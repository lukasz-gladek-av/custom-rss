                <p>A decade is a long period of time, but for Metal Gear Solid fans, it's an eternity. Fortunately, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> launches at the end of the month, bringing a classic from the original series into the modern age of gaming. But beyond that? Expect the future of Metal Gear Solid to be handed over to a new generation of developers.</p><p>Metal Gear veterans Noriaki Okamura and Yuji Korekado recently spoke about how they were preparing to hand over the franchise to a younger team if Konami ever decides to produce a brand-new Metal Gear Solid game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"One of the reasons why we brought in a lot of fresh meat--all the new, younger developers--is because, not only did we want to give them a chance to figure out how to create and develop a Metal Gear game, but also give them a chance to experience the game themselves,” Okamura said to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/metal-gear-solid-producers-training-new-devs-continue-series-1235410797/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a>. "And we’ll still be here for a while, but right now the goal is to build a team that could carry on the legacy on our behalf and could produce, hopefully in the future, more exciting games."</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is designed to be a bridge for that idea, as Okamura and Korekado view it as having the potential to reenergize the franchise and draw in new creators. Korekado explained that the seasoned developers working on the game were able to incorporate feedback from younger members on the team that would help modernize the game, while still retaining the original elements that made this entry in the series so captivating when it was first released in the 2000s.</p><p>The future of Metal Gear Solid is also one that will likely not involve series creator Hideo Kojima, as following his exit from Konami, the industry legend has been busy with multiple projects at his studio, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-review-tied-up/1900-6418377/">Death Stranding and its sequel</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-od-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6533769/">OD</a>, and a spiritual successor to Metal Gear Solid, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-physint-is-still-in-conceptual-stage/1100-6533807/">Phsyint</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-his-new-game-is-now-in-crunch-time-wonders-how-much-longer-he-can-stay-creative/1100-6528760/">Kojima has also spoken</a> about how all the demanding work of creating a video game has begun to take a mental and physical toll on him as he grows older, but he still plans to remain as creative for as long as possible--or at least until he becomes the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-wants-to-be-the-first-person-to-make-a-game-in-space/1100-6532868/">first person to make a game in space</a>. He's also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-refuses-to-play-konamis-metal-gear-solid-3-remake/1100-6533601/" data-ref-id="1100-6533601">not planning to play Metal Gear Solid Delta</a>.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater launches for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on August 28, and we gave it a 9/10 in our review. "Konami's Metal Gear Solid 3 remake is a safe but successful modernization of a beloved classic," Tamoor Hussain wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review-youre-pretty-good/1900-6418396/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater review</a>.</p>

                <p>2017's Hollow Knight just reached a new all-time peak concurrent-player record on Steam, and the achievement came just after developer Team Cherry announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-finally-revealed-after-years-of-waiting/1100-6534159/" data-ref-id="1100-6534159">release date for its sequel, Silksong.</a></p><p>Hollow Knight reached an <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/#max" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">all-time peak concurrent record of 23,819 on Steam today, August 22</a>. Measuring a game's popularity by Steam concurrent numbers is never a perfect or complete encapsulation of a game's popularity, and Hollow Knight being an exclusively single-player game that doesn't rely on people playing at the same time muddies the waters as well. But what is evident here is that Hollow Knight's popularity on Steam is growing in the wake of the big Silksong reveal.</p>

<p>Hollow Knight's previously Steam concurrent record of around 20,000 players was achieved in May 2022. All of this data comes from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/#6y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB.</a></p><p>Steam's own sales data shows that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/US" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hollow Knight jumped into the top 50 overall best-selling games</a> on the platform. The game is also available on console platforms, but sales or engagement data is not available. Hollow Knight is also available on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a> (and Silksong will be as well).</p><p>At least <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/" data-ref-id="1100-6534203">three games have already been delayed due, in part, to Silksong</a>. The game is set for release on September 4, and it's been a long time coming.</p><p>"Hollow Knight: Silksong appears to be exactly what we all should have expected: a strong, well-designed, visually lovely game that carries forward the aesthetic and design philosophies of the original with thoughtful, if not earth-shattering, updates," GameSpot's Steve Watts wrote after going <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/">hands-on with Silksong at Gamescom this week</a>.</p>

                <p>In the menagerie of 1990s animal video game mascots, Bubsy might rank somewhere between Aero the Acrobat and Sparkster from Rocket Knight Adventures (the latter having a small resurgence last year with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/rocket-knight-re-sparked-collection-pre-order-trailer/2300-6464045/" data-ref-id="2300-6464045">rerelease of the Sega Genesis games</a>). Now it's Bubsy's turn to get a new spin for a new decade in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bubsy-returns-in-a-new-3d-platformer-this-is-not-a-joke/1100-6534082/" data-ref-id="1100-6534082">Bubsy 4D</a>, and it actually looks good.</p><p>Over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/fabraz.bsky.social/post/3lwwc5ndsvk2v" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a>, the developer Fabraz showed off more of the game's mechanics, switching Bubsy back and forth from his hairball form, dashing through obstacles, then back to regular form, climbing and clawing his way over walls and other nefarious traps. The cel-shaded colors pop and set it apart from the other games in the franchise.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4bq6P8e5gk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H4bq6P8e5gk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The wise-cracking bobcat is returning to his platforming roots after 2019's auto-runner, Bubsy: Paws on Fire, but this time he's not taking on the Woolies but an army of sheep robots: The BaaBots. Bubsy 4D also includes a customizable wardrobe, including the Bubsy 3D skin.</p><p>So it appears they've cranked up Bubsy's speed a bit, seemingly giving it a more Sonic Frontiers feel. "The team at Fabraz crafted this expressive new moveset to cater to beginners and speedrun enthusiasts alike," the official release says. "Once you've mastered Bubsy’s clawsome new moves, show off your skills by uploading your best level times to the online leaderboards for other players to race against!"</p><p>There's no official release date yet, but you can wishlist it now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3237970/Bubsy_4D/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and it will be available on every major platform.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>What do Hollow Knight Silksong and Grand Theft Auto VI have in common? Enough popularity to make other studios delay their games to get out of the way, and hopefully not be drowned out by the hype of either. Yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-gamescom/">Team Cherry finally announced a release date</a> for Silksong, which will launch on September 4, 2025. Today, developers Aeternum Game Studios and Panik Arcade delayed their games to get the hell out of its way.</p>



<p>Both studios cite Hollow Knight Silksong's release date as a reason for their delay, though in fairness the situations for Aeternum and Panik are not exactly one-to-one. In the case of Panik Arcade and its slot machine roguelike <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/">CloverPit</a>, that takes inspiration from Balatro and Buckshot Roulette, is only being delayed by a few weeks, from its initial September 3 release date to September 26.</p>



<p>The studio announced the delay with a <a href="https://x.com/PanikArcade/status/1958882570210304059">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, and added in a press release, "<em>We like a gamble, but this one is too risky lol</em>. <em>We want to give ourselves and our fans some time to enjoy Silksong, so we’re launching a few weeks later and will use the time to polish CloverPit even further</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨GAME DELAY 🚨</p><p>due to Silksong (can’t wait to play) launching just a day after CloverPit, we decided to delay our release</p><p>our new release date is 26th Sept</p><p>we poured our hearts into our little game, so we want to give it the best possible shot. thanks for understanding!! <a href="https://t.co/QwKwBrBuFJ">pic.twitter.com/QwKwBrBuFJ</a></p></div>— Panik Arcade 🕹️ making CloverPit 🍒🎰 (@PanikArcade) <a href="https://twitter.com/PanikArcade/status/1958882570210304059?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>At least in CloverPit's case, Panik Arcade is just trying to ensure that it can grab some attention when it launches, especially since it's a very different game compared to Silksong, and isn't trying to stand its ground as a 2D Metroidvania.</p>



<p>Which is the problem that Aeternum Game Studios is dealing with. Its upcoming game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2710920/Aeterna_Lucis/">Aeterna Lucis</a>, is a sequel to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1517970/Aeterna_Noctis/">2021's Aeterna Noctis</a> and a 2D Metroidvania.</p>



<p>"<em>Our initial plan was to launch it this September,</em>" Aeternum Game Studios writes in a <a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579">statement on X (formerly Twitter)</a>. "<em>But after the announcement of Silksong, we are fully aware that our game wouldn't have the visibility it deserves. Competing with a phenomenon of that scale would not only be unfair to our team's effort, but also to you, the community, who expect to experience this adventure under the best possible conditions.</em>"</p>



<p>Now, Aeterna Lucis won't arrive until sometime in 2026. Though Aeternum Game Studios isn't just pinning the blame on Hollow Knight Silksong. It needs more than just a few weeks of delay time because it doesn't have "<em>all the necessary development kits to ensure a simultaneous release on all next-generation platforms</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>To be transparent, we believe the best decision for everyone is to step back and bring you Aeterna Lucis at the right time. That's why we've made the difficult but necessary choice to delay the release to 2026.</em>"</p>



<p>The studio doesn't specify which of the next-generation platforms it is struggling to obtain development kits for, but the obvious guess is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/while-the-biggest-studios-have-gotten-priority-many-are-still-trying-to-get-a-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kit/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, as we've seen several reports about smaller studios having issues getting dev kits from Nintendo, with only the larger studios and publishers getting priority.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Aeternum Game Studios goes on to thank Team Cherry, crediting the studio and Hollow Knight as a key reason for 2D Metroidvania games being as popular as they are in the modern gaming landscape. The studio also acknowledges Team Cherry's work as a key inspiration for Aeterna Noctis and Aeterna Lucis.</p>



<p>At least in the case of Grand Theft Auto VI's release date, studios have more time to plan to get out of Rockstar and Take-Two's path, since you can bet that GTA VI will hog <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-7-billion-revenue-60-days/">every bit of the videogame industry's attention</a> when it arrives in May 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.2 will be arriving in early September, bringing with it new Agents for your squad, a new story chunk to uncover, and more.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-21-release-date" rel="nofollow">July's Version 2.1 update</a>, Version 2.2 of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>&nbsp;is launching on September 4th (which, given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">recent developments</a>, is a pretty daring release date to commit to on HoYoverse's part, it must be said).</p>

<p>Story-wise, you'll be dealing with the fallout of the Exaltists' conspiracy and getting to know the Obol Squad, a new elite unit alongside whom you'll be working in order to "uncover long-buried truths", as well as to reveal the hidden stories behind one of its members.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.2-seed-orphie.jpg?itok=roa5RDDh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.2-seed-orphie.jpg?itok=xlZ7I-ZC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two new Agents are joining the fray in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.2.</figcaption></figure><p>That agent is Seed, and you'll be getting the chance to add her to your team in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.2. She's a genius mechanic and Electric Attack Agent who can enhance sustained damage across her whole team.</p>

<p>Joining Seed is the twofer unit Orphie &amp; Magus, a Fire Attack Agent who can boost team Attack and cause Aftershocks to ignore part of your enemy's Defense stat. They're joined by S-rank Bangboo Mercury, who can serve as a tank for their team.</p>

<p>Alongside Seed and Orphie &amp; Magus, you'll also get another chance to pick up Evelyn and Trigger throughout the course of Version 2.2's cycle, and Soldier 0 - Anby, who's "currently undergoing intensive training", will be returning "in future versions" as well.</p>

<p>Of course, Version 2.2 will also bring with it plenty of new events and gameplay improvements, so once you've played through the main part of the new update's story, there should still be plenty for you to do.</p>




<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">available to check out right now for free</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices. Version 2.2, "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night", launches on September 4th.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> began life as a DLC expansion, but then developers Team Cherry decided the concept was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-developers-announce-a-full-sequel-silksong">"too large and too unique</a>", and upgraded it into a full game. They spent six years working on the thing in almost total silence, while fulminating legions of the terminally online quietly drove themselves bonkers hunting for release date clues. We now have a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-gets-a-release-date-and-youve-only-got-to-wait-a-little-bit-skonger">Silksong release date</a> - it's just two weeks away - so in theory, the nightmare is over. Except, oh dear - Team Cherry are planning post-launch content for Silksong, and they're already calling it "ambitious". 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
All that's from this week's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make">breakout interview</a> with Press X To Jason Schreier, the person who considerately does all the investigative reporting in games journalism so that humbler souls like myself can spend our days taking the piss out of him. According to Schreier, "they're already making big plans to add extra content to Silksong in the months and years to come." Then there are some snippets from Team Cherry's founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen.
</p>
<p>
"Launching it is obviously quite exciting," Pellen said. "What comes after for us is equally as exciting."
</p>
<p>
"The most interesting thing now is what can we add to it next," interjected Gibson. "We got a plan. Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well, but hopefully we can achieve some of it."
</p><p>
Those monsters! I look forward to revisiting this post in 2030, assuming RPS hasn't been turned into sausages by then, while writing up the latest rumours about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>: Polyestertune or Satinmelody or whatever they end up calling the third one.
</p>
<p>
Still, perhaps this is better interpreted as show of kindness. Earlier in the interview, Gibson and Pellen fret that by actually releasing Silksong, they're spoiling things for players for whom the real Silksong is speculating endlessly about the release of Silksong.</p>
<p>"It's nice that people are passionate about the game, and that they've obviously formed their own strange or very exciting communities around it," said Gibson, diplomatically. Added Pellen: "Feels like we're going to ruin their fun by releasing the game." I guess this DLC tease is a bid to keep the dream alive, then.

              <p>And…there we go! It’s officially Friday, folks. I’m filling in for Ethan, who <em>should</em> have written today’s edition, so if you prefer his take on Morning Checkpoint, well, sorry, you have to deal with me. This morning, we learn about Double Fine’s future, get ready to watch a weird <em>Fortnite</em> stream, check out what’s up with <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s campaign, and catalog the first game to run away from <em>Silksong</em>‘s September launch. Oh and here’s a trailer for a movie that looks like <a href="https://youtu.be/9oJEUcpPeBw"><em>Jaws</em>, but set during the Second World War. Enjoy</a>?</p> <h2>Aeterna Lucis is delaying its launch to avoid <em>Silksong</em></h2> <p>Yesterday, after many years of waiting, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-september-release-date-trailer-2000619152">we finally got a release date for <em>Silksong.</em></a> It’s arriving next month, and one game is already throwing in the towel and delaying its launch to avoid the indie superstar sequel. On Friday, the devs behind <em>Aeterna Lucis</em> announced that the game was being pushed back from a planned September launch to sometime in 2026, partly because of <em>Silksong</em> and partly because they lack all the dev kits needed for a release on “next-gen” platforms.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/CUomiRcsZU">pic.twitter.com/CUomiRcsZU</a></p> <p>— Aeternum Game Studios (@aeternathegame) <a href="https://twitter.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Our initial plan was to launch<em> [Aeterna Lucis]</em> this September,” said the devs in a statement. “But after the announcement of <em>Silksong</em>, we are fully aware that our game wouldn’t have the visibility it deserves. Competing with a phenomenon of that scale would not only be unfair to our team’s effort, but also to you, the community, who expect to experience this adventure under the best possible conditions.”</p>

 <h2>Double Fine isn’t working on <em>Brutal Legend 2</em> or any other sequels</h2> <p><em>Keeper</em>, Double Fine’s next game, looks great! It comes after a big gap following the company’s last game, <em>Psychonauts 2</em>. If you’re worried that, after&nbsp;<em>Keeper</em>‘s release, you’ll be waiting a while again for more Double Fine goodness, take heart: the studio’s founder and boss, Tim Schafer, says that Double Fine is working on multiple projects at the moment. But, if you were hoping for a <em>Brutal Legend 2</em> or <em>Psychonauts 3</em>, well, I’m sorry to say that ain’t happening anytime soon.</p> <p>“I’m working on other stuff,” <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/double-fines-tim-schafer-rules-out-more-sequels-for-now-so-you-can-forget-about-brtal-legend-2-and-psychonauts-3">Schafer told <em>IGN</em></a>. “The studio is doing multiple projects right now and they’re all original IPs, because we did <em>Psychonauts 2</em> and that will hold us for sequels for a while.”</p> <h2>The alleged mother of one of Elon Musk’s kids will be on a <em>Fortnite</em> stream</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">💥 Fortnite Friday is BACK 💥</p> <p>🚨 Alleged Mother of Elon Musk's Child… Ashley St. Clair (<a href="https://twitter.com/stclairashley?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@stclairashley</a>) gives her FIRST live interview since news broke… straight from the Battle Bus 🚨</p> <p>🇺🇸 5PM PST / 8PM EST 🇺🇸 <a href="https://t.co/WFBXsFMblL">pic.twitter.com/WFBXsFMblL</a></p> <p>— connor (@ConnorEatsPants) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1958612410774040833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>I don’t have much to add to this other than that we live in a very strange world.</p> <h2><em>Call of Duty Black Ops 7</em> is ditching campaign difficulty levels</h2> <p>The latest <em>Call of Duty</em> is making some big changes to the series’ handling of campaigns. <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s will support co-op, and there will be a rogue-like endgame included with it. Another big change? <em>Black Ops 7</em> won’t feature the franchise’s usual difficulty levels, like Veteran or Hardened. Instead, as developers, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-does-not-have-difficulty-options-treyarch-explains-why">Treyarch explained to <em>IGN</em>,</a> the studio is using co-op to balance the game. The more players you include in the action, the harder things get. It’s an interesting change, though I wonder how more casual players hopping in to play with a friend might handle getting their ass kicked over and over again and having no way to make things easier.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-pete-parsons-halo-destiny-2-sony-2000619244">After 23 years, Bungie boss Pete Parsons is leaving</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-ftl-2000619136">This new<em> Star Trek Voyager</em> game seems cool</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/critical-role-campaign-4-cast-brennan-lee-mulligan-date-2000619230">Critical Role’s big shake-up, explained</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="How Star Wars Control Panels Were Made for Filming!" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UykDcJEojc4?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

                <p dir="ltr">NBA 2K26 is just a week out from launch for those who preorder or purchase the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nba-2k26-preorders-editions-bonuses-and-early-access/1100-6533141/">early-launch editions</a>. When it gets here, players should expect to find that what was once the community's biggest complaint has been scrubbed out of the game, according to its gameplay lead. Earlier this week, gameplay director Mike Wang told me in a chat from NBA 2K Community Day in San Francisco that 2K26 was designed from "day one" to eliminate what players most often found had plagued the game: "RNG"--short for random number generation--or what often felt like randomized outcomes.</p><p dir="ltr">The community, Wang told me, "felt like they didn't have control over the outcomes of the shot or whatever it was on the court. That's the biggest thing we addressed. Like, from day one, one of the points of emphasis was to make sure that [for] everything in the game, there's a skill aspect to it, or it's completely driven by skill, so that the gamer had the ability to dictate whether they did something right or wrong.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4554172-screenshot2025-08-21114314.png" data-ref-id="1300-4554172" data-ratio="0.55962343096234" data-width="956" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4554172-screenshot2025-08-21114314.png" data-ref-id="1300-4554172"></a><figcaption>SGA follows his nearly perfect season by being on the cover of NBA 2K26.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4554172-screenshot2025-08-21114314.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"That's probably most felt in shooting. Shooting is such a touchy subject. We're doing green-or-miss [mechanics] again," he explained, describing the way a perfectly timed shot will <em>always</em> go in, while a shot that misses the on-screen green timing window never will. This mechanic frustrated some players in 2K24, leading to the team creating different difficulty, or "shot timing" profiles for players to choose at will in last year's game, but this created its own set of issues by pitting players with different profiles against one another.</p><p dir="ltr">"So, the scary thing about that, obviously, is that people who are really, really good at timing a button can be unstoppable like Steph Curry. So we're trying to balance that with a stronger contest system, and it's in a good spot now [...] There are people who mastered <em>this </em>frame of <em>this </em>jump shot" but savvy defenders can now better "hold them in check if you play your defense and just play basketball."</p><p dir="ltr">He added that the team learned a lot from past mistakes and explained how this year's game aims to conclude a three-year debate over shooting gameplay by applying last year's shot-timing profiles to specific modes and difficulties, evening the playing field on the basis of mode and difficulty level. "And [the idea in 2K25 was], 'Okay, if you're not into the timing [element], you can set this profile to be this lower-skilled one.' So we've taken that concept, and basically, that's what Rookie and Semi-Pro and Pro [difficulties and their related modes] feel like. It's like, you could be a little sloppy with your timing, but still play the game and have fun. Then, when you move up in the difficulty to the higher ones, those feel more like, 'Okay, if I don't really master my shots or learn my players, then I'm gonna miss shots.'"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4554171-screenshot2025-08-21114330.png" data-ref-id="1300-4554171" data-ratio="0.55775234131113" data-width="961" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4554171-screenshot2025-08-21114330.png" data-ref-id="1300-4554171"></a><figcaption>In addition to the game's WNBA mode, women will now be playable in MyTeam, too.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4554171-screenshot2025-08-21114330.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The debate over NBA 2K shot mechanics and green timing windows has raged for years now, and from the outside looking in, the process seems dizzying. I asked Wang what it's like trying to appease every corner of the game's massive audience, with differing and sometimes mutually exclusive ideas on how shooting ought to behave.</p><p dir="ltr">With a (perhaps only half-joking) fatigued exhale, he told me, "It's really hard." Like in recent years, the debate over shooting mechanics will come down to the data. Those are really only visible once millions of people are playing it at once and the series' analytics-obsessed community starts to pick it apart. That process begins next week, when NBA 2K26 launches for early-edition players on August 29.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hollow Knight: Silksong - Official Release Date Reveal Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"Silksong is the most anticipated and wishlisted game on all of Steam and we think people will love this game and play it right at launch (including us) but that also means it will overshadow all games launching close to it. So if we stick to our original date we would risk the launch of CloverPit a fair bit," the developers said.</p><p>The team said it wants to give CloverPit the best chance at succeeding, so it decided to delay the release by a few weeks. The studio will spend the extra time working to "polish the game even further."</p><p>Another release pushed back due to Silksong is the 1.0 launch for Faeland, an adventure RPG inspired by 8-bit games of yesteryear. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1280080/view/496078660487348547?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">developers said</a>, "We've made the tough call to postpone" the 1.0 release of Faeland, which is currently available in Steam Early Access. The 1.0 launch was previously set for September 9.</p><p>"This wasn't an easy decision. We poured years of work and love into Faeland, and we want to make sure it arrives at a time when it can receive the attention and care it deserves," the studio said. A new release date will be announced "very soon."</p><p>Aeternum Game Studios, meanwhile, announced that Aeterna Lucis--previously set to launch in September--is now delayed to 2026. "After the announcement of Silksong, we are fully aware that our game wouldn't have the visibility it deserves," the developer <a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>. "Competing with a phenomenon of that scale would not only be unfair to our team's effort, but also to you, the community, who expect to experience this adventure under the best possible conditions."</p><p>It wasn't just Silksong's release date prompting the delay, however, as the studio said, "We still don't have all the necessary development kits to ensure a simultaneous release on all next-generation platforms."</p><p>Aeterna Lucis is finished, the studio said, and the extra development time will be used for more polish and refinement. </p><p>"We also wanted to take this opportunity to thank Team Cherry. There's no need to wish them luck--we know Silksong will be a success and a masterpiece," the developer said. "Instead of rivalry, what we feel is gratitude: thanks to them, the metroidvania genre is more alive than ever and, in fact, they were one of the main inspirations that led us to create Aeterna Noctis and the entire saga now in development." </p><p>A sequel to 2017's Hollow Knight, Silksong was originally designed to be an expansion to Hollow Knight before developer Team Cherry repositioned it as a full standalone game. The wait for any real news about Silksong led some to believe it might have been in development hell, but the developers said this was not true and that the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">enormous success of Hollow Knight afforded them the opportunity to take their time with Silksong. </a></p><p>Silksong is playable at Gamescom this week, and there are long lines snaking through the convention center for a chance to play the highly anticipated game.</p><p>"Hollow Knight: Silksong appears to be exactly what we all should have expected: a strong, well-designed, visually lovely game that carries forward the aesthetic and design philosophies of the original with thoughtful, if not earth-shattering, updates," Steve Watts wrote after going <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/">hands-on with Silksong at Gamescom this week</a>.</p><p>When GTA 6 was still scheduled for 2025, many believed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-could-prompt-major-studios-to-delay-games-report/1100-6530346/" data-ref-id="1100-6530346">other developers might shift release dates to avoid it</a>. With GTA 6 being delayed to 2026, it looks like Silksong is taking its place as a 2025 game that's prompting others to move around it.</p>

New booster packs are being released regularly for the mobile game, ensuring a steady stream of content. 
</p>
<p>
The Pokémon Company recently made a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-finally-receives-much-needed-trading-overhaul">much-needed overhaul to trading in the game</a>, removing the need for an extra currency.
</p>
<p>
Let's hope this new booster pack doesn't accidentally include any fan art - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-developer-apologises-deeply-after-players-discover-key-artwork-for-its-new-set-was-based-on-fan-drawing">company was forced to apologise</a> when "incorrect reference materials" were used for cards in the previous booster pack.

<p>The rollercoaster ride of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> releases is continuing at breakneck pace, as TPC has revealed that the next Themed Booster Expansion will arrive next week on <strong>28th August</strong>.</p>
<p>The 'Secluded Springs' expansion is another Gen II-focused set, with legendaries Raikou, Entei, and Suicune taking centre stage. A bunch of other Johto and Hoenn 'mon will be tagging along for the ride, and the new teaser trailer showcases some sweet full-arts for the likes of Milotic and our beloved Phanpy.</p>
<p>Here's a closer look at a handful of the cards shown in the trailer:</p>


<p>It feels like just yesterday that we first set eyes on the Ho-Oh and Lugia Wisdom of Sea and Sky set, and our Pack Hourglasses are still flagging because of it. As a reminder, the last set came bundled with a sizeable slice of drama after TPC was hit with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pokemon-tcg-pocket-updates-card-art-following-plagiarism-allegations">plagiarism accusations</a> following the release of the two central legendary full-art cards. TPC quickly released a statement in which it "deeply apologize[d]" for the error, pulled the card art in question, and replaced it a week later.</p>
<p>In other TCG Pocket news, TPC closed out this year's World Championships with a tease that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pokemon-tcg-pockets-next-expansion-introduces-a-mega-mix-up">Mega Evolutions</a> will be coming to the app at some point "this fall".</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-peer-to-peer-support-confirmed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-peer-to-peer-support-confirmed-after-sequel-returns-to-beta.1278234/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher 1047 Games has announced that peer-to-peer support is coming to&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>, allowing you to continue playing the game online even after the central servers are shut down.</p>

<p>Back in July, 1047 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-beta-layoffs" rel="nofollow">announced</a> that in order to focus on rebuilding&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>(which is returning to beta following negative feedback for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-1-0-release-date" rel="nofollow">initial release</a>), servers for the original&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>will be closed down, but at the time, the devs said they would consider either offline play or peer-to-peer support.</p>

<p>Now, in a news post on the official&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>website, 1047 confirms that the direction it's chosen to go down is peer-to-peer play, which means you'll still be able to play with others online, although you'll do so via direct connection and not through a central server.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splitgate-peer-to-peer-servers-shooting.jpg?itok=HlgMDqex 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splitgate-peer-to-peer-servers-shooting.jpg?itok=gOsRvXZq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you love the original&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>, fear not; it'll still be playable after next week.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as introducing peer-to-peer play, 1047 says it's made "previously unreleased, stockpiled, or work-in-progress" content for&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>playable, including 14 new maps for you to gallivant around.</p>

<p>In essence, peer-to-peer play means that certain players will act as hosts, so the stability of the game will depend on how strong their connection is. You'll be able to view in-progress&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>games from the server browser.</p>

<p>You'll also be granted all in-game cosmetics to enjoy, and all of your previous progression will remain intact as well, so everything you've unlocked over the course of your time with&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>will still be accessible.</p>

<p>PC and console play will still be supported, as will cross-play, so you'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>alongside players on other platforms. Anticheat, however, will not be enabled, so there's a chance you may come across more nefarious behavior than before.</p>




<p>You can read the full FAQ for how peer-to-peer play will work in&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>via the <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news/splitgate-1-lives-on-through-peer-to-peer-support" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post</a>, and you can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/677620/Splitgate/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/splitgate/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/splitgate/9P4S1BPJLPHZ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

            <p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> beta is officially a Thing That Happened, and now comes the terrible ordeal of Learning From The Experience. Here is what developers DICE, Criterion, Motive and Ripple Effect have learned from the experience: you are all playing the game far too much like Call Of Duty. Goodness me, it's like 2007 never ended.</p>
<p>Doing headshots in midair? That's an updatin'. Doing a parkour while carrying a light machinegun? That's an updatin'. Bunny-hopping with prejudice? You'd best believe that's an updatin'. Never mind that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-full-multiplayer-reveal-sees-ea-trying-to-rebottle-the-lightning-of-battlefield-3-and-4">those multiplayer reveal montages</a> emphasised footloose quickdraw almost as much as they incited a murderous contempt for helicopters. It's time to play Battlefield the way Battlefield should be played: lying in a hole praying that one of your team-mates spawns on you before a tank rolls over your head.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
This, at least, is my addled Friday afternoon summary of EA's just-announced post-beta plans, via <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1958544678409642329">Mecha-Hitler.com</a>. Let's squeeze into our thinking caps and break it all down.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, the developers are doing a "general pass on recoil and tap-fire characteristics across all weapons", to make them feel more unique, especially in terms of range. They're also making changes to encourage more controlled tap and burst-firing. In particular, the M87A1 shotgun has been defanged, and they're "investigating the Time-to-Kill and Time-to-Death experiences", with news of changes to follow.
</p><p>
As for movement, they want it to feel more "balanced and traditional" in the final version of Battlefield 6. There will be less carry-over of momentum and particularly horizontal speed from a slide to a jump. Jump height will also be lowered during consecutive jumps, and you'll be less accurate while jumping or sliding.</p>
<p>"These changes are designed to make sliding and jumping more situational, so they are no longer ideal options for engaging in gunfights, and will contribute to a gameplay pace that rewards skillful movement without becoming too fast or unpredictable," the devs comment. You won't get as much acceleration when opening a parachute, either, "for more controlled aerial movement". I hate being in control of my aerial movement. In practice, it just makes it easier for people on the ground to shoot me.
</p>
<p>
The game's smaller maps are being tweaked to stop naughty people getting onto rooftops and venturing out of bounds. "This gameplay is not intended for these maps, and the upcoming ladder for the Assault class is also not designed to access these areas," the devs sternly explain. Bad ladder! Down!</p>
<p>They'll be testing two more maps in Battlefield Labs before release, a remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-3">Battlefield 3</a>'s Operation Firestorm and another map set in Mirak Valley, both of which offer "the full complement of vehicles" and "a more vast combat space". Vaster, EA, vaster! How am I supposed to trust you to fine-tune parachute physics when you can't even optimise your sentences. Yes, I realise I have just held up a red cape to all the amateur copyeditors in the comments.
</p><p>
Modes? Well, they've found that Rush gets a bit smeary when there are too many players involved. Apparently, "when a player tries to arm the M-COM while more than 20 opponents are defending, the intended gameplay becomes less tangible", presumably because the attacking player's head and torso also become less tangible. As such, they're lowering the player count for Rush "to improve the flow of combat and restore the tactical, methodical experience that defines the mode". 
</p>
<p>
Anticipating pushback on this front, the post points out that people can mess with the count as they please when playing Rush via the Portal editor. Breakthrough, meanwhile, will receive "map-by-map balance adjustments towards our goal of 50/50 win ratio for both Attackers and Defenders".
</p>
<p>
In general, EA are taking an ad hoc approach to player counts based on the individual map and mode. "For example, at launch, some Breakthrough layouts will support 48 players, while others will have 64," the post comments. "It's the one of many factors we adjust to create the right balance and feel for each scenario. In Breakthrough higher player counts work well on open, dynamic maps, while smaller player-groups offer a more focused experience on denser maps." They've found that "8v8 provides a solid starting point for small-scale, fast-paced modes like Team Death Match, Squad Death Match, Domination, and [King of the Hill]". Again, you can jimmy the workings in Portal if you wish.
</p>
<p>
Some final bits: open and closed weapon playlists will continue to be available in Battlefield 6, "and we are looking for ways to keep them easily accessible". I'm not sure why that would be difficult? They're also trying to fix matchmaking so that you won't have too much difficulty finding games in which to complete the Challenge of capturing sectors in Breakthrough or Rush.
</p><p>
Expect some of these improvements to materialise in forthcoming Battlefield Labs playtests. The game launches on 10th October. Our hardware editor James attended a preview event recently and came away with the verdict that it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-deafening-hours-of-its-multiplayer-battlefield-6-sure-looks-like-a-battlefield-game">"looks like a Battlefield game"</a>, thereby demonstrating the granular insight that got him promoted to CPU Wrangler First Class.</p>
<p>Even more granularistically, James noted that "there are also reasons to be optimistic that this is a series getting itself back on track, from its renewed emphasis on breaking shit to the replacement of show-off specialists with that old unspoken rule of 'Stick with your squad or perish.'" Did you play the beta? How did you find it?

              <p><span>After almost 30 years of monster catching and battling, there are dozens of unsolved mysteries in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-balls-monster-catchin-musical-professor-oak-2000617768"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a> <span>universe. One that has literally haunted fans for over a decade now is the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nobody-knows-what-the-deal-is-with-the-ghost-girl-in-po-1458254184"><span>“Ghost Girl”</span></a><span> who appears in the 3DS games </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. This mysterious Hex Maniac character shows up in Lumiose City, says some ominous stuff to the player, and slides off-screen without an actual walking animation. This odd occurrence has never been explained, and when </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/almost-a-year-later-pokemon-x-ys-ghost-girl-is-still-1646738916"><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>asked</span></a> <i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y </span></i><span>producer Junichi Masuda about it back in 2014, he was playfully evasive.

It’s not just Pokémon hiding out here, however.

So, if Game Freak wanted to finally provide some answers to fans’ long-running questions, this would be the game to do it.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000619525" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619525"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619525">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>All that said, this could just be nothing more than an easter egg for fans to spot in the trailer, and it could go nowhere.

Well, we’ll find out for sure when </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>comes to the Switch consoles on October 16.</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hell-let-loose-vietnam-hands-on-preview-jungle-warfare-has-never-been-this-immersive-in-a-video-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hell-let-loose-vietnam-hands-on-preview-jungle-warfare-has-never-been-this-immersive-in-a-video-game.1278225/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has had one of the first chances to get hands-on with the second installment in the Hell Let Loose series, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose has always been one of my go-to World War 2 games since it released in early access in 2019 following its successful Kickstarter campaign (which I backed!). Its huge scale, impressive visuals, and its high-stakes one-shot kill gameplay have made the game one of the most immersive World War 2 multiplayer games that I don’t think anyone has been able to match.</p>



<p>So when the publisher behind Hell Let Loose, Team 17, announced that there was going to be a new installment in the series, but this time set in Vietnam, I had to jump on the chance to get some hands-on.</p>



<h2 id="h-familiar-but-entirely-different">Familiar, But Entirely Different</h2>



<p>To start the match, I made my way to the action as a gunner in a helicopter, ready to rain down bullets on any Vietnamese fighters we came across. After a short one-minute flight over the rivers and the jungle, we landed at our objective on a swampy riverbank.</p>



<p>Almost instantly, enemy mortar fire started to rain down on our location as we made our way to our objective, which was a Vietnamese village already crawling with enemy soldiers. Bamboo bridges provided fast but risky navigation from building to building, and we were under attack from green tracer rounds, suppressing our position from the jungle tree line.</p>



<p>After a couple of minutes of taking down a few enemies, we secured the objective and made our way to the next one, which meant crossing a large river. For those familiar with Hell Let Loose, you know that this would often provide a challenge of trying to find an uncontested bridge or a canal boat pile-up to get across, but in Hell Let Loose Vietnam, we were able to swim across. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, our squad’s time was short-lived as we were all killed, but the moment made for one of those classic Hell Let Loose cinematic moments that never get old, as the treeline facing us was suppressed by an artillery strike. Sadly, it didn’t hit the enemy that lit up our squad with an AK-47, but hey, what can you do?</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-massive-improvements-across-the-board">Massive Improvements Across The Board</h2>



<p>For those who adore Hell Let Loose, this game feels really familiar, with plenty of improvements across the board that I hope will bleed over into the original game. But importantly, the game feels refreshing in the grand scheme of things. The developers have managed to maintain that immersive feeling that Hell Let Loose is known for, all while making sure the game feels different enough that it warrants an entirely new title.</p>



<p>One of the biggest concerns I had when I heard about the series heading into Vietnam was the lack of enemy visibility, which sometimes is a problem in the first game. However, the improved lighting overhaul, coupled with the game’s upgrade from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5, has seemingly made a massive difference to the game’s overall colour palette. While you’re certainly going to be shot from weird places from time to time, those concerns are now firmly squashed. The audio has also made a tremendous difference in the game, enabling players to rely on both their ears and eyes to pinpoint enemy locations.</p>



<p>Another concern was around the game’s performance, too. Hell Let Loose has been notorious for not having the best performance on some of its maps; however, on the map that we played, I’m pleased to say that I had zero performance issues. Granted, the PC that I was playing on probably had top-of-the-line specs, but I was also keeping an eye on a developer’s screen during the playtest, who was playing on a laptop, where the FPS counter didn’t drop below 100. So, at face value from the test, it appears a lot of effort has been put into making sure the game is as stable as possible.</p>



<p>Overall, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is going to be an unforgettable entry into the Hell Let Loose franchise, giving players a fresh and immersive gaming experience that is often overlooked in the first-person shooter scene.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam currently has a vague release date of 2026 for the PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

According to development chief Tim Schafer, he’s working on multiple projects at the Microsoft-owned studio, none of which are sequels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeper is an atmospheric puzzle adventure in which a long-forgotten lighthouse is awakened and goes on a journey. It’s led by Double Fine’s Lee Petty, which means Tim Schafer is hands-off and free to work on other things.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What are those other things? Speaking to IGN at gamescom 2025, Schafer of course wouldn’t divulge Double Fine’s upcoming games, but did say the studio has multiple projects in the works and they’re all original IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm working on other stuff,” he confirmed. “The studio is doing multiple projects right now and they're all original IPs, because we did Psychonauts 2 and that will hold us for sequels for a while."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, that rules out Psychonauts 3 or — and this was always an unlikely one — Brütal Legend 2, at least in the short to mid-term. As game developers are fond of saying, never say never, but Schafer’s rather definitive comment gives us an idea of what to expect from Double Fine in the coming years — and that is the unexpected.</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Psychonauts 2 was Double Fine’s first release following Microsoft’s acquisition of the company in 2019. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/psychonauts-2-double-fine-xbox-game-studios-acqusition">Schafer has spoken before about how Double Fine had to cut boss fights from the game due to budget concerns</a>, but the Microsoft buyout meant it had the resources to add them back in. Schafer described Keeper as smaller-scale compared to Psychonauts 2, but with an impressive level of quality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Psychonauts 2 eventually came out in 2021.

A title that means the world to us and represents the greatest effort of the entire Aeternum Game Studios team.</p><p>Our initial plan was to launch it this September, but after the announcement of [<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>], we are fully aware that our game wouldn’t have the visibility it deserves. Competing with a phenomenon of that scale would not only be unfair to our team’s effort, but also to you, the community, who expect to experience this adventure under the best possible conditions.</p><p>In addition, we still don’t have all the necessary development kits to ensure a simultaneous release on all next-generation platforms. To be transparent, we believe the best decision for everyone is to step back and bring you <em>Aeterna Lucis</em> at the right time.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>That’s why we’ve made the difficult but necessary choice to delay the release to 2026.</p><p>The game is already finished, and we will use this additional time to keep polishing it, refining every detail, and making sure it delivers the perfect experience our community deserves. We know this change disrupts many of our strategies, but we are confident that with your support we can overcome this major challenge.</p><p>We also want to take this opportunity to thank <a title="Companies > Team Cherry [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/team-cherry">Team Cherry</a>. There’s no need to wish them luck-we know <em>Silksong</em> will be a success and a masterpiece. Instead of rivalry, what we feel is gratitude: thanks to them, the <a title="Genres > Metroidvania [229 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> genre is more alive than ever and, in fact, they were one of the main inspirations that led us to create <em>Aeterna Noctis</em> and the entire saga now in development.</p><p>Thank you for walking this journey with us. 2026 will be a special year, and we can’t wait to live it alongside all of you.</p><p>With all our love,<br>The Aeternum Game Studios Team</p></blockquote><p><em>Aeterna Lucis</em> will be available for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,226 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,789 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,286 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [14,152 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,574 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,070 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2710920/Aeterna_Lucis/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, and now presumably, Switch 2.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/aeterna-lucis-delayed-to-2026]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Keeper - Official Announce Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>Development on Keeper is being led by Double Fine's Lee Petty, and this allowed Schafer to focus his efforts on these new projects. That doesn't mean that we'll <em>never </em>see a Psychonauts threequel--after all, the game between the first and second games was 16 years--or another Brutal Legend game, but for now, the developer is interested in creating brand-new games instead. Back in June, Schafer also commented on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/psychonauts-3-isnt-in-development-right-now-double-fine-confirms/1100-6515614/">how he was developing new games instead of Psychonauts 3</a>.</p><p>While Brutal Legend 2 looks unlikely for now, the game did experience a surge in activity recently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/double-fine-paid-tribute-to-ozzy-osbourne-by-giving-away-brutal-legend-for-666-minutes/1100-6533408/">as Double Fine gave the game away for a devilish 666 minutes</a> to honor the passing of the Guardian of Metal, Black Sabbath's Ozzy Osbourne.</p><p>Double Fine's Keeper will launch on October 17 for PC and Xbox Series X|S, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/keeper-official-announce-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025/2300-6466106/">and in case you missed the reveal trailer</a>, the game revolves around a a long-forgotten lighthouse and a plucky seabird embarking on a grand adventure.</p>

Below, we revisit the user-generated-content features of the game that were ahead of their time.</em></p><p>The rain drenched my infantryman's helmet as he marched forward. He could barely make out the jagged silhouettes of the grey buildings 100 feet ahead, but it would only be a moment until he reached them. Or so he thought--until the ambush fell. Tanks, recon trucks, and bazooka-wielding foot soldiers poured out of the fog and into my trenches, cutting through my defenses before I could even get my bearings.</p><p>For me, Advance Wars: Dual Strike was a grid-based chess match where every piece could explode, but the single-player campaign felt like squaring off against a row of toddlers still figuring out how pawns worked. The missions were charming, but I wanted something sharper. Dual Strike's other modes, especially Versus, were where the real battlefields waited, ready for me to customize my way into intense engagements--including horrific defeats like the one I just described. This mode was both a canvas for my tactical creativity and an early sign of where the game industry would go in the future.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553937-wiiuvc_advancewarsdualstrike_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553937" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553937-wiiuvc_advancewarsdualstrike_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553937"></a><figcaption>Advance Wars: Dual Strike</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553937-wiiuvc_advancewarsdualstrike_06.jpg"></figure><p>I was barely 12 years old when I first shoved the Dual Strike cartridge into my Nintendo DS. Even then, I knew I wanted strategy, not just spectacle. I'd already poured dozens of hours into Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones, carefully ensuring every character survived the campaign. I liked the pressure, the mental math of predicting enemy movements three turns ahead. I was also more than familiar with the bright battlefields and deceptively complicated tactics of earlier Advance Wars games.</p><p>But those early missions across Omega Land? They didn't exactly test my mettle. Even at higher difficulty settings, I could route the Black Hole Army without much of a plan. The introduction of CO skills--special powers like giving units a second turn or buffing their attacks--was fun at first, but it felt like cheating. Omega Land would always be safe as long as Max and I stood watch. I craved scenarios where I wasn't the unstoppable force.</p><p>That's when I spent time with Dual Strike's other modes, including the War Room and, most importantly, Versus mode. Versus was my laboratory. Here, I could disable Max's abilities, strip away my enemy's usual restraints, and see what I was really made of. I'd set the weather to a downpour, throw in dense fog so I couldn't see beyond a few tiles, and pit myself against my most respected rival--Hawke--on a map that demanded mastery of all three battlefronts: air, land, and sea.</p><p>Once the match began, there was no hand-holding. It was pure tactics. Every turn was a test: What units should I build? Where should I send them? Which front should I reinforce, and which should I risk leaving vulnerable? Sometimes the game settled into a tense stalemate, each of us probing for weaknesses while building up our forces. Other times, it became a frantic race to outmaneuver the other before the tide of battle turned. And yes--more times than I'd like to admit, my entire army was steamrolled into the dirt.</p><p>It wasn't unlike Garry Kasparov's famous chess matches against IBM's Deep Blue in the 1990s--me, the human mind, versus an unflinching machine that never made an emotional move. Except in this match, Deep Blue could churn out an endless supply of bomb-dropping bishops.</p><p>What kept me coming back wasn't just winning. It was the process of working through each scenario's puzzle. Defending a capture point against an overwhelming air assault. Outmaneuvering infantry hidden in dense forests. Timing a naval invasion to coincide with an armored push on the opposite flank. The game rewarded patience and punished arrogance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553938-wiiuvc_advancewarsdualstrike_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553938" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553938-wiiuvc_advancewarsdualstrike_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553938"></a><figcaption>Advance Wars: Dual Strike</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553938-wiiuvc_advancewarsdualstrike_05.jpg"></figure><p>And when I got bored of the game's prebuilt challenges? I made my own. Dual Strike's map editor was a treasure trove. I'd design elaborate island chains where naval control decided the war, or create resource-starved wastelands that forced both sides to make desperate, high-stakes gambles. Sometimes I'd stack the deck against myself on purpose--giving the AI extra funds, advantageous terrain, or even a head start in unit production--just to see if I could claw my way back from the brink.</p><p>There was a special satisfaction in winning those battles. Not because the game told me I was good, but because I knew I had beaten something I built to be unfair. It was like crafting my own tortuous obstacle course and then daring myself to survive it.</p><p>The War Room offered its own brand of joy. These standalone missions were more polished than my homemade ones but still gave me freedom in how to approach them. I'd replay certain maps over and over to test new CO pairings and figure out the absolute most efficient way to dismantle the enemy's plan.</p><p>Looking back, I realize Dual Strike made me comfortable with failure--because I failed a lot--and it made the eventual victories that much sweeter. It also planted the seed of creativity in my mind. This edition of Advance Wars was one of the few games, and one for DS no less, that offered user-generated content tools decades before they would shape the future of gaming. That early experience is part of why creation tools--like Fortnite Creative or Battlefield Portal--have become a central focus of my career. One of the greatest ways to empower players is to give them the tools to build the experiences they want.</p><p>Even now, I gravitate toward that same custom-built chaos when I revisit Advance Wars: Dual Strike. The campaigns are fun for nostalgia's sake, but I'm happiest when I'm staring down a near-impossible map I've cobbled together, wondering if I've created a monster I can't beat. The rain is still falling. The fog is still thick. Hawke is still somewhere out there in the mist. And he's probably going to beat me.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company and DeNA have announced a brand new themed booster pack expansion for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, and it's bringing a ton of new cards for you to collect next week.</p>

<p>Arriving on August 28th,&nbsp;<em>Secluded Springs</em>, like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-eevee-grove" rel="nofollow">Eevee Grove</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-expansion-shining-revelry" rel="nofollow">Shining Revelry</a>&nbsp;</em>before it, is a themed booster pack rather than a mainline expansion (like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow"><em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em></a>), which effectively means that it's bringing fewer cards and no seismic gameplay changes to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>.</p>

<p>That doesn't mean you can't expect lots of new cards, though, and true to form,&nbsp;<em>Secluded Springs&nbsp;</em>will bring brand new digital goodies for you, including a gorgeous new Suicune ex card, a new full-art Milotic, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-secluded-springs-suicune.jpg?itok=8Mj89KIM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-secluded-springs-suicune.jpg?itok=taH36410 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new Suicune ex card is just one of the cards that awaits you in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Secluded Springs&nbsp;</em>expansion.</figcaption></figure><p>You can also look forward to new cards depicting the likes of Entei and Raikou, as well as Mantyke, Slowking, and other 'mons you might find around a hot spring area. By the looks of the art that's been shown for the expansion so far, it's all lovely high-quality stuff, too.</p>

<p>Of course, there's no guarantee that the art for these cards won't turn out to have been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-production-issue-plagiarism" rel="nofollow">inadvertently stolen from fanart pieces</a>, but at least we can probably expect The Pokemon Company to act quickly if that does turn out to be the case.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, it's a mobile version of the popular&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>card game that simplifies combat rules and renders your collection digitally rather than physically.</p>

<p>It's got plenty of cards from the main game to collect, as well as a number of unique art pieces you can only find within&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>itself, and hey, it's free to play, so you may as well check it out, right?</p>




<p><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is available to play now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>, and its&nbsp;<em>Secluded Springs&nbsp;</em>themed booster pack launches on August 28th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher Battlestate Games has announced that the game's 1.0 release finally has a release date, and it's just around the corner.</p>

<p>In a new trailer titled "Prepare for Escape" (which is pretty brief and doesn't feature too much in the way of gameplay footage), a man can be seen typing code on a screen, interspersed with footage of soldiers in camo gear engaging in firefights.</p>

<p>Eventually, amidst blaring alarms, the man types a single date on the screen: November 15th. Technically speaking, the trailer doesn't specifically say that this is&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>'s 1.0 release date, but it's hard to imagine what else could warrant this kind of fanfare.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/escape-from-tarkov-1.0-release-date-snow.jpg?itok=VubJzyJu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/escape-from-tarkov-1.0-release-date-snow.jpg?itok=jTBCsqBa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>is finally getting a 1.0 release later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Battlestate first teased a 1.0 release for&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>this year <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-10-2025-steam-confirmed" rel="nofollow">back in April</a>, and the studio confirmed that the game will be coming to Steam then as well, although whether that'll happen alongside the 1.0 launch remains to be seen.</p>

<p><em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>was first released in closed beta back in 2017, and since then, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-patch-0-16-0-0" rel="nofollow">undergone</a> a number of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-patch-01400-brings-new-location-for-beginners-achievements-weapons" rel="nofollow">changes</a> thanks to consistent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-patch-0135" rel="nofollow">updates</a> (and progress wipes to go along with them, of course).</p>

<p>The game has also spawned a spinoff in the form of <i>Escape from Tarkov: Arena</i>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-arena-shows-its-fps-gameplay-in-new-trailer" rel="nofollow">more traditional FPS</a> that forgoes&nbsp;<em>Tarkov</em>'s wide-open areas and PvPvE gameplay for more straightforward player-versus-player deathmatch engagements.</p>

<p>If you wish, you can check out the new Preapre for Escape trailer right here. It doesn't give too much away other than the date, but it's a fun little creation on Battlestate's part regardless.</p>




<p><em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>is, as far as we know, due to launch in full on November 15th this year. If you want to check it out ahead of that date, you can <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pick up its beta right now on PC</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hollow Knight has hit a new peak player count on Steam more than eight years after being released. This super-surge in popularity has come about after the Hollow Knight: Silksong release date was <strong>finally revealed </strong>after years of anticipation. </p>



<p>As I write this, the game peaked at 22,260 users on Steam <strong>three minutes ago</strong>. It’s trending upwards, so we can expect that number to climb as more people jump onto Hollow Knight to experience it before Silksong’s release date comes around.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-silksong-release">When is the Silksong Release?</h2>



<p><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong is set to be released on September 4, 2025. </strong>It’s closer than we expected, but it was a date that many thousands of players had to be patient for, especially given that the last game hit the market almost a decade ago.</p>



<p>During the recent Opening Night Live showcase at Gamescom, Team Cherry unveiled an all-new trailer for Silksong, which included the ultimate drop of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/">game’s release date</a>.</p>



<p>Here’s the new Silksong release trailer, which has racked up more than 3 million views in under a day:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Hollow Knight: Silksong - Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The original Hollow Knight title has skyrocketed in popularity since the trailer dropped during Opening Night Live. In recent minutes (at the time of publishing), a new peak was achieved by Hollow Knight on Steam. Before today, the last peak was 20,300 players in May 2022, but I can’t say for sure what caused that surge.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight is one of the best-reviewed games ever made, boasting an ‘Overwhelmingly Positive’ rating on Steam that’s represented by 97% positivity across a whopping 136,000+ reviews.</p>



<p>It’s easy to see why the anticipation is so high for the follow-up game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="8BitDo Arcade Controller 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bac924760d933/8bitdo-arcade-controller-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you’re into fighting games, chances are you’ve probably seen – or maybe even used – a bunch of leverless arcade controllers. They’re taking the fighting scene by storm, and now 8BitDo, one of the most consistent accessory manufacturers in the business, has launched its own <strong>Arcade Controller</strong> for the Switch, Switch 2, and PC, priced at <strong>$89.99</strong>.</p>
<p>But what the heck is a leverless arcade controller? Well, some folks call them Hit Box controllers, but <a href="https://www.hitboxarcade.com/">Hit Box</a> is actually just one of many branded products released over the years, so it’s kinda like calling a games console ‘a Nintendo’. In reality, they’re largely referred to as ‘leverless’ thanks to the obvious lack of a joystick / lever in favour of an all-button setup. If you’re dead set on a more traditional setup, 8BitDo also has its own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/01/hardware_8bitdos_arcade_stick_grants_that_coin-op_feel_to_your_switch">Arcade Stick</a> available for purchase.</p><div><figure data-videoid="myrpG5TN7_Q" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/myrpG5TN7_Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/myrpG5TN7_Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/myrpG5TN7_Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed53c808gnuqyt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myrpG5TN7_Q" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>So let’s take a closer look at the buttons on this thing, starting with the standard circular inputs (we’ll come back to those bean-shaped ones shortly). These are your basic inputs, and their positioning on the controller is such that your fingers can rest comfortably across the majority of them. The black buttons represent your movement, with ‘left’, ‘right’, and ‘down’ grouped together, and ‘up’ situated down toward the bottom. The red buttons, meanwhile, are a mixture of the face buttons and shoulder buttons on a standard Switch Joy-Con or Pro Controller.</p>
<p>What’s particularly nice about this is that the Arcade Controller boasts a dynamic button layout depending on whether you’re playing on Switch or PC. The dial in the top left corner of the controller lets you flick between the two modes, and internal lights will indicate how each of the red buttons function, changing automatically when switching from one mode to the other.</p>

<p>So in other words, the light indicators are a lovely way of easing you into the experience of using a leverless controller, since a lot of brands don’t include them at all. I won’t lie, getting started with a leverless controller can be daunting at first, even if you’re used to a regular arcade stick. Any muscle memory you might have accumulated over the years goes out the window, and you’ll probably find yourself making all kinds of wild mistakes when you start trying to string combos together in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear -Strive-</a> or pulling off a Drive Reversal in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>. Trust me when I say, however, that it’s well worth the time investment.</p>
<p>Going back to the buttons, those four extra bean-shaped inputs are essentially programmable to your liking. So for example, if you’re really not keen on having ‘up’ be near the bottom of the device, you can map this to the bean situated just above the ‘down’ button, making your directional inputs more akin to the familiar WASD setup on a keyboard. To map them, you simply hold down the button you want to map to along with the target input, then press the yellow star button at the top of the device. Alternatively, if you’re <em>really</em> not keen on them, the Arcade Controller also includes four replaceable lock caps to render them completely unusable.</p>
<p>As for the button quality, you’re looking at <a href="https://www.lofree.co/products/lofree-wizard">low-profile Kailh Wizard mechanical switches</a>, and they feel incredibly satisfying to press. They’re clicky and tactile, and the clicking noise can really help beginners understand when they’ve completed an input to help with those essential combos. That said, they're a little <em>too</em> loud at times, and the noise can be pretty distracting when playing either docked or in tabletop mode. Thankfully, like most leverless controllers, the button caps and switches can be modded with replacements, so feel free to experiment to see what suits you.</p>

<p>In an effort to be tournament ready (granted, you won't find many tournaments utilising the Switch or Switch 2, but still...), the 8BitDo Arcade Controller also comes with a lock switch at the top left of the device, along with SOCD cleaning. The former can be switched on to prevent any accidental presses of the start button, the blue home button, or whatever else might get you disqualified from a tournament.</p>
<p>But what is SOCD? It stands for Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Directions, and refers to the simultaneous input of directions that, on a single analogue stick or d-pad wouldn’t be possible, but with separate directional buttons <em>is</em> possible. For example, pressing ‘up’ and ‘down’ or ‘left’ and ‘right’ at the same time would sometimes result in unwanted in-game behaviour, but SOCD cleaning alleviates this entirely. Here, pressing opposing directions at the same time will simply yield a neutral stance in fighting games by default. Jolly good.</p>
<p>Like most 8BitDo products, you can also link up the Arcade Controller with the Ultimate Software V2 app on Windows. There is a version of the app available on Mac, but as of right now, the Arcade Controller will not link up there at all – only Windows. You’ll want to link the controller to the app as soon as possible in order to update it to the latest firmware (v1.04 at the time of writing) and make it Switch 2 compatible. So if you’re only on Mac, you’ll want to borrow a friend’s Windows PC or simply wait until the controller is compatible with the version on Mac.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the app will also let you create controller profiles and remap the buttons as you see fit. You can completely rearrange the layout of the inputs to your desire, or even set macros for special attacks; a good option for those extra bean-shaped buttons. It’s worth noting that you can only map single buttons to the programmable beans via the controller itself, while macros are only possible in the app. Once you’re all set up, however, you simply press the yellow star button on the controller to swap between profiles – easy. If you wish, you can also alter SOCD rules; so for example, rather than two opposing inputs rendering a neutral stance, you can make it so the first button pressed takes priority.</p>

<p>Aesthetically, 8BitDo’s Arcade Controller is absolutely stunning. Like its previous Arcade Stick, it looks to pay homage to the NES with the black, red, and light grey colour combination. Boasting a frosted tempered glass surface on top which, yes, might pick up a few minor fingerprints over time, this look is far preferable to a completely glossy surface, in my eyes. Meanwhile, over on the back, you’ve got a non-slip silicon cover that’s enhanced with a beautiful, consistent pattern of fighting combo patterns; seriously, it needs to be seen in person to really appreciate how cool this is.</p>
<p>You’ll also find a couple of other notable features on the back of the device. First up is the USB dongle, and this is magnetic, so holding the dongle close will cause it to snap into place, and believe me, it’s surprisingly satisfying in practice.</p>
<p>On the topic of the USB dongle, by the way, you can connect the Arcade Stick to your Switch or Switch 2 either via Bluetooth, the dongle, or the USB-A to USB-C cable, and all of them are completely viable with minimal latency from my experience. Linking via Bluetooth for the first time is simply a case of holding the green sync button while in the ‘Change Grip/Order’ section of the controller settings. Again, make sure you’ve updated the controller before attempting this on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Finally, there are switches on either side of the silicon cover which you can flip to add a slight bump to the device's angle when set upon a flat surface. It’s a minor change, but it does make a nice difference if you’re playing on a desk. Alternatively, the Arcade Controller is just as comfortable when used on your lap on the couch. If you opt to go wireless, then you can be safe in the knowledge that you'll get about 15-20 hours out of the battery life, which is incredibly generous.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>8BitDo's Arcade Controller is a fantastic piece of kit whether you're a leverless veteran or a complete newcomer to the fighting scene. Heck, it's even a great option for retro 2D platformers too, if you wish. At less than $100, it's a remarkably affordable device for those looking to dip their toes into the world of leverless controllers, and like the vast majority of 8BitDo's products, the quality far outweighs the cost.</p>
<p>The only major downside is the noise of the stock buttons, which can prove quite distracting in practice. Thankfully, however, you can completely replace the switches for something a little more kind on those auditory nerves. Otherwise, it's hard to fault. Leverless controllers definitely take a bit of getting used to, but they can really help to give you a competitive edge once you're comfortable with the setup. Crucially, however, it's just a lot more fun and satisfying than a bog-standard controller. 8BitDo has done it again.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-controversial-267-pve-mode-will-at-least-be-given-for-free-to-edge-of-darkness-owners/">Battlestate</a> has announced a release date for the 1.0 version of Escape from Tarkov, which will escape its early access shackles this coming November 15, 2025. </p>



<p>The news was announced with an intense live-action trailer on the studio's official YouTube channel, where the release date first shown on the watch of a downed soldier, and then more prominently displayed on a computer screen as the final shot of the trailer.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Ahead of its launch, players in attendance at any of the following events will be able to check out the 1.0 build for Escape from Tarkov, with the final event in South Korea overlapping with the game's 1.0 launch.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Battlestate</figcaption></figure>



<p>When Escape from Tarkov arrives this coming November, it will have spent a little more than nine years in early access before its 1.0 launch. At the time of this writing, it's not completely clear what changes are coming and what specifically will be included in the 1.0 version, but with the coming build appearing at the above four global events, hopefully, we'll start to hear more about the new version soon.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Battlestate just recently released a new patch for the game, with <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/351">update 0.16.9.0</a> now live, bringing a slew of balance changes and tweaks. </p>

              <p>Ubisoft’s long-promised animated series&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</em> has finally been given a longer trailer and a release date. Due October 14, the Liev Schreiber-fronted anime also stars comedian Janet Varney as Anna “Grim” Grímsdóttir, and has been in the works for about four-hundred-thousand years.</p> <p>OK, five years, but it really has dragged on. In the meantime we learned an entire <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-splinter-cell-movie-tom-hardy-1851700151"><em>Splinter Cell</em> movie starring Tom Hardy was canned</a>, while there’s been no word on other announced Ubisoft TV and movie projects like <em>Watch_Dogs</em>,&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Division</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ghost Recon</em>, <em>Riders Republic</em>, a <em>Rabbids</em> feature, and even a <em>Just Dance&nbsp;</em>movie. So honestly, the fact that anything at all is coming to screens feels fairly miraculous.</p> <p>The trailer, however, is…not what I was expecting. In 2024, Michael Ironside—who voiced title character Sam Fisher in the games—<a href="https://screenrant.com/splinter-cell-anime-cast-update-liev-schreiber-sam-fisher/">said that he was “too old” to play the part</a> at 75, with the role handed over to 57-year-old Liev Schreiber for the anime. So it’s something of a surprise to see Sam appearing in the trailer looking like a 75-year-old man.</p>

 <p>There’s still no clear idea what the show will actually be&nbsp;<em>about</em>, beyond it being personal to Fisher, following the death of someone called Douglas Shetland. What we do see is a lot of guns being fired, and Sam mistaking a fair few people for knife racks. Oh, and while it’s weirdly tossed away in the middle of the short teaser, at least the three-light googles appear at one point. I mean, I’m not in charge of Netflix marketing, but given most of the trailer looks like Sam Fisher: The Retirement Home Years, I’d perhaps have ended on the iconic headwear and maybe&nbsp;<em>something</em> that suggested some sort of intrigue.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Splinter Cell: Deathwatch | Official Teaser | Netflix" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LAM63Dj3XBQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The better news is the team behind the show. The creator is Derek Kolstad, responsible for Bob Odenkirk’s reinvention as an action hero in&nbsp;<em>Nobody</em>, and the writer of the first three&nbsp;<em>John Wick</em> movies. That’s some caliber, although I struggle not to imagine the scripts for <em>John Wick</em> are mostly “John punches a man, and then another man and then he shoots three guys, and then he gets shot in the leg but shakes it off and punches four other guys and throws knives at a guy.” Along with Kolstad is a writing team that features scribes from <em>Shooter</em>, and some fresh faces too.</p> <p>It’s an oddly witless and plotless teaser, although given Kolstad is head writer, it seems implausible the show itself could fall that way. Right? Please? As for Fisher’s age, perhaps the show is canon to the games, given the last one—<em>Splinter Cell: Blacklist</em>—came out an extraordinary 12 years ago. Maybe it’s to make the people who remember playing the games feel seen.</p>

Although we still don't really understand what this will involve, exactly, there are already some surprisingly mixed reactions coming from the community, with some players upset about the timing, suggesting it's an all-too-convenient <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-is-getting-a-stardew-valley-collab-in-september-but-not-everyone-is-happy-about-it"><u>distraction from the recent controversy around leakers</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There have been a few collaborations between Stardew Valley and other games over the years," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1958574815495037251" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posted</u></a> on X/Twitter yesterday. "To be clear, I never receive any money from these collabs. I've only done them because I was a fan of the other games, or because I genuinely thought the players would like it."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, Infinity Nikki responded directly to Barone from its official X/Twitter account.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We really appreciate you sharing your feelings on this. Any unintended stress was the last thing we wanted. It was our way of saying thanks — a free love letter to Stardew Valley from our team and for the community," the message <a href="https://x.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1958609280535519445" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Working on it felt like we were all tending a little farm together. The care and detail you pour into your world is exactly why we want to make cozy games too. We're still learning from you every day."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, it feels as though the fallout from the Stardew Valley collab is just a matter of bad timing here. The Infinity Nikki community has been unhappy ever since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-players-threaten-to-uninstall-the-game-as-dev-introduces-controversial-changes-with-update-15"><u>update 1.5</u></a> added some controversial changes to the game, such as retconning Infinity Nikki's story, and ramping up the money and time investments required to collect full outfits. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not that Barone does this all that often, either. Stardew Valley has only ever worked with a handful of other games, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/balatro"><u>Balatro</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/terraria"><u>Terraria</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in May, Barone admitted that he "didn't want to just be the Stardew Valley guy," explaining that was why he's currently working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microids has finally announced a release date for Syberia Remastered, a "<em>fully modernized</em>" version of the classic title that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/syberia-remastered-unveiled-for-q4-2025-launch/">first revealed earlier this year</a>. As expected, it'll arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, and it'll be out on November 6, 2025. What wasn't expected was that it's also making the jump to VR, and will launch on <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/syberia/6794327920669318/?srsltid=AfmBOoryYxnvWd-oUHWGBdjHWbRYZHo7vAEtjwAE69Dtc_vGvS0-jbac">Meta Quest 3</a> headsets a week after its PC and console launch, on November 13, 2025.</p>



<p>Alongside the news of the confirmed release date and the coming VR version, Microids debuted a 'Before/After' trailer that shows off the visual improvements fans of the original can enjoy in this new remaster. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Syberia Remastered – ESRB Before/After" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aMyKwVlDs_A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Fans looking to keep a piece of this remaster for themselves will also be able to pick up a physical version of the game on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, though it's unfortunately only being released physically in the UK.</p>



<p>The story of Syberia follows Kate Walker, a lawyer from New York who sets out to remote parts of the French Alps alongside her companion Oscar to find Hans Voralberg, an inventor obsessed with making a discovery thought to be impossible, to find the last remaining living mammoths on a mythical island, Syberia.</p>



<p>The trailer revealed today focuses on the visual improvements, but fans of the original are likely more interested in seeing what Microids has done regarding the redesigned puzzles, and to see how the quality of life improvements coming in the remaster smooth out the entire Syberia experience.</p>



<p>Now, thankfully, those fans have a date to look forward to that will satisfy their curiosity.</p>
