<p>Helldivers 2 is getting a fresh content drop next week with its Into the Unjust update, following on from the long-awaited Xbox launch and Halo ODST Legendary Warbond.</p>

<p>From a new Premium Warbond filled with new weapons and armor, to new challenges to explore, the Into the Unjust update has plenty to offfer.</p>

<p>Announced in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/26/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-launches-september-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation blog</a>, Into the Unjust in Helldivers 2 pushes players into a fresh battle against the Terminids into unknown territory, seemingly with a challenge that won’t allow you to call in Stratagems.</p>



<p>The teaser blog details disappearing “into the fog” to “discover new dangers”. It’s explained that “because of the nature of the caves, your Super Destroyer won’t be able to give you full support.” As a result, it’s your squad facing up against the Terminids alone.</p>



<p>New enemy types are also detailed, with “a new subterranean species of Terminid Warriors, Bile Spewers, and Chargers,” along with the Dragonroach, and “more terrifying creatures lying in wait on Hive Worlds.”</p>



<p>New challenges include escorting a mobile oil rig, locating and destroying the Hive Lung, along with new optional and sub-objectives too.</p>



<p>As is customary in Helldivers 2, the new drop of content also comes alongside a new Premium Warbond, called Dust Devils, which will “ensure survival in the harshest conditions these worlds can throw your way.”</p>



<p>The Warbond includes a primary weapon, a new throwable, and three unique stratagems, all of which launch on September 4.</p>



<p>Are you planning to pick up the latest Premium Warbond in Helldivers 2? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-go/">Pokemon Go</a> developer Scopely has revealed new details on the game's next season, Tales of Transformation. The season will start on September 2 and will run through December 2, with some of the highlights including a new transformation for a legendary Pokemon, more Mega Pokemon, and a few new pocket monsters will be coming to the game.</p><p>Kicking things off is confirmation that Keldeo will be able to transform into its Resolute Form during a season-long Special Research journey. In the Pokemon games, this form gives the mythical Pokemon more power and speed, and players who have already caught Keldeo can earn Keldeo Candy to power it up further.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxQyaeZu_d8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GxQyaeZu_d8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Fans of Mega Pokemon can look forward to Mega Raid Days throughout the season, as Mega Sharpedo, Mega Camerupt, and Mega Metagross will all appear during this event. There'll also be new Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokemon appearing during Tales of Transformation, like Dynamax Abra, Dynamax Duraludon, and Gigantamax Garbodor. Anyone looking to capture some new critters can also hunt for Dripplin and Hydrapple next month.</p><p>Dripplin was introduced in the Teal Mask expansion for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and when certain conditions are met, it evolves into the Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon Hydrapple. It's the third branch of potential evolutions for Applin, the apple-inspired Pokemon that can also evolve into Flapple and Appletun.</p><p>Finally, players looking for a real challenge can take part in Shadow Raids to face off against Shadow Groudon and several other Shadow Pokemon.</p><p>Later this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-is-completely-overhauling-its-leveling-system-in-october-to-be-more-rewarding/1100-6534230/">Pokemon Go will also overhaul progression</a>.

            <p>
A new major update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> has been unveiled, which will finally take the battle to the home of Super Earth's enemies.
</p>
<p>
Into the Unjust will see players explore the Hive Worlds behind the Gloom, to the home of the insect-like Terminids. That means battling through an underground labyrinth of cave tunnels without Super Destroyer support from the skies.
</p>
<p>
News of the update arrives on the same day Helldivers 2 releases on Xbox Series X/S. Into the Unjust will arrive on 2nd September.

<p>
The update will bring a whole bunch of new enemy types, as well as new mission types. Players will need to locate and destroy the Hive Lung in the tunnels to stem the spread of the Gloom, as well as escorting a mobile oil rig across treacherous terrain.
</p>
<p>
The update will also arrive with a new Dust Devils premium Warbond. This will include a primary weapon, a new throwable, and three unique strategems, in addition to new armours, capes, and more - details in the image below.

            <p>Sony has pushed an update live to the PlayStation store that makes refunds considerably easier.</p>
<p>The new process, which can only be done on the PlayStation website or app, goes as follows: navigate to the PlayStation store and select the three dots in the top right corner to access your transaction history. From there, you should be able to select your past purchases and request refunds.</p>
<p>Previously, PlayStation users would have to use an online assistant, basically a chat bot, to negotiate a refund. The requirements for a refund remain the same: only a product bought within the last 14 days is valid, and you can't have begun the process of downloading or playing it. That is, unless what you bought is faulty, in which case these requirements may be circumvented.</p>

<p>It's a nice little update that should make those 2am reflex purchases of Detroit Become Human feel a little less rancid the next day. Also, anything that takes away those pesky chat bot supports is a good update in my book. This comes alongside a selection of other improvements made to the PS Plus store as of late, including additional accessibility options and Apple Pay support.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Playing My Hero Academia: All’s Justice highlights one big thing for me: I really need to catch up and watch the anime. I think I’m at least three seasons behind now, and the eighth and final season is about to air in just over a month, but on top of all that, there’s a new series-capping game coming with My Hero Academia: All’s Justice.</p>
<p><iframe title="MY HERO ACADEMIA: All’s Justice | Battle Systems Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5QUi-Mrzrnc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Just as with the previous games, this is a 3v3 3D arena battler, but with the jump to the final season, we have a roster stuffed full of characters who’ve now reached maturity and levelled up all their abilities. Where Shoto was a rough around the edged glass cannon at the start of the series –&nbsp;for reasons that were quickly revealed –&nbsp;he’s now mastered the powers of One For All, able to call upon more layers of inherited abilities than before.</p>


<p>One of the main draws here will naturally be playing through the story mode and reliving the various staged battles between heroes and villains depicted in the Final War arc of the manga and anime, but then there’s also just all the wish-fulfilment and fun of creating distinctly mixed up fighting trios and pitting them head to head. I stuck with the good vs. bad divide, and had a lot of fun with with the baddies, who definitely had the feel of being more powerful.</p>


<p>Combat revolves around four core actions, with a locked-on target combo, a guard and counter-attack, and an unblockable attack to break through a stern defence. Being able to dash and get out of the way of an attack is key, but so too is being able to quickly swap characters and resume the fight with a different set of powers and abilities. Bakugo’s explosive fists are better at short range, while Todoroki’s mixed fire and ice give him enhanced movement and a bit more range, so you could adjust to a rival’s tactics. Of course, if one of your fighters is knocked out, then your options become a bit more limited!</p>
<p>New for this game is the Rising meter. This builds up as you fight, eventually filling a meter until you can trigger it and boost the power of your character with increased attack power, movement speed and recovery speed – it’s a pretty big bump, and it’s automatically granted to you when reduced to your last character, which is nice.</p>
<p>And then there’s the Plus Ultra abilities, which can be used to trigger a Plus Ultra Combo and bring your full squad in for a devastating combo attack of character switching.</p>

<p>While there’s no doubt going to be a lot of returning players diving into All’s Justice, work has been put in to try and make this more accessible with a new single-button auto-combo to take off some of the load while trying to keep pace with the battling. It’s definitely a bit of a help, given how difficult it is just to maintain distance and positioning sometimes, but it’s intended as just a stepping stone up to the regular control scheme.</p>
<p>All-in-all, this feels like a solid evolution of the One’s Justice games and should be a great way to wrap up the series in video game form, adding a few gameplay tweaks and with a smidgeon of added accessibility.&nbsp;Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got to go and figure out where I got up to in the anime…</p>

The Pokémon Company is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pokemon-legends-z-a-lands-another-new-mega-evolution">teasing another YouTube Premiere</a> for Thursday, 28th August 2025.</p>
<p>This is the second premiere in two weeks, following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pokemon-legends-z-a-lands-another-new-mega-evolution">last week's unveiling of Mega Victreebel</a>. This time, the hook is a little more obvious - no purple goo, no darkly-lit areas, simply a piece of art (or video, from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DN0bOyK2GAg/?igsh=N3loODM3eXA5bXRo">Instagram</a>) showing a Hawlucha facing off against a Machamp.</p>
<p>Now, if we had to guess, we'll probably be getting a new Mega Evolution again. The thing is, neither Hawlucha or Machamp have one. So one of these two (or both?) could be getting one.</p><div><figure data-videoid="vf32irwF2Do" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f76a2rlkquh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf32irwF2Do" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Several indie game developers have announced that they're moving the release dates of their games in order to avoid clashing with Team Cherry's hotly-anticipated&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>.</p>

<p>Last week, we learned that&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">will be releasing in September</a>&nbsp;(in fact, it's due next Thursday at time of writing), and a number of indie games have scrambled to move their release dates by a couple of weeks in order to compensate.</p>

<p>Today alone, Devolver Digital's&nbsp;<em>Baby Steps</em>, which was originally due to launch on September 8th, was <a href="https://x.com/devolverdigital/status/1960326361727258824" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">moved</a> to September 23rd, and cozy magical game&nbsp;<em>Little Witch in the Woods&nbsp;</em><a href="https://x.com/SunnySideUp_DEV/status/1960291045528547599" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">will now be launching</a> on September 15th to dodge&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s release date as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-witch-in-the-woods-silksong-release-date.jpg?itok=DTFKDC6s 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-witch-in-the-woods-silksong-release-date.jpg?itok=Y5NA3PPE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Little Witch in the Woods&nbsp;</em>is just one indie game that has delayed its release date to avoid&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Yesterday,&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>publisher Ysbryd Games announced that its&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>-meets-<em>Disgaea&nbsp;</em>tactical RPG <a href="https://x.com/YsbrydGames/status/1960029218055864420" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">would be delayed</a> to November owing to&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s launch, having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-release-date-september-2025" rel="nofollow">originally been planned for a September release</a>.</p>

<p>Developer Necrosoft <a href="https://x.com/necrosoftgames/status/1960035797387870674" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">subsequently said</a> that the delay was "not [its] choice", but that it "understand[s] why the choice was made"; the studio goes on to say that "dropping the <i>GTA&nbsp;</i>of indie games with 2 weeks' notice makes everyone freak out".</p>

<p>As well as the aforementioned games, upcoming Metroidvania&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Aeterna Lucis</em></a>, "hellish gambling roguelike"&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/PanikArcade/status/1958882570210304059" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>CloverPit</em></a>, and 16-bit throwback adventure game&nbsp;<em><a href="https://x.com/Talegamesnews/status/1958593783161135519" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Faeland</a>&nbsp;</em>have all been delayed to varying degrees owing to&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s release date.</p>

<p>These developers' decisions are understandable;&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>is one of the most hotly-anticipated games of all time, having been in development for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-is-hollow-knight-sequel-youve-been-waiting-for" rel="nofollow">at least six years</a>&nbsp;with very little news trickling down between its announcement and recent developments.</p>




<p>When it does launch,&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>will continue the story of the first game's agile bug Hornet as she explores a brand new kingdom, battles new bosses and regular foes, and platforms her way to the peak of a new Metroidvania map.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005908" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/hollow-knight-silksong/9n116v0599hb" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and Nintendo Switch consoles on September 4th.</p>

                  The stan wars are over as both Huntr/x and Saja Boys fans pay tribute to their fallen fave
                </p><div>
              
              <p><span>Anime and nerd conventions have plenty of ingrained traditions that transcend any one gathering. From artist alleys to yaoi paddles, most veteran attendees know what to expect when they show up to their annual event, and now </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>is adding a new tradition to the mix.</span> <span>The Netflix musical has only been out for two months, but it’s already leaving an imprint on conventions around the world, as fans are using them to pay their respects to their favorite demon boy band heartthrob.</span></p>  <p><span>Jinu is the lead vocalist of the Saja Boys, Huntr/x vocalist Rumi’s beau, and also a demon with a tortured past he longs to forget. He leads the boy band in a battle for hearts and minds against Huntr/x, but is slowly won over to the light side by his connection to Rumi. Progress isn’t linear, though, as he does end up betraying her in the lead-up to the final showdown and nearly feeds all of Seoul’s kpop fans to Gwi-ma, the demon king. As </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-songs-animal-crossing-youtube-stream-2000618416"><span>Huntr/x</span></a><span> faces the demons in one last musical battle, Gwi-ma nearly defeats Rumi with a massive, soul-powered energy blast, only for Jinu to stand between them and take the blast himself. As he dies, he tells Rumi that she set him free and gave him his soul back, which he leaves to her to finish the fight.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Yeah, redemption arcs are great and all, but my babies didn’t even get to kiss. “Are they lovers? Worse. They never got to be.” The rest of the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-box-office-showtimes-songs-2000620026"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>fandom is also feeling this grief, because memorials for Jinu are popping up at conventions all around the world. The anchor of these displays is usually a memorial photo of Jinu, which is then surrounded by offerings such as stickers, notes, and even empty soda cans and bottles as a reference to Saja Boys’ breakout hit “Soda Pop.”&nbsp;</span></p>              <p><span>R.I.P. to a real one, but even as fans mourn Jinu, there’s another subset of them who believe the demon diva may come back in the inevitable sequel, as the film implies his soul lives within Rumi’s sword which she uses to defeat Gwi-ma. But until I see him fully re-materialize and give Rumi a kiss on the forehead, I’d better keep seeing memorials for him at every convention.</span></p>

                <p>The latest Grounded 2 patch may not be adding anything completely new to the game, but it is removing some of the survival sandbox's biggest annoyances. Patch 0.1.3 includes some improvements for the Buggy, save-repair options, and makes sure resources will no longer respawn through your structures--though players still report frequent crashes.</p><p>In what Obsidian refers to as a "quick fix" pending more major changes, Grounded 2 is getting a handful of game-repair options to remove a few annoyances. You'll now be able to use the Creature Reset option to move all creatures back to their original locations, and the Buggy Reset to send all Buggies back to the nest, no matter where they were--or what state they were in.</p>

<p>The game now ensures that all Snail Shells will automatically despawn after 24 hours, while a separate fix stops resources from spawning in the middle of player-built structures. Obsidian notes that you will still have to get rid of resources that are currently in your base once the update is applied, but that it shouldn't return after this.</p><p>A few bugs affecting the Buggy have been cleaned up, including a duplication glitch some players have been exploiting by using the Buggy's inventory.</p><p>Obsidian also estimates the new update comes with a 30% improvement to performance, resolving a few glitches that were known to cause game crashes. However, on the topic of stability, the studio reminds players that Grounded 2 is still in early access, and that players can expect stability and performance to continue to improve through development.</p><p>The Grounded sequel launched in early access at the end of July, and quickly racked up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grounded-2-reaches-major-player-milestone/1100-6533899/" data-ref-id="1100-6533899">over 3 million players</a>.

		<p>Arrowhead has announced that the Helldivers will have a new objective to deal with from September 2nd, which is when Helldivers 2: Into the Unjust will launch. These new missions will take players deep into the Terminid Hive Worlds where there will be new missions to beat, and new enemies to push back in locations that will be creeping with all sorts of creatures.</p>
<p><iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Into the Unjust Deep Dive" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dJi8VsvnkoE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Hive Worlds have been shrouded by the Gloom, so it is time to lift the veil and shoot at whatever is hidden by it. Locations will include huge towers to scale and caverns deep underground where you and your squad could be hit at any time. Arrowhead has stated that when you are in the caverns there will be no Super Destroyer support, meaning it is just your squad and whatever weapons you can carry. Some of the new creatures that will be encountered on the Hive Worlds include variants of Terminid Warriors and Bile Spewers, along with Chargers that will dig underground and emerge in front of its enemies, aka you. There is also the new Dragonroach creature which flies and fires down burning bile. Arrowhead has stated there are other creatures which players will discover for themselves. The new missions include escorting an oil rig across the planet’s surface, and destroying Hive Lungs in the caverns below. New additional objectives will be added to Helldivers 2 for Into the Unjust too.</p>
<p>The Dust Devils Premium Warbond will also be available from September 2nd, and it will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>G-7 Pineapple – </strong>This cluster frag grenade might look like a cute and unassuming fruit, but it’ll have the bugs in absolute pieces.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>S-11 Speargun – </strong>A true big game hunter’s companion. The S-11 fires heavy-duty projectiles that release a cloud of gas on impact.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>EAT-700 Expendable Napalm – </strong>Heat up the planet with this single-use missile that contains napalm cluster bombs.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>MS-11 Solo Silo – </strong>The long-range power of a missile in a new convenient package. Calls down a Hellpod-sized missile silo with a single, ultra-powerful missile and a handheld targeting remote.</em></li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>DS-42 Federation’s Blade – </strong>Captures the essence of armies marching through the desert sands. Wear with the Rightful occupier cape and player card for a polished look.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>DS-191 Scorpion- </strong>Look like a true nomadic warrior in this desert-proof draped set, pairs perfectly with the Windswept Wayfinder cape and player card.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><em>Title: Burier of Heads</em></li>
<li><em>Emote: Raider’s Cheer</em></li>
<li><em>Pattern: “Rattlesnake” for vehicles and Hellpods</em></li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As Helldivers 2 launches onto Xbox Series X/S today, developer Arrowhead Games has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/26/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-launches-september-2/">debuted a deep-dive</a> into the upcoming Into the Unjust update, which will arrive on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X/S this coming September 2, 2025.</p>



<p>This new update doesn't just add new worlds for players to liberate, it adds a new flavor to the Helldivers 2 experience, sending players deep into the caves of these Hive Worlds where the Terminid enemy originates, where you'll be without the help of your Super Destroyer. You'll need to work together, even just to see the path ahead of you, as you'll need to coordinate between using your heavy-duty weapons and flashlights to see what's charging at you.</p>



<p>You'll have two new main missions to complete on these Hive Worlds. One is above ground and has you defending an oil rig that is mining oil on these Terminid planets for Super Earth to use on its mission to liberate the universe. The other is what has you going underground, as you try to move through the maze of caves to find the Hive Lung and destroy it.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Into the Unjust Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dJi8VsvnkoE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Of course, with new planets to explore, you'll face new challenges, with new mole-type enemies that burrow into the ground to try and catch you off guard when they pop up below you, and new dragon bugs. No, really, dragon bugs, called Dragonroach, that spews acidic bile from above you.</p>



<p>Arrowhead even teases a larger subterranean bug that they don't exactly show, but a short clip at the end of the deep dive makes them look like giant worms. We'll be sure to get a closer look at them next week.</p>



<p>With new enemies and challenges also comes new weapons and warbonds, namely the Dust Devils Warbond. There's also the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-coming-to-playstation-helldivers-2-warbond/">Halo ODST crossover</a> that is technically the first time Halo content is available on a PlayStation device. The Halo ODST Warbond is available today, while the Dust Devils Warbond will arrive with the Into the Unjust update next week.</p>

<p>Into the Unjust is the most significant update to Helldivers 2 since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-out-now-fight-on-the-streets-of-super-earth/">Heart of Democracy</a> update earlier this year, and alongside the Halo ODST collaboration, a fitting way to ring in Xbox Series X/S players who are joining the fight for the first time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Enhance has announced the&nbsp;<em>Lumines Arise&nbsp;</em>release date, and if you're still on the fence about checking out the studio's latest rhythm-puzzler, then there's a PS5 demo available for you to try out right now.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/26/lumines-arise-launches-nov-11-ps5-demo-available-now/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the PlayStation Blog, Enhance's Tetsuya Mizuguchi reveals that you can expect to check out&nbsp;<em>Lumines Arise&nbsp;</em>in full on November 11th, and that the PS5 demo is up for download. Sadly, it doesn't seem to be available on Steam, or at least not yet at time of writing.</p>

<p>The demo contains three single-player stages for you to try, and it's got just one difficulty level on offer, namely Easy mode. The full game will add three extra difficulties to keep you on your toes no matter what your rhythmic proficiency may be.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lumines-arise-release-date-seahorses.jpg?itok=xJt0jWoA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lumines-arise-release-date-seahorses.jpg?itok=FM0P6H9C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lumines Arise&nbsp;</em>is coming in November, but if you're on PS5, you can check it out now.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Lumines Arise&nbsp;</em>was first revealed as part of Sony's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-state-of-play-june-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">State of Play showcase back in June</a>, and it's the first new <i>Lumines&nbsp;</i>game in nine years (longer if you don't count 2016's&nbsp;<em>Lumines: Puzzle &amp; Music</em>, which was a mobile release).</p>

<p>According to Mizuguchi, the game is "incredibly easy for anyone to get into" thanks to its "excellent interactive tutorial", which also means it's ideal for anyone who's never played a&nbsp;<em>Lumines&nbsp;</em>game before, as well as those who are just getting back into the series after a break.</p>

<p>If you're not the kind of person who loves the time pressure that&nbsp;<em>Lumines</em>' default modes bring, you can switch off the timer using the No Stress&nbsp;<em>Lumines&nbsp;</em>option in the game's accessibility menu, and there are tons of other tweaks to help you reach the experience you want to have.</p>




<p><em>Lumines Arise&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2370000/Lumines_Arise/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10011885" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> on November 11th, and if you're playing on PS5, you can download the demo right now. Stay tuned for more on this one, and in the meantime, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/lumines-arise-is-going-to-be-your-chill-out-game-of-year" rel="nofollow">be sure to check out our preview</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-1tb-sandisk-ssd-is-nearly-free-amazons-going-crazy-for-back-to-school-2000620332</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Having an external SSD on hand to back up important documents or photos is a good idea. With the possibilities of theft or hacking, you can never be too careful. That is why companies such as <em>SanDisk</em> remain a top choice when it comes to reliable storage devices.</p>
<p>If you need an external SSD with excellent performance, the 1TB storage capacity places itself in the sweet spot for most users. And thanks to Amazon’s Back to School sale, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3731/">you can now grab the SanDisk 1TB Extreme Portable SSD at an all-time low of about $99 (down from $129)</a>. Larger models such as the 2TB and 4TB also receive price cuts in the neighborhood of 25/35%.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3731/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>High Speed Storage</h2>
<p>The SanDisk 1TB SSD <strong>boasts up to 1050MB/s read speeds and write speeds that are only a hair behind, at around 1000MB/s</strong>. That kind of speed is ideal for quick transfer of big files. With USB 3.2 Gen 2 interface via USB-C, you can plug this drive directly into newer laptops or even certain tablets and smartphones with ease. The speedy data transfer rate means less waiting about so you can get on with what matters.</p>
<p>This drive carries an IP65 rating so it’s <strong>water and dustproof</strong> to a reasonable extent. That gives you extra confidence if you’re carrying it around in a backpack or briefcase. It may become splashed or dusty but that will not prevent your data from remaining secure. It is also lightweight, measuring approximately 4 inches long and half an inch thick so it will not occupy much space when traveling.</p>



<p>The drive<strong> features 256-bit AES encryption</strong> with password protection which is easily manageable with free SanDisk software. It keeps your files locked down to unauthorized access even if your drive for some reason gets misplaced. All you need to keep in mind is that this security feature functions optimally with Windows and macOS; some phones might not support it totally.</p>
<p>It supports a wide range of operating systems, including Windows 10 and newer, macOS 10.13+, and plenty of USB Type-C capable devices. And in addition, the drive is powered by the bus, which means you won’t need an extra power cable — all you do is plug into the USB port and you’re ready to roll.</p>
<p>The construction is solid without being blocky and <strong>SanDisk offers a five-year limited warranty</strong>. That provides some added peace of mind if you’re planning on relying on this drive as your workday driver, school driver, or personal project driver. Speed, reliability, and resilience all coexist in neat package form in a easily pocketed or bagged form.</p>
<p>Don’t miss your chance to get it here:</p>

                <p>A much-hyped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-dress-to-impress-lady-gaga-event/1100-6534112/" data-ref-id="1100-6534112">meet and greet</a> with Lady Gaga on Roblox's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dress-to-impress/" data-ref-id="5000-682160">Dress to Impress</a> did not play out as advertised, according to fans who were not exactly impressed by the event. DTI has issued an apology, promising to "take accountability" for fans' disappointment over the meet and greet.</p><p>Fans were disappointed to discover that, while Lady Gaga was in fact present and in control of her avatar during the event, only a select few players--including devs, influencers, and contest winners--were actually able to interact with her directly. Other players only saw a broadcast version of Gaga's avatar from a different server. Fans also expressed disappointment that the Gaga Q&amp;A was purely text chat, instead of a voice broadcast.</p><p>However the biggest controversy over the event was the way feedback was handled by DTI's community team both on official channels and on their own personal socials. "None of you are forced to be here," one community manager said on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBHXhDIA7sI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Live stream</a> of the event when reading player criticisms in the chat. "If you're unhappy just leave." The community manager, who streams as BeaPlays, issued a personal apology via DTI socials. "I should not have responded with such a lack of empathy, and that is completely on me," Bea said. "Moving forward, I will keep in mind your feedback and ensure that my responses are more appropriate and thought out."</p><p>The developers addressed other concerns with the event, explaining that it was not possible for the hundreds of thousands of players who attended the event to all personally meet Lady Gaga, and Roblox limitations also meant that live audio could not be broadcast across all the servers. "This is the first time we have done something this big, but that doesn't excuse the fact that we missed the mark," the apology reads. "In the future, we will make more of an effort to ensure that our messaging is very clear so that you know exactly what to expect."</p><p>The DTI team also explained that all questions that were given to Gaga during the Q&amp;A had to be okayed by her team in advance, meaning there wasn't much scope for spontaneity during the event. They also acknowledged that the fan event was "feeling drawn out or a little boring towards the end," but in a message on Discord added that they didn't want to rush Lady Gaga's answers.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/allurequinn/status/1959296671772254700" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">🚨LADY GAGA IS CURRENTLY TEASING DEAD DANCE ON DRESS TO IMPRESS <br>“You've created a creature of the night, now I'm haunting your air, your soul, your eyes” <a href="https://t.co/THXe2ypxyx" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/THXe2ypxyx</a></p>  — pop culture gal (@allurequinn) <a href="https://twitter.com/allurequinn/status/1959296671772254700?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>While the event wasn't exactly everything that fans had hoped it would be, Gaga used the unlikely appearance to tease her upcoming song "The Dead Dance," and even debuted some of the upcoming song's lyrics in the Dress To Impress chat.

                <p>Today is a somewhat unusual day for game releases, as two high-profile games that originated as console exclusives are now leaping to competing platforms. Sony's Helldivers 2 launched today on Xbox, with Microsoft's Gears of War: Reloaded debuting on PlayStation 5.</p><p>Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-published-game-helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-in-august/1100-6532942/" data-ref-id="1100-6532942">announced that it was bringing Helldivers 2 to Xbox back in July</a>, while Microsoft's announcement of Gears of War: Reloaded in May <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-remaster-coming-this-august-to-xbox-playstation-and-pc/1100-6531314/" data-ref-id="1100-6531314">confirmed a PS5 release.</a></p><p>The launches are notable in part because of what they say about the evolving landscape for games. Microsoft has been embracing a multiplatform release strategy for some time now, and Gears is just the latest effort for Microsoft to put its games on the biggest console platform in a bid to make more money.</p><p>Microsoft previously released games like Sea of Thieves, Grounded, and Forza Horizon 5 on PlayStation. In fact, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-ps5-sales-charts-but-another-game-reigned-supreme/2900-6827/" data-ref-id="2900-6827">Xbox games are dominating the PlayStation sales charts</a>. There is a physical edition of Gears of War: Reloaded for PS5, but it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-physical-edition-for-ps5-is-only-40/1100-6532287/" data-ref-id="1100-6532287">not available on Xbox.</a></p><p>Sony's sample size is smaller, as Helldivers 2 is one of PlayStation's first releases on Xbox. The MLB The Show series is now on Xbox, but it's co-published with Major League Baseball. According to a report, it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-comments-on-deal-to-bring-mlb-the-show-21-to-xbox-and-game-pass/1100-6489820/" data-ref-id="1100-6489820">MLB's decision to put the series on Xbox (and Switch).</a> Whether or not Helldivers 2 coming to Xbox signals any kind of significant publishing policy shift from PlayStation is unknown. The company previously avoided putting its games on PC, but changed that stance--and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-expects-to-earn-450-million-from-pc-games-in-next-10-months/1100-6514491/" data-ref-id="1100-6514491">made a lot of money from it.</a></p><p>Xbox senior social marketing manager Josh Stein shared a meme on social media regarding the launches of Helldivers 2 on Xbox and Gears on PlayStation.</p><p>Nintendo, for its part, does not release its own games on any rival console platforms. The Japanese gaming giant did, however, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-explains-why-mario-wont-come-to-smartphones/1100-6410004/" data-ref-id="1100-6410004">hold out on releasing mobile games for a long time</a> before eventually kicking off a mobile-game endeavor with games like Mario Kart Tour, Super Mario Run, and Fire Emblem Heroes.</p><p>Helldivers 2 on Xbox is more than just a straight port of the game for Microsoft's console, as the game launched today, August 26, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-odst-crossover-will-add-4-iconic-halo-weapons-and-more/2900-6890/" data-ref-id="2900-6890">Halo crossover</a>--and this content is available on PS5 and PC as well.</p><p>As for Gears of War Reloaded, the remaster of the 2006 original game doesn't have any special content with history connected to PlayStation. The franchise was among the best-known for Xbox in the Xbox 360 days, but is only just now making the leap to PlayStation after some 19 years.</p><p>Gears of War creator Cliff Bleszinski has said he is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-co-creator-is-thrilled-that-the-franchise-isnt-xbox-exclusive-anymore/1100-6534071/" data-ref-id="1100-6534071">thrilled to see Gears come to PlayStation.</a> The next entry in the series, 2026's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526145/" data-ref-id="1100-6526145">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, is so far only confirmed for release on Xbox for its console release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Arrowhead Game Studios have revealed Into the Unjust, the next major&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>update, and it's time for you and your squad to take the fight to the mysterious Terminid Hive Worlds.</p>

<p>As revealed in a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/26/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-launches-september-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Into the Unjust arrives on September 2nd, and its big new addition is the aforementioned Hive Worlds, where you'll find new Terminid dangers both above ground and beneath it.</p>

<p>When Into the Unjust lands, you'll be delving underground as part of its new missions, and while you're down there, you'll encounter new Terminid enemies. You'll also be unable to call in your Super Destroyer for support, so it's just you and your team against whatever horrors lurk in the tunnels.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-dragonroach.jpg?itok=3qM2rmN3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-dragonroach.jpg?itok=58pzFwQz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>will introduce new enemies and more in its Into the Unjust update.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Arrowhead, the update's new Terminid enemies will "burrow underground" and begin moving towards you when they detect you. Once they're close enough, they'll emerge from the ground and launch a surprise attack.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to encounter new enemies like the Dragonroach, a flying enemy that zeroes in on you and spits bile at you once it spots you. As if&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s existing flying enemies weren't already annoying enough to deal with.</p>

<p>New mission types will be added as part of Into the Unjust, too; one has you escorting a mobile oil rig and defending it from Terminid attacks, for instance, while delving underground will see you tasked with destroying the Hive Lung to stop the ever-encroaching Gloom.</p>

<p>You can check out a developer deep dive on the Into the Unjust update right here. It should give you a bit more info on what you're up against.</p>




<p>Following the release of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-halo-3-odst-warbond" rel="nofollow">first Legendary Warbond</a>&nbsp;(which also happens to be a <em>Halo 3: ODST </em>crossover) today, a new Dust Devils Premium Warbond has also been announced.</p>

<p>It comes complete with new weapons, including the AR-2 Coyote assault rifle, the S-11 Speargun, and the MS-11 Solo Silo stratagem, as well as new armor, new capes, and plenty more. It's launching just two days after Into the Unjust on September 4th.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/helldivers-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[This Lenovo Laptop (12GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Office 365) Is 85% Off, Amazon Clears Inventory for Summer’s End]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-lenovo-laptop-12gb-ram-512gb-ssd-office-365-is-85-off-amazon-clears-inventory-for-summers-end-2000620309</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With Amazon’s <em>Back to School</em> discounts currently in full swing, there’s one notebook that looks almost too good to be true: the <strong>2025</strong> <strong>Lenovo IdeaPad 15.6″</strong> with a solid mid-range spec (12GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Intel Celeron N4500, Office 365 for one year, Windows 11 Home) for a record low price. Amazon is likely clearing out old inventory, likely without making a single penny in profit, and that makes you the beneficiary of a deal that’s too great to pass up.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3723/">computer usually costs around $2,400 but today Amazon reduced its price to as low as $349</a>: That’s an 85% discount, and<strong> you’ll be saving around two thousand dollars on a brand-new computer</strong>. You’re spending less than most individuals spend on a smartphone at this price point, but you’re receiving a full Windows computer bundled with a one-year subscription of Microsoft Office 365.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3723/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Student Laptop</h2>
<p>Specs do matter, even in a budget-friendly machine, and this Lenovo is far from stripped down: It’s <strong>powered by an Intel Celeron N4500 processor.</strong> Although it’s not for serious gaming, it’s perfectly suited to day-to-day productivity tasks such as word processing, spreadsheets and streaming television shows. The inclusion of 12GB of DDR4 RAM is a difference-maker: multitasking is so much more responsive than the 4GB or 8GB of memory you typically find in this price category.</p>
<p>A fast <strong>512GB PCIe SSD</strong> gives you speed and space which means Windows boots in a flash, programs load in a flash and still having space for a large collection of school work, work documents, or entertainment media. In addition to the SSD, there’s also a <strong>secondary 128GB eMMC</strong> that gives you additional space to work with light files or backups.</p>



<p>The 15.6-inch HD display features anti-glare coating so your eyes don’t get as tired during extended study sessions. Paired with Dolby Audio dual speakers, you’ll enjoy more immersion when streaming or Zoom calls. You even receive a built-in HD 720p camera with a privacy shutter which is surprisingly rare on laptops in this price range.</p>
<p>Connectivity is also a plus point: <strong>USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, an SD card reader, and an audio combo jack</strong> are all present and give you all the ports you’ll need to have accessories and external storage easily attached. <strong>Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2</strong> are integrated within so wireless speed and dependability are on tap for both online classes and easy Netflix streaming.</p>
<p>Discounts this intense rarely stick, and since Amazon is clearly liquidating excess stock, make sure you don’t miss it.</p>
