			<p>Once upon a time, there was the <strong>MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) Golden Age</strong>. During those years, some of the largest and most renowned gaming studios were willing to make massive investment bets in the development of new MMO games, easily justifying them with the genre's burgeoning popularity.</p>



<p>After the pioneering times of classics like Ultima Online, EverQuest, and Dark Age of Camelot, it was the arrival of Blizzard's <strong>World of Warcraft</strong> that truly turned the interest of many millions of players toward the genre. Until its launch, the most popular games had peaked at between 250,000 and 500,000 subscribers; World of Warcraft immediately attracted millions of fans, eventually reaching its peak of <strong>over 12 million subscribers</strong> in 2010, toward the end of the Wrath of the Lich King expansion.</p>



<p>Between 2005 and 2014, the release schedule saw the debut of many big-budget MMO games made by Western developers: The Matrix Online, The Lord of the Rings Online, Vanguard: Saga of Heroes, Age of Conan, Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning, Champions Online, Star Trek Online, DC Universe Online, RIFT, Star Wars: The Old Republic, Guild Wars 2, The Secret World, Defiance, Neverwinter, Wildstar, and The Elder Scrolls Online.</p>



<p>These projects often leveraged massive entertainment franchises and large budgets to try to carve out a sizable slice of World of Warcraft's dominant market share. RIFT, one of two games on this list that publicly reported having a peak subscriber base of over one million players at some point, reportedly cost $50 million to develop. The other game is Star Wars: The Old Republic, on which Electronic Arts is believed to have invested a budget of around $200 million between the license, highly expensive fully voiced questlines for each character class, and other expenses.</p>



<p>None of these games could quite replicate the level of success seen with World of Warcraft, though. While Guild Wars 2, The Elder Scrolls Online, and (to a lesser extent) Star Wars: The Old Republic and The Lord of the Rings Online are still going strong, Blizzard's game remains the most popular Western MMO even twenty-one years after its release.</p>



<p>More to the point of this article, following that decade of unbridled investment, Western developers have started looking elsewhere to other genres. <strong>After The Elder Scrolls Online, it took seven years before another Western-made MMO launched into the market</strong>. I'm talking about New World, of course. It was the tip of the spear of Amazon's investment into gaming; powered by a massive budget, the game's mere existence drew the eyes of countless long-suffering fans of the genre who had been yearning to play a new triple-A MMO game for a very long time.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/New-World-Key-Art-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>When it launched in late 2021, New World was the first triple-A MMO game made by a Western studio to release in seven years.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>That led to an early success. The game neared a peak of one million concurrent players on Steam, causing long server queues and prompting even Amazon owner Jeff Bezos to <a href="https://wccftech.com/jeff-bezos-praises-amazon-games-for-its-first-success-with-new-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">congratulate the team</a>. New World suffered from a severe lack of content, though, which soon meant players had little to do and stopped logging in.</p>



<p>However, even before the launch of New World, Amazon already had another major project underway: a new MMO based on J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. This game, first <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-working-f2p-lord-of-the-rings-mmorpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in July 2019, was part of Amazon's larger strategy on the IP: Bezos himself, a known fan of LOTR, had previously given Amazon Studios the mandate to acquire the television rights from the Tolkien Estate, which they successfully obtained in November 2017 (to eventually produce Rings of Power). Between the game and the Prime Video show, Amazon hoped to rival and potentially even exceed the Game of Thrones phenomenon.</p>



<p>From the point of view of MMO fans, a new LOTR game by Amazon seemed like the perfect combination to reignite interest in the genre. What better universe than the setting that defined Western fantasy, and what better developer than one with such wealthy coffers? While the 2007 game originally crafted by Turbine has a niche charm that still keeps it alive to this day thanks to its loyal fans, this new project's potential was far grander, even if only to leave behind the dated tech that LOTRO is built upon.</p>



<p>Contractual disputes between Amazon and Tencent <a href="https://wccftech.com/lord-of-the-rings-mmo-canceled-due-to-contractual-dispute-between-tencent-and-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">led to the cancellation of the project in April 2021</a>, but that was not the end of the story. Two years later, Amazon <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-once-again-in-production-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was able to reach another agreement with the Embracer Group</a>, restarting development on The Lord of the Rings MMO. At the time, Amazon Games VP Christoph Hartmann <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-will-be-very-different-from-new-world-will-use-a-next-gen-version-of-its-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a>: </p>



<p><em>We're determined to build the best possible The Lord of the Rings MMO and something that the franchise's millions of fans all over the world will truly love.</em></p>



<p>The goal, they said, was to apply the lessons learned from New World to the new game. But a few weeks ago, Amazon closed down its internal studios, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sunsetting New World</a> (just when it was improving) and effectively <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelling LOTR, too</a>. Just like that, once again, there is no publicly known triple-A Western MMO in development (with the exception of Riot's project, which may or may not ever release, according to the developers themselves).</p>



<p>Die-hard aficionados of massively multiplayer online games took the news hard, and heated discussions surrounding the genre's long-debated final demise, at least as far as Western developers are concerned, filled Reddit, social media, forums, and the like.</p>



<p>Shortly after the news, I started reaching out to several industry veterans to get their perspective on the real state of affairs. In this unique interview, you'll read how each of them responds to the same questions, providing different viewpoints on the issues with their insights.</p>



<p>The first one is <strong>Greg Street</strong>. Street's career in the gaming industry spans nearly thirty years; he has worked on several Age of Empires games, then moved to Blizzard, where he contributed to World of Warcraft at its peak, followed by work on League of Legends and a brief stint on the League of Legends MMO. More recently, he founded Fantastic Pixel Castle to make a new MMO codenamed Ghost, which I <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-mmorpg-qa-ex-wow-designer-opens-up-on-every-aspect-of-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussed with him exactly two years ago</a>. However, after getting the initial funding from NetEase, the studio was recently shut down.</p>



<p>The second is <strong>Rich Vogel</strong>. A genre pioneer with his work on the very first 3D graphical MMORPG, Meridian 59, he later worked on Ultima Online, Star Wars Galaxies, Star Wars: The Old Republic, and, for a while, on the MMO-adjacent Fallout 76. Like Street, he founded a new studio, T-Minus Zero Entertainment, with the help of NetEase in 2023, when I <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-qa-neteases-latest-aaa-team-plans-ambitious-things-never-before-seen-in-online-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed him</a>. Like Fantastic Pixel Castle, T-Minus Zero also got its funding cut, although a group of developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-returns-dead-fantastic-pixel-castle-announces-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resurrected it</a>.</p>



<p>The third one is <strong>Scott Hartsman</strong>, who worked as Technical Director on EverQuest I and II and later as Executive Producer on EverQuest II, although most people will know him as the General Manager and CEO of Trion Worlds, the company behind RIFT, Defiance, and other games. More recently, he has served as an advisor to multiple companies, including NCSOFT West. I'd like to thank them all for their willingness to chime in with their thoughts and analysis.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Greg-Street-Ghostcrawler-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Greg Street: 'It's just a really challenging genre to fund, especially in this market where hardly any deals are getting made. Publishers love the thought of a steady income stream for a decade, but they get nervous about the cost to commit to a content-based live service game vs., say, a PvP game. (The PvP games flop all the time as well, but at least the live service commitment is lower.)<br></em><br><em>So, then you play this game of: if you don't innovate enough, you won't attract players who already have an MMO like WoW, Guild Wars, or Final Fantasy, let alone newer players who have rejected the genre as old and stuffy. But if you innovate too much, you may not appeal to the core MMO gamer, and there is no guarantee you will appeal to the newer gamer either.'</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The news that Amazon has cut its entire MMO division, sunsetting New World and cancelling its upcoming project based on The Lord of the Rings, has been taken particularly badly by genre fans, who had hoped that the combination of a big-budget game and a beloved IP might spark a renaissance of sorts. Do you agree that it's a bad omen, even for other industry players who might have been looking into making an MMORPG in the coming years? Are MMORPGs really dead in the Western world? If so, why, and what would it take to revive them?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Greg Street:</strong> I don't think MMOs are dead in the West. It's just a really challenging genre to fund, especially in this market where hardly any deals are getting made. Publishers love the thought of a steady income stream for a decade, but they get nervous about the cost to commit to a content-based live service game vs., say, a PvP game. (The PvP games flop all the time as well, but at least the live service commitment is lower.)</p>



<p>So, then you play this game of: if you don't innovate enough, you won't attract players who already have an MMO like WoW, Guild Wars, or Final Fantasy, let alone newer players who have rejected the genre as old and stuffy. But if you innovate too much, you may not appeal to the core MMO gamer, and there is no guarantee you will appeal to the newer gamer either. The basic problem is that it's hard to start small with an MMO. You have to commit to a lot of systems and content to make it work. There are some notable exceptions, like Warframe, which started small and grew into an MMO.</p>



<p><strong>Rich Vogel:</strong> Over the past few years (<em>ed: following the overstaffing that occurred during the pandemic</em>), the gaming industry has undergone a significant market correction, characterized by large layoffs and project cancellations. Amazon, like other game publishers, needs to evaluate its portfolio and manage its risks. MMORPGs are costly to develop, launch, and support. Their core development team is based in California, which is known as one of the most expensive places in the world for game development. Therefore, given current market conditions, I don't see the cancellation of those MMORPGs as a bad sign. I see it as a strategic business decision to focus on other, less expensive projects with a lower ROI (return on investment) risk.</p>



<p>I don't believe MMORPGs are dead. Several MMORPGs that were developed over 10 years ago still have large communities and maintain a solid, sustainable business model. Good examples include Destiny, Guild Wars, ESO, and Fallout 76. Classics like WOW and SWTOR still have active communities as well. A key reason for their ongoing success is that they have evolved. Destiny, for instance, introduced Strikes, which allow players to complete 20-minute missions and enjoy gaming with friends for short periods, rather than the major time sinks required to keep up with others. Fallout 76 is another great example; it has become much easier to play and progress with friends. The team transformed the game from its original version, which felt like an abandoned world (no NPCs), to what players expected a Fallout game to be (filled with NPCs with quirky dialogue). The TV series also significantly boosted the player base. Now, Fallout 76 <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-update-now-live-adding-the-ghoul-from-the-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is embracing the series and adding similar content to the game</a>. I believe that players will come if an MMORPG is easy to get into, designed as a mid-core game, and offers fun gameplay that does not require a huge time investment.</p>



<p>Look at the recent launch of Dune: Awakening. It attracted many players to try it, but it <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-announces-layoffs-despite-dune-awakening-being-biggest-release-in-32-year-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could not maintain its original player numbers</a> because it was hardcore in terms of PVP and required a significant time investment. In my opinion, it is a hardcore game that heavily draws on the legacy of Anarchy Online, which caused substantial churn in the first six months after launch. But even that game has a solid core base to sustain itself. Many players who previously played RUST are still playing the game.</p>



<p><strong>Scott Hartsman:</strong> Withdrawals and shutdowns like that are certainly not a sign of anything good, and I do know a number of very solid folks over there whose game I would have loved to have seen come out. That said, I wouldn't read too much into it industry-wide. It's really hard to make an MMO or live games focused business scale to the level that it would have had to be in order to be considered a big hit at Amazon Scale. I think you'd most likely have to hit a WoW or LoL level of success to hit that bar. As an industry, if you include all live games, we make about one generational success every 18 months. When their initial games didn't hit that bar, and they didn't see a clear path to that world, we get what just happened. I don't think we should take it as an indicator of anything bad for the kinds of companies that have realistic expectations of what success means in our corner of games.</p>



<p>What we're seeing is more of what you'd call a reversion to the mean, in an environment where the most popular massive and live games being played average 10-13 years old. There's already a ton to play, in a world where these games just don't ever end, and people are still loving games that have existed for a long time. Smaller teams (independent and mid-size) getting entertaining and novel games, being able to take risks -- That's the kind of thing that's going to continue to thrive. It's not that the genre is dead or failing; it's that what success looks like has changed over the years. And the ones pursuing the old definition (massive money in, massive money required out) are going to keep getting bitten.</p>



<p><strong>Asian developers, who continue to invest in the genre, often launch their MMOs on mobile platforms as well. Considering that the mobile segment is the only one showing actual growth in the industry, is that a necessary compromise for big studios to make if they want to invest in a triple-A experience?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Greg Street:</strong> I am more familiar with the market in China than elsewhere in Asia, but they are also worried about player fatigue on MMOs. They still launch more of them than publishers in the West do, but they have been declining (even if gaming as a whole is growing), and there have also been some spectacular failures. Korean publishers still seem to be interested in MMOs, though they are tightening their belts like everyone.</p>



<p><strong>Rich Vogel:</strong> Mobile games in Asia have surpassed PC games in popularity. Most of these titles attract a mid-core audience. I believe that with the latest phones and the shift of console manufacturers toward creating mobile gaming systems, we will see an increase in mobile gaming. This presents a great opportunity for developers to focus on creating multiplayer games for mobile. While Asia has a head start in developing mid-core mobile games, I believe the West will catch up before the end of this decade. I see developers creating AA and AAA mid-core games for all platforms, enabling cross-platform play. I don't see developers focusing solely on PC and console games in the future. Therefore, I can easily imagine developers making MMORPG-lite games for all platforms that appeal to mid-core players.</p>



<p><strong>Scott Hartsman:</strong> I do agree that having some extra advantage is a strategy that'd be wise if someone's going in big like the old ways. Whether that's mobile, simultaneous global on all possible platforms, or some other big lever -- Having something that potentially impactful would certainly be important.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/rich-vogel-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Rich Vogel: 'I believe that games with open-world PVE sandboxes that are heavily system-based and provide more emergent player-driven content are more engaging. I envision a bright future for developers creating a lightweight MMORPG targeting a mid-core audience, featuring an open-world and system-driven design that spans all platforms. I believe a well-made fantasy MMORPG that isn't too hardcore and targets a midcore player base could catch up if it can scale in players and content.'</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Outside of MMORPGs, gamers have been getting more accustomed lately to harsh experiences where you die a lot (Soulslike games) and even possibly lose your hard-earned loot (extraction games). Could that pave the way for more sandbox MMO-like experiences, loosely inspired by Ultima Online and its ilk, which would place less focus on expensive cinematics and storylines and more on emergent, player-driven content? There is one game that has had some success in this niche, albeit on a small scale: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/761890/Albion_Online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Albion Online</a>. Do you think it could be replicated on a larger scale?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Greg Street:</strong> I agree that if MMOs aren't challenging enough, there is less satisfaction in playing and certainly less need to cooperate with other players. I don't personally think pure sandbox is the answer, or you would see the modern attempts be super successful. Too often, the sandbox experience is conflated with either PvP or "go find your own fun." I think the way forward is a hybrid, where you still give players direction and a story, but it requires more strategy on the part of the player than just grinding instances that they have all memorized or doing the same daily quests over and over.</p>



<p><strong>Rich Vogel:</strong> Those games-as-a-service games, like Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders, are PvP games. They hit a different target audience than MMORPGs. PVP players are tolerant of hardcore mechanics. I believe that games with open-world PVE sandboxes that are heavily system-based and provide more emergent player-driven content are more engaging. I envision a bright future for developers creating a lightweight MMORPG targeting a mid-core audience, featuring an open-world and system-driven design that spans all platforms. I believe a well-made fantasy MMORPG that isn't too hardcore and targets a midcore player base could catch up if it can scale in players and content. </p>



<p><strong>Scott Hartsman:</strong> Absolutely. The original sandboxes were well ahead of their time in a lot of ways. Not entirely unlike the way D&amp;D and Magic: TG started out as these niche, nerdy hobbies. Over time, more people get on board with those kinds of experiences. Sandboxes are an entirely different kind of experience, but I'd say they're on a similar track. Theme parks introduced a massive number of people to MMOs and live games in general. Globally playing with friends and making new ones across the world used to be this freakish thing only for the hardest of the hardcore. Now it's just called "games." The step that comes after that is more freedom, more variety. Sandboxes and survival are a huge fit there. More people are absolutely getting more interested in that, as we've seen over the past half-decade or so, both as players and developers, especially across the indie and AA scene.</p>



<p>I'm not an Albion Online expert, but they're clearly succeeding in a niche, and that's fantastic. To me, that's an exciting part of how MMOs have evolved: if you can find a niche and serve it well, you can have a healthy business that runs potentially forever, which is great for both players and developers.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Scott-Hartsman-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Scott Hartsman: 'It's on us to figure out how to deliver the kind of entertainment that an audience large enough to sustain us is looking to play. In some cases, that may mean finding a way to succeed with a smaller audience (i.e. Niche Worlds Cult's Monsters &amp; Memories). In other cases, it may mean adapting the definition of what an MMO is and how we choose to express our worlds and systems. I don't think that's bad for MMOs at all. It's all about finding our players and serving them. After all, they're the ones we're doing this all for.'</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Do you believe there are still enough players potentially interested in an MMORPG, or is that just a pipe dream, given that the older generation has way less time and the new generation is taken in by other genres?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Greg Street:</strong> Our data suggests that Western players are very interested in trying new MMOs, and if you look at some of the launches in the past 5 years, they do try them out. They just don't stick with them long if there isn't enough content, especially at the endgame.</p>



<p><strong>Rich Vogel:</strong> Yes, I believe a large audience is waiting for the right MMORPG to emerge. Consider the millions of players who have played and continue to play WOW, SWTOR, ESO, UO, EverQuest, Fallout 76, and others. The problem is that no publisher is willing to invest the money and take the risk at this time. My instinct tells me that the next major MMORPG will likely come from Asia and/or Europe. If what I have been hearing about GTA 6's features and gameplay is true, it could evolve into an MMORPG, as many of its planned features are typically found in MMORPGs.</p>



<p><strong>Scott Hartsman:</strong> I think it's not as much about having less time, it's more about giving people more control over their time. It's a similar dynamic to what you see with streaming: watch an 8-hour movie? Are you crazy? Watch 16 half-hour episodes in a row? Absolutely! We need to adapt to what people want to engage with.</p>



<p>Contrast that with the original MMOs: a 4-8 hour dungeon crawl, sitting in one place, waiting 15-20 minutes at a time for respawns? Sure, some people might still enjoy that. But that number only goes down over time. Not the number who are interested in being entertained. It's one of the reasons that you see Path of Exile continuing to grow and hit new records a decade after launch, while more classic MMOs stagnated. It did that even with a relatively harsh loss penalty (especially if you're casual). People are okay with challenge, they're even okay with loss, and it turns out they're also phenomenally okay with grinding and random chances on loot. Some of them are even okay with permadeath. A lot of those elements overlap with the harshest of MMOs. People just want the package those elements are wrapped up into to be more aligned with how they're looking to experience them.</p>



<p>It's on us to figure out how to deliver the kind of entertainment that an audience large enough to sustain us is looking to play. In some cases, that may mean finding a way to succeed with a smaller audience (i.e. Niche Worlds Cult's <a href="https://monstersandmemories.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monsters &amp; Memories</a>). In other cases, it may mean adapting the definition of what an MMO is and how we choose to express our worlds and systems. I don't think that's bad for MMOs at all. It's all about finding our players and serving them. After all, they're the ones we're doing this all for.</p>

              <p>At a hotel in China that reportedly specializes in catering to gamers and esports competitors, staff claim to have found a disgusting mess left behind by a man who stayed there for two years.</p> <p><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/15653824/grim-video-hotel-guest-leaves-room-stomach-churning-mess/">As first reported by <em>The Sun</em></a> and then spotted by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/guest-from-hell-leaves-hotel-room-a-disgusting-mess-after-two-year-gaming-marathon-3296126/"><em>Dexerto</em></a>, a man believed to be an avid gamer checked out of his hotel room after two years. And during that time, it seems no cleaning staff had ever been allowed in because when employees entered the room, they discovered mountains of trash and a disgusting toilet surrounded by used toilet paper. <em>The Sun</em> reports that staff called the man a “guest from Hell.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Grim vid shows hotel guest from hell leave room in stomach-churning state <a href="https://t.co/GwT0sWJo2d">pic.twitter.com/GwT0sWJo2d</a></p> <p>— The Sun (@TheSun) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSun/status/2001548703564226963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Staff say a thick layer of brown grime had built up on the floor in the hotel room, and the gamer’s sparse furniture was buried in trash that, in some areas, was nearly three feet deep. During his two-year stint in the hotel, employees claim he rarely left the room, with staff telling the outlet that many didn’t know what he looked like because he spent so much time in his disgusting little gamer hole.</p>

 <p><em>The Sun’s</em> report sharing the details and photos of the hard-to-look-at hotel room mess doesn’t provide too many specific details about the location, the guest, or precisely when this happened. But I’ll never forget where I was when I first laid eyes on that toilet.</p> <p>It reportedly took three days to clean out the hotel room after the man left, and it will take more renovations and repairs to make the place rentable once more. The guest apparently still owes 10 days’ worth of fees, amounting to around $400. So the next time you look at your gamer room and feel gross about an empty can or a leftover wrapper, you can at least remind yourself that you aren’t as bad as the person behind this awful gamer-related hotel disaster. But still, pick that crap up.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-killed-concord-again-after-fans-tried-to-bring-it-back-to-life/">Before Concord</a>, there was <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-redfall-refunds/">Redfall</a>. Two games that you could argue were similarly fated from the beginning, though at least in the case of Redfall, it got to stick around <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/">for longer than two weeks</a>. Both were major flops for their respective first-party publishers, both games got their respective studios shut down, and both games walked the same line of 'fine and forgettable.'</p>



<p>That's not to say the loss of Arkane Austin and Firewalk Studios is on equal footing. It was far more devastating to see Arkane Austin go, as that was another case of a studio with a talented team that was good at making single-player games <a href="https://wccftech.com/redfall-development-was-reportedly-plagued-by-understaffing-and-confusing-direction/">being forced to change the makeup of their team and try something entirely new</a>. All while still trying to make it an 'Arkane Austin' game, whatever that was supposed to mean in the form of a kind of game Arkane Austin had never made before.</p>



<p>If Arkane Austin had stuck around, the video game industry would be a better place, and for that to have happened, Redfall needed to survive, and potentially, even thrive. According to the game's director, Harvey Smith, there might've been a path to that.</p>



<p>While speaking on the <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console/episodes/harvey-smith-game-director-deus-ex-dishonored-redfall">My Perfect Console podcast</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deus-ex-designer-former-arkane-studio-director-reflects-on-closure-redfall-disastrous-launch">Eurogamer</a>), Smith claimed that if Redfall's final update, <a href="https://wccftech.com/redfall-offline-mode-coming-one-final-update/">which was update 1.4</a>, was the version that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/redfall-dishonored-meets-far-cry/">the studio actually launched with in 2023</a>, then Arkane Austion's fate might've "<em>been a different story</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>It was a shock</em>," Smith began on the decision to close the studio. "<em>It was not a decision I agreed with. I did believe very much in the future of the studio, we were working on something super cool.</em>" Smith goes on to describe the 1.4 update as a "<em>huge upgrade to the game</em>," and said, "<em>If we had launched with that and then built from there it might have been a different story</em>." According to Smith, the 1.4 update was as close as the studio was able to get to their full vision for the game.</p>



<p>Beyond saving Redfall, if Arkane Austin had gotten the chance to stick around, we might've even gotten a Blade Runner game from them, according to Smith. "<em>We were working for a while on a Blade Runner game, which was super exciting to me. What we could have done with Blade Runner...</em>"</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Leaker Wanted To ‘Ruin’ Harry Potter Surprise Because J.K. Rowling’s A Transphobe]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/fortnite-harry-potter-skins-leak-jk-rowling-transphobia-2000654659</link>
            <guid>1387681</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>’s crossover slop has now spread to engulf the Wizarding World as Epic’s inescapable battle royale is gearing up to add cosmetics based on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-review-harry-potter-rowling-transphobia-1850127849"><i><span>Harry Potter</span></i></a><span>. The game has become such a worldwide phenomenon that there are plenty of leak accounts on social media routinely posting about upcoming collaborations, but the account that leaked the </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>skins had a different motive than simply informing people, as they have stated they “spoiled” the surprise in protest of it inclusion because of </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>author J.K. Rowling’s transphobic rhetoric.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Rowling has been a vocal figurehead in the fight against trans rights </span><a href="https://theweek.com/feature/1020838/jk-rowlings-transphobia-controversy-a-complete-timeline"><span>over the past few years</span></a><span>, and it’s made buying and supporting </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>and its various movies, video games, and spin-offs harder for fans and trans supporters, though it hasn’t stopped </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-harry-potter-slytherin-house-jk-rowling-1850305177"><i><span>Hogwarts Legacy</span></i></a> <span>from racking up over </span><a href="https://x.com/HogwartsLegacy/status/2001336625847243153"><span>40 million sales</span></a><span> since its launch in 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>So when it was confirmed that </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>content was coming to </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>, some fans of both </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> had to wrestle with whether or not they want to support the crossover, or the game more broadly. Fortnite Underground, a </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>leaker who </span><a href="https://x.com/FNBRunderground/status/2000583138209100108?s=20"><span>leaked the </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>collaboration</span></a><span>, has posted a lengthy explanation on X about why they chose to post about it ahead of its official announcement, saying they wanted to “ruin” the surprise in an act of protest and that </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>once “stood for what was right.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Most people won’t care,” they wrote. “These Outfits will probably sell pretty well, most people will be happy to see one of their favorite childhood franchises come to the game, and Epic Games and J.K. Rowling will make plenty of money.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But I’m not okay with that, and I hope you’re not okay with it either.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Opinion – I was the leaker who spoiled Harry Potter coming to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fortnite?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Fortnite</a>. Here's why ⬇️ </p> <p>Last year, Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling claimed that Imane Khelif, a female boxer, was actually born as a man. There's just one issue: they weren't. There's been a sentiment around this… <a href="https://t.co/tzKv18jYeK">pic.twitter.com/tzKv18jYeK</a></p> <p>— Fortnite Underground (@FNBRunderground) <a href="https://twitter.com/FNBRunderground/status/2001447614466691338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>Fortnite Underground signs off saying they wanted to spoil the collaboration in hopes that “less people would buy it,” but many of the responses argue that any kind of discussion promotes it in some way. Maybe their bringing attention to Rowling’s views could start some much-needed conversations in the </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> community, though you also have a bunch of transphobic nonsense in the replies, with people claiming they’ll buy the </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>cosmetics as a counter protest. Do yourself a favor and avoid the responses to their post.</span></p>

This has caused some to have to scramble to find childcare and pet care arrangements that were previously not needed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mandatory overtime is in service of finishing an internal demo in time for a review by Sony, after said demo missed multiple deadlines. Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet does not currently have a public release date or window set, but Bloomberg's report suggests internally it is targeting mid-2027.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The report concludes that the mandated overtime ended this week, and Naughty Dog will return to just three days a week mandated in-office ithrough the end of January, with a more detailed schedule to come.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Naughty Dog has been notorious for crunch over the years on series such as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/were-definitely-at-the-point-where-somethings-gotta-give" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncharted</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/as-naughty-dog-crunches-on-the-last-of-us-ii-developer-1842289962" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Last of Us</a>, with the studio even openly hiring for individuals who would be willing to crunch. In 2021, studio co-presidents Evan Wells and Neil Druckmann addressed the issue in an <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2021/08/28/naughty-by-nature-naughty-dog-leadership-reflects-on-the-studios" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Game Informer</a>, saying that while they wanted to prevent burnout, they didn't want to impose a one-size-fits-all restriction on employee passion and creativity. That same year, the studio <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-07-22/sony-s-naughty-dog-video-game-studio-finally-has-a-team-of-producers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hired a number of producers</a> specifically tasked with alleviating workload. However, many of those producers have reportedly since left the company, and some employees have apparently already worked long hours to finish Intergalactic's first trailer, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-heads-to-space-with-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-the-game-awards-2024">debuted at The Game Awards last year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Druckmann has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-naughty-dogs-most-expansive-and-maybe-the-most-expensive-game-the-studio-has-ever-made">referred to Intergalactic</a> as the most "ambitious" "expansive" and "expensive" game Naughty Dog has ever made.

<p>However, she said she was and remains concerned that Tomb Raider could fall apart, given that Perfect Dark was canceled. "I just felt so relieved that I still had Lara, but I also felt really frightened about losing Lara. I'm still frightened of losing Lara," she said.</p><p>Wilton-Regan also shared new insight into what happened with Perfect Dark and how she felt about the game's shuttering and the closure of developer The Initiative.</p><p>"I was as shocked, surprised, and devastated as everyone else was when the funding was pulled, and the studio was closed," Wilton-Regan said. "I did not see it coming. I was absolutely blindsided when the project was defunded."</p><p>She said she was shooting scenes for Perfect Dark in 2023, 2024, and even in 2025 prior to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/" data-ref-id="1100-6532921">Microsoft's announcement in July 2025</a> that the project would not go forward.</p><p>"To my knowledge, we were pretty far along. I'd done entire chapters of this universe." She went on to say that it was her understanding that Microsoft was "really happy" with what the team at The Initiative had turned in up to that point.</p><p>GTA parent company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-almost-got-a-second-chance-at-take-two-report/1100-6534419/" data-ref-id="1100-6534419">Take-Two was said to have been involved in a potential purchase of Perfect Dark</a> to keep the project alive, but a deal did not materialize.</p><p>"That was the day I was really sad because that was the day I lost hope," Wilton-Regan said.</p><p>As for the new Tomb Raider games, a remake of the first game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-remake-will-be-easier-to-cater-for-modern-player-tastes/1100-6537071/" data-ref-id="1100-6537071">Legacy of Atlantis</a> is coming in 2026, with a brand-new game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-actor-shares-her-heartfelt-farewell-to-lara-croft/1100-6536958/" data-ref-id="1100-6536958">Catalyst</a>, set to release in 2027.</p>

Internally, we were having a blast playing it before release, and your reaction to the tech test in April gave us an inkling of what was to come. What we didn't count on was the sheer scale of love and passion you guys were going to show this game."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ARC Raiders - Flickering Flames Winter Event Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Arc Raiders, which was released in late October, became a smash hit right out of the gate, selling millions of copies within days and solidifying itself as one of the most-beloved multiplayer games of the year. Though many multiplayer games enjoy a surge of popularity that eventually relents, Arc Raiders has held on impressively long. As of this writing, its <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam numbers alone</a> are still in the six-digit realm.</p><p>Embark Studios seems intent to keep the ball rolling too. Arc Raiders has received consistent updates, addressing quality-of-life issues while simultaneously rolling out new features and even maps. The latest major update to the game, called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-the-arc-raiders-cold-snap-update/2900-7344/" data-ref-id="2900-7344">Cold Snap</a>, adds a new frosty map condition, in-game event, and more. It's just the first of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-reveals-new-map-in-november-quests-and-more-in-the-months-ahead/1100-6535859/" data-ref-id="1100-6535859">many significant updates</a> which the team has already outlined.</p><p>"We're here for the long term, to build a game that continues to excite and surprise - we hope you stick around for the journey," reads the blog post. In addition, Embark is doling out a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-has-free-raider-tokens-for-you-right-now/1100-6537077/" data-ref-id="1100-6537077">free 1,000 Raider tokens</a>, an in-game currency, to anyone who plays the Winter event before it ends on January 13th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Snow is falling, the chimney fire is blazing, and hot cocoa is brewing. Maybe that's happening for real in your life, or maybe you live in Florida like me and have to imagine these nice Winter scenarios because they don't exist here. Nonetheless, it's Winter here in the U.S., and that means it's time for the 2025 Steam Winter Sale, which went live today and lasts through January 5.&nbsp;</p><p>Though the sale just began, we're already seeing some deep discounts on some of 2025's biggest and best games. While you're free to peruse the sale yourself, your wallet might be afraid. It's dangerous to go alone, though, so pull up the Steam storefront with this handy dandy round-up while you shop.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/flotsam-impressions-review-city-builder/</link>
            <guid>1387657</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>A survival city-builder in broadly the same vein as stuff like <em>Frostpunk </em>and <em>Ixion</em>, <em>Flotsam</em> is a game set at the end of the world that, thanks to its vibrant art style and optimistic outlooks, actually feels more like the start of the world instead.</p><p>You play as a tug boat that poots around a flooded world, ala <em>Waterworld</em>, and as you go--on a kind of strategic overworld map--you need to scrounge for resources and pick up survivors. Zoom in, though, and the game becomes a city-builder, where you can attach buildings to your boat and use those resources to craft stuff, build <em>more </em>buildings and keep everyone happy by giving them nicer houses and places to hang out.</p><p>The cheery, hand-crafted visuals are a joy to be around. For an apocalyptic game, <em>Flotsam</em>'s glass is very much half-full, its flooded wastes featuring crystal-blue oceans, storybook islands and fantastic character art, while the survivor's chatter is mostly interested in everyone working together to build something new and communal from the wreckage. To give you an idea of just how cheery things are, here's the game's website:</p><blockquote>The world of Flotsam is a colorful and cheerful place. It’s about going on adventures, seeing the world and cleaning it up as you go. The sun is shining, the sky is clear and the ocean is calm… mostly at least.</blockquote><p>Does this change the way the game plays? Not really. Does it dictate the way I feel while playing it? Absolutely. As I've explained<a href="https://aftermath.site/town-to-city-pc-builder-cozy-impressions-review/"> <u>in my impressions of <em>Town To City</em></u></a>, I like these games because they let me build stuff, and I hate the stresses so many of them bring along for the ride. <em>Flotsam</em> has those stresses--you need to keep everyone fed and supplied with fresh water--but meeting those needs is so straightforward, and everyone looks and works so happily while they're in danger, that it never feels like a <em>crisis</em>.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/owkx83gyETY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Flotsam - Official Version 1.0 Launch Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>I should note that this isn't really a city-builder in the traditional sense. While you are definitely building a settlement around your boat, and it needs walkways and power and all that stuff, the overworld navigation is a place you spend a <em>lot </em>of time exploring, finding resources and picking up survivors. What's cool is that the two are linked; you cruise around a map screen where everything is abstract, but when you find something to explore, the view zooms into the boat-scaled view, and the objects that appeared as points on the map are now islands represented off the stern of your town, on which you can see your survivors clambering over and harvesting supplies.</p><p><em>Flotsam </em>has a more involved supply chain and production management slant than many of its peers, which I really enjoyed; the loop of harvesting raw resources from the overworld, then using your city to refine them and turn them first into processed resources, then <em>things</em>, is always satisfying. There are a ton of different materials and items, some you can only get by scrounging, others that can be grown and others that you have to craft, and it's an interesting challenge having to prioritise your survivors and various buildings to churn out exactly the things you need at any given time.</p><p>I said earlier in the year<a href="https://aftermath.site/4x-game-climate-capitalism-civilization-future/"> <u>that I'm tired of apocalyptic futures where humanity is resigned to living off scraps</u></a>, where the overriding themes are those of defeat and despair. <em>Flotsam's</em> optimism and resolve to build something <em>new</em> from the ashes are exactly what I was talking about; the fact it's a game where you're directly responsible for the building only makes it better.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/4x-game-climate-capitalism-civilization-future/"><div><p>Give Me A Future Worth Fighting For - Aftermath</p><p>I want to build a better world, not live in the ruins</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The developer behind the slot machine-based indie game <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> has asked fans not to buy it on Xbox, and instead told <em>Kotaku</em> he wants people to<a href="https://kotaku.com/no-games-for-genocide-xbox-microsoft-boycott-palestine-2000650175"> boycott Microsoft due to the company continuing to support Israel</a> in its violent attacks against Palestine and its people.</p> <p>On December 18, <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> creator Dan DiIorio <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:n52jsewxgg2zp65ggprctppx/post/3mabikxrjz22q?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fkotaku.com%252Fwp%252Fwp-admin%252Fpost.php">reshared a post</a> about investigative games reporting outlet <em>People Make Games</em> boycotting Xbox due to its involvement in the Israel-Palestine conflict. The dev further added that he didn’t want people to buy the slot machine game on Xbox.</p>

 <p>“Please do not purchase<em> Luck Be a Landlord</em> on Xbox,” posted DiIorio. “I will be making a $10,000 donation to The Palestine Children’s Relief Fund to (hopefully) help offset the revenue the game has generated for Microsoft.”</p>   <p>Originally released in 2023, <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> is a roguelike slot machine game that helped inspire the creation of <em>Balatro</em>. In the game, players try to pay their rent using a slot machine that can be upgraded and tweaked. <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> first launched in 2023 on PC but was ported to consoles earlier this year.</p> <div id=":5b"> <p>“I would love for everyone to give what they can to <a href="https://nogamesforgenocide.com/">The Palestine Children’s Relief Fund</a>, whether they purchased the game on Xbox or not,” DiIorio told <em>Kotaku</em> via email.&nbsp; “I also encourage those with Game Pass subscriptions to cancel them.”</p> <p>DiIorio isn’t the first indie developer to publicly distance themselves from Xbox and vocally support the ongoing and growing boycott against the company. In April, the developers behind <em>Tenderfoot Tactics&nbsp;</em>pulled the game from the Xbox store in solidarity with the BDS campaign against Israel.</p> <p>“We hope that Microsoft will listen to the voices of their workers and customers and stop all business with the criminal Israeli military, which we have watched conduct an open genocide in Gaza over the last 18 months,” said one developer at the time on social media <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indie-developer-removes-their-game-from-xbox-stores-in-solidarity-with-pro-palestine-boycott">as reported by <em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun.</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>The boycott against Israel has continued to cause problems for Xbox and will likely do so moving forward into 2026.</p> </div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-crunch-trailer-2000654650</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last year, </span><i><span>The Last of Us </span></i><span>developer Naughty Dog released a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-grounded-making-of-documentary-1851196816"><span>documentary on the making of the game’s 2020 sequel</span></a><span> that attempted to discuss the studio’s reported problems with overwork and crunch. The video ended on a note indicating that things had improved, but it sounds like the team is facing a similar struggle with its upcoming PS5 game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-last-of-us-naughty-dog-1851721022"><i><span>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</span></i></a><span>.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/sony-s-naughty-dog-studio-orders-employee-overtime-on-intergalactic"><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i></a><span> reports that Naughty Dog has had developers working mandatory overtime as it races to complete a demo of the sci-fi action game for Sony to review, despite a planned release date that’s still years away.</span></p> <p><span>The mandatory overtime reportedly began in October, with staff being asked to work a minimum of eight extra hours a week and logging them on an internal spreadsheet. This was in an effort to get the game’s production back on track after several missed deadlines, though developers were also told not to work more than 60 hours a week.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>During this period, a new mandatory return-to-office order was also pushed through, requiring everyone to be onsite at the Santa Monica studio five days a week, rather than the typical three. According to </span><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i><span>’s sources, employees had to find “alternative care arrangements” for children and pets.</span></p>

 <p><span>This follows older reports that Naughty Dog had hired a new team of producers specifically meant to help alleviate the team’s crunch problems. But according to </span><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i><span>, several of them have already left the company. While select members of the team reportedly worked overtime to finish </span><i><span>Intergalactic</span></i><span>’s debut trailer back in 2024, this new overtime requirement has applied to “most” of the staff.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Management reportedly told workers the company will return to its usual three-day in-office requirement in January, with a more detailed breakdown coming after the team returns from holiday break. The </span><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i><span> story signs off with an ironic anecdote, saying the team was given metal coins to commemorate the game’s ongoing development, which included text of a quote from the game, “The suffering of generations must be endured to achieve our divine end.”</span></p> <p><span>Reports of Naughty Dog crunching date back years, with </span><i><span>The Last of Us Part II</span></i><span>’s development being </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/as-naughty-dog-crunches-on-the-last-of-us-ii-developer-1842289962"><span>one of the most notorious</span></a><span>. Back in 2023, Naughty Dog </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/naughty-dog-ps5-playstation-sony-last-us-part-3-layoffs-1850893794"><span>cut dozens of contractors</span></a><span> roughly a year before </span><i><span>Intergalactic </span></i><span>was announced at the 2024 Game Awards.</span></p>

    <div>
        
<p>Naughty Dog is forcing the developers working on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet to work overtime. This, according to a new report from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier.</p>



<p>In a story published on Thursday afternoon, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/sony-s-naughty-dog-studio-orders-employee-overtime-on-intergalactic?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NjA4NTY0MSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NjkwNDQxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0hDRFNLR0lGUEUwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.jGluGdyZVa1EEBKJKLlY2aRo0tCwewmOk2TBd_9y2Iw&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Schreier states</a> that the studio behind games like The Last of Us and Uncharted has <strong>“been pushing its staff to work long hours to get ready for an upcoming review of the demo by its parent company.”</strong></p>







<p>It’s said that requests began in October for staff to work at least eight extra hours per week with it being logged via spreadsheet. This was done to make up for time lost due to missed deadlines.</p>



<p><strong>“The employees were instructed not to work more than 60 hours a week,” </strong>Schreier writes. <strong>“Staff were also told to return to the office five days a week for this period, up from three previously, sending some employees scrambling to find alternative care arrangements for children and pets.”</strong></p>



<p>Those who spoke to Schreier under the condition of anonymity are worried that, if there’s already mandatory overtime over 18 months away from release, it might get worse in the coming months. As of writing, Intergalactic is scheduled to release in mid-2027. </p>



<p>Sony and Naughty Dog also declined to comment on the claims.</p>

                <p>A new report claims that Naughty Dog recently mandated that workers return to the office five days per week--up from three--and had been pushing staff to work "long hours" to get a demo of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> ready to show off to Sony higher-ups.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/sony-s-naughty-dog-studio-orders-employee-overtime-on-intergalactic?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NjA4NTY0MSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NjkwNDQxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0hDRFNLR0lGUEUwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.jGluGdyZVa1EEBKJKLlY2aRo0tCwewmOk2TBd_9y2Iw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg report</a> said that beginning in late October, Naughty Dog asked staff to work "a minimum of eight extra hours a week" and document their overtime in a spreadsheet. "This overtime period was an attempt to get the production back on track after several missed deadlines," the report said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItkWqN3nMHE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ItkWqN3nMHE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Workers were told to not work more than 60 hours per week, the report said. The return-to-office mandate was disruptive to some workers who reportedly had to find cover for childcare and their pets. The report added that the "mandated overtime" period wrapped up this week with the completion of the demo.</p><p>Sony and Naughty Dog declined to comment when approached by Bloomberg.</p><p>The report added that Naughty Dog established a new team of producers in 2021 with the directive of helping cut back on instances of extended overtime, or crunch. "Many" of these people have since left the company, the report said.</p><p>Finally, the report said Naughty Dog is aiming to release Intergalactic in mid-2027, and that workers are fearful that "overtime requirements will get worse" as the game's release draws closer.</p><p>On the topic of developers at Naughty Dog crunching, studio head Neil Druckmann said in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-2-director-on-crunch-theyre-gonna-w/1100-6478208/" data-ref-id="1100-6478208">June 2020 interview</a> with GQ, "They're gonna work very hard. We need to put some guardrails [in] so they don't injure themselves, but I don't think we could prevent them from working hard and still make the kind of games we make."</p><p>Naughty Dog co-president Evan Wells said in 2021 that its workers want to work more than 40 hours per week. Keeping people in the office only 40 hours a week "would frustrate people to no end," he said, adding that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-execs-push-back-against-unions-say-they-may-not-solve-crunch/1100-6495708/" data-ref-id="1100-6495708">unionization won't help.</a></p><p>Intergalactic is a new IP from Naughty Dog, which is notable given the company has mostly worked on sequels to its Uncharted and The Last of Us series for the past two decades. The sci-fi game aims to be Naughty Dog's "wildest, most creative story yet," and focuses on the character Jordan A. Mun, a bounty hunter who becomes stranded on a planet called Sempiria.</p><p>Naughty Dog has multiple internal development teams, and a second team could be working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">The Last of Us: Part III. </a></p>

                <p>Fortnite's latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-winterfest-2025-collabs-cosmetics-gameplay-changes-and-everything-else-to-know/2900-7362/" data-ref-id="2900-7362">Winterfest celebration</a> kicked off with the usual array of map and gameplay changes in Battle Royale and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-winterfest-2025-all-free-cosmetics-and-how-to-unlock-them/2900-7363/" data-ref-id="2900-7363">piles of free stuff in the Winterfest cabin</a>. But that's not all there is to care about in Fortnite's latest update--we've also got a pair of new sets of quests that reward XP, and an additional free cosmetic that must be earned by completing a specific one of those new quests. Let's take a look at what we've got here.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Winterfest_2025_quests">Winterfest 2025 quests</a><ul><li><a href="#Drop_1">Drop 1</a><ul><li><a href="#Collect_a_Perfect_Gift_from_a_chest">Collect a Perfect Gift from a chest</a></li><li><a href="#Bring_a_Perfect_Gift_to_any_character">Bring a Perfect Gift to any character</a></li><li><a href="#Damage_Yule_Trooper_or_any_other_boss__500_points_">Damage Yule Trooper or any other boss (500 points)</a></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Squad_Up__quests">Squad Up! quests</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Winterfest_2025_quests">Winterfest 2025 quests</h2><p>The first of these new quests sets, listed under Winterfest in your quest log, are for Battle Royale. There are four time-gated groups of this set of quests--the first group is available now, and the rest will be added every two days until they're all there. Completing a quest awards 12K XP each, and there may be a reward at the end of the questline--but we don't know for sure yet. These quests expire when Winterfest ends on January 5.</p><h3 id="Drop_1">Drop 1</h3><h4 id="Collect_a_Perfect_Gift_from_a_chest">Collect a Perfect Gift from a chest</h4><p>Every chest you open during Winterfest has a change to drop an item called Perfect Gift, which triggers a quest to deliver it to any non-hostile NPC on the map within five minutes. But for this quest, you just have to collect the item. Fortunately, the Perfect Gift does not require one of your inventory slots.</p><h4 id="Bring_a_Perfect_Gift_to_any_character">Bring a Perfect Gift to any character</h4><p>This quest requires you deliver one of these Perfect Gifts to an NPC. They all work, so pick whichever is most convenient.</p><h4 id="Damage_Yule_Trooper_or_any_other_boss__500_points_">Damage Yule Trooper or any other boss (500 points)</h4><p>You will need to cause 500 points of damage to any boss NPC for this one--and we mean the NPCs specifically. Players who have used a boss token to disguise themselves as bosses don't count for this.</p><h2 id="Squad_Up__quests">Squad Up! quests</h2><p>In addition to the main Winterfest quests, there's an additional set of very simple quests that simply require you to find Shiny Llamas in the Squads version of Battle Royale, Reload, OG, or Blitz. These Shiny Llamas have a random chance to drop any time you open a rare chest or supply drop, or when you defeat an enemy player or NPC. You'll receive 12K XP for every 100 of them that you collect, until you've collected 1,000 of them. You won't have to compete with your teammates for them, though, because any Shiny Llamas collected by any squad member counts for all four of you.</p><p>Which is good, because there's also a cosmetic reward for these quests. Collecting 400 of these Shiny Llamas will earn you the <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=11838" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Starbrite Slasher pickaxe</a>, which has been sitting in the Fortnite game files collecting dust for nearly two years. You'll want to pay particular attention to this quest if you purchased the Lego starter pack that includes the Brite Agent skin, since this is the first time it's been possible to get the pickaxe that belongs to her set.</p>

They could quit, but then they'd be looking for work in a terrible hiring environment, competing with their peers for a scant number of positions, many at companies also pushing for the use of generative AI. So they bite their tongue, grind their teeth, and muddle through, trying to make the most of a frustrating position.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many developers are put in this position by leaders who either haven't worked on a game for years or who come from strictly from an executive background. They are forced to watch as people who don't have to use these tools for complex tasks decide their fate. Vincke is the rare CEO who directs his company's games, but even with that perspective, his position as CEO fundamentally means he faces different day-to-day complexities than his employees.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And with the power to hire—and fire—workers, saying "no" to his demands is rather difficult.

How comfortable would you be pushing back against that?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even if you aren't an international hire, Larian's ability to implement such a strenuous test shows the strength it can exert over workers. And even if the game industry hadn't spent 3 years laying off thousands of developers, its reputation would make it a highly desirable place to work. And when you land a dream job like that, and management dictates you have to use a tool you have deep concerns over—of course that's going to breed frustration and resentment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those power dynamics create kindling for this kind of conflict to spark and</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">they're not unique to any particular company.

              <p>Developer Mark Ffrench has carved out something of a unique niche on Steam, regularly releasing fill-a-pix logic puzzle games of enormous scale and surprising depth. Among others in 2024 there was <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2024/11/proverbs/"><em>Proverbs</em></a>, a wall-sized puzzle based on Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s painting Netherlandish Proverbs, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3380760/2024_Mosaic_Retrospective/"><em>2024: Mosaic Retrospective</em></a>, which contained dozens of interlocking images recalling major events from the whole year. Following&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3444650/Mosaic_of_the_Strange/"><em>Mosaic of the Pharaohs</em></a> earlier this year, we now have the most elaborate entry yet:&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3444650/Mosaic_of_the_Strange/"><em>Mosaic of the Strange</em></a>—a game that combines the same logic puzzle conceit with a pixelated point-n-click adventure.</p> <p>Right, describing a logic puzzle is always the most stultifying and joy-destroying process, so please bear with me for a moment before we get back to the fun stuff:</p> <p>To get everyone on the same page, fill-a-pix is one of the many logic puzzle types to come from puzzle maestros <a href="https://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx">Conceptis</a>, where you fill in a grid based on&nbsp;<em>Minesweeper</em> rules. Each number in the grid indicates the number of cells that should be shaded in the three-by-three grid of which it sits in the center. So, a “6” on the side of a puzzle means all six cells are shaded, while a “0” in the middle means you can eliminate its nine cells from any overlapping clues. The more you play, the more familiar you become with certain patterns, such as the consequences of having a “6” and a “3” in two adjacent cells (you have to shade the three cells to the left of the 6, and eliminate the three to the right of the 3), and so many more besides. RIGHT, OK, WE’RE DONE.</p>

  <p>The way Ffrench implements this is by creating enormous mosaics that are segmented into individual puzzles, and rewarding completion of most with little pop-up information. In&nbsp;<em>Proverbs</em> it was details on each of the proverbs depicted in the vast painting. In&nbsp;<em>2024</em> it was details of the events of that year. But in&nbsp;<em>Mosaic of the Strange</em>, it’s all rather different. The details that pop up are documents, mostly about conspiratorial mysteries, because in this game you’re playing as FBI agents investigating a murder.</p>

 <p>Agents Cullen and Brady are called in after a body is found in gruesome condition, with the circumstances of the man’s death a crazed muddle of mysteries. And rather than solving multiple puzzles on a single wall, here the process of completing the grids is how you’re exploring the items in the rooms. OK, yes, it’s spurious. You’re not actually playing a point-n-click in the sense that you’re actually deducing anything, but with each item solved you gain a document pertaining to a peculiar subject, perhaps cryptids or UFOs or mysterious disappearances from lonely lighthouses, which all add up to evidence to stick up on the pinboard in your office. You also visit the coroner, the murder victim’s apartment, and elsewhere, with a total of 144 puzzles and documents to find.</p>

 <p>Various items prompt conversations between the characters, which makes what would otherwise be a more sterile puzzle game feel much more alive and in-depth, and the result is something absorbing both in narrative and in puzzling. Ffrench has nailed the way in which he delivers the challenges, with smart, context-sensitive hints if you want them, and a prompt that will pop up if you’ve gone too horribly wrong without noticing. Also, in this game, you can hugely change the difficulty of the puzzles in a way that I adore.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654620" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654620"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654620">© Mark Ffrench / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>You can make things so simple that you’re basically painting by numbers, or in increments make it so challenging that every puzzle is a head-scratching ordeal on the scale of <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2020/02/tametsi/"><em>Tametsi</em></a>. I’ve mostly settled on one notch down from the latter, but it’s fun to scale it up to the hardest point and really have to scour for every super-complex pattern of numbers. Even better, you can change that difficulty at any point, midway through solving any grid.</p> <p>OK, I completely nerded out there, but trust me, you’ve never played anything like&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3444650/Mosaic_of_the_Strange/"><em>Mosaic of the Strange</em></a>, and you’ll get&nbsp;<em>hours</em> of entertainment for your $12. I can’t wait to see what Ffrench does next, especially if these games continue to evolve in their current direction.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Coalition has given a brief but promising update on Gears of War: E-Day, which it claims is its ‘most ambitious’ title. While no release date has been announced for the prequel, it seems fans will have much to look forward to in 2026.</p>



<p>The Gears of War series, also known as Gears, has been going strong since 2006, almost 20 years ago. Following a ragtag group of soldiers, you’ll shoot (and chainsaw) your way through the parasitic Locust. With five titles, including a few spin-offs, the third-person shooter has become a staple for Xbox. While no sequel to 2019’s Gears 5 has been revealed, a prequel starring Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago, called Gears of War: E-Day, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-e-day-official-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced in 2024</a>. A 2026 launch is still on the books and, now, the team has provided some new comments on the anticipated title.</p>







<h2 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day-to-play-like-gears-but-play-like-new-says-developers">Gears of War: E-Day to “Play Like Gears, But Play Like New”, Says Developers</h2>

<iframe title="Gears of War: E-Day | Official Announce Trailer (In-Engine) - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EC20gLfUHeA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/18/xbox-bethesda-blizzard-activision-king-2025-games-thank-you/#gow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">year-end article from Xbox</a>, many of the teams of 2025’s biggest games, like The Outer Worlds 2 and South of Midnight, discussed them and what they are looking forward to in 2026. One of the interviewees was Mike Crump, Studio Head at The Coalition for Gears of War: Reloaded. Asked about what the studio is looking forward to the most in 2026, Crump said the following:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Next year marks the 20th anniversary of Gears of War, and we can’t think of a bigger way to celebrate than with the release of&nbsp;Gears of War: E-Day</strong>,” states Clump in the interview. “<strong>This is our most ambitious game yet, entirely built from scratch in Unreal Engine 5 to feel like Gears and play like new. This is a return to our roots as Marcus &amp; Dom face the Locust for the first time ever. It’s the best place to jump into the Gears universe and we can’t wait to share more next year.</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As mentioned before, Gears of War: E-Day is planning to release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-e-day-release-window-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sometime</a> in 2026. No gameplay or additional trailers have been released since 2024. Still, the team at The Coalition and People Can Fly seem adamant the game will live up to expectations. Seeing as Gears 5 was an ambitious title in the series, E-Day may be what fans have been waiting for.</p>

<p>Not all that detailed, eh? Hey ho, at least the additions sound interesting enough.</p>
<p>We had a good time with Fitness Boxing 3 when it punched its way onto Switch last year. While the music really got on our nerves, we stated that it "brings some much-needed variety to what could have been another by-the-numbers release with new songs and not much else" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/fitness-boxing-3-your-personal-trainer">our 7/10 review</a>.</p>

			<p>Studio Wildcard's latest ARK: Survival Ascended expansion, Lost Colony, is now out for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S players, as the latest expansion closes the gap between the stories of the previous Extinction expansion and the upcoming ARK 2, while adding a host of new creatures, seven new biomes, and more.</p>



<p>Lost Colony takes players to Arat Prime, where humanity made its final stand. You'll begin your journey in the Necrocene, a post-cataclysmic era that has plunged the entire southern pole of the Earth into darkness. It's here, beneath the snow, the ice, and under the shroud of night, where the Lost Colony continues to survive below its energy shields. </p>



<p>Energy shields that are powered by radioactive Red Element, which is also the source of what's keeping the Earth a broken planet. Which is how the Lost King wants to keep, to maintain his rule. It's then your choice to go the way of the lost king and succumb to his tyranny, or try to oppose him and hold on to your humanity.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>The release of this expansion rounds out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3720100/ARK_Lost_Colony_Expansion_Pass/">Lost Colony expansion pass</a> that Studio Wildcard announced and kicked off earlier this year, which was also when the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-gets-ps5-pro-patch-with-pssr-support-ue5-5-upgrade-and-10-year-anniversary/">received a major graphical update across consoles and PC</a>, including improvements that <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-2-higher-quality-proper-4k-120-fps/">took advantage of PlayStation's PSSR and PS5 Pro</a>.</p>



<p>Across the seven new biomes introduced, you'll experience the overwhelming and oppressive metropolis of the Lost King's domain, the arctic perimeter of the Tundra, the bioluminescent flowers and fauna of the Twilight Forest that's far more dangerous than it looks, the eerie Dark Forest that leads to even more dangers beyond what lurks in its woods. </p>



<p>There's also the Caldera, a volcanic crater with a massive sacred ring dedicated to the Lost King, hot springs which you'll find across the map in different concentrations, and aberrant crash sites where you'll have to avoid toxic sludge. So, cheery places all in all.</p>



<p>Across these new biomes you'll find 13 new creatures, which are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Veilwyn</li>



<li>Solwyn</li>



<li>Malwyn</li>



<li>Ossidon</li>



<li>Gloon</li>



<li>Desmodus</li>



<li>Cryolophosaurus</li>



<li>Gigadesmodus</li>



<li>Aureliax</li>



<li>Thralls</li>



<li>Gargoyles</li>



<li>Neophytes</li>



<li>Revenants</li>
</ul>



<p>It's a fairly sizable expansion for ARK players to dig into while they wait for ARK 2, which doesn't seem to be arriving anytime soon. In fact, Studio Wildcard <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/sci-fi-dino-taming-survival-game-ark-2-eyes-a-2028-release-with-a-little-or-a-lot-of-vin-diesel">confirmed today</a> that it won't be arriving until 2028, with an expansion in 2027 giving players their first taste of what the sequel will be like.</p>

            <guid>1387558</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Awards included a reveal trailer for NO LAW, a cyberpunk first-person shooter from developer Neon Giant and publisher Krafton that’s coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. The trailer gave us a first look at the sleazy, lawless city of Port Desire and ended on a line that hints at the game’s tone: “Reap what you sow.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/20251119004339-1-1765306650974.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as Grey Harker, a seasoned military veteran who barely survived his last deployment. So he decided to leave war behind to lead a life of peace and gardening, but of course, that peaceful life wasn’t in the cards. Trouble came knocking on his door (or more like bulldozing through it), and now it’s time for some payback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trouble isn’t exactly rare in Port Desire. As the trailer says, it’s a city with no laws and no oversight. It’s located on the coast where the borders of three nations meet, leading to a melting pot of both people and environments. There are seedy areas soaked in neon, tall buildings that stretch into the smog-filled sky, as well as lush areas where the jungle has started encroaching on the city. And you’ll see all of it as you travel across the dense open-world city.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/20251119004039-1-1765306575582.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mayors have used violence and intimidation to establish a kind of order, but it’s tenuous at best. Everyone is out for themselves, justice is self-defined, and you’re seemingly always one step away from crossing the wrong person. In this den of danger and vice, Grey’s decisions are up to you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The open-ended story of NO LAW evolves depending on the decisions you make. Will you help and protect those who need it? Or will you take what you want when you want it, whoever gets in your way be damned? These decisions have consequences, and each decision and consequence compound on each other to make each playthrough different. After all, “reap what you sow” doesn’t just apply to the people who’ve wronged Grey. It also applies to you, the player. This is the kind of story where it won’t be possible to see every path and outcome in one playthrough, and your relationships will be shaped by your choices.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/rooftop-infiltration-1765392744132.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Grey’s morality isn’t the only thing you’ll have control over. It’ll also be up to you how to approach combat, with several tools at your disposal. Having been in the military, Grey has training in gunplay, stealth, and hacking, but you’ll be the one to decide if he should specialize in one of these paths or be a jack-of-all-trades. He can stick to the shadows and strategically eliminate foes, use devices and hacking to outsmart them, or say to hell with all that and just rush in guns blazing, driven purely by rage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer shows some of that in action, including sneaking through vents to get the drop on enemies from above, using a device to map a room, and facing a giant mech in a 1-on-1 shootout in the street using explosives in the environment. You can also see in the trailer that environments are built with verticality in mind, providing ample opportunity for both catching enemies unawares and violently kicking them off elevated surfaces to their deaths.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/impact-screenshots-meleekick4-1765306650974.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the first look at NO LAW, but there are sure to be many more details revealed in the future.

            <guid>1387555</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch port of 1–4-player survival game Oppidum is officially out, completing its list of platforms after it came to PC, PlayStation, and Xbox earlier this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oppidum was created by Spanish indie developer EP Games with a team so small it only has one programmer, though you wouldn’t know it from the scope of the game. It has more than 40 hours of story content and a ton of features. It takes place on the once beautiful and magical island of Insule, but now corruption has spread across it and its creatures. And you're the hero who comes to break the curse that looms over the island.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll establish a camp that’s your safe space, then explore the island’s woods, swamps, and caves to try to locate the source of the corruption. These areas are full of creatures you’ll need to deal with, some of which are still touched by the magic that imbues the island.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is real-time and you’ll often face groups of enemies, so you need to pay attention to the skills of each to figure out which ones to take out first. For example, one enemy might charge you with its shield raised and seem like the most immediate threat. But it could be protecting a nearby healer, so you’ll need to avoid the aggressive attacker and take out the healer first.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/screenshot-illi-1765998641262.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Enemies will drop resources, and you can gather others by chopping down trees, taking a pickaxe to rocks, or opening treasure chests (some of which are locked until you clear the surrounding area of enemies). You’ll notice that after chopping down a tree, a glowing silhouette of it will remain. That means it will eventually regrow in that same spot, powered by the energy of the island. With the materials you gather, you can construct buildings, craft tools, upgrade your weapons, plant and tend crops, take care of animals, and cook meals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you venture across the island, you’ll meet and build relationships with its inhabitants. They’ll have new quests for you, and as you help them, they’ll help you in return. They’ll move the story forward and inform you about local customs and lore, deepening your connection to the world around you. And completing their quests can score you rewards like increased health and blueprints to improve your camp and equipment, so it’s worth helping everyone you find. As your gear improves, you’ll be able to tackle new areas, where you’ll find new residents to help, new mysteries to solve, and new information to uncover.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/screenshot-oppidum-sunset-01-1765998691388.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing objectives can also open up unexpected new possibilities. For example, when you defeat a boss, it’ll unlock its Altars, where you can make offerings to get new upgrades. That includes things like expanding your inventory, increasing your health, increasing how many of one item can be included in a stack, and more. This gameplay loop guarantees that through Oppidum’s 40+ hours of content, there’s always something new to discover and new goals to accomplish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can do all of this solo or with up to three other players at the same time. There’s cross-play between all platforms, with options for shared or private playthroughs. A shared game allows everyone to invite new people, nobody can be kicked out, all players can connect at any time (meaning you don’t need a particular person to be online in order to play), and if someone leaves the realm, their slot can’t be used by someone else. A private game is created by one person, and only they have the power to invite or kick out other players. It’s also only possible to join the game while the creator is online, but if someone leaves the realm or is kicked, they can be replaced by another player.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/screenshot-sights-coloredforest-1765998802952.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The experience can also be fully customized, including difficulty level and gameplay options. Difficulty can be altered with multiple different presets to tailor it to exactly what you’re looking for. If you just want stress-free gameplay where you gather resources and build up your camp without facing any real danger, you can turn on the Relaxed option, which makes it impossible for you to die. On the other end of the spectrum, if you’re looking for more of a challenge, you can activate Hardcore mode, which makes enemies much tougher and survival mechanics harsher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to get into more nitty gritty gameplay options, you can do that too. You can change things like enemies’ aggro range and how long an in-game day lasts. And there are accessibility options like disabling the need to hold buttons, adjusting durability settings for your tools and gear (which includes turning off the durability system altogether), simplifying fishing, and several more. The breadth of options earned Oppidum the Best Accessibility award at Spain’s Iris Games Awards, so needless to say it’s one of the game’s strongest features.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/screenshot-new-update1-2-0-1765998769515.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch launch of Oppidum also includes the recently released Patch 1.2.0, which added a bunch of new features and content. The headlining additions are two new minigames. Beach Pong is what it sounds like, and you can play against a friend or bennies, the island’s native creatures. In Battle Arena, you can earn rewards for fighting off waves of enemies. You can play in co-op with up to four players, or compete against each other in PvP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The patch also added a new cue to let you know the right time to parry an enemy, a “snap to grid” option during building construction, a new pause feature, and lots more. For full specifics on the patch and everything it added, check out <a href="https://www.epgames.gg/oppidum-patch-1-2-0/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>EP Games’ official website</u></a>.
