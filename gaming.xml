            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/greedfall-2-dying-world-preview-compelling-beginning<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Greedfall 2: The Dying World</em>&nbsp;is the follow-up to the successful release of&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9d4b187f-3cae-4274-b402-636e49656238" href="https://techraptor.net/games/greedfall">Greedfall</a>,&nbsp;</em>though this is actually a prequel to the original. Set five years before the events of&nbsp;<em>Greedfall,&nbsp;</em>it's set to expand on the world and lore. Launching into Early Access, I was unsure if the game was going to feature the full story or merely a fragment of it due to the size of the game Spiders is aiming for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I only briefly played the original game, so I came into the preview with no specific expectations or mechanics from <i>Greedfall.</i>&nbsp;After exploring as many nooks and crannies as I could for 11 hours, here's what I noted about&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4c664cbe-089e-47c4-9698-d0f4d2686862" href="https://techraptor.net/games/greedfall-2-dying-world"><em>Greedfall 2: The Dying World</em></a>&nbsp;at the beginning of Early Access.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/greedfall-2-dying-world-teer-fradee-village.jpg?itok=ufPinrsu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/greedfall-2-dying-world-teer-fradee-village.jpg?itok=bvaoOwh2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Story Begins</h2>
<p><em>Greedfall 2</em>&nbsp;contains the first three areas of the story: the Prologue takes place in Teer Fradee, while the next locations are on the main continent. You play as a prospective doneigad, or sage, for your tribe. The Prologue brings you around your area of the island, visiting the Bridge Alliance's fort and mine as part of your initiation. You're accompanied by two others, Nilan who's also being initiated, and Sheda who acts as your escort. The story develops the lore of Teer Fradee in contrast to that of the foreigners, and how the differences in perspective affect the very land itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can be seen as a commentary on capitalism, colonialism, and the destruction of the environment for the sake of wealth. Not only do the Natives have to deal with new sicknesses, poisoned land and water, and lack of food, but they also have to deal with being kidnapped, called savages or animals, and even killed by the foreigners invading their homes.&nbsp;The way one culture can denigrate another is shown throughout the playable story, scaling in travesty until the end of the available content.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/greedfall-2-dying-world-rootless-initiation.jpg?itok=mDJaKd31 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/greedfall-2-dying-world-rootless-initiation.jpg?itok=-HWPH7iN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>On the other side of the coin, there are characters encountered that stand against those injustices. Those in power that protect others who've been targeted unfairly, friends working to aid their found family regardless of race or nation of origin. Strangers attempting to stop plans to plunder Teer Fradee until there's nothing left.</p>
<p>Outside of the themes present in the main story,&nbsp;<em>Greedfall 2</em>&nbsp;is a game where your choices make a difference to outcomes down the line. Kill a lewolan during your initiation and it's remarked upon. Fail to gather enough evidence to clear your name and you may end up in jail. Taking the time to fully explore an area and complete multiple quest objectives gives you as many possibilities to level up and experience the world as you can.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Strategic Combat... if You Want It</h2>
<p>The way combat works allows you to play how you want. Your character and up to three NPC companions can engage in battle with various enemies. If you want a more strategic experience, you can enter into a paused tactical mode. This allows you to assign up to three actions per character that they'll execute when the game unpauses. You can make all the combat decisions, including what skills are used and who gets healed.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/greedfall-2-dying-world-combat.jpg?itok=Kg2IUMRN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/greedfall-2-dying-world-combat.jpg?itok=FZriKZYl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If that's not your style, there's an autonomous mode that controls the NPCs, allowing you to focus on your character's abilities. This is what I ended up going with after experimenting with both methods. I found that I would forget to switch to another character to set up an attack and often tunneled on keeping my main girl from dying. I also felt that implementing three attacks at a time slowed down combat, where I was looking for a faster battle experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This ability to choose what works for you extends to how you build your character and level up your companions. While there are suggested routes and skill trees, you can still pick whichever skill you want to add to your kit. Companions are a bit more pigeon-holed, but still have two or three skill trees to build from. Then you have the different attributes you can level up, which increase your damage, health, and other stats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On top of that, Rootless gets access to Talents. These increase your ability to persuade people, make potions, or pick locks. Even if you build your character exactly the same on a second playthrough, picking different Talents to level up will impact some aspects of the story. This could mean not having to find a key to get into a locked room, potentially running into enemies in the process, or being able to convince someone to take a different action.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Downfall of Early Access</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/greedfall-2-dying-world-nilan-glitched.jpg?itok=pD0J-5JZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/greedfall-2-dying-world-nilan-glitched.jpg?itok=ApQhAmDl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With&nbsp;<em>Greedfall 2: The Dying World</em>&nbsp;being an Early Access game, it's expected that there will be some bugs occurring. Throughout my playtime, I experienced a number of issues, including game crashes, companions fighting invisible enemies or disappearing entirely, or a companion glitching into the ground and being unable to fight in a boss battle. Those are the most impactful bugs I encountered, and in total, I only had issues a handful of times.</p>
<p>Other bugs include Rootless' hair going missing, the environment blurring, getting stuck on ledges that you should be able to jump off of, as well as missing item or alliance names.</p>
<p>As Early Access proceeds, these are sure to be addressed and remedied, but those who find experiencing bugs completely ruins their game experience may want to wait until some of the bigger problems are handled.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>Greedfall 2: The Dying World</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/greedfall-2-dying-world-uxantis.jpg?itok=ZCGd5QiU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/greedfall-2-dying-world-uxantis.jpg?itok=NtKp4jcy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Greedfall 2</em>&nbsp;sets up an interesting story, draws you in, and leaves you on a cliffhanger. The world is gorgeous and well detailed, with NPCs of varying personalities bringing locations to life. Those most interested in the world of&nbsp;<em>Greedfall</em>&nbsp;may want to continue playing as new content is added in early access, while those who hate to wait on an ending or deal with bugs would be better served experiencing the complete game at full release.</p>
<p>I'm personally looking forward to the next chapters in the game becoming available. According to the road map released by Spiders, the next update will feature companion quests, a new companion, another segment of the main story, and more. This update is set to come this autumn, with another following in the winter. There's no set timeframe for&nbsp;<em>Greedfall 2: The Dying World</em>&nbsp;to exit early access, but according to the early access Steam information, Spiders is planning for about 70% more content to come with the full release.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/worms-the-board-game-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/worms-the-board-game-review.990738/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/worms-the-board-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Making a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">board game based on a video game</a> is no easy task, particularly when that video game is focused on physics and kinetic weaponry. At first glance, you might assume Worms: The Board Game is a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games">dexterity game</a> – that is, a game about flicking or flinging projectiles at the opponent. This is not the case. Worms: The Board Game does focus the experience on chaos and unintended consequence, but it arrives at this destination through heaps of random chance. This is Worms if your carefully aligned bazooka shot was at the whim of a fistful of dice and a prayer.</p><div catalogid="1ae7d44b-05ab-410b-8237-4226f536c3f3" id="207664"><div id="207664" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Worms: The Board Game</h3></p></div><p>I think designers Jack Caeser and Matt Gilbert deserve some credit. Attempting to capture the physics engine at the heart of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/worms">Worms video game series</a> would be a nearly impossible task. Instead, this duo decided to emulate the environment and energy at the heart of the game. The core tenet of Worms is Murphy’s Law, and the turmoil of unexpected outcomes is a prominent feature in this board game. </p><p>The Worms board game uses a straightforward system. Up to four players each control their own team of four worms. Over roughly 45 minutes, you will battle to the death, blowing each other and the battlefield itself apart. Once a player’s entire team of worms has been eliminated, the game ends, and the person with the most worms remaining is the winner. So it’s a fight to the death, but one where pink fleshy nightcrawlers wield bazookas, uzis, and cluster bombs. The video game is hilarious, and this tabletop adaptation includes a dose of humor as well.</p><p>The ruleset is easy to understand, even for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">board game beginners</a>. On your turn, you choose one of your worms to activate, move it up to two times, and then play a weapon card from your hand to unleash hell on your fellow invertebrates. The complexity is contained in the weapon cards themselves. Bazookas blast entire hexes and cause mass damage. Machine guns harm only a single target. More exotic weapons are plucked from crates that litter the board and feature highlights from the video game series such as the banana bomb and holy hand grenade. There are dozens of items with various capabilities and strengths. The large variety here is core to the experience as the weaponry births the chaos and personality of the design. It’s also where the board game both fantastically captures and wildly diverges from the spirit of the video games.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is Worms if your carefully aligned bazooka shot was represented by a fistful of dice and a prayer.</p></div><p>The majority of weapons require you to toss dice. These are chunky 12-siders that map to the various edges of your target hex. For instance, if you roll a one your shot scatters north of your intended location and hits whatever is in the hex above it. Three of the die-faces show direct hits, meaning your shot doesn’t scatter and instead lands where intended. The closer you are to your target, the more dice you typically roll, allowing you to choose the best option for your intended consequence. It’s relatively simple and slick. The best part is the wind.</p><p>Wind faces one of the hex-side directions and will randomly change throughout the game. Three of the 12 faces on the target dice show a wind result, which means the shot scatters in the direction the wind is blowing. It’s such a key feature of the Worms video game that it had to be represented here. What’s marvelous is that it encourages a targeting strategy on the table top that’s similar to what’s employed in the electronic version. This is reflected in better overall odds by aiming upwind of your target and hoping your shot blows just shy of where you’re aiming. It’s a clever little inflection that results in meaningful gameplay with minimal rules overhead.</p><p>Another humorous quality is that the scatter dice are not only used for targeting weapons. When worms are hit with blast effects from explosions, the worms themselves scatter into nearby spaces. Sometimes this can throw you into a safe patch of dirt, other times it tosses you onto a mine and creates a hellish chain reaction. This is when the game is at its best.</p><p>In addition to worms, there are various objects littering the battlefield. Crates of course to dispense the implements of justice, but also mines and barrels. Mines have a 50% chance to explode when you enter the hex. They’re another tool of carnage that can be set off unintentionally. Barrels are grand. When they blow, they spit fire into surrounding spaces. This can hurt other worms, but it can also set off other barrels or mines. It’s not hard to envision a scenario where you fire a bazooka and nail your target which causes a worm to fling onto a nearby hex and set off a mine that also blows up a barrel. I’ve had plays of this game where I’ve lost half my team before I even got a turn due to these unexpected chain reactions.</p><p>This chaos also introduces the possibility of harming yourself. Your cluster bomb could scatter backwards, landing on your own space and blowing your worm off the board and into a deadly water hex. The most memorable moments feature these dramatic resolutions, with players holding their breath as handfuls of dice are dropped to the table and violence reverberates. It can be splendid. </p><p>It also can be somewhat uneventful. Occasionally, multiple spouts of flame scatter into water and no one is harmed. Sometimes your shot misses altogether and lands into an empty hex. It’s even possible you run low on weapon cards and have nothing terribly useful. A game with high variance can result in such situations of non-event. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Barrels are grand. When they blow, they spit fire into surrounding spaces.</p></div><p>This unpredictability is a large aspect of the game. It’s also a key component in avoiding any sense of malice. The light tone inherent to the property means you'll generally laugh – rather than get angry – when bad luck runs your way. The stakes feel extraordinarily low, which is fun, but can also be a problem. So much nonsense occurs that it’s difficult to be totally committed. The experience is somewhat hollow, resulting in a game that serves as filler to something more meaningful at game night.</p><p>Those beautiful moments of anarchy butt right up against that ceiling. They aren't frequent enough to truly tip the scales, instead, punctuating play occasionally and teasing some chuckles from the group. The result is a perfectly serviceable mass market game that manages to capture some of the Worms experience. But it’s also unfortunately forgettable, edged out by stronger competitors with either richer and more evolving gameplay, or an extended amount of content to keep players' interest. It offers exceptional components with high quality plastic worms, crates, mines, and barrels that would be lovely to paint. Everything is crisp and the graphic design, while garish, fits the Worms aesthetic well.</p><p>Worms: The Board Game is enjoyable and certainly offers fun, but it never manages to push through and actually achieve a sense of greatness. It’s sure enough to please most players, but it fails to leave a lasting impression. It’s less the game to repeatedly explore, and more the one someone sees on your shelf only to ask, “There’s a Worms board game? Does it involve flicking?”</p><h3>Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/98bjvL?object_uuid=c538dba6-2b8a-4952-9b27-1104dfd05981&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QPbjXV?object_uuid=c538dba6-2b8a-4952-9b27-1104dfd05981&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Walmart</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aepdlJ?object_uuid=c538dba6-2b8a-4952-9b27-1104dfd05981&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Miniature Market</a></li></ul></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Sep 24, 2024 8:00 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Worms has a competent design that occasionally produces brilliant moments of carnage, but ultimately offers an experience that is somewhat thin and faint.

When the company was told that was not possible, SAG-AFTRA says, Formosa “secretly transferred the game to a shell company and sent out casting notices for ‘NON-UNION’ talent only.” </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/03/043024-lol-patch-14-9-notes-banner-1714756967064.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>SAG-AFTRA has called a strike against League of Legends. </figcaption></figure></output><p>SAG-AFTRA calls the alleged actions by Formosa “egregious violations of core tenets of labor law,” and has filed an unfair labor practice charge against the company with the National Labor Relations Board in response. Not only that, but SAG-AFTRA’s National Executive Director has called a strike against one of Formosa’s most popular titles, League of Legends, meaning all SAG-AFTRA members must cease any union-covered services they may have been providing for the game.</p><p>League of Legends publisher Riot Games, meanwhile, distanced itself from the allegations made against Formosa in a statement posted a few hours after strike was called. Riot says that, ever since League of Legends became a union project five years ago, it "has only asked Formosa to engage with Union performers in the US and has never once suggested doing otherwise." The statement, which you can read in full below, also notes that the claims surrounding Formosa are in regard to a non-Riot game. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">League of Legends has nothing to do with the complaint mentioned in SAG-AFTRA’s press release. We want to be clear: since becoming a union project five years ago, League of Legends has only asked Formosa to engage with Union performers in the US and has never once suggested doing… <a href="https://t.co/SH4XvY1qtA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/SH4XvY1qtA</a></p>— Riot Games (@riotgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/riotgames/status/1838678925742084178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 24, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>“It’s bad enough that Formosa and other companies are refusing to agree to the fair A.I. terms that have been agreed to by the film, television, streaming, and music industries, as well as more than 90 other game developers,” SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director &amp; Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said in the union's statement. “To commit illegal unfair labor practices is beyond the pale and won’t be tolerated by SAG-AFTRA members. Formosa will be held accountable, starting with an immediate strike of League of Legends.”</p><p>“League of Legends is a game of champions. Instead of championing the union performers who bring their immense talent and experience to beloved characters, decision-makers at Formosa have chosen to try to evade and abandon them,” added Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee Chair Sarah Elmaleh. “Such double-dealing is very disappointing from a longtime committed union signatory. And such regrettable choices are unnecessary when our union committee and staff are as collaborative and excited to create protected work as our performers love to collaborate with game makers, and love this work.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Formosa will be held accountable, starting with an immediate strike of League of Legends.”</p></div><p>SAG-AFTRA called the video game strike back in July, the main reason being that video game companies have not come to an agreement with actors over regulating generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in their projects. The union notes in today’s statement that Formosa is “one of the members of the bargaining group that has refused to agree to protect our members against the unethical use of A.I.”</p><p>Some positive momentum in the strike, however, was made earlier this month after Last Sentinel developer Lightspeed LA <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/voice-actor-strike-makes-progress-as-last-sentinel-dev-signs-ai-protection-agreement"><u>signed SAG-AFTRA’s agreement</u></a> promising better rights for actors and protections against artificial intelligence. Following that announcement, <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-applauds-80-games-signed-union-agreements-during-video-game-strike#:~:text=terms.-,In%20a%20huge%20win%20for%20SAG%2DAFTRA%2C%2080%20video%20games,protections%20%E2%80%94%20are%20fair%20and%20achievable." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the union revealed</u></a> that 80 games signed their tiered-budget or interim agreement, “proving that the union’s provisions — which include common sense A.I. protections — are fair and achievable.”</p><p>IGN has reached out to Formosa for comment.

</div><div>



            <p>
Airship <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/syndicate">Syndicate</a>, the studio behind the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/darksiders-genesis">Darksiders Genesis</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wayfinders">Wayfinder</a>, has announced its second round of layoffs in less than a year. These latest job cuts will  impact 16 employees, with Airship blaming "difficult challenges facing our industry."
</p>
<p>
The studio initially laid off 12 people back in January, two months after its publishing agreement with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-review">Warframe</a> developer Digital Extremes - which was handling Airship's free-to-play fantasy game Wayfinder - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-dev-confirms-a-number-of-layoffs-as-it-shuts-down-publishing-arm">collapsed</a>. Since then, Wayfinder has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/darksiders-devs-wayfinder-ditches-free-to-play-and-online-following-split-from-warframe-studio">reworked and re-announced</a> as a single-player title, the overhauled game eventually releasing back in June.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, its retooling doesn't seem to have given Airship a sufficient boost. In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/airship-syndicate_in-light-of-the-difficult-challenges-facing-activity-7242332202624000000-t9US">statement shared on LinkedIn</a> announcing the studio's latest layoffs, CEO Joe Madureira and president Ryan Stefanelli explained, "In light of the difficult challenges facing our industry, we've had to make the tough decision to let go of some incredibly talented Airship team members, including 12 full-time employees and four contractors."

<p>
Madureira and Stefanelli note the pay cuts they took back in January during the studio's first round of layoffs remain in place, and that they're "both contributing personal funds to help Airship continue operating with our remaining staff." According to today's announcement, 50 employees are still at the studio after this latest round of job cuts, and Airship is "committed to delivering the Wayfinder roadmap and developing future projects."
</p>
<p>
"We extend our deepest gratitude to all of our employees, both past and present," Madureira and Stefanelli concluded, "for their hard work and dedication."
</p>
<p>
Today's news continues a devastating 2024 for the games industry, which has already seen <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">over 12,000 employees</a> lose their jobs since the year began. Back in March, GamesIndustry.biz's Chris Tring, writing for Eurogamer, took a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">closer look</a> at the circumstances leading to such massive numbers of job cuts over the last few years.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/lord-of-rings-trick-taking-game-previewed-at-gen-con-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in August, Gen Con 2024 came and went. The tabletop convention held many delights, including a chance to get the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-2024-player-handbook-will-be-sold-early-at-gen-con" rel="noopener" target="_blank">newest <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Player Handbook</a> early. In addition, it played host to several early previews, including <em>The Lord of the Rings Trick-Taking Game</em>.</p>

<p><em>The Lord of the Rings Trick-Taking Game</em> was previewed by game designer and Board Game Geek co-editor W Eric Martin in <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/165540/can-you-deal-with-the-challenges-of-middle-earth-i">an official post</a> on the website.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lord-of-the-rings-trick-taking-game-card-artwork.jpg?itok=SaPazB5w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lord-of-the-rings-trick-taking-game-card-artwork.jpg?itok=VLxMRTal 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>According to Martin, the game was designed by Bryan Bommueller. Bommueller is also the Creative Sourcing Manager for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-saddled-with-eu900-million-debt-by-embracer-group" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Asmodee Group</a> studio Office Dog. It's a co-op game for 2-4 players and broken up into 18 chapters. Those chapters are themed after story beats from <em>Fellowship of the Ring</em>.</p>
<p>In each chapter, you lay out the four starting characters and shuffle the deck, then place one card at random face up under the chapter card, then deal cards to each player. Each deck contains 37 cards broken up into four suits numbered 1-8 and one suit numbered 1-5. The four suits of 1-8 are Forest, Hill, Mountain, and Shadow. The 1-5 suit is the Ring.</p>
<p>From there, players claim a starting character. Each character has a unique challenge alongside set-up details. For example, whoever has Frodo must also have The One Ring card.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lord-of-the-rings-trick-taking-game-chapter-boxes.jpg?itok=Mk9pDJhU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lord-of-the-rings-trick-taking-game-chapter-boxes.jpg?itok=fdxrJVDS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Once this set up is handled, <em>The Lord of the Rings Trick-Taking Game</em> should be familiar. Frodo leads the first trick. Players must play a card in the same suit when possible. Highest card in the suit ends. Ring cards cannot be played until someone plays a ring off-suit in a trick. Once all players meet their goals, the next chapter begins.</p>
<p>A small twist comes in the implementation of The One Ring card. The owner can choose whether or not the card trumps or not.</p>
<p>Martin's preview of <em>The Lord of the Rings Trick-Taking Game</em> is from an outsider perspective. He admits he's not a Lord of the Rings fan but enjoyed his time with the game, experiencing the game's first five chapters and praising the stained glass card artwork by Elaine Ryan and Samuel Shimota.</p>
<p>At time of writing, there is no release date for <em>The Lord of the Rings Trick-Taking Game</em>.</p>

Also, in an email to <em>The Verge</em>, Riot spokesperson Joe Hixson clarified that neither the upcoming Worlds tournament nor<em> Arcane </em>season two will be affected by the strike as they are not projects governed by the interactive media agreement.</p><p><a href="https://formosagroup.com/interactive/">Formosa Interactive</a> is a support studio that offers assistance to other game developers in a range of disciplines, including art, production, sound design, voiceover, and more. According to SAG-AFTRA, the studio attempted to cancel one of its games after the strike began in July. When that was unsuccessful, SAG-AFTRA claims that Formosa then secretly transferred the game to what the union described as a shell company and subsequently put out casting calls exclusively for non-union talent. </p><p>In response, SAG-AFTRA has filed an unfair labor complaint with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against Formosa Interactive and added the studio’s highest profile game — <em>League of Legends</em> — to the union’s struck games list. </p><p>“To commit illegal unfair labor practices is beyond the pale and won’t be tolerated by SAG-AFTRA members,” said&nbsp;Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA’s national executive director and chief negotiator. “Formosa will be held accountable, starting with an immediate strike of <em>League of Legends</em>.”</p><p>The video game strike began on July 26th after SAG-AFTRA and a bargaining committee of video game publishers — of which Formosa Interactive is a member — failed to reach an agreement for a new interactive media contract. According to SAG-AFTRA, the bargaining committee refused to extend AI protections to voice and motion performers, while the publishers argued that the terms they offered were fair.</p><p><em>The Verge</em> has reached out to Formosa Interactive for comment.</p><p><em><strong>Update, September 24th: </strong>Added a statement from Riot Games.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This Leia is often referred to by fans as “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dancing-girl_costume&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dancing-girl_costume" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slave Leia”</a></span> and has become popular in the fan community. But it’s also an outfit that has led to a lot of debate among fans and critics. And when Disney bought <em>Star Wars</em> in 2012, we indeed saw a decrease in how often “Slave Leia” appeared in merchandise and media. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?M=sw0485&amp;name=Princess%20Leia%20-%20Slave%20Outfit&amp;category=%5BStar%20Wars%5D%5BStar%20Wars%20Episode%204/5/6%5D#T=S&amp;O={%22iconly%22:0}&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?M=sw0485&amp;name=Princess%20Leia%20-%20Slave%20Outfit&amp;category=%5BStar%20Wars%5D%5BStar%20Wars%20Episode%204/5/6%5D#T=S&amp;O={%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Since Disney bought <em>Star Wars</em>, only one new Lego set</a></span> has been released that includes a version of the metal bikini. And now a new version is finally here, but she’s showing less plastic skin.</p><p>On September 21, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/brickset/status/1837475806202769595?t=8VbUpB_z9MIJffzRxRQdcw&amp;s=19&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/brickset/status/1837475806202769595?t=8VbUpB_z9MIJffzRxRQdcw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Lego news and fansite <em>Brickset</em> tweeted out</a></span> two images comparing the 2013 Leia to the new 2024 Leia that will be included in the Barge set. The images showed that the new Leia is mostly the same, but now has a larger skirt that covers her entire upper legs. No more side thighs or oddly nude behind. </p><p>The reaction has been strange and hard to parse. There are people mocking or parodying folks being upset that they can’t “jerk it” to a plastic toy figure. There are also people jokingly blaming the nebulous concept of “woke” for the figure’s covered thighs. However, mixed in with these jokes and confused posts are folks who do seem <em>actually</em> upset about this new minifig. Some seem to suggest this is Disney trying to erase history. Others are shouting about censorship.  At least one Lego outlet described the new Legie figure as “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.brickfanatics.com/lego-star-wars-princess-leia-two-step-back/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.brickfanatics.com/lego-star-wars-princess-leia-two-step-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one step forward, two steps back</a></span>.”</p><p>How many of these are real and how many are people just “joking around” is hard to tell. In 2024, I can easily see some people being mad about a less sexy Lego minifig. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2022/01/22/tucker-carlson-widely-mocked-after-criticizing-less-sexy-mms/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2022/01/22/tucker-carlson-widely-mocked-after-criticizing-less-sexy-mms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">People got angry about the green M&amp;M not being sexy</a></span>. Every week it seems a group of online personalities yell about “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/JimSterling/status/1838119106471424275&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/JimSterling/status/1838119106471424275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DEI Chins</a></span>” on<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sweet-baby-inc-consulting-games-alan-wake-2-dei-1851312428&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sweet-baby-inc-consulting-games-alan-wake-2-dei-1851312428"> fictional women</a></span>. We have long crossed the Rubicon when it comes to what certain weirdos online will scream about that I genuinely can’t tell if a joke is a joke or a desperate soul angrily sharing his real, honest thoughts on Leia’s unexposed plastic ass. </p><p>Anyway, I think the new Leia looks fine. It was always weird that her skirt didn’t cover her rear, as it does in the film, and while the new skirt might not be accurate, it looks better than the old figure which <em>also </em>didn’t have a perfectly accurate loin cloth design either. I’m now going to stop writing about this and try to enjoy my life. Try to feel something again. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s apparently old enough for <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2024/0924_02.html">Nintendo to announce</a> that the Japanese versions of the consoles — the Nintendo Classic Mini Family Computer and the Nintendo Classic Mini Super Famicom — will no longer be eligible for repair once Nintendo Japan’s current stock of parts runs out.</p><p>That doesn’t mean that if you wake up tomorrow morning with a mini Famicom that won’t boot you’re out of luck. Nintendo Japan will continue to accept repairs but is warning users that it doesn’t have a definitive timeline for how long that will be the case. Nintendo Japan <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2023/0523.html">announced its plan to end repairs</a> of the 12-year-old Wii U in May of 2023 but didn’t actually run out of parts and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/4/24192163/nintendo-japan-will-no-longer-repair-the-wii-u">stop accepting units for repair</a> until July of 2024.</p><p>The timeline could be shorter for these consoles. Although the relatively unpopular Wii U sold even fewer units than the GameCube, Nintendo still managed to make and move over 13 million of them. However, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/4/13/15293270/nintendo-nes-classic-mini-discontinued">company limited the availability</a> of its Classic Edition consoles,  and although they frequently sold out, there were fewer of them manufactured, which could result in a much smaller stockpile of spare parts.</p><p>The Classic Edition consoles were miniature replicas of the NES and SNES that played a collection of retro games from each original system through software emulation. They opened the floodgates for other retro mini consoles, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20861085/sega-genesis-console-retro-mini-review-launch-games">superior Sega Genesis Mini</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221906/turbografx-16-mini-review-classics-games-consoles-price">TurboGrafx-16 Mini</a>.</p><p>Nintendo of America’s <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/products/detail/p/966">support pages</a> don’t say that it plans to discontinue repair services for the NES or SNES Classic Edition consoles, but we have reached out to Nintendo to confirm and will update this post if it does.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-steam-sale-absurd-comedy-1851656501<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve written off most of the humor in games. Maybe tons of it is funny to the millions of players outside of myself, but most of it misses the mark for me. Instead, I often find humor in the random conversations me and my friends have when we play games together, or the shenanigans we sometimes get up to. Recently though, there’s been an uptick in games taking a more tactful approach to comedy; rather than a shotgun spread of zingers and Whedonisms—which have their place but have unfortunately oversaturated the market—there are some games now dialing into particular niches and styles of humor that go underappreciated or unrepresented in games, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tactical-breach-wizards-impressions-strategy-steam-1851626007&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tactical-breach-wizards-impressions-strategy-steam-1851626007"><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></a></span><em> </em>or even AAA heavy-hitters like the <em>Like A Dragon </em>series. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-guide-walkthrough-1851633756&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-guide-walkthrough-1851633756"><em><strong>Thank Goodness You’re Here</strong></em></a></span><strong>, which is currently going for $16 on </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366980/Thank_Goodness_Youre_Here/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366980/Thank_Goodness_Youre_Here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Steam</strong></a></span><strong>, is one of those games, and thank goodness for it, because it’s utterly ridiculous in the best way possible.</strong></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196918" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why You'll Fall In Love With This Indie Horror Romance Mashup" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="196918,197260,197209" data-current="196918"><div><p>Why You'll Fall In Love With This Indie Horror Romance Mashup</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22475.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here </em>could be loosely defined as a platformer, but feels more like an adventure game whose central mechanic is slapping. Dubbed a “slapformer” by the developers, it places you in the shoes of the littlest guy imaginable, a salesman who’s sent to what appears to be a mild-mannered Northern English town called Barnsworth where all hell proceeds to break loose. The town greets your diminutive protagonist with open arms, proceeding to continually ask the world of you in order to solve its increasingly bizarre and surreal problems, which range from the mundane fixing of a deep fryer to the more unexpected corralling of a flock of gulls that serve a man with no underpants, and eventually taking you to a nightmare meat dimension. Yeah, you heard me right, and no, I can’t properly explain it all. </p><p><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here </em>knows exactly what it is, and never falters in that regard. It opens by testing your understanding of a phrase in the local dialect, which decides whether its subtitles and menu will be translated or not. When you pause, the game drops the game’s comic art style (like a funny newspaper comic, not cel-shaded) for a still of 1980s archival footage showing a small town’s brick-laden houses and street. It’s a game ostensibly about meat pies and all the absurdity and lewdness beneath the surface of the English idea of polite society, all the while bouncing you between delightful little comedy sketches all the way to its grand finale.<br></p><p>Here are just some highlights from my sleep-deprived hours-long run of the entirety of <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here:</em></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>In the game, you constantly cycle through the same few locations in Barnsworth, steadily unlocking more and more of the town on every successive loop. Since there’s only a single path forward, you have to complete the cycle in order to get back to any one place. One of those locations is the home of a character named Roy, and you enter his home via his fireplace, which you are brusquely shoved down by a crude <em>Oliver Twist</em>-like chimney sweep. Every time you spill into his living room, you bring a fresh wave of soot and ash that covers it. At first, he takes it in stride, but with every next encounter, he grows increasingly frustrated and even traumatized at having to clean up yet another mess. Your visits start whimsical enough, but eventually the dude just quietly cries to himself, helpless to the cycle of violence you continuously perpetuate.</li><li>Some of the transitions between two zones involve you jumping into a pipe and maneuvering it all snake-like, either underground or at times in the walls of apartment buildings. One of these skits involves a hilarious meeting between a pair of parents and their daughter’s new boyfriend, and it predictably goes sideways, but for the most inane reasons. My favorite, though, is the continual disruption of a decorative plate featuring Lady Di on someone’s cabinet as you root around in the pipework underneath it. </li><li>There’s a man with a food truck who you can disturb by leaping into his vehicle and then proceeding to spank him. He’ll repeatedly put up a sign lamenting the beating his “bum bum” receives, but he also keeps curiously opening up his shop.</li><li>I will never look at a cow the same way after the bit of <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here </em>that takes place on a farm. Never.</li></ul><p>I’ve got to admit, I got <em>a lot </em>out of slapping everything and everyone in <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here. </em>It is just a silly way to interact with the wacky world of Barnsworth, but feels appropriate given the townspeople’s lunacy. After all, this is a place where bottles of “White Shite” sit all over the place, and where there’s a lady who dry humps vegetation. Maybe they need some sense smacked into the whole lot of them.<br></p><p>Best of all, though, is that <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here </em>is remarkably quick-witted <em>and </em>over before it could possibly overstay its welcome. Great comedies know when to wrap things up, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-how-long-guide-1851616299&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-how-long-guide-1851616299"><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here </em>can be completed in a single sitting</a></span>. It took me about two to three hours, but if you just put your foot on the gas, you could maybe even wrap it up quicker. Take in the sights though, smell the flowers, and maybe even smack a few. There are numerous little gags tucked away behind simply interacting with elements in the world, like trash cans or piles of dirt, or revisiting locales you’ve already exhausted of meaningful objectives.<br></p><p>Look, it’s really simple, <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here </em>is the most particular game of the year, and it’s also the most hilarious. It respects your time and rewards that investment with some of the sharpest and most succinct comedy writing you’ll find in a game. It is so remarkably silly and crude without being disgusting or crass, which is a tough balancing act in games. I cannot possibly endorse it more, especially considering that it’s already affordable without a sale, and is now discounted even further. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s also, like any convention, an exhausting long weekend full of bad food, blisters, and booze.<br></p><p>This was my first year attending TwitchCon, here’s how it went.</p><h2 id="h11812"><a id=""></a><strong>TwitchCon 2024 Day One: Getting there</strong></h2><p>At 5 a.m. I’m in a car on the way to the airport for a flight that doesn’t leave until half past 8. I wait too long in line for a mediocre iced latte. I worry that someone is going to get angry about my trucker hat that reads “men made me what I am today: a bitch.” I get a few dirty looks as I tramp through JFK, but one Delta flight attendant openly laughs at it as I board, so I’m safe. I’ve no idea what the weekend has in store for me, and just a few minutes into my flight I realize that many of us here are going to TwitchCon. A Ubisoft person sits behind me next to a Twitch employee, they chat for a few minutes as they take their seats. I don’t have a window in my row and the internet isn’t working, so I fall asleep for a few fitful hours.<br></p><p>Soon enough, I’m boots on the ground in San Diego, and it’s clear from the airport outfits (Twitch-themed tees from older conventions, anime sweatshirts, plushies) that there are thousands of people here for the convention. Thankfully, the San Diego Convention Center and my hotel are right next to each other, and they’re both not far from the airport—before I know it I’m whizzing past SDCC, which is draped in the spring-time purples and pinks of TwitchCon 2024. Throngs of people mill about, wearing pastel lanyards and holding gimbals so they can stream while they walk.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="b43b0312232909c560cb3922c50ad585" data-recommend-id="image://b43b0312232909c560cb3922c50ad585" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A cloud inflatable floats over TwitchCon.

I check in, quickly change, and run over to the convention center to pick up my badge. The space is fairly empty, but there are dozens of staffers directing people to the proper counters. I’m in and out fast, which is good—I still need to be editing pieces from <em>Kotaku</em> staff back in New York.<br></p><p>That night, I attend a media happy hour, then go to an after party for a company called Blerp, which bills itself as “sound memes for streams.” The nightclub is full of streamers, many of whom seem unaware of typical party etiquette—there’s a lot of drink spilling and accidental hip checks. A guy wearing a baby sling with a Scooby Doo stuffed animal holding a mini solo cup strapped into it demands people try and sink a pong ball into the cup. A sticky-sweet-voiced Southern woman shouts above the music to tell me about her cooking streams. I don’t have it in me to stay there much longer, so I head back to the hotel, wash my face and pass out.<br></p><h2 id="h11813"><a id=""></a><strong>TwitchCon 2024 Day Two: Stream starting soon</strong></h2><p>I wake up with a start at around 4 in the morning—jet lag, my mortal enemy. I drift in and out of sleep for about three hours before giving up and getting ready for the day. I make the mistake of getting an iced latte from the retro-themed diner in the Hard Rock hotel—it’s bland and way too milky and now I’m cranky. My mood worsens as I walk across the train tracks to the convention center and see several people in army fatigues wearing rubber duck masks handing out squeaky ducks to everyone walking by. My entire trek to the convention entrance is then punctuated by shrill squeaks as an army of neurodivergent people squeeze the ever-loving shit out of the ducks. (For the rest of the weekend, the scream of rubber duckies haunts me.)<br></p><p>The convention center is massive, and though TwitchCon boasts a few tens of thousands of attendees, the show floor is sparse compared to PAX East or New York Comic Con, which are always incredibly crowded. It’s refreshing, actually, having a bit of personal space and a reprieve from body odor.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="d423ed6a7dac135f0f0ea604a32b6360" data-recommend-id="image://d423ed6a7dac135f0f0ea604a32b6360" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Peloton installation at TwitchCon.

I wash it down with my shit coffee and run to find the meeting rooms for my first interview: Rachel Delphin, chief marketing officer. We chat about inclusivity at Twitch, about their efforts to make the platform more welcoming for women, people of color, and queer folks with their new Unity Guilds, and how Twitch isn’t a platform for free speech.</p><p>Then, I chat with <em>Minecraft</em> streamer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/hannahxxrose&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/hannahxxrose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HannahxxRose</a></span>, whose face is plastered all over the convention. A few years back, she left college to pursue streaming full time, and now her entire family is here to support her. “[My growth as a streamer] just kind of happened over time and I’m so grateful that it did…I really wasn’t enjoying what I was doing in school. I was very unhappy,” she tells me, before excitedly talking about all the countries she’s visited thanks to her Twitch partnership. “I never had any dreams to travel and do things like that—I never thought I would.” Her agent, who can’t be more than 21 years old, hands me a few Differin acne patches. “She’s sponsored,” they chirp happily.<br></p><p>After that, I’m taken on a media tour of the convention, which starts with the Peloton installation. The exercise company has partnered with charity speedrunning organization Games Done Quick to raise money for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ablegamers.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ablegamers.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AbleGamers</a></span> through walking on their treadmills or pedaling their bikes.

Half an hour before it’s set to kick off, we’ve been warned that the space is filling up, so myself and a few other journalists rush down there to catch it. The mock debate stars several other high-profile streamers, some from his unofficial crew (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/willneff&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/willneff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Neff</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/austinshow&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/austinshow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Austin Show</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/carolinekwan&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/carolinekwan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caroline Kwan</a></span>) and others from his wider circle (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/bbnogames&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/bbnogames" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bbno$</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/cyr&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/cyr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyr</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/jasontheween&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/jasontheween" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jasontheween</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/nmplol&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/nmplol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nmplol</a></span>). It’s quite funny, if a little rough around the edges, and Piker flexes for the crowd several times to keep everyone plugged in—though Kwan steals the show by leaning into a “libbed out” girlboss character.<br></p><p>But I have to catch the TwitchCon Drag Showcase, so I run across the convention center to the absolute ass-other-end of the building, through the impressively large Artist’s Alley, and into the hall to catch the queens. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/twitchcon-2024-drag-queens-showcase-queer-inclusive-1851655276&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/twitchcon-2024-drag-queens-showcase-queer-inclusive-1851655276">You can read more about that experience here</a></span>.</p><p>After the showcase, I rush out into the street to speedwalk to my hotel and get changed for a Capcom happy hour at the Coin Op Arcade. As I’m waiting to cross the road between the convention center and the Gaslamp Quarter, someone pokes me on the shoulder. I tense up, half-expecting it to be a Very Angry Gamer ready to make good on all those threats I’ve been getting since March, but instead it’s a guy I went to elementary school with—on Long Island. “What the fuck are you doing here?” we ask in unison. His company has a booth at TwitchCon; it’s his first time at the show. We snap a picture and go our separate ways.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="cdf43d231e796f4a944b8f4c70c3256f" data-recommend-id="image://cdf43d231e796f4a944b8f4c70c3256f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3024" data-height="4032" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Twitch streamer Cyr speaks while a mime hangs out behind him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Twitch streamer Cyr speaks while a mime hangs out behind him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Alyssa Mercante / Twitch</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cdf43d231e796f4a944b8f4c70c3256f" data-recommend-id="image://cdf43d231e796f4a944b8f4c70c3256f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3024" data-height="4032" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Twitch streamer Cyr speaks while a mime hangs out behind him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I quick-change in my hotel room, throwing on a strappy red dress and motorcycle boots in an homage to Milla Jovovich’s outfit in <em>Resident Evil</em>, only to be immediately upstaged at the party by a Leon Kennedy cosplayer and a drag queen whose wildly teased hair is touching the bar’s ceiling. I play some arcade games (<em>The Addams Family</em> pinball, skeeball, <em>Time Crisis II</em>, and beer pong, of course), talk to a few content creators, then head back to the hotel, jet lag once again threatening my sanity.<br></p><p>When I get back to my room, I realize that I’ve left the balcony doors open. I can hear the San Diego Padres’ stadium from the moment I walk in. The crowd roars and moans and groans and cheers and it’s like I’m right there, even with the music floating up from the Hard Rock’s 207 Bar. It’s Ashlee Simpson. I wonder if she knows she plays at the Hard Rock Hotel.<br></p><p>The Padres win, and the crowd roars so loud I can feel it in my chest. Then, fireworks start exploding around the stadium—I Google it and see it’s Hispanic Heritage Night, and they’re doing a fireworks show set to music by J.Balvin and Bad Bunny. I watch it from the balcony, a grin stretching from ear-to-ear. After the smoke clears, I drift asleep to the dulcet tones of The Weather Channel meteorologists. Right before I lose consciousness, I hear a rubber duck squeak echo up from the street below.<br></p><h2 id="h11814"><a id=""></a><strong>TwitchCon 2024 Day Three: Mods!</strong></h2><p>Another 4 a.m. wake up, but this time I just stare at the ceiling until my body can get out of bed and down to the gym. A few Twitch employees are working out together, employing a deck of cards to determine what exercises they do when. I do a quick lift, shower, get ready and go out of my way to get a good cup of coffee: Achilles Coffee Roasters, you will always be famous. On the schedule today are six different interviews, and several shows I want to check out—I need a god damn good cup of coffee.<br></p><p>I chat with a few more execs about businessy stuff and bans. “You want streamers to feel comfortable and safe. There have been instances in the past where streamers or even viewers haven’t felt safe on the platform. And Twitch has heard that and built tools to kind of solve for that,” says Sakina Arishwala, the VP of community health, trust, and safety. I request some clarification regarding the platform’s tendency to let repeat, intentional offenders return to streaming.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="70fb57d1c13129e7dc9aea175ff36475" data-recommend-id="image://70fb57d1c13129e7dc9aea175ff36475" data-format="jpg" data-width="588" data-height="588" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Me on Hasan's stream for two seconds.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Then a much more fun, lighthearted chat: the hilarious Will Neff, who opens up our conversation by celebrating how he went from getting a master’s degree in interactive media to talking about sucking his own dick on Twitch. He gives me a bottle of his hot sauce (TSA took it), and we talk about his pivot from making content for a media company that didn’t value him to making it for himself (expect a story on that soon).</p><p>For a brief moment, it appears I’ve convinced Twitch PR to get me the coveted Hasan Piker interview, but he’s running behind and changes plans at the last minute. I manage to say hi while he’s on stream, however, and am immediately bombarded with texts from my friends saying they spotted me.<br></p><p>I head back to the hotel and change to grab a drink and a chat with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/denims&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/denims" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DenimsTV</a></span>, a top political streamer. As I’m leaving our drinks, I run smack into Will Neff again, who is wearing a massive, shoulder-padded, leopard print coat. “Try it on!” he urges me. It fits. </p><p>I stop by the TwitchCon block party, where attendees are playing big versions of party games like Jenga and cornhole, and we each get three free drinks. It’s too crowded for me though, so I duck out and meet my friend <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/wisalallen&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/wisalallen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Wallen</a></span>, streamer and comedian, for espresso martinis in a hotel bar. They can’t keep me awake though, and I head back to my hotel at a reasonable hour and pass out, yet again, to The Weather Channel. </p><h2 id="h11815"><a id=""></a><strong>TwitchCon 2024 Day Four: Chat, am I alive?</strong></h2><p>I awake with a start at, you guessed it, 4 a.m., my body doggedly refusing to adjust to West Coast time. I drift in and out of sleep for hours, then get ready to head back across the street for the last day. No flat iron today, my hair is more tired than I am. I get a larger latte from Achilles, this one boasts four shots of espresso in a cup that’s bigger than my head. The duck game people are back, handing out ducks as we cross the monorail tracks—I loudly protest, but several immediately begin squeaking the free rubber birds. It’s going to be a long day. I have a few minutes before my interviews, so I wander through Artist’s Alley, running into my elementary school classmate yet again. I buy some smutty <em>Mass Effect</em> stickers from an artist called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/malivethart/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/malivethart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maliveth</a></span>.<br></p><p>Then, two interviews: Pontus Eskilsson, the VP of global partnerships, who excitedly tells me about how many more scientists are streaming on Twitch. Like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/paleontologizing&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/paleontologizing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paleontologizing</a></span>, a paleontologist who uses the money he makes streaming to fund his dino digs.<br></p><p>During a brief break, I run to see the Trixie-Cosmetics-branded Power Up room, where attendees can freshen up and get some free makeup. A young girl, no more than nine, is there with her dad, getting some make-up tips from an official rep. I snap a picture in the photo booth and get a free blush palette, then run back to the meeting rooms to chat with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/deere&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/deere" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deere</a></span>, who tells me how she adopted Twitch streaming long before the pandemic, as a means to show off her artistry in different, more unique ways.</p><figure id="" data-id="59f7eb853bce4e3d7dcc5592ecdab661" data-recommend-id="image://59f7eb853bce4e3d7dcc5592ecdab661" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The TransLifeline board at TwitchCon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The TransLifeline board at TwitchCon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Alyssa Mercante / Twitch</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="59f7eb853bce4e3d7dcc5592ecdab661" data-recommend-id="image://59f7eb853bce4e3d7dcc5592ecdab661" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The TransLifeline board at TwitchCon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I get a last-minute offer to interview Caroline Kwan, who regularly streams award shows and other pop culture events with a political lean. She is, by far, the most engaging and fascinating interview of the weekend—we talk at length about the role of women in such a male-dominated space, the importance of connecting pop culture and politics, and, of course, our outfits. Expect a long piece about my chat with her soon.<br></p><p>After Kwan and I part ways, I run down the hall to meet with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/central_committee&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/central_committee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Central Committee</a></span> and Denims to chat for a piece I’m working on about the importance of political streamers in an election year. About 40 minutes into our chat, which we have outside in the designated smoking area, the familiar notes of Chappell Roan’s “Pink Pony Club” float up from the Kappa Cabana, where live bands have been playing on and off all weekend. Someone says that it’s actually Roan, and we speedwalk through Artist’s Alley and out to the cabana, just to discover we were duped. </p><p>“There’s only 30 minutes of con left,” someone utters, half-sad, half-relieved. Tired, a little dejected, and thoroughly over discussing chuds, we separate and head back to our respective hotel rooms. Walking back through the convention center, I hear a rubber duck squeal out, a final goodbye to me and the con, and am stricken with a bout of hysterical laughter.</p><p>We did it. TwitchCon 2024 is in the books. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">SAG-AFTRA is striking <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/league-of-legends/">League of Legends</a>, claiming that Formosa Inc.--the studio from which Riot Games sources its voiced content--is guilty of committing "a flagrant violation of labor law." The union has responded by filing an unfair labor practice charge against Formosa. The strike is especially unique because previously, League Of Legends was declared exempt from the strike, allowing its guild-associated voice and motion-capture performers to continue their work on the game.</p><p dir="ltr">So what did Formosa do to upset the guild this much? SAG-AFTRA's latest press release alleges that Formosa tried to cancel one of its struck games. (Currently, struck projects cannot proceed with voice acting or motion-capture work until the strike ends.) Formosa was allegedly told that canceling the game couldn't be done, and--according to SAG-AFTRA--got around this obstacle by quietly transferring the game to a shell company before proceeding to send out casting notices, which were specifically seeking non-union talent.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/sagaftra/status/1838646003840487906" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">SAG-AFTRA called a strike today against popular online game League of Legends, after a company that produces the game tried to subvert the video game strike.

"In light of Formosa's unfair labor practices, SAG-AFTRA's National Executive Director, with the advice and consent of the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee, has called a strike of League of Legends, one of the company's most high-profile games. SAG-AFTRA members must immediately cease providing covered services to League of Legends and the game will be updated on the union's search function as a struck game."</p><p dir="ltr">Members of the guild who work in the games industry--primarily voice actors and motion-capture performers--are currently striking over AI-related concerns, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/">named Formosa Interactive as one of 10 major gaming companies</a> it was negotiating with when the strike began in late July. Known as the collective bargaining group, other companies at the bargaining table include Activision Productions Inc., Disney Character Voices Inc., Electronic Arts Productions, Insomniac Games Inc., Take 2 Productions, WB Games Inc., and more.</p><p dir="ltr">"League of Legends is a game of champions," SAG-AFTRA interactive media agreement negotiating committee chair Sarah Elmaleh said. "Instead of championing the union performers who bring their immense talent and experience to beloved characters, decision-makers at Formosa have chosen to try to evade and abandon them. Such double-dealing is very disappointing from a longtime committed union signatory.

                <p dir="ltr">Season 6 of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a> includes Call of Duty's annual The Haunting event, and the spooky theme brings one of the battle royale's most interesting limited-time modes. Purgatory isn't your typical Warzone experience, but it's a fun sandbox-style mode that feels like the perfect send-off for this final season of Modern Warfare 3. It's also a refreshingly chill mode that should stick around long-term.</p><p dir="ltr">Purgatory is played with 10 squads of four battling on Season 6's Hellspawn variant of Rebirth Island. The map's hellish makeover includes an eerie sky, blood-red water, zombified NPC creatures, and flesh-covered walls, providing enough atmospheric changes here to get you in the Halloween spirit.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Modern Warfare III &amp; Warzone - The Haunting Season 6 Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">At first glance, it's unclear what you're supposed to do with your time in Purgatory. This is a sandbox mode with custom loadouts and infinite respawns, so there's no real objective dictating how you play. This makes the mode great to play with friends while just chatting and completing challenges. Purgatory is perfect for finishing up your camo grind, completing daily or weekly challenges, or knocking out the seasonal Warzone Rewards objectives.</p><p dir="ltr">Purgatory also introduces some weird mechanics to Warzone that sound completely outlandish, but they all add to the unique character of the mode. There are mystical ball-shaped portals that you can use to teleport around the map, and giant killer balls called "Terriballs" that bounce around and you can shoot at enemies, causing the ball to smash into opponents and down them.</p><p dir="ltr">The Shipment multiplayer map floats as an island above Purgatory, and you can not only land on the island and fight opponents, but you can also drive the island. Yes, you literally pilot the Shipment map around the sky like a helicopter. This is as silly as it sounds, but it's a lot of fun to take control of the island and cruise around looking for fights. Plus, it's hilarious to see someone making Shipment do loop-de-loops in the sky.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4372044-purgatoryflyingshipment.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372044" data-ratio="0.56237218813906" data-width="2445" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4372044-purgatoryflyingshipment.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372044"></a><figcaption>Purgatory's flying Shipment</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4372044-purgatoryflyingshipment.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This mishmash of new mechanics makes for a lot of quirky fun , like the awkward moment when you realize both you and an enemy are chasing after the same Terriball. It becomes a panicked scramble to make sure you're not the one knocked out by the bouncing Terriball. Of course, some matches of Purgatory are still sweaty, with a lobby of players just hunting you down for kills, but others feature welcomed comradery as some players use the in-game chat feature to team up and help each other complete challenges. You can quietly and casually play much of a match without too much heat on you, but you also have the option to play more aggressively and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-warzone-purgatory-island-event-challenges-all-rewards-and-how-to-complete/2900-5788/">build up a high Torment level</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Torment level is shown below the minimap as a meter with five skulls, and the more kills you rack up, the higher the meter goes with a rating of 1-5 skulls. You earn more XP as your Torment level increases, but it also elevates the match difficulty. For example, reaching Torment Level 5 marks you on the map for all your opponents, and it sends an attack chopper to hunt you down. You can also lose your entire Torment level by dying or entering a safe zone, so this can be an intentional or unintentional loss of heat on the map. Again, just another welcomed mechanic that can shake things up and allow you to go for extra XP, but there's no pressure to do so.</p><p dir="ltr">The hardest part of Purgatory might just be convincing your friends to play a full match. One of my biggest gripes about the mode is Purgatory's two-hour match timer. This makes it longer than a Zombies or DMZ match, yet you don't have a way to exfil and bow out early. On the positive side, leaving early doesn't seem to tax you with any penalties. There's usually a warning for attempting to leave a standard Call of Duty match early, reminding you that you'll sacrifice the match XP if you exit early. I didn't get that warning when I needed to leave a match of Purgatory, which is nice because two hours is a lot of time to commit to one match of Call of Duty.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4372045-purgatoryterriballs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372045" data-ratio="0.562574970012" data-width="2501" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4372045-purgatoryterriballs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372045"></a><figcaption>Purgatory's Terriballs</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4372045-purgatoryterriballs.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The mode would feel more satisfying if you could exfil early or have an optional game-ending objective. If you stay the full time, the map just gets nuked and there are no winners declared or additional rewards offered. It just ends.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, it's worth noting that players are reporting some games are ending with a nuke animation before the match timer ends. I've not experienced this in any of my matches, and there doesn't seem to be any hidden nuke challenge discovered.</p><p dir="ltr">Another minor complaint is that all of the contracts on the map are just the standard Warzone variety. It would've been nice to see something Halloween-themed or outside of the normal contracts added in like zombie-killing contracts or something of a spooky nature. Even a special bounty contract similar to the HVT contracts in Zombies mode, which require you to take out a special zombie type. It feels like a missed opportunity not to have Mangler, Mimics, and Disciple enemies from Zombies appear in Warzone. Even Zombies' giant Abomination enemy would be cool to see lurking around on Rebirth Island.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless of the flaws, I've spent a great deal of time racking up XP in Purgatory since Season 6 launched, and it makes me think a sandbox mode would be great to stick around, or at the very least, exist as a recurring mode. Call of Duty features an abundance of events and challenges that aren't always easy to grind in Warzone, especially in the normal sweaty playlists with limited respawns, and this would serve as a great option for those who don't own the yearly Call of Duty releases. It doesn't even have to remain on the spooky Hellspawn variant of Rebirth Island--Warzone's larger Urzikstan map would also be great to host a larger sandbox-style experience and seasonal events.</p><p dir="ltr">The Haunting event runs until October 16, and I highly recommend this mode for anyone looking for a spooky, fun way to level up and finish up any challenges before Season 6 ends. And while there's no real winning in Purgatory, you do have several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-warzone-purgatory-island-event-challenges-all-rewards-and-how-to-complete/2900-5788/#1">Purgatory Island event themed rewards to earn</a> in the process, including some really sweet-looking animated weapon camos.</p><p>This is the final season of Modern Warfare 3 as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> arrives on October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blasphemous-2">Blasphemous 2</a> - developer The Game Kitchen's acclaimed Souls-like action-platformer sequel - is delving further into the mythology of The Penitent One on 31st October, when its paid Mea Culpa expansion and an accompanying free update arrives for all platforms.
</p>
<p>
Mea Culpa tells the story of the eponymous lost sword, wielded by The Penitent One in The Game Kitchen's first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a> game. It promises two new zones featuring "harsh winds", "towering heights", and two new bosses. That's alongside four new quests - in which players piece together their sword - as well as new NPCs, prayers, rosary beads, Argent board figures, and an alternate ending. It also includes a "new (yet familiar) weapon and ability" - no prizes for guessing what'll be - plus new achievements.
</p>
<p>
Blasphemous 2's Mea Culpa expansion launches for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2879370/Blasphemous_2__Mea_Culpa/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/blasphemous_2_mea_culpa">GOG</a>, and the Epic Games Store) on 31st October. It'll cost £11.99/€11.99/$11.99 USD, but there's a 20 percent discount if you pick it up in its first two weeks of release.

<p>
Mea Culpa arrives alongside a big free Blasphemous 2 content update for all players that The Game Kitchen is calling True Torment. There's a lot going on here, starting with expanded versions of existing zones. Choir of Thorns, Sunken Cathedral, and Basilica of Ancient Faces have all been "reforged" with new challenges, and the developer is introducing new connecting zones for quicker traversal between key areas.

<p>Activision and Treyarch were paying attention to everyone’s feedback during the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer beta, jotting down fixes for multiplayer maps, spawns, performance, weapons, movement, and more on the road to the game’s launch. Here’s an overview of everything they intend to improve upon for the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer following beta feedback!</p>



<p>In preparation for next month’s release, Treyarch’s <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-mp-road-to-launch#more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest blog post</a> unveils how they’re improving the core multiplayer experience for competitive players.</p>



<h3 id="h-maps">Maps</h3>



<p>You likely noticed that the multiplayer beta only featured a small handful of small-size maps, which made for chaotic matches. In the full launch, most of the maps will be slightly bigger—medium size—and include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Vault</li>



<li>Protocol</li>



<li>Lowtown</li>



<li>Red Card</li>



<li>Vorkuta</li>



<li>Subsonic</li>



<li>Payback</li>



<li>Warhead</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-spawns">Spawns</h3>



<p>After spending tens of hours playing the multiplayer beta apiece, one of our biggest complaints was the spawn mechanics. They were too chaotic, too close. According to Treyarch, a core reason for the beta was to delve into the spawn system and gather data, which helped. They found that spawn logic required improvements and implemented changes to make it better.</p>



<h3 id="h-game-performance">Game Performance</h3>



<p>The whole point of a beta is to uncover bugs and performance issues. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 featured a few, and Treyarch found and squashed them. These include script errors, user interface issues, asset streaming glitches, and “hitching,” all of which they fixed for launch day.</p>







<h3 id="h-weapons">Weapons</h3>



<p>Regarding the game’s weapons, which felt impactful on day one of the beta, Treyarch is fixing a few key areas:</p>



<ul>
<li>Headshot damage is significantly improving, with location multipliers playing a pivotal role in time to kill.</li>



<li>Bullet penetration will improve before release, reducing the damage bullets deal after passing through surfaces.</li>



<li>Improvements to sniper DS</li>



<li>Better fluidity when swapping weapons</li>



<li>Reduced weapon motion during crouch animations</li>



<li>Target adjustments to shotguns and SMGs.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-movement">Movement</h3>



<p>Activision and Treyarch touted the reimagined movement system as a highlight of Black Ops 6’s multiplayer gameplay, and while it felt fluid and frantic, it left something to be desired. Before launch, they intend to touch upon:</p>



<ul>
<li>Animation fluidity and fidelity</li>



<li>Adjustments to slide mechanics</li>



<li>Intelligent Movement updates</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-other-notable-changes-to-black-ops-6-multiplayer">Other Notable Changes to Black Ops 6 Multiplayer</h3>



<p>While those key areas will see significant updates before launch day, that’s not the only way Treyarch intends to improve the core experience!</p>



<ul>
<li>Shortened time in the Winner’s Circle</li>



<li>Kill Counter added to the HUD</li>



<li>Reducing camera motion while sprinting and sliding</li>



<li>Improvements to the Kill Order game mode</li>



<li>Equipment and Perk tweaks</li>
</ul>
