            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/titanfall-3-isnt-dead-and-will-be-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2025-rumor/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to two reliable leakers for news about Apex Legends, the long-awaited Titanfall 3 is not dead, and it is currently in the works at Respawn.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/YOROTSUKI_/status/1907780125996745064">Yorotsuki</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Osvaldatore/status/1907780126626164993">Osvaldatore</a>, two leakers who have a solid reputation for Apex Legends leaks took to X to reinvigorate players hopes that Titanfall 3 is not lying in a ditch somewhere (or the digital equivalent on EA's servers).</p>
<p>Yorotsuki was a little clearer than Osvladatore, claiming that Respawn is working on the game and that it will be revealed during The Game Awards 2025 showcase set for December 2025. Osvladatore simply posted a graphic of the game's alleged logo.</p>
<p>The Titanfall franchise is arguably one of the best franchises in video game history that got dealt the worst hand possible. The first Titanfall game definitely wasn't perfect, but it brought a new and exciting flavor to the FPS genre that was dominated by Call of Duty and Battlefield.</p>
<p>Then, Titanfall 2 stepped everything up, and if EA hadn't aided in Titanfall 2 being overshadowed by Battlefield 1 launching right beside it in EA's effort to keep up with Call of Duty launching its annual release, Infinite Warfare, in 2016, then there's a solid chance Titanfall 2's story ends differently.</p>
<p>It still has what is regarded as one of the best single-player campaigns, not just in a first-person shooter, but in any game in gaming's history. And the rise and sustained popularity of Apex Legends continues to be proof that there's no other franchise that has mastered movement in a first-person shooter quite like what Respawn was able to accomplish with Titanfall.</p>
<p>That's just a part of what has made Titanfall 3 a topic its fans bring up nearly as often as Bloodborne fans cry out for a sequel or remake, and why Respawn's chief executive officer, and one of the original creatives behind Titanfall, Vince Zampella, has had to answer questions about Titanall 3 time and again.</p>
<p>Even though Zampella has previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/titanfall-3-id-love-it-but-it-has-to-be-the-right-thing-at-the-right-time-says-respawn-ceo/">stated that the studio is not working on Titanfall 3</a>, the reality of the video game industry, of which EA is no exception, is that things can change on a dime. Just last month, another multiplayer FPS game Respawn was<a href="https://wccftech.com/respawn-cancels-another-unannounced-multiplayer-fps/"> incubating was canceled</a>, so it's entirely possible that the cancelation of that project has led to Titanfall 3 being kicked up again, which is where today's rumor comes from.</p>
<p>There are plenty of unknowns here, but crazier things have happened during The Game Awards than a franchise that's beloved by millions coming back from the dead.</p>

            <p>
Alright folks, quiz time: what's the single best feature in the GTA series? I'll give you a second. Got your answer done? If you wrote anything but the in-game radio, you'd be dead wrong, obviously it's listening to boppin' tunes as you crash into lamp posts for the umpteenth time, there's nothing else it could be. I love an in-game radio, and as it turns out, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> of all games will include one (didn't know they had radio on Arrakis).
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Best of all though is the fact that the in-game radio will <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/546731472820633915">actually feature music from the original Dune games</a>, the pair of games released in 1992, Dune and Dune 2: Battle for Arrakis. I'd also like to highlight that the soundtrack for the first one even has its own name, Dune: Spice Opera, which is just lovely. It even received a remaster last year apparently, so you'll have some crispy tunes to enjoy as you travel the desert planet (sadly, co-composer Stéphane Picq passed away just this February).

<p>
There's apparently three channels to peruse on the Communinent as it's been dubbed, like Harvester Radio, a station catered to the "commoner workforce." This one will be where you'll be able to listen to music, but also get some tips for survival and even ads, apparently. They're everywhere these days! There's also official Harkonnen and Atreides channels, though maybe stay away if you're susceptible to propaganda.
</p>
<p>
The in-game radio is fun, but including music from the original Dune games is just such a lovely touch. Most people obviously think of the newer films, the OG David Lynch version, and of course the books themselves, so it's a cute way of acknowledging another aspect of the sci-fi series' history. I'm not big on MMOs generally, but this might be enough to get me to give it a go at the very least.

The big one is Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) which boosts image quality without sacrificing framerate. It’s become a cornerstone of PC gaming and one of the main ways rigs punch above their weight for running high-end games. </p><p>The Switch 2 will also be capable of ray tracing, a feature still somewhat rarely seen in console gaming in practice, as well as Nvidia G-Sync’s Variable Refresh Rate in handheld mode to make performance and image quality more smooth using AI. The company also claimed the Switch 2's GPU tensor cores do all this while “keeping power consumption efficient.” Exactly how efficient remains to be seen. </p><p>Nintendo recently revealed the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-battery-life-steam-deck-compares-4k-60fps-1851774376&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-battery-life-steam-deck-compares-4k-60fps-1851774376">Switch 2's battery life is even worse</a></span> than the original Switch at the low-end. How all of these features work out in practice, and in the hands of developers, will be the real test. Once the Switch 2 is out in the wild for real we’ll have a better sense of how it operates after hardware enthusiasts do teardowns and show us exactly what’s inside.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>For example, although they should be looking at the same person, to one it looks like a storybook animal character, while to the other it looks like a robot.

One lingering question is whether the new system's magnetic Joy-Con controllers will be prone to the same stick-drift problem that was commonplace in the Switch 1 controllers, and Nintendo's answer didn't exactly put those concerns to rest.</p><p>During a Q&amp;A with several of Nintendo's senior hardware development staff, the panel was asked if the new Joy-Con and Pro controllers for the Switch 2 have solved the stick drift-problem. Nintendo technology and development general manager Tetsuya Sasaki briefly fielded the question.</p><p>"As you may have witnessed and felt, the new Joy-Con 2 controllers for the Nintendo Switch 2 have been really designed from the ground up, from scratch, and they've been designed to have bigger movement and also smoother movement," Sasaki said.</p><p>The answer does suggest that the new Switch 2 Joy-Cons have been improved, but the answer conspicuously didn't address the subject of the question: if the new controllers have resolved the stick-drift problem. Perhaps being redesigned from the ground up has resolved the issue, but Nintendo did not say so directly.</p><p>The new Joy-Cons are very different than the older ones in some key ways, though. They're larger, to fit the new size of the system, and they attach magnetically rather than through a sliding mechanism. They can also double as mice when turned on their side, which is used in games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-facing-18-years-of-expectations/1100-6530584/" data-ref-id="1100-6530584">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, the wheelchair basketball game Drag X Drive, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-is-paid-but-only-barely/1100-6530597/" data-ref-id="1100-6530597">Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>, among others.

            <p>
We've learned an awful lot about Switch 2 over the last 24 hours or so, but not so much - as is Nintendo's usual way - when it comes to the technology driving the thing. Now, though, Nvidia, which designed the console's GPU, has talked a little about Switch 2's abilities, claiming it has "10x the graphics performance" of the original Switch.
</p>
<p>
Nvidia discussed Switch 2 - and confirmed various bits of information which have circulated following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-reveals-a-proper-generational-upgrade-though-its-biggest-new-idea-remains-unproven">Nintendo's recent hands-on event for press</a> - in a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nintendo-switch-2-leveled-up-with-nvidia-ai-powered-dlss-and-4k-gaming/">post on its website</a>, referring to the console's processor as a "custom" design featuring "dedicated RT Cores and Tensor Cores", alongside AI-driven enhancements. Those Tensor Cores, it claims, "boost AI-powered graphics while keeping power consumption efficient", while the RT Cores "enhance in-game realism with dynamic lighting and natural reflections".
</p>
<p>
Nvidia also reiterated HDR and AI upscaling - via DLSS - are supported on Switch 2, and that the console's GPU is capable of 4K visuals (at an unspecified maximum frames per second) while docked, and up to 120fps at 1080p in handheld mode. Variable refresh rate via G-Sync is also supported while in handheld mode for "ultra-smooth, tear-free" gameplay. "With 1,000 engineer-years of effort across every element - from system and chip design to a custom GPU, APIs and world-class development tools," it continued, "Switch 2 brings major upgrades."

<p>
Some of the Nvidia's chatter was either confirmed or hinted at during yesterday's Switch 2 Direct, of course - with the likes of 4K and 120fps both referenced during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-will-have-paid-upgrades-for-certain-switch-games-bringing-enhanced-frame-rates-and-more">Nintendo's announcement enhanced upgrades for various original Switch titles are coming</a>. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, for instance, supports 4K and 60fps with HDR in Quality Mode, and 1080p/120fps with HDR in Performance mode.
</p>
<p>
As for Nvidia's claim Switch 2 has "10x the graphics performance" of the original Switch, it certainly sounds impressive, but Digital Foundry was perhaps more cautious in its evaluation of Switch 2's potential real-world performance when sharing its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-switch-2s-full-reveal-analysed-how-powerful-is-nintendos-new-hardware">initial analysis of the console</a>. "As an opener for the deluge of games to come, Switch 2 lands where I would expect it to based on what we've seen so far," Richard Leadbeatter wrote. "Personally, I went into the presentation expecting a machine with overall performance in line with Steam Deck, but early indications do suggest something more potent - at least in docked configuration."
</p>
<p>
It'll be a while yet before Digital Foundry gives Switch 2 the full hands-on treatment, but until then there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">plenty more to read about and plenty more to see</a>, particularly as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-treehouse-live-presentations-announced-featuring-hands-on-gameplay-of-switch-2-titles">Nintendo delves deeper into some of the console's launch window titles</a> over the few days. Switch 2, of course, arrives on 5th June, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-are-now-live">some stores have already begun taking pre-orders in the UK</a>.

		<p>The lines between console generations and hardware leaps have become so blurred in the last few years. It almost doesn’t make sense to me that The Last of Us Part II is already five years old, nor does the reminder that it was originally a PlayStation 4 game feel like any more of a truthful statement. A big part of that is a combination of just how incredibly good this game has always looked, combined with the increasingly shrinking amount of space new games have left to innovate or expand on graphical technology. It already felt like we hit the apex with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/12/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4-tlou2/">the original PS4 release of this game</a>, and seeing just how gorgeous it is on PC makes it even harder to believe it isn’t actually a cutting-edge, brand new game.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last of Us Part II Remastered - Announcement Trailer | PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O6MdexNSy3o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One of my favorite parts of modern PlayStation exclusives is the absolute overload of accessibility options and fine-tuning settings they pack into their releases. The recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/16/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-review/">PS5 re-release of The Last of Us II</a> added an impressive number of these to the game, beyond what was already there on PS4, and they’re all included in this PC release as well. A lot of them are gameplay altering options that lessen or remove certain instances in combat, and options to retool a lot of button-holds and presses to taps or triggers. There’s a refreshing amount of UI options, as well, including welcome sizing options for the HUD and subtitles that would make playing the game on a large screen or from a far non-desktop distance a lot easier.</p>



<p>On top of these tools, there’s a massive array of new graphical and display settings available for the PC version of the game. All the frame generation and upscaling methods you’d hope for are included here – with AMD’s FSR 3.1 and 4, Nvidia’s DLSS 3 with Frame Gen, and Intel XeSS support. There’s also solid ultrawide screen support, with the option to even toggle cinematic pillarboxes on or off if you dare.</p>

<p>There’s all the graphical settings you would expect from a native PC release, with things like texture quality, LOD, volumetrics, shadows and more all scalable. I was also happy to see the amount of control The Last of Us II gives you over visual effect intensity on PC. You’ve got sliders for film grain, lens dirt, chromatic aberration, and camera shake, letting those who dislike certain effects tune them down or turn them off. Some of the finer options go a bit over my head, but what’s obvious is that the game looks great and runs great.</p>
<p>Without doing in-depth benchmarks across dozens of GPUs and configurations, my GeForce 3080 handled the game with ease. I get crisp visuals at 1440P and nearly maxed out settings alongside the game hovering around 120FPS in cutscenes and floating between 60-90FPS in gameplay.</p>

<p>The Last of Us Part II is also verified for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> – and while it’s certainly a consistent experience on the hybrid Valve handheld, it’s also without a doubt a highly compromised experience. Visuals take a noticeable hit on this platform, even with heavy FSR upscaling applied. I wouldn’t see myself enjoying the narrative-heavy material of the game in this way.</p>
<p>I did, however, enjoy a couple hours of the roguelike No Return mode on my Steam Deck, since it’s so much more of a combat focused experience where visual fidelity and lighting effects don’t matter nearly as much to me. This mode has been expanded a little for the PC release, with the new content being patched into the PS5 release as well. There’s new characters brought forward from TLOU Part I with Bill and Marlene giving new playstyles, and there’s four new maps to help sprinkle a little more variety into your runs.</p>

<p>There’s nothing compromised about The Last of Us II&nbsp;on PC. Even the previously controversial PSN account requirements touted for Helldivers II and God of War: Ragnarok on PC are fully optional this time around for The Last of Us II. If you want to experience this chapter of Naughty Dog’s harrowing post-apocalyptic epic, you’re in for just as much of a rewarding journey on PC as you would be on PS5.</p>

			<p>Nintendo's presentation for the<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;Nintendo Switch 2 included many surprises</a>, but the brand-new open-world Donkey Kong game&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-launches-this-july-on-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> was arguably the biggest surprise of all.</p>
<p>That is why I was very intrigued to check out the gameplay that would be shown during Nintendo's Treehouse livestream event. The event showcased several of the games revealed during Wednesday's Nintendo Direct, including Donkey Kong Bananza.</p>
<p>If you want to say that it's just Donkey Kong getting the Super Mario Odyssey treatment, you'd be only sort of right. Yes, in technical terms, it is a 3D platformer, and yes, you do have a little pal along with you for the journey that's a new character for the series. Donkey Kong appropriately gets a little odd-looking talking rock as his companion, rather than a hat.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Treehouse: Live | Nintendo Switch 2 Day 1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MkNm2wmpyto?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But what makes this more than just Mario Odyssey swapped out with Donkey Kong is DK's ability to smash everything and anything around him. The game's surrounding terrain is entirely moldable, with the ability to smash new paths on either side of you, above you, and below you. DK might not have the platforming prowess of Mario, but he makes up for it by being able to entirely re-shape the world he inhabits.</p>
<p>The gameplay shown off in the Treehouse livestream shows how you can not only destroy the surrounding terrain, you absolutely should be smashing the world around you to bits as often as you can. It also shows off a few DK-specific movement abilities that still let him retain some of the fluid movement Mario enjoys.</p>
<p>It's still ultimately just a vertical slice of a much larger game, but the Treehouse livestream makes clear that there's more to Donkey Kong Bananza than just being a game where Donkey Kong gets the Super Mario Odyssey treatment.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals Season 2: Hellfire Gala has been revealed, confirming the arrival of two new characters, Emma Frost and Ultron.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Rival Season 2: Hellfire Gala begins on April 11, 2025, and the new trailer provides players with details on what to expect. Emma Frost has invited all Marvel Rivals characters to the island of Krakoa, so mutant rivals and friends can work together to share a better future. However, Ultron has different plans and invades the peaceful time Marvel Rivals characters are having during Emma Frost’s party.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-emma-frost-and-ultron-arrive-for-marvel-rivals-season-2">Emma Frost and Ultron Arrive for Marvel Rivals Season 2</h2>



<p>The Marvel Rival Season 2: Hellfire Gala <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thyG51IdChc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> begins with characters like Magneto, Wolverine, Star Lord, Black Panther and more pulling up on a red carpet with their flashiest outfits (some new skin teases), clicking pictures, interacting with each other and having a great time. However, as soon as Emma Frost starts delivering a toast, she is interrupted by an invasion from Ultron’s army, and the Marvel Rivals roster has to join hands to take down a common enemy.&nbsp;More details about the upcoming season should be revealed closer to release, including new characters, maps, cosmetics and more.</p>



<p>Emma Frost and Ultron were leaked for Marvel Rivals a few months ago. Emma Frost was expected to arrive with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whole set of X-Men characters</a>, including Professor X, Gambit, Nightcrawler, and more. Ultron, on the other hand, was leaked along with the Thing. He is expected to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leaks-reveals-details-about-ultron-and-the-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a support character</a> with different healing abilities for the team.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Amazon has revealed the PC games that'll be coming to Prime Gaming in April, and this month, there's a rich selection of gangland drama, sci-fi adventues, and fashion crimes to check out. In total, there'll be 23 games on offer this month. As a reminder, all of the free games that you claim through Prime Gaming are yours to keep forever, even if your subscription expires. If you aren't a member, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can sign up for Amazon Prime</a> for as little as one month to take advantage of the subscription and the freebies offered through it.</p><p>One of the highlights this month is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mafia-definitive-edition/" data-ref-id="5000-512542">Mafia 3: Definitive Edition</a>. Compared to the previous Mafia games, Mafia 3 offers a busier sandbox to explore while you embark on a tale of revenge. After his surrogate family is wiped out by the Italian Mafia, protagonist Lincoln Clay embarks on a mission to take down the Mafiaso responsible, while building a new family and crime syndicate in the process. The Definitive Edition comes with a lot of post-launch story content and various cosmetics bundled in as well.</p><p>With the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-minecraft-movie-clip-focuses-on-a-date-night-for-unlikely-couple/1100-6530463/" data-ref-id="1100-6530463">Minecraft movie launching this week</a>, you can also check out one of the spin-off games through Prime Gaming. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-566097">Minecraft Legends</a> is an action-strategy game that places a heavier emphasis on story, multiplayer, and tactics. While the combat mechanics can be a little rough, the attention to detail, cute character designs, and environments will likely make it a hit with younger members of the family looking for more Minecraft entertainment.</p><p>Another interesting game to grab this month is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/genesis-noir/" data-ref-id="5000-480616">Genesis Noir</a>, which is a beautiful adventure with noir undertones that spans all of time and space. This is essentially a point-and-click puzzle-adventure with incredibly stylish visuals that tells the story of a love triangle between cosmic beings, and the game is a digestible jaunt across the cosmos. For something that won't give you an existential crisis, there's the avant-garde action of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fashion-police-squad/" data-ref-id="5000-513934">Fashion Police Squad</a>. A boomer-shooter where you dispense justice with a leather belt and weaponized sewing machines, it's a weird but enjoyable dive into the fashion industry.</p><h2>Prime Gaming free games for April 2025</h2><h3>Now available</h3><ul><li>Mafia 3: Definitive Edition (GOG Code)</li><li>Minecraft Legends (Xbox and PC via Microsoft Store Code)</li><li>Gravity Circuit (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Paleo Pines (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Clouds &amp; Sheep 2 (Amazon Games App)</li></ul><h3>April 10</h3><ul><li>DreadOut 2 (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Endless Space - Definitive Edition (Amazon Games App)</li><li>God's Trigger (GOG Code)</li><li>New York Mysteries: Power of Art Collector's Edition</li><li>Projection: First Light (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Faraway: Director's Cut (Amazon Games App)</li></ul><h3>April 17</h3><ul><li>Gloomhaven (Epic Games Store)</li><li>The Last Spell (GOG Code)</li><li>Fashion Police Squad (Epic Games Store)</li><li>Genesis Noir (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain (GOG Code)</li><li>Berserk Boy (GOG Code)</li><li>The Last Show of Mr. Chardish (Epic Games Store)</li><li>Wild Country (GOG Code)</li></ul><h3>April 24</h3><ul><li>Thief Gold (GOG Code)</li><li>Troublemaker (Epic Games Store)</li><li>Kraken Academy (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Priest Simulator: Vampire Show (Epic Games Store)</li></ul><p>Prime subscribers will also be able to the following games in January via the Prime Gaming Luna channel:</p><ul><li>SpongeBob: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated</li><li>Hot Wheels Unleashed</li><li>Bee Simulator</li><li>Thymesia</li><li>The Jackbox Party Pack 6</li><li>Fortnite OG</li><li>Fortnite Ballistic</li><li>Lego Fortnite Brick Life</li><li>Fortnite Battle Royale</li><li>Fortnite Festival</li><li>Lego Fortnite Odyssey</li><li>Rocket Racing</li><li>Fortnite</li><li>Trackmania Starter Access</li><li>Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition</li><li>Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition</li></ul>

                <p>One of the announcements from the April <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Nintendo Switch 2 Nintendo Direct</a> event was a game called Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour. The digital-only game explains the console's new features by dropping players into an enlarged Switch 2, with players walking around the surface of the console, reading signs, and playing demos that highlight the console's new features.</p><p>Many expected this to be a free offering, but it's a paid game. Just how much does it cost, though? In Japan, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aahea/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it's priced at ¥990</a>. This works out to about $6.50 USD. Regional pricing varies, and Nintendo hasn't yet announced a price point for the US. GameSpot has contacted Nintendo in an attempt to find out.</p><p>"Through tech demos, minigames, and other interactions, players will get to know the new system inside and out in ways they may never have known about otherwise," Nintendo said of Welcome Tour.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="532858936" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend">Endless Legend</a> 2 is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amplitude-announce-endless-legend-2-an-oceanic-4x-with-manor-lords-outfit-hooded-horse-as-publisher">decidedly oceanic</a>, with seas that shift and retreat to reveal new areas over the course of a campaign, so it makes sense that at least one of the 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game's new factions should be aquatic-themed. Say hello to the Aspects, and say hello to their coral. You'll be able to say hello to their coral because it is, in fact, a hivemind - a biomechanical reef that provides access to a gestalt intelligence called the Chorus, and which extends across their territory much like the Creep of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a>'s Zerg, but in a less obviously menacing way.

"In terms of gameplay, the Aspects are an economic and diplomatic empire focused on cooperation over conquest," explains a press release from developers <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amplitude">Amplitude</a> and publishers Hooded Horse. "Their main unique trait is their coral terrain - instead of claiming territories via outposts, the Aspects first place Coral Spores that will slowly spread coral to other tiles. These can be turned into cities, but they also serve as nodes for coral growth across the map." 
</p>
<p>
Yes. Yes. This is very much my cup of picturesque-but-insidious. Coral spores also extract dust, the game's magic resource, from their surroundings, while healing and accelerating your units and letting them cross water tiles. Best of all, they infest the minds of your rivals, making them better-disposed towards you. One way this happens is that other empires can exploit any coral growing on their territory for dust, which in turn lets the Aspect player see what they're seeing, and makes it easier to sway those empires in diplomacy.
</p>
<p>
Amplitude have written a big <a href="https://community.amplitude-studios.com/amplitude-studios/endless-legend-2/blogs/965">forum post</a> explaining their inspirations for the faction's visual design (coral aside, their architecture calls on influences from central Asia) and playstyle. "For them, we wanted to move away from the classical trope of diplomatic pacifist faction and make them something more like 'deal with the devil'," the designers write. "They don't want this world to be safer but manipulate people for their own good.
</p>
<p>
"At first, we wanted to make them evil landlords, capturing territories then selling them to other empires," the post continues. "This idea evolved into the Coral growing toward other empires' assets and giving to the Aspect the possibility to sign some specific treaties and get additional resources.
</p>
<p>
"The main difficulty dealing with the development of this faction was the fact that the Coral is a common resource shared by all Aspect empires in the game. This creates drastic changes in how you will play this faction whether there is another Aspect empire in your game or not." Intriguing.
</p>
<p>
As for the Aspect at war, they're big on cooperation with a varied roster of "swarming scouts", "steadfast archers" and "powerful flying behemoths". One key overarching mechanic is that when an Aspect unit defends for a turn, it confers attack boosts on allies. So they are great counterpunchers, in short. If only real-life coral reefs were this resilient.
</p>
<p>
I really like this crafty and unpleasant approach to the idea of a diplomacy faction. It's certainly channelling the spirit of the first game's faction design, which (for example) cast dragons against type by sort of turning them into the UN.
</p>
<p>
But where is my faction of no-nonsense warmongering builder-bastards, I hear you cry? That would probably be <a href="https://community.amplitude-studios.com/amplitude-studios/endless-legend-2/blogs/964-kin-of-sheredyn-spotlight">the Kin of Sheredyn</a>, a band of cyberpunk Romans who are the remnants of a fallen interstellar empire. They're great at shield walls, hench automatons, and staying under their city cap because they think it's uncouth to expand too much. I haven't dug into the detail yet, but they feel like Endless Legend 2's equivalent for the first game's Vaulters.
</p>
<p>There will be two other factions ready to go for Endless Legend 2's early access launch this year, with two more planned for the 1.0 version. Any hopes for the remaining empires? I always liked the first game's Roving Clans, who found their cities on massive beetles. Perhaps the new game will harbour an equivalent who live inside whales.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Have you ever woken up and thought to yourself "I'd like to be a bear, or perhaps a moose, just for like, a little bit"? Oddly specific thing to think about first thing in the morning, but <strong>Striden</strong> has you covered at least. It's a looter shooter, yes, it's a survival game, sure, it's a team-based game, why not! Except sometimes, for some reason, you can just turn into different animals to fight your opponents, like a radioactive bear, which I think is very silly, but in a wonderful kind of way. And, as developer 5 Fortress announced today, it's getting an open beta this weekend so you can see what it's like for yourself.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There's a couple of new modes being introduced with the beta, the first being transmit mode. This one is PvP, and sees you duking it out with other players across "three intense maps in a fast-paced objective mode." Presumably this one involves moving something around, given the name. There's also a PvE mode which sees you trying to hold out against "relentless waves of enemies." More bears? No idea! I hope not, I don't like the idea of gunning down a bear.

5 Fortress also shared some of the more <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2052970/view/536595840131663106?l=english">specific changes coming with the open beta</a> last month, like how the construction system has had a rework, namely introducing the ability to destroy enemy constructions, and the need to repair your construction tool to fix breached doors and windows. Sounds like it could be a bit overwhelming, but the game isn't even in early access yet, there's time to change things.
</p>
<p>
Each class now has three unique construction items they can build too, and a vault/ mantle system is in the works, but that one might not be in the open beta. The open beta itself starts tomorrow, April 4th, at 4:00 PM CEST, and finishes on April 6th at 12:00 AM CEST, and there'll be another test the weekend after from April 11th to 13th. Can't wait to see what other mostly regular animals that you can turn into get added in future updates.
</p>

<p>In the Call of Duty League, rostermania has been kicked into final gear in the <strong>day before </strong>the Major III qualifying stage. Moments ago, Vegas Falcons revealed that Arcitys and Priestahh will join Pred and Exnid to complete the four-man roster. </p>



<p>We’ll likely never know the size of the bag these players have been offered to represent the Vegas Falcons. Presently, the team has the worst record in COD esports history, having failed to win a single series since the season kicked off in December 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-it-enough">Is It Enough?</h2>



<p>The Vegas Falcons have had a woeful run, failing to win a single match since entering the Call of Duty League last year. They’re flat bottom in the standings, and unless something remarkable happens, the team is already out of this year’s Call of Duty League Championship, which is taking place in Canada in June.</p>



<p>On social media, the Falcons team revealed the recent signing of Arcitys and Priestahh. The latter was recently dropped from LAG M8, which has also been on a monumentally miserable run of late, while the former comes up from a solid run in Challengers.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Two more World Champions have arrived to complete our roster. We’re ready to make some noise as we head into Major III Qualifiers.

Welcome, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Arcitys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Arcitys</a><span> </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Priestahh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Priestahh</a><span> 🦅💚 </span></p></article></div>







<p>Both of these players are former world champions, Priestahh much more recently than Arcitys. He was a part of the incredible New York Subliners roster that went on a dramatic run through the CDL 2023 season, winning Champs in record time with a 5-0 scoreline.</p>



<p>Arctiys has been out of the League since being dropped by Surge just over a year ago, but he has been in phenomenal shape in the Challengers circuit. Just days ago, he won the Dallas Open while flying the OMiT flag, and in July last year, he won the COD Challengers Final with Lore.</p>



<p>Do you think the Vegas Falcons can finally win a series? Let me know your thoughts in the comments.</p>
