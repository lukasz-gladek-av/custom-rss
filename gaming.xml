<p>Developer Sam Eng actually pulled a fast one and released Skate Story's Steam Next Fest demo a bit early. It debuted at the tail end of last week, jumping the big queue of cool things each Next Fest has become. Despite my British sense of etiquette, I'll forgive him, because he did at least <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1263240/view/501711331410315348?l=english">pair it with some big news</a>. Skate Story will release on December 8th, 2025.</p>
<p>On that day, you'll be able to take in nine chapters of the answer to the following question: 'What if Tony Hawk's soul was sent to a realm of nightmare surrealism, and was also a bit peckish?' On this day, you can give the first chapter a whirl in the demo, which I've just kickflipped through in about 35 minutes.</p><p>As far as I can tell, it's the same demo Brendan, no doubt using his mysterious skateboarding magicks, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-skate-story-demo-has-me-yearning-for-its-knee-shattering-flow-state">managed to get his hands on back in 2024</a>. Curse you, Caldwell, one day we'll see your cupboard of evil tricks flung open, no doubt to reveal a bit of paper which reads 'I just asked the dev, and they said there you go'.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've given it a go and it's just as cool as ol' Brendo said. I particularly enjoyed dispelling the smiling block's manhole guffs, and the section which sees your skater glide through space to kickflip at a celestial body. The soundtrack being more akin to Disco Elsyium's chill Sea Power symphony than the usual pop punk performances blasting in skating games will take a bit of getting used to. If you're interested in finding out more about the artist behind it, Blood Cultures, there's a bit of chat with them in the Steam post I linked earlier.</p>
<p>"Skate Story is based on a true story," Eng wrote in that same post. "Yes, that’s right folks. Sure, it’s slightly dramatized for effect, but it’s all totally 100% true. Of course, names and places have been altered as well, for the privacy of those involved. For example, it was not originally a Frog who ran the bagel shop, and the Skater actually had to get a lawyer before signing the Devil’s Contract."</p>
<p>Cool. Skate Story's demo's on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1263240/Skate_Story/">Steam page</a>, where you can also wishlist it ahead of that December release.</p>

              <p>Battle royales are a dime a dozen. Probably cheaper. While the premise of every-player-for-themselves and winner-take-all makes for a good multiplayer game, it’s hard to find a battle royale game that offers a unique spin on those fundamental premises. But <i>Final Sentence</i> sure as hell seems like it might’ve found a distinctive enough concept to set itself apart: Gather a bunch of players in a room and have them type as fast as they can, with every typo leading to potential elimination.</p> <p>Developed by Button Mash, <i>Final Sentence</i>’s premise and setup doesn’t get any simpler: Put your butt in the chair and copy the text in front of you as accurately and quickly as possible. For every three typos you make, a masked man in a trench coat will load a bullet into a revolver, spin the cylinder, and fire it at you. If you’re lucky, you can continue playing. If not, well. You’re dead. The more times you trigger a spin of the cylinder, the more bullets your masked executioner loads into the gun.</p>

  <p>There’s a demo available on Steam as a part of <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-free-demos-next-fest-painkiller-reanimal-steam-2000634620">Next Fest</a> if the premise appeals to you. Having played a few matches myself, I can say it’s quite fun! I tend to push multiple keys at once when typing fast, so I’ve had my share of eliminations.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-free-demos-next-fest-painkiller-reanimal-steam-2000634620">10 Of The Best Demos To Check out In October’s Steam Next Fest</a></p> <p>The game is expected to arrive in Q4 of 2025, so if you fancy yourself a pretty adept touch typist, keep this one on your radar. Maybe you’ll get to prove to the world just how speedy and accurate you are on a keyboard, while the bodies of those who couldn’t match your prowess pile up around you.</p>

But he acknowledged that the date is "undeniably going to be on people's minds at the time the game comes out. Players will be thinking a lot about what they liked about the series."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though not timed for the 30th anniversary, the game certainly pulls from the franchise's vast library for its story.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> has revealed the dates for next year's Summer Game Fest event, as well as a change of venue.</p>
<p>The event will take place in the first weekend of June, beginning with the Live Kickoff showcase on 5th June.</p>
<p>This showcase will take place in-person at the Dolby Theatre in LA, which has been used for multiple gaming events in the past. The event will also be streamed online, for those not able to make it.</p>

<p>Of course, it's too far in advance to say what will be shown at the event, but expect the latest game announcements across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Before that, there's The Game Awards, which this year will take place on 11th December at the Peacock Theatre in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Nominees are yet to be announced, but will be revealed in mid-November. Judging by popular sentiment, the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, and Death Stranding 2 appear to be frontrunners for the biggest awards.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just weeks after Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">unveiled its new subsidiary with Tencent to be Vantage Studios</a>, which will house the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises, and be co-led by Charlie Guillemot (son of Yves Guillemot, chief executive officer at Ubisoft) and Christophe Derennes, the current head of the Assassin's Creed series, Marc-Alexis Côté has left Ubisoft.</p>



<p>This news was first reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft">IGN</a>, which reports that staff were alerted to Côté's departure today through an internal email that also included details regarding "<em>the need for Vantage Studios' leadership team to be aligned with its core goals</em>." The report adds that Côté was offered a role within Vantage Studios, but declined to take it.</p>



<p>The report also included a statement attributed to a Ubisoft spokesperson (which Ubisoft also sent to Wccftech, confirming Côté's departure), which reads, "<em>Following the organizational restructuring announced in March 2025, Marc-Alexis Côté</em> <em>has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft. While we are saddened to see him go, we're confident that our talented teams will carry forward the strong foundation he helped build</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We are deeply grateful for the impact Marc-Alexis Côté</em> <em>has had over the years, particularly in shaping the Assassin's Creed brand into what it is today. His leadership, creativity, and dedication have left a lasting mark on our teams and our players. We thank him sincerely for his many contributions and wish him continued success in all his future endeavours.</em>"</p>



<p>Marc-Alexis Côté had been with Ubisoft for 20 years and first began working on the Assassin's Creed franchise in 2009. Since then, he's been a part of the series every step of the way, from the conceptual beginnings of each title to its execution. He's worked on the series as a level designer, game director, creative director, and since March 2022, he's overseen the development of the entire franchise. </p>



<p>Wccftech has reached out to Ubisoft for further clarification on the nature of the roles Marc-Alexis Côté was offered, and if he would have been able to be in a similar position at the head of the Assassin's Creed franchise, had he accepted. We'll update this story if/when we hear back.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Boss Marc-Alexis Côté Reportedly Leaves Ubisoft After Two Decades]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-boss-leaves-ubisoft-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-c%C3%B4t%C3%A9-reportedly-leaves-ubisoft-after-two-decades.1324540/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>franchise boss&nbsp;Marc-Alexis Côté has departed Ubisoft after more than two decades with the company, having most recently overseen the development and launch of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>.</p>

<p>According to a statement given to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>&nbsp;by Ubisoft itself,&nbsp;Côté, who is affectionately known as "Mac" inside Ubisoft thanks to his initials, has "chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft".</p>

<p>His decision follows the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" rel="nofollow">setup of a brand new company</a>, Vantage Studios, to handle some of Ubisoft's most profitable IP, including&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>. The company is headed up by&nbsp;Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot, leading to <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-ceo-charlie-guillemot" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">accusations of nepotism</a>&nbsp;since the latter is the son of Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-boss-leaves-ubisoft-shadows.jpg?itok=lf-cTdm7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-boss-leaves-ubisoft-shadows.jpg?itok=_ESENhZF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>boss&nbsp;Marc-Alexis Côté has left Ubisoft after over 20 years.</figcaption></figure><p>Per IGN, in an internal Ubisoft memo, Derennes told staff that he was "disappointed" by Côté's departure and that Côté "had his own expectations and priorities related to Vantage Studios' creation and future".</p>

<p>That's not much to go on, but it sounds as though Côté may have butted heads with Derennes and Guillemot over the direction of either Vantage Studios as an entity or&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>as a franchise (or perhaps both). It's hard to say.</p>

<p>Côté has worked on the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>franchise since 2010's&nbsp;<em>Brotherhood</em>, where he served as lead level designer. He worked as&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed 3</em>'s director, going on to become the creative director for titles like&nbsp;<em>Syndicate&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Odyssey</em>.</p>

<p>His departure comes at a busy time for the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>franchise, with a major story DLC launching for&nbsp;<em>Shadows&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-review-more-of-same-not-in-good-way" rel="nofollow">just last month</a>&nbsp;and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-update" rel="nofollow">big free update on the way</a> for the Baghdad-set&nbsp;<em>Mirage&nbsp;</em>in November.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what effect&nbsp;Côté's departure will have on the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>franchise and on Ubisoft as a whole. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pathologic 3 Release Date Revealed for January]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pathologic-3-release-date-revealed-for-january.1324537/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HypeTrain Digital and Ice-Pick Lodge have announced the release date for upcoming immersive sim-style horror adventure&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>, and it's due out early next year.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>, which was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">back in October last year</a>, will be arriving on PC on January 9th. The two studios say the new release date is "nailed down, screwed in, wrapped in commitments, and...isn't moving".</p>

<p>If you're looking to check out&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>before it launches, then there's also a new demo you can try out right now as part of the latest Steam Next Fest. This demo is distinct from the free&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>prologue section that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-quarantine-release-date" rel="nofollow">released at the beginning of the year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathologic-3-release-date-corpses.jpg?itok=bLj2Asw0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathologic-3-release-date-corpses.jpg?itok=gqqD35cV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pathologic 3</em>&nbsp;brings more of the series' trademark weirdness in January.</figcaption></figure><p>As Ice-Pick Lodge tells it, the new demo is different to&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>"in every way"; rather than being a standalone prologue experience, the demo represents "a slice from the beginning of the full game", and therefore has a "different story" to&nbsp;<em>Quarantine</em>, as well as covering "different events".</p>

<p>The new demo should take you about an hour or two to complete, and it supports various languages including English, Russian, and Brazilian Portuguese. If you're at all interested in the game, give it a download, as Ice-Pick Lodge says this will help more Next Fest visitors see what they're offering.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>, it's the third game in the idiosyncratic&nbsp;<em>Pathologic&nbsp;</em>series, which melds the freeform approach of immersive sims with a strong investigative focus and a warped, surreal atmosphere.</p>

<p>This latest entry <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-2-bachelors-scenario-announced" rel="nofollow">began life as an expansion</a> for&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2&nbsp;</em>before being spun out into its own standalone game last year.&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2&nbsp;</em>itself serves as a sort of junction between reboot, remake, and sequel for the original&nbsp;<em>Pathologic</em>, so&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>'s origins feel curiously appropriate for the series.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on January 9th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

              <p>We’ve cruised on past Amazon’s Prime Big Deals Days. If you missed out on Amazon’s huge Fall savings event that stretched from October 7 to October 8, we have good news. You don’t have to wait for Black Friday to start saving some cash again. There are some great deals active right now across Amazon despite the Prime event having ended. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4332/">Like right now, you can snag this mini PC for 33% off. The Geekom Mini PC AX8 Max has dropped down from $749 to just $499 for a limited time</a>. That discount ends up saving your a solid $250.</p>
<p>Taking a peak at this mini PC’s specs, we’re looking at an AMD Ryzen 7 capable of up to 4.9GHz alongside an AMD Radeon 780M graphics card. It’s got 32GB of RAM and a 1TB M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD. If that’s not enough to store all your files, videos, and games, the SSD slot is expandable up to 4TB.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4332/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This mini PC can run in three different modes depending on your needs in a given moment. Normal mode is just that. This default is balanced for versatile performance, great for when using office applications or video and photo editing software. Quiet mode can be set when you want to reduce power consumption and noise. Good for late night studying or light office work. Then we have performance mode. This pushes the hardware to its limits to optimize for AAA gaming.</p>
<h2>Why Go Mini?</h2>
<p>A mini PC offers a nice in between option for anyone who can’t decide between a laptop or tower PC. It’s compact in size as not to take up a ton of desk space. It can be a great option for anyone trying to keep a clear desk or optimize the space they’re working with. You don’t have to give up an entire shelf or your foot space under the desk for a solid piece of hardware.</p>



<p>Mini PCs also work great as a secondary computer or multimedia player. Sure, most TVs manufactured today already come with smart features built-in and apps like Hulu or Netflix available to download, but there is still value in choosing a mini PC for your home theater over your TV’s factory UI. For one, they are a full-on Windows computer so they support a much wider array of video formats. This is great setting up a PLEX server or for playing videos you have locally that have been acquired by perfectly legal means.</p>
<p>Similarly, a mini PC makes for an excellent retro gaming machine. ROMs for older gaming consoles need hardly any processing power and a mini PC can be set up to run them all, or at least, all of the ones you have acquired by perfectly legal means.</p>

              <p><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> will reach its first birthday at the end of October, giving cause for everyone to look back at the last year and wonder at how it <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-shinedust-trade-token-1851786369">still</a></em><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-shinedust-trade-token-1851786369"> hasn’t managed to figure out a workable version of trading</a>. However, with an update due to arrive in time for the anniversary, there are about to be some slight improvements to trades, as well as a new ability to give away spare cards to your friends.</p> <p>Of course, this being&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>, it can’t just be a nice simple feature that lets you toss a bunch of dupes to your buddy who’s trying to fill in gaps in their collection. Come the new update, you’ll be allowed to receive one card a day, and only up to 4-diamond rarity (as in, no better than a basic ex). Woooooo. We can hand each other our bulk in the slowest way possible. Bizarrely, this new feature is being called “Share,” although there’s no sharing involved: You don’t get to keep the card after you hand it over—it’s what we humans call “giving.”</p>

 <p>Slightly better is an improvement to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-tokens-broken-feature-1851753735">continuously dreadful trading in&nbsp;<em>Pocket</em></a>. So determined is The Pokémon Company that no third-party money should be able to change hands when organizing trading that it’s ensured it’s all wildly slow and frustrating to use, and until now has only been available for low-rarity cards. The best you can trade right now are the 1-star cards, or what the real-world sets would call Illustration Rares. But after the next update, trading will include 2-star cards (Special Illustration Rares), and 1- and 2-shiny star cards (Shiny Pokémon). Sadly, 3-star cards (the animated Immersive cards) and crown-marked cards (Golds) still won’t be available to trade, and neither will the damn Promos.</p>

  <p>A couple of other tweaks are coming. Wonder Picks will now start to deliberately include cards that are missing from your collection (although they’ll still make you beg, with a one-in-five chance of actually getting the card you want). It’s also going to slightly simplify Flair, by which you add special twinkly effects to your cards, and no longer require you to spend shinedust to apply them—given shinedust is now required for trading, that surely ensured no one was ever bothering with Flair anymore, likely prompting the change.</p>

 <p>And that’s it. It’s a pretty paltry range of improvements for a game that <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-premium-pass-ui-features-1851705873">still hasn’t addressed some of its most egregious faults almost a year later</a>. Of the 10 issues I listed last year as being most in need of fixing, a somewhat demoralizing 10 of them remain exactly the same. Instead, with the botched addition of trading, the list of issues has only grown far longer.</p>

 <p>For what it’s worth, the best solution for trading I’ve found so far is a mobile app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mi.poketrade">PokeHub</a>. It lets you create shareable lists of cards you’re after, and look through others, arranging trades and sharing in-game details with strangers. And it works really well—while you’re still stuck with&nbsp;<em>Pocket</em>‘s abysmal one-trade-at-a-time system, people on the app want super-fast exchanges, so you can swap out a bunch of cards at a fair pace. And no, no money changes hands at all.</p> <p>It would remain far better if&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> just implemented a similar system itself, given it would keep players within its walls and doesn’t involve any elements that would be frowned upon by the developers. It’s bewildering that it hasn’t already happened, and speaks to a situation in which TPCi seems more scared of <em>Pocket</em> than proud of it. It’s certainly bringing in enough cash to fund any improvements/castles they could wish for, but instead everything is so tentative and cautionary, and ultimately reeks of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gacha-loot-box-gambling-1851690838">gacha greed</a> instead of player happiness.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon content is ramping up ahead of the huge 30th anniversary of the franchise next year, with new titles and spin-off games announced, along with a host of leaked content that creates a huge roadmap.</p>



<p>Huge leaks in the Pokémon community are nothing new, but the latest batch has seemingly outlined the next half a decade for fans, covering big secrets all the way up until the 11th Generation.</p>



<p>We’ve got a detailed breakdown of all the confirmed Pokémon titles set to release on the horizon, followed by the content said to be in the works, with a full roadmap.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-confirmed-pokemon-game-amp-dlc-in-roadmap">Every Confirmed Pokémon Game &amp; DLC in Roadmap</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More to come. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>







<p>Already confirmed and available to pre-order, Mega Dimension is post-game DLC for Pokémon Legends: Z-A, with Hoopa playing an integral role. From the few reveals we’ve had so far, we know that we’re getting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-announced-featuring-two-mega-raichus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two forms of Mega Raichu</a> in the first step of Pokémon the roadmap.</p>



<p>The release window for Mega Dimension has not been announced yet, but it’s likely to either come before the end of 2025 or early in 2026, with other big releases lined up for later in the year.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokopia">Pokopia</h3>



<p>Pokopia is the first confirmed Pokémon title for 2026, with the new spin-off title putting players in control of a Ditto that has assumed a human form. This farm-life sim is a new venture for the franchise, with big comparisons to Animal Crossing.</p>



<p>A release window has not been revealed for Pokopia, though we’ll likely hear confirmation at the big 30th anniversary Pokémon Day, with Pokopia taking a slot earlier in the year before the expected release of Gen 10 in the latter half (more on that later).</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-champions">Pokémon Champions</h3>



<p>Pokémon Champions is set to make a big change to the competitive scene of the franchise, which, moving forward, will not be played on the latest instalment of games and instead come in the free-to-play title.</p>



<p>Again, a release window has not been confirmed for Pokémon Champions, but the Pokémon World Championships 2026 VGC section will be played on the title, so it will need to launch early enough in the year for players to get used to it and for any issues to be ironed out.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-leaked-pokemon-games-amp-dlc-in-roadmap">All Leaked Pokémon Games &amp; DLC in Roadmap</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A big twist. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-pokopia-dlc">Pokopia DLC</h3>



<p>In the latest round of huge leaks for the franchise, DLC for Pokopia <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977791170093687087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was mentioned</a>. No details have been shared on this, nor do we know the release window, but it seems likely that any Pokopia DLC will land before the launch of Gen 10.</p>



<p>Pokopia DLC looks set to be the first big piece of leaked content on the Pokémon roadmap, though there is plenty more to come.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-wind-amp-waves-gen-10">Pokémon Wind &amp; Waves: Gen 10</h3>



<p>Gen 10 in 2026 is all but guaranteed, with Pokémon celebrating a 30th anniversary next year, though it’s still yet to be fully revealed. Similarly to specific release dates for announced titles, expect news to come in February’s birthday bonanza.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-wind-waves-gen-10-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Huge leaks have emerged</a> though, detailing everything from the game’s location to new mechanics, along with big new features that will be elaborated on in future generations of the game. Though a release window is uncertain, expect it to land at the back end of 2026.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-wind-amp-waves-dlc">Pokémon Wind &amp; Waves DLC</h3>



<p>Pokémon has moved away from the previous model of enhanced games or third titles in a generation with extra content to a DLC approach, witnessed in Sword and Shield, then replicated in Scarlet and Violet, and, of course, there’s the Mega Dimension DLC for Legends: Z-A.</p>



<p>In Gen 9, the first part of DLC came almost a year after the launch, with the second part a few months later. It remains to be seen whether a similar approach will be taken in Gen 10, or whether the DLCs will be spaced out more. Expect these to come in 2027.</p>







<p>Reportedly scheduled for either 2027 or 2028, per the leaks, the third game in the Pokémon Legends series will see players return to Galar, the Gen 8 region, travelling 1,000 years in the past. This would be the second major time-reverse in the Legends series, following on from Legends: Arceus.</p>



<p>Again, the release window isn’t set in stone, though it likely depends on where other titles land. The original Legends game released in the first-quarter of the year, while Legends: Z-A releases in Q4. The big difference, however, is Arceus arrived the same year as Scarlet &amp; Violet.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-seed-multi-region-mmo">Pokémon Seed: Multi-Region MMO</h3>



<p>With a reported 2028 or 2029 release window, Pokémon’s big MMO project, said to be internally codenamed as Seed, could be the biggest advancement of the franchise yet by connecting various regions of the Pokémon world together and encorporating MMO themes—which are initially said to be introduced in Gen 10.</p>



<p>The huge connected region is said to incorporate all of the Pokémon regions set in Japan, which are Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh, alongside Kitakami, which featured in Scarlet &amp; Violet DLC.</p>



<p>A similar approach could then be taken for the European-based regions of Galar, Kalos, and Paldea, though that’s just a theory for now.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-gen-11">Pokémon Gen 11</h3>



<p>Said to be arriving in 2030, which would fit perfectly into the four-year cycle Pokémon has settled into in the modern era between generations, Pokémon Gen 11 is the next big step for the franchise—and it doesn’t seem that far away.</p>



<p>At this early stage, no major details are known about what Gen 11 of the Pokémon franchise could entail, particularly given the huge advancements that are seemingly being planned for the years to come.</p>

                <p>Gearbox Software CEO Randy Pitchford has declared, "We suck" following the launch of the studio's latest game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-4-review-too-much-of-an-overcorrection/1900-6418405/" data-ref-id="1900-6418405">Borderlands 4</a>. Why does he believe that? In an interview with <a href="https://www.bbc.com/audio/play/p0m7sd7y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BBC Radio 5 Live</a>, Pitchford said Gearbox's mission is "to entertain the world," and the company is only currently reaching a small piece of the pie.</p><p>"There are billions of people in the world. We got a lot of work to do. We're gonna cross probably <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-will-push-franchise-beyond-100-million-sales-gearbox-ceo-says/1100-6534199/" data-ref-id="1100-6534199">100 million units sold</a>, with Borderlands 4, of the franchise. That's awesome compared to a lot of things. But it kinda sucks if your goal is to entertain the world. So I feel like we're just getting started," he said, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-chief-randy-pitchford-says-if-more-developers-better-understood-why-gamers-love-making-decisions-about-loot-wed-have-good-competitors" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by IGN.</a></p><p>Pitchford said that now, in 2025, Gearbox is finally "starting to get pretty good" at making Borderlands games after nearly 20 years. "It feels like we're starting to figure it out. I feel like we've probed a lot of the end points. But I don't think we're anywhere near the end of a journey," he said.</p><p>The latest data reveals that more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-will-push-franchise-beyond-100-million-sales-gearbox-ceo-says/1100-6534199/" data-ref-id="1100-6534199">94 million copies of Borderlands games have been sold</a>, so Borderlands 4 would have to hit 6 million to push the franchise past 100 million.</p><p>Borderlands 3 sold more than 23 million copies and is 2K's fastest-selling game ever. The top-selling game of all time for 2K is Borderlands 2, which has achieved sales of more than 30 million units. No sales data for Borderlands 4 has been announced as of yet.</p><p>Also in the BBC interview, Pitchford said other studios in the looter-shooter space have failed to compete with Borderlands on a level that he expected them to by this point.</p><p>"If other game designers that were trying to get in on the action, so to speak, understood that, we'd have more competitors, or we'd have good competitors," he said. "But we haven't so far. It's weird. The kinds of people that just want to go after it, they're not thinking about it on that level. They're just putting into motion something because of market analysis. It's not a designer's or creator's drive that's doing it. It's either a business drive or a wishing to be something that you're not kind of drive."</p><p>Pitchford said he "fully expected" after the original Borderlands came out in 2009 that "everyone would be hip to" jumping into the looter-shooter market and that there would be "lots of other games imitating and aping." But, in Pitchford's eyes, this didn't come to bear on the level he imagined.</p><p>There have indeed been many other looter-shooter games that have come to market after Borderlands, including Destiny and The Division, and each has left their own stamp on the market.</p><p>Pitchford is known for making eye-catching comments. Before this, he said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/real-fans-will-find-a-wake-to-make-it-happen-if-borderlands-4-costs-80-says-pitchford/1100-6531677/" data-ref-id="1100-6531677">"real fans" would find a way to buy Borderlands 4 if it were priced at $80</a> (which it was not). After Borderlands 4 launched, Pitchford mixed it up with fans about the game's technical issues, saying people were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/randy-pitchford-remains-defiant-about-borderlands-4-pc-issues/1100-6534798/" data-ref-id="1100-6534798">being "4K stubborn"</a> and that they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-calls-people-4k-stubborn-disputes-reports-of-performance-issues/1100-6534746/" data-ref-id="1100-6534746">should get a refund if they're not happy.</a></p>

                <p>The last big content drop for Helldivers 2 added new toys to play with and sandboxes to wreak havoc in, but with persistent player grievances about poor performance, studio Arrowhead is delaying future content updates to tackle these issues.</p><p>Speaking in a video interview for the Helldivers 2 YouTube channel, game director Mikael Eriksson admitted that after the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/" data-ref-id="1100-6534405">Into the Unjust update</a> in September, which added terrifying new enemies and labyrinthian cave systems, the game experienced "more issues than [the studio] were comfortable with."</p><p>Eriksson said that feedback from players was "very justified," and that the team was taking the issues seriously "to make sure this sort of thing doesn't happen again."</p><p>"We have made the decision to push some of our content and feature updates a little bit into the future while we're addressing these things to make sure that we can get to a much more stable state that we can believe in," Eriksson announced.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVYKgOunbsA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fVYKgOunbsA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Some of the pain points Helldivers 2 faces can be addressed "fairly quickly," Eriksson said, particularly some of the game's prevalent technical bugs. Improving frame rates on consoles will be a trickier affair, Eriksson admitted, who noted that the studio's "top brains" were working on it.</p><p>Arrowhead has already made "big improvements," a confident Eriksson claimed, and the studio will talk more in depth about these improvements "hopefully quite soon."</p><p>In late September, Arrowhead promised <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-update-planned-for-october-with-bigger-performance-pieces-needing-more-time/1100-6534979/" data-ref-id="1100-6534979">performance-related fixes in "mid-October-ish,"</a> but the studio was working on a "bigger development plan" for the larger issues the game was facing, which included game crashes, audio bugs, and stability hiccups. Eriksson's announcement appears to be part of that plan, but it remains to be seen what concrete fixes the studio will deploy and when.</p><p>The gargantuan install size of Helldivers 2 on PC is also a big topic of discussion, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-explains-why-the-game-takes-up-so-much-space-on-pc/1100-6535217/" data-ref-id="1100-6535217">Arrowhead providing an explanation</a> on why the game takes up so much space and laying out potential solutions. The game also recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-xbox-trade-exclusives-today-with-helldivers-on-xbox-and-gears-on-ps5/1100-6534266/" data-ref-id="1100-6534266">came to Xbox Series X|S</a> after previously launching only on PC and PS5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I had a brief but intense <em>Gwent</em> phase, playing <em>The Witcher 3’s </em>monster-based card game a whole lot but pretty badly. <em>The Killing Stone</em> reminds me a bit of <em>Gwent</em>&nbsp;in that there are cards and monsters and after I make my play I watch the enemy’s monsters wallop me while I yell “wait, no!” helplessly at my screen, but it stands out with a wonderfully physical board game feel and a narrative that infuses its design.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2781470/The_Killing_Stone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Killing Stone</em></a>, which has a demo out now as part of Steam Next Fest, puts you in a contest against the devil for the souls of your deceased mentor and her family. There’s a narrative that you play in between matches of its in-game game, in which you walk around a dark 17th century mansion and choose among dialogue options that can be rendered in either modern or period English. The game-within-the-game takes place on a table and paper map, where you play cards to deploy tiny figures of monsters, and try to destroy your enemy’s “eye”–basically their main health pool–before they can destroy yours.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Killing Stone - Official Announcement Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-DyiW7B7jZc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Everything in the game is wonderfully physical: pens scratch and figurines rattle, and the sound design comes really close to making you feel like you’re actually touching the objects on the board. You have a limited amount of action points and space to play your various creatures in a row. Some of them are just monsters who do damage, while others have special abilities. I became very fond of the Sacrificial Lamb, a weak sheep I’d basically set up to die to trigger its ability to give me extra action points, and the Immolator, which can be placed on the enemy’s side of the board to damage them as it moves along. Your pieces also have a Reserve slot above the board you can place a piece or power into; these can buff that piece or deploy when that piece is destroyed to give you additional effects. The order you play your monsters and reserves in matters, as they can affect each other, and they also stand as a physical buffer between the enemies and your eye. The best plays are those that strategically arrange your pieces to do multiple things at once, taking care of troublesome enemies while also chaining effects or setting you up for the next turn.</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath</figcaption></figure><p>On top of these battles is a sort of meta game, which you progress through by picking a path along a paper map. There’s a lot there: there are healing rooms and a place to swap out decks; “familiar” characters like a raven and a dog give you run-long benefits; and you can use chits to “wager” on buffs and against your opponent’s buffs. I liked the way this stuff was dressed up in the whole game’s narrative of deals and bargains with nefarious creatures, though the jargon did sometimes overwhelm me a bit. I definitely didn’t come close to mastering any of it in my time with the demo, but it hints at the ability to really craft your run once you have.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The wager system (Question)</figcaption></figure><p>My favorite parts of <em>The Killing Stone</em> are how physical everything is, and how strong the game’s world and vibe are. I might be dreadful at the wagering for boons and buffs, but I love how the chits fall with a rattle, and how the system plays with hidden information in a similar manner to an actual game round. I lost continuously to the demo’s first nemesis, but I couldn’t get enough of its evocative design and the metallic clinking of its erector set face.</p><figure><figcaption>Look at this guy! (Aftermath)</figcaption></figure><p>There is a lot going on in <em>The Killing Stone</em>, with its various narratives and multiple mechanics, but they all tie together in a way that feels consistent. <em>Gwent</em> was always “people in this world like to play cards,” but <em>The Killing Stone</em>’s game is a piece of the full game’s narrative as much as a game and story of its own. I’m excited to spend more time with the demo and learn to overcome my fatal instinct in games like this to just click things that look exciting instead of really thinking it all through. Steam Next Fest runs through October 20.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-party-wooooooo"><h3>We’re Throwing A Party, And You’re Invited</h3></a><p>Celebrate our two-year anniversary with us!</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-assassins-creed-reconstruction-ubisoft"><h3>Everything Is Assassin’s Creed</h3></a><p>"You can look at 15-ish games at this point and watch, nearly yearly, the progression toward the world we live in today"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-review"><h3>100 Meters Is A Soulful Gem About The Poetry Of Running</h3></a><p>Studio Rock’N Roll Mountain’s rotoscope take on Uoto’s track manga unearths raw truths and soulful cadence with every thunderous footfall</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/killing-stone-demo]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="0eea4def6cf17"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0eea4def6cf17/pokemon-legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>We finally did it, Trainers! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> launch week is upon us and, with just two days to go, reviews have started rolling in.</p>
<p>Here at Nintendo Life, we had a perfectly pleasant time with TPC's latest. Our very own Ace Trainer Alana awarded it a 7/10 in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a>, calling the new real-time combat mechanics "the best Pokémon battles have ever felt", but struggling with the whole set up of Lumiose City. Here's a snippet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A should be celebrated for its fabulous real-time combat and its largely smooth jump to the Switch 2, but in condensing things down to one single location, it loses part of the Pokémon magic that Arceus and many other entries managed to amplify.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="vf32irwF2Do" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f76a2zxwitl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>And yet, we are not the only outlet which has been getting reacquainted with Kalos; oh no! Reviews are rolling in across the board and there's actually a pretty wide range of opinions.</p>
<p>We've assembled the following round up to give you an idea of the critical consensus, picking out all the different view points so you can get a snapshot image of the overall reception. We should also point out that <em>all of the following are for the Switch 2 version only</em>.</p>
<p>We'll kick things off right at the top of the spectrum, with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/">VGC</a>'s 5/5 review billing Legends: Z-A "the best Pokémon game in many years":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In many areas, it feels like a massive departure for the series, with its new battle system and Z-A Royale structure, in particular, paying off, and once again proving that the Legends series is home to the most interesting ideas <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/companies/game-freak/" title="Companies > Game Freak [345 articles]">Game Freak</a> has.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/nintendo-switch/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">TechRadar Gaming</a> went ever so slightly lower in its 4.5/5 review, praising the how the game reinvigorates the classic formula, and packs in a cracking story and soundtrack to boot:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It finds a way to simultaneously mix things up while gripping perfectly to a few core Pokémon pillars such that the end result can feel very different yet very recognisable all at once.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Opting for a 4/5, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/">GamesRadar</a> vibed with the worldbuilding and battle system, but felt the scope of Lumiose City was perhaps a little too small:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pokemon Legends: Z-A may not be the perfect open world adventure, but its slice of life vibes and brilliant battle system changes are a real delight, and I hope this isn't the last we see of its innovations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.pockettactics.com/pokemon-legends-z-a/review">Pocket Tactics</a> went for a similar 8/10, saying that the focus on battles, solid performance and overall bravery of the damn thing is enough to outweigh its shortcomings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This game might be the bravest and boldest effort from Game Freak in as long as I can remember, and the developer is successful in a lot of ways</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a 7/10 for <a href="https://www.gfinityesports.com/article/pokemon-legends-z-a-our-review">GFinity</a>, where the outlet found Lumiose City's "claustrophobic" design to be a real tripping point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Revisiting an area in modern times in Legends felt like a good idea when I first started the game, but upon reflection, traveling back to the more ancient time in Arceus felt like a much fresher experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">Eurogamer</a> awarded Legends: Z-A a 3/5, describing it as "proof of concept" for a much bigger, better game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What we have is a kind of proof of concept. But the concept is <em>so good</em> that you can't help but feel a little frustrated to be teased with it.</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A is already playable on PC and Android devices via emulators like EDEN.</p>



<p>As showcased in a new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tabeneru">tabeneru</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases">EDEN emulator</a> can run the new entry in the popular series launching this week worldwide on PC and even Android devices rather well with the appropriate settings. </p>



<p>On PC, users don't even need a high-end system to run the game at the native 30FPS cap, as the user's system, powered by an Intel Core i5-13500 CPU and RTX 3060 Ti GPU, which is far from being the fastest system configuration, has no trouble running the game smoothly, at least in the shown segment. However, a high-end system is required to push the emulated Switch release of Pokémon Legends: Z-A past its resolution and framerate cap on PC with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44SLbqzH04M&amp;t=2s">the first mod that allows up to 4K at 60 FPS gameplay</a> shared by Youtube user FRANC225. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although Pokémon Legends: Z-A has yet to officially release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-leak-online-early-builds-pokedex-more/">early copies of the game already reached the hands of players</a>, so it's not surprising to see the game already emulated on PC. However, this ability to emulate new titles may soon change. As development shifts to the Nintendo Switch 2 exclusively, it is widely expected that it will take a long time before an effective emulator for the new console becomes available on PC.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hps-2025-intel-n150-laptop-bundle-is-back-in-stock-at-almost-80-off-and-its-not-refurbished-2000634011</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this week, Amazon was celebrated Prime Big Deals Days which had extended from October 7 to October 8. It was a great two-day stretch of time to find yourself some excellent savings on just about anything from kitchen appliances to apparel to tech. Had you been hoping to score a new laptop for yourself, but somehow missed the sales event, all is not lost just yet. You can still find some fantastic laptop deals across the website. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4760/">Like right now, this HP Intel laptop designed for students and businesses dropped its price by a staggering 76%. Amazon has the full price listed at $1,500, so after the discount, it comes down to just $365.</a> That’s a savings of $1,135.</p>
<p>Now before you get too excited, know that this discount — while good — isn’t enormous as it seems. Lots of Amazon sellers tend to jack up the list price of their offerings and then mark the product back down so that it can be labeled with a huge discount. The specs on offer here would really never justify a price of $1,500. The new $365 price tag is a much better reflection of what you’re getting. Still a great value though.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4760/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>With this 2025 HP laptop, we’re looking at an Intel N150 four-core, four-thread CPU alongside an integrated graphics card. You’ll have solid performance browsing the web and even doing some light photo or video editing. It’s working with 16GB of RAM and a storage capacity of 128GB.</p>
<p>The screen measures in at 14-inch, keeping it compact and portable to easily fit into any bag on your way to and from class. It displays in slightly above 720p at 1366 by 768 pixels. The HP True Vision 720p web camera and dual-array digital microphone allow you have crystal clear video calls, even in low light conditions.</p>



<h2>Bonus Gifts Included</h2>
<p>Included with the laptop is a set of added accessories to get you going. The HP 2025 laptop comes with a wireless mouse and CD/DVD drive which pretty much no laptop comes with on-board any more. You get a 256GB SD card which effectively triples your storage capacity. Then we also have Windows 11 Pro pre-installed as well as a one-year license to Microsoft 365 which will grant your access to Word, PowerPoint, Excel and all the other Microsoft Office apps. Plus that comes with OneDrive so you can save files to the cloud and access them from any device.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4760/">For a limited time, you can get the HP laptop with all these additional accessories for just $365.</a></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-raichu-ranked-2000625708"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is just a few days away and already </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-leaks-switch-2-image-mega-evolution-2000630717"><span>leaking all over the internet</span></a><span>, but that’s not the only leak coming out of Game Freak right now. It’s been a full year since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688"><span>the massive Teraleak</span></a><span> revealed more information about upcoming </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games and anime, and now, the same leaker is releasing some new alleged details on even more future projects. This includes information about the 10th-generation games for the Switch 2, but also the next </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>game, and a new MMO that might give some fans something they’ve been asking for for years.</span></p> <p><span>The leaks have begun circulating through </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>leak accounts, and include details and concepts for five upcoming games, and a loose timeline for the next five to six years of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> development. But keep in mind that even if these projects are at some stage of development at Game Freak, pipelines shift, ideas can be scaled back from their initial concepts, and some of these games could be internally canceled and never formally announced.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The biggest info dump is for what appear to be the Generation X games: </span><i><span>Pokémon Wind</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pokémon Wave</span></i><span>. Game Freak is apparently targeting a 2026 launch for these games, and they will be Switch 2 exclusives. The games will be set in a region inspired by Southeast Asia, which contradicts original reports that Gen X would be based in a Greece-like region.</span><i><span> Wind</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i><span> will lean hard into the open-world exploration of recent games like</span><i><span> Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, with procedurally generated islands for the player to traverse. There will also be underwater areas that you can dive into and explore further. Game Freak also appears to have DLC in the works that will launch in 2027.</span></p>

This game will apparently return to the past like </span><i><span>Legends: Arceus</span></i><span> after </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s modern-day detour, and will be set 1000 years before the events of </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>. Part of the game will focus on the player creating the first Gigantamax Poké Ball, which is used to capture the massive kaiju Pokémon in the Galar region. Game Freak’s pitch documents for the game liken it to </span><i><span>Xenoblade Chronicles X</span></i><span>, implying it may have real-time elements in its combat systems. This may also include boss battles against Gigantamax Pokémon, though the leaks only show concept images of those at this time.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">From Game Freak docs:</p> <p>“Remakes made for Black and White onwards should have a lot more love and care put into them.

Like in</span><i><span> Legends: Arceus</span></i><span>, the player would have been transported to the past from modern times. Eventually, Game Freak shelved this in favor of the modern story in Kalos that became </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. I’d like to think the team could revisit this project down the line, but now that it’s been leaked like this, that feels unlikely.</span></p> <p><span>That’s a lot to digest all at once. The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>pipeline is a well-oiled machine of nearly annual releases at this point, so it’s not surprising that several projects could be in some stage of development all at once. A lot of these games sound very ambitious, so hopefully the extra year of development Game Freak got by skipping 2024 helps them reach that potential. </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> is coming to Switch and Switch 2 on October 16, and was originally planned to launch last year, so we’ll see how much that extra development time paid off.</span></p>

<p>If you can’t bear to wait a few more days, one final ARC Raiders Open Beta test awaits. It’s known as the ‘Server Slam Test,’ and it’s trying to ascertain server stability and functionality. Check out its dates and how you can take part in the final hurdle before launch.</p>



<p>There are no more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> delays on the cards. We know the devs thought the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-delay-explained-embark-game-not-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game was “Not Fun,”</a> hence earlier delays. We are now about as locked in as you’ll need to be once you set foot in Speranza and the surface for real this time. But just in case, Embark Studios has unleashed one final open beta test for ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>It’s a server stress test to find out how many players are likely to pop in on release day, and how the servers will handle the enormous amount of pressure likely heading the shooter’s way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It's not as far in the future as we thought.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-pokemon-game-pokemon-presents-2024">When Pokémon Legends: Z-A was first revealed,</a> we all immediately got to work speculating on when it would take place in the Pokémon timeline. Not where, we knew that: it takes place entirely in Lumiose City from Pokémon X and Y's Kalos region. But given that Legends: Arceus was a time-traveling narrative going back hundreds of years into Sinnoh's past, we had every expectation based on trailers that Z-A would be many, many years in Lumiose City's future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We were incorrect! We now know exactly when it takes place, and it's not nearly as big a leap as you'd think.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've been playing Pokémon Legends: Z-A for review and the embargo has now lifted. So we can confirm, from first-hand experience talking to multiple characters (most of which we unfortunately can't directly cite or show due to the ongoing embargo restrictions), that Z-A takes place just five years after the events of X and Y. It's not a time traveling narrative, it's a direct sequel that offers a follow-up to many of the characters and situations introduced in X and Y.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, we already know that you get to hang out with AZ, a 3,000-year-old man who plays a pivotal role in X and Y. We also know that Mable, a former member of Team Flare, takes on the role of Pokémon professor in this game and sends you out to catch Pokémon with various challenges. Other characters you'll remember from X and Y show up as well, some of them dramatically changed, but we can't and won't spoil them just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Legends: Z-A being a direct sequel is actually a pretty big deal. The Pokémon universe has been real hand-wavey with how the different games and regions relate to one another over the years. While there have been some direct sequels before (Gold and Silver after Red and Blue, Black and White 2 after Black and White, etc), later games have introduced time travel (Legends: Arceus), alternative universes (Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire), and basically every game has implied that all the other games' locations and monsters exist in the same world, but events taking place in those games may or may not be canon depending on which one you're playing. The Pokémon timeline, if drawn out, probably looks far more ridiculous than the Zelda one at this point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if you were wondering what happened to most of the main cast of X and Y five years after the events of the game, here you go: this is just a straightforward sequel! In hindsight, we should have seen this coming when they named it "Z-A" after X and Y.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">review-in-progress of Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is now live, if you want to check out my impressions of the first 24 hours, with a full review coming next week. I've also been writing about how the Nurse Joy job is now open to people who don't look exactly identical to the original Nurse Joy after 27 years in Z-A.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Review codes for Pokémon Legends: Z-A were only sent out less than a week ago, but I’ve already put in around 24 hours or so in the last five days. Across that time I’ve been catching every new species of Pokémon I find, doing every side quest that pops up, and stopping every so often to completely change my outfit. I’ve currently got a full team all in the level 50s, and I can’t wait to stop writing this review-in-progress to go play more. It’s real good so far!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ah, feels nice to say that after, uh… <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-the-teal-mask-dlc-review"><u>this</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a few reasons why I don’t feel comfortable scoring Z-A right now. Apart from simply not having beaten it yet, the embargo we’re publishing this under is pretty strict about what we can and can’t say or show. We always try to avoid spoilers (and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-datamining-begins-fans-warn-that-the-pokmon-legends-z-a-spoiler-floodgates-have-now-opened"><u>recent leaks</u></a> mean plenty are already in the wild), but here we can’t even talk about basic plot details that happen literally in the first 10 minutes. We can’t mention loads of the specific Pokémon in Z-A, despite the fact that any number of them might casually roam across our footage at any time. We can’t even show you the map of Lumiose City, where everything in Z-A takes place. It’s difficult to say exactly how close to the credits 24 hours puts me, but I’ll likely be back with my final, scored review shortly after launch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also haven’t had the chance to test it on Nintendo Switch 1 ahead of time, although I am at least so happy to report that Pokémon Legends: Z-A runs great <em>on Nintendo Switch 2</em>. It glides along at a smooth framerate with very, very few hitches or hiccups. There is occasionally still some sudden pop-in of NPCs, including ones positioned very close to the player, and here and there I’ve seen a character do that creepy thing where their head and neck suddenly snap into place as I get closer. But critically, unlike <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review"><u>Scarlet and Violet</u></a>, none of this is horribly distracting, nor does it really detract from the overall experience. Because of Scarlet and Violet, I spent the first 20 minutes or so paying close attention to whether or not Z-A ran well. But then, after that, I barely thought about it again, a state of mind which I consider ideal. Here’s hoping that’s still the case with the Switch 1 version, which I will take into consideration as part of my final review either way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Running well doesn’t equate to a game being pretty, of course, and Z-A isn’t going to win any beauty contests. Lumiose City looks fine. Its buildings are covered with mostly flat images of the same couple of window and terrace patterns over and over again. Up close, the effect is pretty weird – like someone painted a Looney Tunes door on a wall so Roadrunner would crash into it. The samey buildings are broken up with occasional trees, battle courts, parks, and the same bench copy-pasted about 100 times. There’s a greyish sewer system with greyish water running through it, and rooftops occasionally interrupted by same-looking cafe set-ups. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The reduced scale of this world has worked in Game Freak’s favor.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, I do think that the reduced scale of the world has worked in Game Freak’s favor with Z-A when compared to, say, Arceus or Scarlet and Violet. The city is smaller, so it’s more densely packed with trainers, Pokémon, items, shops, and other actually interesting things to see and do. I’m not running for minutes on end through massive fields of flat, GameCube-style textures, with nary a point of interest in sight. As a result, similar to Z-A’s performance, it was easy to stop thinking about the low-quality building design fairly early on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s also helped by the fact that building interiors and the character and Pokémon models themselves look pretty good, and the human characters in particular are more varied than ever before. While almost every NPC you meet in the city is categorized by trainer type and given an appearance to match, Game Freak is now experimenting not just with diverse facial features and skin tones, but also clothing items. We saw some of this in Scarlet and Violet, but almost everyone was wearing school uniforms, so it wasn’t nearly as noticeable. Now, you might see two athletic trainers wearing differently colored versions of the same athletic gear, or two artists with different colored aprons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Small a touch as this sounds, combining that with facial differences does a lot to make Lumiose City feel inhabited by many different, diverse people instead of the same 10 trainer types repeated ad nauseum. That customizability extends to the protagonist, too. There are tons of hair, facial, and fashion choices to choose from, including new options to mix and match certain types of outfits (different undershirts with different jackets, for instance). It’s a massively refreshing improvement after spending most of Pokémon Violet expressing myself via the same four ugly purple uniforms and a variety of mismatched hats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another element that I think elevates Lumiose City far above the much larger overworld of Scarlet and Violet is that it’s dense with interesting landmarks, items, obstacle courses, stores, Wild Zones, shops, and people. Lumiose is round, with different streets running out from the center like wheel spokes, and the entirety of it is open to you within just a few hours of starting your journey. You can, if you want, scour the whole map very early on, though it won’t be especially interesting at first blush. But over time, you’ll gradually unlock new ways to get around and new things to see when you get there: a new travel method that lets you scale scaffolding to collect rare items at the top, new ways to get onto buildings and Assassin’s Creed your way to little nooks of the city you couldn’t quite reach before, and new Wild Areas teeming with new Pokémon to catch. That steady unlocking of a city you always had free reign of adds to the feeling of getting to know a new place you’ve just moved to.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Every Pokémon location in Lumiose City feels deliberate and well-considered.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploration is often rewarded, too. While I criticized Scarlet and Violet for just sort of slapping large quantities of Pokémon haphazardly over a big map, especially in later areas, every single spawn location in Lumiose City feels deliberate and well-considered. A line of trash bins might not have anything interesting to see when you pass by on one visit, but there could be a Trubbish on top the next. Flocks of Pidgey and Fletchling scatter as you dash into a courtyard. Spinarak regard you calmly while hanging from tree branches. If you really explore, you might encounter a rare dragon-type on a rooftop (the embargo forbids me from saying which one despite the fact that its evolutions have been confirmed for the game already); a Spritzee floating idly in a hidden cafe; once, I turned just in time to see an Eevee sprint past me into an alleyway, and I barely threw a PokeBall quickly enough to catch it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I won’t (and can’t) spoil too much of the story, but what I can talk about is the interesting rhythm it establishes that feels, in practice, quite different from any other Pokémon game so far. Like Arceus, Z-A foregoes the traditional “gather eight badges” structure, though here you’ll divide their time between day and night – during the day, you’ll be catching Pokémon in Wild Zones, battling rogue Mega Evolved Pokémon, performing goofy side quest errands for individuals around the city, shopping, and exploring. At night, you have the option to visit Battle Zones where you take on trainers and complete challenges to raise your score and eventually collect a Challenger’s Ticket, which unlocks your promotion match for the next level of the “Z-A Royale.” There are 26 ranks total, one for each letter of the alphabet. I am currently at rank D, though I wish this was slightly more fleshed out as a proper competitive mode rather than just a story vehicle – for instance, you don’t exactly spend a meaningful amount of time at every single one of the 26 letter ranks.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Pokemon Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll have more to say on this in the final review, free from my embargo shackles, but I am really enjoying the story so far. Ditching the eight badge trainer journey like Arceus before it allows Game Freak to flesh out a deeper, more interesting cast of characters, both the heroes and the villains. There’s simply more reason for them to be where you are, doing things alongside you and participating in the world-changing events you’re experiencing. I’m also fascinated by how much Z-A appears to be inspired by the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series. The enclosed city setting, the absurd and silly tone of the side quests, the story’s concerns with community and civic issues, and the protagonist bopping around a metro area solving problems by being absurdly stronger than everyone else all lend Lumiose City big Kamurocho energy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which leads me to the meat and potatoes of any Pokémon game: the battling. With Z-A, Pokémon has gone full action game. Not a turn-based battle in sight. While I don’t think I want Pokémon to fully depart from doing turn-based combat forever, this works pretty well as a detour. Game Freak did an admirable job translating its traditional battle system into one that works in an active-time environment, especially with moves seemingly so specific to the turn-based format. Protect and Detect now stop damage for a set period of time instead of one “turn.” Spikes dumps, well, spikes all over the floor in an area, forcing you to steer your Pokémon out of it. Long-range moves keep Pokémon out of harm’s way, but take longer to execute and recharge than more risky, short-range ones. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are a lot of new tactics and strategies to mess around with.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a lot of new tactics and strategies to mess around with, such as how movement and dodging works. You control your trainer directly, and can either hold ZL to open the move select menu to send your active Pokémon into the fray, or release it to have them follow you around, allowing you to guide them while dodging. This makes for an interesting combat flow as I strategize around calling my Pokémon back to me to dodge an attack, then positioning them ideally to set up their next move before the opponent can swing again. The system is a bit awkward at times, especially in enclosed areas, but I’m interested to see what a competitive meta looks like with this format.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These tactics grow even more critical and chaotic in boss battles with Rogue Mega Evolved Pokémon, of which Z-A has many. These battles all take place in uniform, wide, circular arenas, but the Pokémon themselves are far from ordinary. Rogue Mega Evolved Pokémon are essentially Z-A’s answer to Arceus’ Frenzied Noble Pokémon. In addition to their regular movesets, they each have additional unique abilities you’ll have to avoid, such as turning the arena into a bullet hell you have to dodge around, or suddenly appearing right in front of you for an attack. Like in Arceus, your trainer can get hit and even die (sorry, I mean “black out”) if they’re attacked too many times by an enemy Pokémon, and that becomes a legit concern as Rogue Megas will enrage partway through and try to attack you directly.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Rebekah's Favorite Pokemon Games</h3><p>All my favorite Pokemon games from over the years! In no particular order. (but Crystal IS number one)</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The best way to counter this is to Mega Evolve your own Pokémon or use “Plus” moves, which are superpowered versions of regular moves that also consume the energy you need to Mega Evolve. Unlike in Pokémon X and Y, where you could get away with fighting Mega Evolved Pokémon with regular monsters, you really do need to engage with the Mega mechanics in Z-A. Though it starts off pretty tame, Z-A quickly ramps up the difficulty – even doing every side quest, I’m still finding its boss battles will make me sweat a little.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Man, I was going to try and hold back a bit on this review-in-progress since I still have plenty to see before my final review, but I’m just so genuinely excited about what Game Freak has done here. I liked Arceus a fair amount and thought it showed promise, but have been broadly disappointed with the slow backslide I saw from the studio in its move to console game development, and worried the quality dip was a new trend for 3D Pokémon games that we’d never escape. Pokémon Legends: Z-A, at least across the first two-dozen hours, is putting a lot of my fears to rest. It’s not revolutionary by any stretch, but it’s really good! I’m having fun, I’m excited to keep playing, I feel rewarded for exploring every corner, the story’s got my attention, and I’m not distracted by my Pokémon falling through the floor while they battle or everything crashing when I try to climb a ladder. If the rest of my adventure holds up (and the Switch 1 performance isn’t a disaster), we could finally have a 3D game worthy of the Pokémon franchise on our hands. It’d be about dang time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review]]></content:encoded>

This comes as a response to Sora 2’s ability to generate videos featuring the likenesses of copyrighted characters from anime and video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sora 2, which OpenAI launched on October 1, is capable of generating 20-second long videos at 1080p resolution, complete with sound. Soon after its release, social media was flooded with videos generated by the app, many of which contained depictions of copyrighted characters including those from popular anime and game franchises such as One Piece, Demon Slayer, Pokémon, and Mario.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking at the Japanese government’s Cabinet Office press conference on Friday, Minoru Kiuchi (the minister of state for IP and AI strategy) informed attendees about the government’s request, which called on the American organization to refrain from infringing on Japanese IPs. The request was reportedly made online by the Cabinet Office’s Intellectual Property Strategy Headquarters. Kiuchi went on to describe manga and anime as “irreplaceable treasures” that Japan boasts to the world. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/gettyimages-2175283205-1760445251099.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Minoru Kiuchi described manga and anime as “irreplaceable treasures” that Japan boasts to the world.

However, it also lays down some principles for dealing with problematic AI use, including copyright infringement. <a href="https://www.kojimalaw.jp/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Japan-AI-Promotion-Act-KOJIMA-LAW-OFFICES-jp-en-reference-translation.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Article 16</u></a> of the AI Promotion act covers research and investigation and says that the government may “analyze cases in which citizens’ rights or interests have been infringed upon through research, development, or utilization of AI-related technology conducted for improper purposes or by inappropriate methods, and consider countermeasures based on those analyses.” However, as noted by the <a href="https://fpf.org/blog/understanding-japans-ai-promotion-act-an-innovation-first-blueprint-for-ai-regulation/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Future of Privacy Forum</u></a>, the act does not specify any clear penalties for misuse of AI, but instead calls on business operators to <a href="https://www8.cao.go.jp/cstp/ai/ai_hou_gaiyou_en.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>cooperate with the measures</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A member of Japan’s ruling LDP party with a seat in the country’s parliament (the Diet), politician Akihisa Shiozaki has written extensively about Sora 2 and its legal implications on his <a href="https://akihisa-shiozaki.jp/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official X account,</u></a> and <a href="https://note.com/akihisa_shiozaki/n/n40ebca032aff" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>noted</u></a>: “the release of Sora 2 has once again highlighted the issue of AI and copyright."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, he also insisted this challenge is an opportunity: “Japan bears a responsibility to take the lead on making rules (related to AI and copyright infringement), precisely because we are a country that has captivated the world with the creative power of anime, games, and music.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openais-new-sora-video-generator-require-copyright-holders-opt-out-wsj-reports-2025-09-29/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reported</u></a> on September 29 that OpenAI had contacted studios and talent agencies a week before Sora 2’s launch, giving them the option to opt out. However, it was not specified which studios were contacted. Whether major Japanese creative companies and studios were contacted or not is unclear, but the fact that Sora 2 can generate videos containing the likenesses of Japanese characters has triggered a lot of backlash on Japanese-speaking social media. <a href="https://x.com/wep0duRLxt5zdHQ/status/1975146521822990447" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Criticism</u></a> has been leveled, not only at OpenAI, but also at the Japanese government and Japanese IP holders for their perceived failure to respond swiftly enough to the infringement dangers posed by AI.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/gettyimages-2236544077-1759743013545-1760444768008.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called Sora 2 videos using copyrighted characters "interactive fan fiction."

Altman also made a specific refefence to Japan, saying: “in particular, we'd like to acknowledge the remarkable creative output of Japan — we are struck by how deep the connection between users and Japanese content is!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, at the time of writing, there has been no formal response from OpenAI regarding the Japanese government’s latest request.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-issues-official-statement-in-response-to-generative-ai-claim-as-openai-ceo-sam-altman-calls-sora-2-copyrighted-character-videos-interactive-fan-fiction">Nintendo took the unusual step of issuing an official statement</a> seemingly in response to comments from Satoshi Asano, a member of Japan’s House of Representatives. In a deleted social media post he subsequently apologized for, Asano accused Nintendo of “avoiding using generative AI to protect its IP” and "engaging in lobbying activities with the government" over the increased use of generative AI in the gaming industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo denied this, but did warn it would take “necessary actions against infringement of our intellectual property rights.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Contrary to recent discussions on the internet, Nintendo has not had any contact with the Japanese government about generative AI,” <a href="https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1974716195246088220" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo said</a>. “Whether generative AI is involved or not, we will continue to take necessary actions against infringement of our intellectual property rights.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Disney and Universal have sued the AI image creator Midjourney, alleging that the company improperly used and distributed AI-generated characters from their movies. Disney also sent a cease and desist letter to Character.AI, warning the startup to stop using its copyrighted characters without authorization.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of the videos that people are going to generate of these cartoon characters are going to infringe copyright,” Mark Lemley, a professor at Stanford Law School, told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/04/sora-openai-video-app.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a>. “OpenAI is opening itself up to quite a lot of copyright lawsuits by doing this.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, the famously litigious The Pokémon Company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this">formally responded to the use of Pokémon TV hero Ash Ketchum and the series' theme tune by the Department of Homeland Security</a>, as part of a video showing people being arrested and handcuffed by law enforcement agents.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Square Enix has announced a new entry in its Dissidia Final Fantasy series, and it has a surprising premise. The game, which is coming to mobile devices next year, still features a who's who of Final Fantasy protagonists but unfolds in the modern day.</p><p>Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy is set in current-day Tokyo, albeit a version that has a giant crystal at its center. This crystal appeared in the city some time ago, but by the time the game begins, the population has already adapted to its strange presence. That is, a negative energy pollutes the crystal, causing monsters to pour out of it and invade the city.&nbsp;</p><p>These creatures aren’t the only things to emerge; warriors hailing from various Final Fantasy games also arrive to save the day. But when they’re not fighting monsters, characters like Cloud and Lightning have assimilated into society and live ordinary lives (which includes wearing contemporary clothing) until they’re needed again, almost like they’re superheroes.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zLM7V3jrNNc?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zLM7V3jrNNc?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In addition to a main story, which is fully voiced in Japanese, players will witness the daily lives of these FF heroes in short episodes. That includes text chats featuring characters such as Terra sharing their new outfits for other characters, like Warrior of Light, to comment on.&nbsp;</p><p>Gameplay-wise, Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy features 3v3 team boss battles as two teams race to defeat a giant boss the fastest, all while battling e roaming monsters along the way. As a mobile game, Dissidia's third-person action is designed to be played using only one hand.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has officially announced its next Dissidia game in the Final Fantasy spin-off series, coming to mobile devices next year.</p>
<p>Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasys-beloved-fighting-spin-off-is-soon-set-to-make-a-return">teased yesterday</a> and then officially revealed today, with sign ups for its closed beta test now open (but only in the US and Canada).</p>
<p>While the trailer only hints at expected gameplay, it will feature 3 vs 3 battles with teams aiming to defeat monsters and bosses before their rivals.</p>

<p>There will also be some form of Bravery system to allow characters to unleash their full power, and it's all set in modern day Tokyo featuring a wealth of stars from across the Final Fantasy series.</p>
<p>"A peaceful everyday life, visited by chaos," the trailer teases. "Those who arrived to confront the chaos were called 'Ghosts'."</p>
<p>Ability illustrations will also be drawn by popular artists, and players will be able to customise their warriors with different outfits</p>
<p>The game is coming to iOS and Android devices next year, with <a href="https://www.square-enix.com/ddff/en/cbt/">recruitment available</a> for the closed beta test running until 28th October. The test will take place from 7th - 14th November on Android only.</p>
<p>The trailer ends with a tease of more characters set to join the game.</p>

<p>Creative producer on the game (and series veteran) Tetsuya Nomura shared a message about the game on social media, celebrating the long-running spin-off series.</p>
<p>"Duellum is the sixth installment in the series, and as you can see from the world setting and visuals, it is another aspirational title packed with many new undertakings and ways for the staff to challenge themselves," he said.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-will-reportedly-arrive-on-nintendo-switch-2-in-december-2025.1324447/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows hasn't officially been announced for the Nintendo Switch 2, but we've seen multiple rumours, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-assassins-creed-shadows-ports/">even dating back to August 2024</a>, that the game would arrive on Nintendo's new console. After the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gets-rated-for-nintendo-switch-2/">was rated by PEGI earlier this year</a>, it seemed like a lock that an announcement would arrive soon, likely at the next Nintendo Direct event.</p>



<p>There have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-announced-friday-september-12/">multiple chances for the game to show up at a Nintendo Direct</a> event since the rating went live, and still we've heard nothing, but a <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/assassins-creed-shadows-debarquera-bientot-sur-switch-2-on-vous-devoile-la-date-de-sortie-60629">new report from Billbil-kun at Dealabs</a> seems to have told us both when the game will arrive on Nintendo Switch 2 and when we'll hear about it.</p>



<p>According to the report, the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Assassin's Creed Shadows will be officially announced at some point before November 7, 2025, while the actual release date of the new version is expected to be December 5, 2025. Dealabs also reports that it expects the new version to be priced at "<em>around € 50</em>."</p>



<p>If Shadows arrives on Nintendo Switch 2 before the end of the year, then it'll be the second major Ubisoft title to make its way to the device after Star Wars Outlaws, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">which was actually a pleasant surprise in terms of its performance</a>. Hopefully, Assassin's Creed Shadows <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlKCBGzrB1I">follows in those footsteps</a>, and we're able to see the Nintendo Switch 2 continue to punch above its weight class and keep up, as best it can, with current-generation releases.</p>



<p>Its arrival in December would also technically make it the first 'new release' for the Assassin's Creed series under <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Ubisoft's new subsidiary with Tencent, Vantage Studios</a>. </p>



<p>For more on Assassin's Creed Shadows, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">you can check out our review from its initial release in March</a>, where Francesco De Meo gave the game an 8.7/10, saying, "<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em>" </p>

If you’re not interested in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/788141/steelseries-arctis-nova-elite-review">$599.99 Nova Elite</a> or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23132836/steelseries-nova-pro-wireless-review-gaming-bluetooth-anc">$349.99 Nova Pro</a>, the Nova 7 Gen 2 is SteelSeries’ more affordable midrange option at $199.99.</p><p>The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-headsets%2Farctis-nova-7-gen-2%3Fcolor%3Dblack%26primaryPlatform%3Dpc" rel="sponsored">Arctis Nova 7 Gen 2</a> matches the aesthetics of SteelSeries’ high-end headsets, but it’s missing the swappable battery system, active noise cancellation, and the wireless base station. Still, the Nova 7 Gen 2’s impressive battery life improvements mean that this latest version can run up to 54 hours before you need to charge it via USB-C.</p><p>You’ll also still get simultaneous audio through a 2.4GHz connection and Bluetooth audio, meaning you can mix together audio from your PC or game console and your phone. The headset connects wirelessly to a PC, PlayStation, Switch, Xbox, phone, or tablet through a small L-shaped USB-C dongle.</p><p>The Arctis Nova 7 Gen 2 also includes support for real-time audio control through SteelSeries’ Arctis mobile app. It includes more than 200 presets for a variety of games, and these presets improve the audio EQ for each individual title. If you’re playing on PC, you can even use SteelSeries’ GG app to automatically switch audio presets depending on which game you’re playing.</p><p>Much like the Nova Pro and Nova Elite, the Nova 7 Gen 2 also includes a noise-canceling microphone. The boom mic can be hidden within the headset and even disabled if you want to use your own microphone on a PC.</p><p>SteelSeries’ Arctis Nova 7 Gen 2 is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-products%2Farctis-nova-7-gen2" rel="sponsored">available today</a>, priced at $199.99 / £179.99 / €199.99.
