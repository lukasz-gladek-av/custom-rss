		<p>Jaw Drop Games has released its co-op dinosaur survival horror Deathground into Early Access on Steam, with a 15% launch discount. Its regular price will be $14.99 / €14.79 / £11.99. The development team has also released a roadmap of what player should expect for the future of Deathground, including additional content.</p>
<p><iframe title="Deathground | Dinosaur Survival Horror Game | Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-WcSU8wAHhU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Deathground has launched with six operatives to choose from including Scout, Medic, Observer, Engineer, Survivalist, and Hunter. There are two AI enemy types with those being the Utahraptor and Compsognathus, two training grounds and three missions across three maps. Those missions are Restart the Power Plant on the Geothermal map, Spray The Greenhouse in the Agricultural map, and Secure The Specimen in the Biomedical map. Players also have access to four tools with those being the motion detector, hacking device, tranquilizer gun, and and a med kit. Following on from today, there will be monthly mini updates which will add two story events, three sub missions, three items, and bug fixes. In the future, the Allosaurus will be added along with two more maps with associated missions, more story events, proximity chat, and two more loadout items. Even further down the line, more enemies will be added with even more story events, maps, missions, items, and collectables.</p>
<p>In Deathground, teams of up to four players have to work together to complete the missions while trying to survive the threat of dinosaurs that are hunting them. Deathground was first announced back in 2020, so it has been a long journey for the game to stomp on to Steam.</p>

<p>More reveals coming next week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you've played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> with a friend in local co-op, then you know how chaotic things can get. Heck, if you've played enough of it on your own and come up with a ridiculous screen-filling build, then you've seen how far you can push the limits.</p>
<p>Well, poncle is <em>finally</em> adding online co-op to the "bullet heaven" game in version 1.14, which is coming this Autumn. Up to four players will be able to join a room and fight their way through various Vampire Survivors stages.</p>
<p>But it's only the first in a line of updates that the developer will be revealing over the course of the next month — with the next reveal coming "next week". Four more updates are coming, so we're waiting with bated (garlic) breath.</p>
<p>For now, here's a rundown of online co-op:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Online Co-Op is coming to Vampire Survivors this Autumn on PC and consoles!</p>
<p>Play online with up to 3 other friends from around the world, just as Poe Ratcho intended. (That’s 4 players in total!)</p>
<p>Free roam the stages whilst your friend struggles to find their way through Astral Stair, or maybe see if you can all survive Room 1665… More players doesn’t make it easier, or does it?</p>
<p>Autumn is our time to shine, so be sure to come back next week to see what the following card will reveal… we might finally answer a burning question that has been asked thousands of times</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The game's last free update added <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-owners-might-want-to-check-out-this-handy-update-for-vampire-survivors">cross-save to the Switch version back in June 2025</a>. And in April, Square Enix teamed up with Square Enix to make a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/vampire-survivors-and-square-enix-team-up-for-free-dlc-but-its-not-the-series-youd-expect">SaGa-themed DLC</a>.</p>
<p>Will we get a good ol' Switch 2 Edition? Mouse controls? Time will tell!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA announced the availability of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/campaigns/arc-raiders-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders GeForce RTX 50 Series bundle</a>.

The best (and pretty much <em>only</em>) solution is to buy an expansion card from Seagate or Western Digital. You can store Xbox games on a USB external hard drive, yes, but you’ll need to re-transfer them to the system’s internal storage to play them. An expansion card allows you to play games from your library without having to move anything around.</p><p>Fortunately, you can pick up a <strong>512GB WD Black C50 expansion card</strong> for $85.99 ($8 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Expansion-Officially-Licensed-Consoles/dp/B0C44B1VSH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, which is its second-lowest price since May. <strong>Western Digital’s 1TB expansion card</strong> is on sale for around $119.99 ($30 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Expansion-Officially-Licensed-Consoles/dp/B0C44XVWCH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fwd-c50-1tb-storage-expansion-card-for-xbox-series-xs-gaming-console-ssd-black%2FJXJ62C6RX8" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, which is its lowest price since July, though it’s $20 shy of beating that price.</p><p><strong>Seagate’s storage expansion card</strong>, meanwhile, starts in a 1TB configuration, and is discounted to around $123.49 ($30.50 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fseagate-1tb-storage-expansion-card-for-xbox-series-xs-internal-nvme-ssd-black%2FJ37C5HZ2W7" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, which is lower than it was last Prime Day.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Current Game Pass Ultimate subscribers <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-hike-cod-2000632122">are getting hit with the new 50-percent price hike</a> on November 4, but only in some countries. Microsoft recently confirmed that fans in places like Poland and Korea can remain at the lower monthly price if they stay subscribed. Not so for Xbox users in the U.S.</p> <p>The confusion started when some fans started sharing the emails they’d received from Microsoft about Game Pass Ultimate going from $20 a month to $30. While some of those messages informed players about a price hike they’d see next time they renewed their subscription, others were told the pricing wouldn’t change unless they ended their subscriptions and later resumed them. Microsoft has now confirmed that the delay is only for users in some markets like Austria, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Korea, Poland, and India. Players in the U.S. and UK will see the changes take affect as planned on November 4.</p>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is that one real. I got one saying tough it’s going up. <a href="https://t.co/EHbqiWvCr8">pic.twitter.com/EHbqiWvCr8</a></p> <p>— I play games (@G_Obertron) <a href="https://twitter.com/G_Obertron/status/1975558838607839518?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <div> <p>“Our recent Game Pass update remains unchanged. Current subscribers in certain countries will continue renewing at their existing price for now, in line with local requirements. We’ll provide advance notice before price adjustments take effect in these countries,” Kari Perez, head of Xbox communications, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/794032/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-changes-countries">told <em>The Verge</em></a> in a new statement.</p> <p>Why the discrepancy? Some have been speculating it has to do with local laws restricting how companies can hike subscription prices and the amount of heads-up they have to give consumers. Either way, it’s a bummer for any Xbox fan in the U.S. who thought they might be getting an unexpected reprieve from the latest Xbox price hikes. Microsoft also recently confirmed that Game Pass subscribers are <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-game-pass-call-duty-points-discount-changes-2000631483">no longer eligible for 10 percent off of DLC</a> and other add-on content. That perk’s been replaced by an overhauled rewards program.</p> </div>

If so, you may be the perfect candidate for the new game show that NBC is piloting. <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/wordle-tv-series-jimmy-fallon-pilot-nbc-1236569567/" rel="nofollow ">Deadline</a> has reported that the show is being filmed in the United Kingdom.</p><p dir="ltr">Savannah Guthrie, known for her role on NBC's Today show and other journalistic work, will host the show. The project comes from Jimmy Fallon’s Electric Hot Dog company, Universal Television Alternative Studio, and The New York Times. Fallon, who has said he is "addicted" to Wordle on The Tonight Show, will serve as an executive producer.</p><p dir="ltr">This show follows The New York Times’ acquisition of the Wordle, which was originally created by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle in 2022. The daily puzzle is still hugely popular. Last year, it was played 5.3 billion times, up from 4.8 billion in 2023. Everyone plays it, even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-new-pope-plays-wordle-and-words-with-friends-and-he-just-watched-conclave/1100-6531417/" data-ref-id="1100-6531417">Pope Leo</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">This news doesn't necessarily mean that a Wordle game show will eventually air on NBC or Peacock.

      <div><p>Today, the Shift RPG Kickstarter project has gone live. This new TTRPG, published by Hit Point Press, aims to be a more accessible experience for players new to the hobby. It' a pitch that is paying off since the project was fully funded the day of launch.</p>



<p>According to the official <em>Shift RPG</em> Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shiftrpg/shift-rpg/description" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, this new TTRPG is designed to bring a rich experience to the table without hundreds of pages of rules or additional supplements. On the GM side, it is designed to be less cumbersome thanks to streamlined rules.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shift-rpg-gaming-table-artwork.jpg?itok=YCG35sy3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shift-rpg-gaming-table-artwork.jpg?itok=dff4JfFw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The big unique selling point is the World Spark. These are a series of micro-settings with enough detail to get players' imaginations going. These micro settings are designed by industry creatives. The ones mentioned in the campaign a sci-fi western world by Carlos Cisco (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>), and a post-apocalyptic setting by Joseph Carriker (Fantasy AGE).</p>

<p>The Shift RPG Kickstarter is transparent with its influences in the campaign page. It cites various genre properties as inspiration for its atmosphere and fiction such as Transformers, Batman: The Animated Series, and classic Final Fantasy, but mechanic-lite, storytelling rich TTRPG systems like <em>FATE Core</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/john-harper-announces-blades-in-dark-deep-cuts-ttrpgs-first-official-supplement" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Blades in the Dark</em></a>, and <em>Mothership</em>.</p>

<p>The fundamental system involves the Trait and Shift Die mechanic. Traits represents a character, vehicle, item, or monster's strengths and weaknesses. Those strengths and weaknesses determine what Shift Die you use to resolve a skill test, which ranges from a D4 to a D12. A 1,2, or 3 is a success, which means the lower the die face, the better. But if you roll the highest number on your die, the die face goes up.</p>

<p>The different pledge tiers for the Shift RPG Kickstarter are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Print'N'Play PDF for $19:</strong> A digital copy of&nbsp; the game, a set of three reference sheets, and all unlocked PDF stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Softcover Book for $29:</strong> Everything from Print'N'Play tier, and a physical softcover copy of the game</li>
	<li><strong>Hardcover Book for $39:</strong> Everything from the Print'N'Play tier, and a physical hardcover copy of the game</li>
	<li><strong>Deluxe Hardcover Book for $59:</strong> Everything from the Print'N'Play tier, and a deluxe physical hardcover copy of the game illustrated by Elliot&nbsp; Bouriot</li>
	<li><strong>Shift Starter Box for $65:</strong> Everything from the Print'N'Play tier, and a Starter Set box that includes a physical hardcover copy of the game, a set of 3 notepads, and a GM Screen</li>
	<li><strong>Shift Deluxe Box Set for $85:</strong> Everything from the Print'N'Play tier, and a Starter Set box containing a deluxe physical hardcover copy of the game</li>
	<li><strong>All-In Bundle for $159:</strong> Everything in the Shift Deluxe Box Set and Shift Starter Box tiers, and four sets of dice</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Shift RPG</em> Kickstarter has raised&nbsp;$27,169, more than five times its initial funding goal of $5,000. The campaign concludes on November 6.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jared-leto%E2%80%99s-tron-ares-is-getting-demolished-in-some-early-reviews.1319026/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The year is 2025. An entertainment industrial complex once riding high on a new generation of bankable stars and fresh IP now faces increasing decline and desperation as it strip-mines what remains of its old energy reserves. Enter <em>Tron: Ares</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-tron-3-ad-features-mr-beast-tron-ares-disney-2000623530">a fall blockbuster that seems to exist entirely</a> to breathe new life into an old franchise and that accidentally commits the company’s latest act of stomach-turning necromancy instead. The first wave of reviews is in, and it does not paint a very flattering picture of Jared Leto’s latest vessel for renewed relevance.</p> <p><em>Tron: Ares</em> (2025) is a sequel to <em>Tron: Legacy</em> (2010) which was a follow-up to the original<em> Tron</em> (1982). It features Leto as the titular Ares, an advanced program sent by a defense contractor into the real world to attack a gaming company in a race to perfect a technology that can make digital objects exist in real life. Leto is essentially a <a href="https://x.com/thelegacyofnerd/status/1975228908862894321?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet"><em>Fortnite</em> skin come to life</a>&nbsp;fighting in a live-service turf war between competing metaverses, except eventually he joins the side of the good guys, including Jeff Bridges and his son. Gillian Anderson is also in this one.</p>

 <p>Forces within Hollywood have been trying to make this movie for a while. Leto was reportedly central <a href="https://gizmodo.com/tron-ares-set-visit-jared-leto-greta-lee-lightcycle-2000652340">to finally making it happen</a>. It was directed by Joachim Rønning, best known for the seminal 2019 fairy tale reimagining<em> Maleficent: Mistress of Evil</em>. The results with <em>Tron: Ares</em>, out October 10, probably could have been a lot worse, but by all accounts, they still aren’t great.</p>

 <p>“There is no drama or jeopardy or human interest anywhere,” writes Peter Bradshaw for<em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/07/tron-ares-review-gillian-anderson-sci-fi-jeff-bridges-jared-leto">The Guardian</a></em>. “This franchise now looks about as urgently contemporary as an in-car CD player.” Alison Willmore was not much more impressed at <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/review-tron-ares-doesnt-realize-its-depressing.html"><em>Vulture</em></a>. “Rønning does get his own kick-ass score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, all ominous throbbing, but can’t come up with anything visually distinctive,” she wrote.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tron-ares-review"><em>IGN</em></a> considered the movie mid overall but adored the soundtrack. “<em>Tron: Ares</em> is getting a 5. And honestly, I bumped it up from a 4 just because of Nine Inch Nails,” wrote <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tron-ares-review">Clint </a><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tron-ares-review">Gage</a>. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/tron-ares-review/"><em>Gamesradar</em></a> gave the movie 2.5 stars out of five, dinging it in part for Leto’s performance, with Emily Garbutt calling him “thoroughly unconvincing as AI-with-a-heart Ares.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/tron-ares-review-jared-leto-jeff-bridges/"><em>Polygon</em></a> was let down by what critic Samantha Nelson saw as the paint-by-numbers storytelling, though she found the overall vibes more entertaining. “The Daft Punk soundtrack was the best part of <em>Tron: Legacy</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>and the Nine Inch Nails album written for&nbsp;<em>Tron: Ares&nbsp;</em>similarly elevates even lackluster scenes,” writes Nelson. “There are haunting sequences that evoke Vangelis’ <em>Blade Runner&nbsp;</em>score and more propulsive tracks that perfectly complement the fast-paced action.”</p>

 <p>And not everyone found Leto so ill-suited to the role, though whether or not that’s a good thing is up for debate. “Leto’s performance works because he’s so utterly believable as a soulless ghoul that it’s easy to buy into the happy-to-be-here warmth of his emergent humanity,” writes David Ehrlich for <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/tron-ares-movie-review-1235154526/"><em>IndieWire</em></a>. “Sure, the movie’s idea of “emergent humanity” is limited to Ares’ deep appreciation for Depeche Mode (who the security program rightly appraises as being superior to Mozart), but these days that’s more humanity than a lot of people could ever hope to muster.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/tron-ares-review-1236542140/"><em>Variety</em></a>‘s Peter Debruge ultimately blames former Disney studio exec Sean Bailey for the ambitious misfire. “As president of production at Disney, Bailey effectively pillaged the company’s back catalog (he was responsible for so many of those live-action remakes, franchise reboots and theme park adaptations),” he writes. “While it was exciting to see what <em>Tron</em> might look like in the 21st century, the brand gets in the way of Ares’ internal evolution…there’s a sense that <em>Tron: Ares</em> has too much nostalgia to service, from the cobwebby re-creation of Flynn’s arcade-basement office to Bridges’ extended cameo (as a drawling, laid-back Dude who sounds less like Flynn than his <em>Big Lebowski</em> character).”</p> <p>A parody news post claiming Leto <a href="https://twitter.com/DiscussingFish/status/1975205738416128324">had sex with AI</a> to prepare for the movie spread on social media yesterday. It was false, obviously, but maybe <em>Tron: Ares</em> would have turned out more interesting if he actually had.</p>

October 9 also marks the debut of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 6.</p><p>It's pretty common for Activision to launch a free trial around the time of a new season launch, as the company likes to give players a taste of the new content to convince them to buy the game or subscribe to Game Pass. The timing with the Battlefield 6 launch looks like a coincidence.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4581694-screenshot2025-10-07at2.06.09%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4581694" data-ratio="0.56965174129353" data-width="1206" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4581694-screenshot2025-10-07at2.06.09%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4581694"></a><figcaption>A free trial starts soon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4581694-screenshot2025-10-07at2.06.09%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><p>Black Ops 6/Warzone Season 6 adds new maps, modes, weapons, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-season-6-arrives-to-black-ops-6-and-warzone-with-chucky-a-chainsaw-and-a-slasher-mode/2900-7113/#1" data-ref-id="2900-7113">a bunch of Halloween content, including new skins for Jason Voorhees, The Predator, and Chucky.</a></p><p>The next Call of Duty game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Black Ops 7</a>, launches on November 14 and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-extended-now-wraps-up-right-before-battlefield-6-launch/1100-6535266/" data-ref-id="1100-6535266">multiplayer beta is going on now.</a> As for Battlefield 6, the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">releases on October 10.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Everyone deserves a pair of headphones that are comfortable to wear and sound great that doesn’t cost a ton of cash. Well you can have it all with the Sony WH-CH520 wireless Bluetooth on-ear headphones. They come in a wide array of fun colors and are dirt cheap, right now at least. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/">Normally going for $70, it’s down more than 46% to just $38. You’ll save a whole $32.</a></p>
<p>I’ve really got to applaud Sony on the brand’s naming scheme choices. You take a look at Apple and its flagship over-hear headphones are given a flashy name like the AirPods Max. Samsung’s line of earbuds are predictably the Galaxy Bus. But Sony? Nah. These are The WH-CH520. No sauce, just the meat — but it’s good meat.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Pick between six stylish colors. The Sony WH-CH520 come in your classic black and white, but also in fun varieties like blue, yellow, pink, and cappuccino.</p>
<p>The headphones are super lightweight and the synthetic materials around the earcups are soft. You can comfortably wear them all day without taking them off. The band includes a plush head cushion. Some real bad pairs of headphones will create that awkward pressure right at the top of your head where it makes contact. That’s not a problem here.</p>



<h2>All-Day Listening</h2>
<p>And you really can wear them all day long with the super long battery life. One chare will last your an impressive 50 hours. Charging is fast too. If you find you’ve forgotten to plug them in before a big trip and you’re rushing out the door, no sweat. A miniscule three minute charge will bring them back up to a whole 90 minutes of listening time. You can plug them in while brushing your teeth and then be good to go.</p>
<p>Take hands-free calls when wearing the Sony WH-CH520 headphones. Your phone can stay in your pocket the next time it buzzes as you accept the call. Built-in microphones are able to isolate your voice from any distracting background noise so this way folks on the other end hear you and only you.</p>
<p>Multi-point Bluetooth allows you to connect the headphones to two different devices simultaneously. Pair them with both your phone and laptop. This way you can be listening to Spotify off the computer while you’re working or maybe be watching a YouTube video with lunch, then when someone calls you one your phone, you can seamlessly switch over and have the call come through the headphones. You can even play a podcast or music off your phone while also paired with your gaming console to make the grind more enjoyable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/">For a limited time, grab these Sony WH-CH520 Bluetooth Headphones for the reduced price of $38.</a></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Silent Hill 2 Remake Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>Like the 2001 original game, the Silent Hill 2 remake puts players in control of James Sunderland, a man who is lured to Silent Hill by a letter seemingly written by his late wife, Mary, three years after she died. But instead of a loving reunion, James finds a personal hellscape of his own creation.

			<p>EA Sports FC 26 arrived <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-release-date-gameplay-reveal/">last month on September 26, 2025</a>, and in less than two weeks from its arrival on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S consoles, according to a report from <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/alineaanalytics/p/septembers-top-playstation-games?r=1h8120&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">Alinea Analytics</a>, the latest iteration of EA's annual football game has already sold <strong>10 million copies</strong> across all platforms in less than two weeks.</p>



<p>That's the kind of start you can't exactly scoff at, even for a title like EA Sports FC, which is expected to hit these kinds of sales numbers, and more, every year. According to the report, 60% of those 10 million copies sold came from PlayStation players. </p>



<p>Beyond EA Sports FC, Alinea Analytics also reports that September was a sports-focused month, with NBA 2K26 being the other top-selling game for the month, hitting over 6 million copies since its debut, with 2 million of those coming from PlayStation players in September.</p>



<p>In the number three spot, below EA Sports FC 26 and NBA 2K26 for September's best-selling games on PlayStation, is where Borderlands 4 landed, while Hollow Knight Silksong came in at the number four spot. Other notable inclusions in the top-10 best-selling games on PlayStation for September 2025 include Silent Hill f at number 10, Dying Light: The Beast at number eight, EA Sports FC 25 at number seven, and Grand Theft Auto V at number five.</p>



<p>Of those titles, Wccftech reviewed Dying Light: The Beast and Silent Hill f. For <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/">the former, we wrote that</a>, "<em>Dying Light: The Beast's parkour mechanics and crunchy melee combat are the two load-bearing pillars that make it a game worth leaping into, with support from a beautiful world to explore (minus the infected) and a tense day and night cycle that greatly raises the stakes on its survival elements. Beyond that, the mechanical and narrative pacing, inconsistent writing and narrative tone, and world design choices that feel antithetical to the series in the first place all bring it to a fairly uninteresting experience that is only worth it for however long you want to turn your brain off and enjoy watching digital infected brains go </em><em>splat.</em>"</p>



<p>And <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/">for the latter, we wrote</a>, "<em>With an engaging story full of haunting, disturbing sequences, a finely tuned balance of everything that makes survival horror great, and combat deeply rooted in resource management, Silent Hill f is a triumphant return for the series after its long hiatus. Its short length and minor PC performance issues may disappoint some, but no fan of the franchise, or the genre, should miss one of the best survival horror releases in years.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft is holding off on its Xbox Game Pass Ultimate price hikes for some existing subscribers in select countries. After announcing a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">50 percent price increase to Game Pass Ultimate</a> last week, Microsoft now says this price increase will only currently affect new purchases and not existing subscribers in markets like Germany, Ireland, South Korea, Poland, and India.</p><p>“At this time, these increases will only affect new purchases and will not affect your current subscription for the market in which you reside, as long as you are on an auto-recurring plan,” explains Microsoft in an email that was sent to some Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers overnight. “Should you choose to cancel your plan and repurchase, you will be charged at the new current rate.”</p><p>Microsoft has confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> that the email is genuine, and it’s not impacting subscribers in the US or UK. “Our recent Game Pass update remains unchanged. Current subscribers in certain countries will continue renewing at their existing price for now, in line with local requirements. We’ll provide advance notice before price adjustments take effect in these countries,” says Kari Perez, head of Xbox communications, in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Xbox Game Pass subscribers in Poland, Ireland, Italy, Germany, and <a href="https://x.com/KoreaXboxnews/status/1975431903009513554">South Korea</a> have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/gp_price_hike_doesnt_seem_to_affect_people">all reported</a> that they’ve received the emails today.</p><p>The change in these countries is likely related to local regulations on subscription price changes, and it means in Ireland existing subscribers with auto-renew enabled will still be charged at the €17.99 monthly rate, instead of the new €26.99 pricing. Microsoft notes in its email that existing subscribers in these markets will be notified “at least 60 days in advance” of price changes, meaning the changes won’t go into effect for at least two more months.</p><p>The halt in price increases in select markets is a change to what Microsoft announced last week. “This updated pricing will go into effect on October 1st for new subscribers, and then at the next billing cycle, likely to be November 4th, for current subscribers,” said Dustin Blackwell, director of gaming and platform communications at Microsoft, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em> last week.</p><p><em><strong>Update, October 7th</strong>: Article updated with comment from Microsoft.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/794032/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-changes-countries]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Recreate Marvel’s Most Iconic Moments</h2>
<p>Lego recreated that one slow-mo shot used in all the trailers. It’s the one in the opening scene from the movie as the Avengers are storming Hydra’s snow base and they all momentarily are all leaping through the air while busting through trucks and trees and whatnot. The first Avengers film had that tracking shot in the middle of Manhattan, circling around the heroes. Avengers: Age of Ultron had this.</p>
<p>The 613-piece Lego sets features favorite Avengers minifigures including the Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner. I mean Hawkeye. Designed for kids 10-years-old and up, this Lego Marvel set has some interactive elements. Simulate the Hulk’s explosive power and strength with the bunker that launches into the air. A push-along road vehicle is included. The set includes a variety of transparent stands so each of the Avengers can be suspended in air in the middle of the action, making it all feel dramatic and dynamic.</p>



<p>The whole set is reconfigurable to your liking. You can built it to spec, making the frame of the 2015 film to a T or, I don’t know, stick Iron Man and Captain America in the humvee to act out Tony teaching Cap how to drive before his road test. Buy a Batman minifigure and pretend he is in the Avengers, teaching Cap how to drive before his road test. That’s the magic of Lego.</p>
<p>The Lego Marvel The Avengers Assemble: Age of Ultron makes a great gift for a Marvel fan of any age. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4595/">Get it now while it’s on sale for $30 off, bringing the price down to just $70 for a limited time.</a></p>

Shop, craft and trade your way to the perfect loadout – or ignore all common sense and fill your pack with beach balls and fireworks.</li><li><strong>Step Two</strong> – Deploy. The moment your dropship lands, the clock is ticking. Time is short, planets are hostile and everything (including your teammates) can, and probably will, go sideways.</li><li><strong>Step Three</strong> – Survive, celebrate and swap stories back on the Starseeker. For all its “critical missions” and “serious science,” life on the station is more like a space party bus than a research facility.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>First Stop: Planet Tephra</strong></p><p>The first destination for intrepid Astroneers is Tephra, a lush and mysterious planet deep in frontier space. Its tangled jungles, vast oceans and cavernous depths hold secrets, and more than a few hazards.</p><p>Each planet in <em>STARSEEKER: Astroneer Expeditions</em> is handcrafted, letting players return to favorite vistas, hidden caches or that one spot where Carl got eaten by a flower monster. As Squads progress, new Landing Zones unlock, opening up uncharted territory, fiercer challenges and bigger <a title="Genres > Co-Op [339 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> missions.</p><p>And Tephra is just the beginning. As the Starseeker travels deeper into frontier space, the crew will uncover new worlds, each bringing its own dangers, creatures and stories tied to the Fronteer Force’s Super Top-Secret Mission mission. It’s a big mission.</p><p><strong>First Look at an Expedition</strong></p><p>In the <em>STARSEEKER: Astroneer Expeditions</em> Direct demo, a Squad touched down on Tephra to help repair critical equipment for the science team. Simple enough, until it wasn’t. Local fauna had Gooped everything in sight, forcing recruits to improvise with their EXO Tools and specialized Nozzles. Nozzles are modular upgrades that transform the way explorers interact with the environment.</p><p>The Squad’s mission required the team to set up a comms relay high up on Tephra’s cliffs, all while cleaning Goop from machinery using Water Hose Nozzles, contending with rowdy creatures, and escaping the planet before time ran out. Of course, detours were made for Carrotling-chasing, Squad hijinks and general chaos. After all, what’s a Starseeker expedition without a little creative disaster?</p><p><em>STARSEEKER: Astroneer Expeditions</em> will bring players deeper into the <em>ASTRONEER</em> universe. Whether you’re a meticulous planner, a curious explorer or just someone who really likes throwing beach balls in space, the Starseeker has a seat for you.</p></blockquote><p><em>STARSEEKER: Astroneer Expeditions</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,565 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,055 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, Switch, and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,475 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1454370/STARSEEKER_Astroneer_Expeditions/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2026.</p><p>Watch the video below.</p><h2><span>Gameplay Reveal</span></h2><p><iframe title="STARSEEKER: Astroneer Expeditions | Gameplay Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S5lw4PJtHmI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/starseeker-astroneer-expeditions-gameplay-reveal-video-details]]></content:encoded>

U Deluxe is a remaster of the old Wii U title from 2012. It offers updated graphics, the New Super Luigi U expansion, new items, and other quality-of-life upgrades. You'll get to explore over 160 levels through nine unique worlds, each with its own enemies, aesthetics, and power-ups. Part of what makes the game so fun is its cooperative play, which allows up to four players to tackle its 2D levels together. For players new to platformers, they can play as Nabbit (who is practically invincible and makes it easy for newcomers to learn the ropes).</span></p></div>                      </div><p>As a bonus, you'll find three additional game modes--Boost Rush, Challenges, and Coin Battle--offering plenty of replay value once you've made it through the core content. The game is always an easy recommendation for Mario fans, but at this new price, it's the ideal time to cross it off your wishlist. New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe has only dropped below this price point a few times since its release--and with this deal expiring at the end of Big Deal Days on October 8, be sure to check it out soon.</p><p>Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/new-super-mario-bros-u-deluxe-review-its-a-me-agai/1900-6417061/" data-ref-id="1900-6417061">New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe review</a> gave it a solid 7/10, due to its smooth platforming and inventive level design.</p><p>"Despite its aging formula, New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe is still a great entry in the series, with its typically tight platforming and both accessibility and depth to spare," wrote critic Oscar Dayus. "While it can feel a bit stale for those who have been round the Mushroom Kingdom one too many times before, Deluxe is well worth playing, especially if you didn't get a chance to play NSMBU on Wii U."</p><p>Of course, this isn't the only Switch game on sale during Amazon's shopping event.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/after-a-second-price-drop-in-three-days-the-2025-rog-strix-g15-has-just-reached-a-new-record-low.1318927/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Shopping for a gaming laptop means balancing several critical factors: <strong>you need a powerful GPU</strong> that can handle modern games at high settings, <strong>a fast processor</strong> that won’t bottleneck performance, <strong>enough RAM</strong> for smooth multitasking, and a <strong>display with a high refresh rate</strong> that keeps up with fast-paced action. The ASUS ROG Strix G16 checks every box with its Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 GPU powered by the new Blackwell architecture, Intel Core i7-14650HX processor, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 165Hz display. This 2025 model has already seen a price drop recently, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4592/">Amazon just pushed it to a new all-time low of $1,199, down from $1,499</a>. That’s also $300 off and cheaper than the 2024 model currently sells for.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4592/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The RTX 5060 GPU is a major step ahead due to <strong>the Nvidia Blackwell architecture</strong>: It introduces DLSS 4 technology, which employs AI to create additional frames and accelerate performance without compromise to visual fidelity. Practically, you are free to play demanding games such as Cyberpunk 2077 or Alan Wake 2 at increased settings with smooth frame rates. The technologies for Max-Q aim for optimal power efficiency so the laptop produces muscular performance without overwhelming heat and fan noise. Ray tracing creates incredibly realistic lighting, reflections and shadows, and it enhances the visual experience for games supporting it.</p>
<h2>Processing Power and Memory Designed for Gaming</h2>
<p>The Intel Core i7-14650HX is a hybrid processor featuring 16 cores: <strong>8 performance cores for demanding tasks and 8 efficiency cores for background processes</strong>. This architecture means the laptop can handle gaming while simultaneously running Discord, streaming software, or browser tabs without stuttering. The base clock speeds reach up to 2.2 GHz, with <strong>boost frequencies climbing to 5.2 GHz</strong> when you need maximum power for intense gaming sessions or content creation work like video editing.</p>



<p>The <strong>16GB of DDR5-5.6GHz memory provides fast memory access</strong> to maintain smooth operation of everything. DDR5 is significantly faster than DDR4, reducing load times and delivering increased frame stability for memory-intensive games. The<strong> 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD provides ample storage</strong> for your game collection and serves up read speeds of up to 7,000 MB/s.</p>



<p>It uses a 16:10 aspect ratio instead of a typical 16:9, and gives it extra vertical screen estate useful for gaming and productivity work. The FHD+ resolution of 1920 x 1200 pixels is a sensible compromise between image sharpness and performance, as more demanding resolutions would involve extra stress on the GPU. Smooth motion during a bullet blaster or a racing game is <strong>provided by a refresh rate of 165Hz</strong> and motion blur and ghosting are eliminated by a 3ms response time.</p>
<p>The ROG <em>Intelligent Cooling</em> is where ASUS shows off its engineering expertise: <strong>End-to-end vapor chamber spreads heat across a larger surface</strong>&nbsp;and tri-fan technology exhausts more air through the case. Employing Conductonaut Extreme liquid metal on the chipset, rather than typical thermal paste, transfers heat more efficiently, retaining lower temperatures even during longer gaming sessions. Advanced cooling equates to a laptop operating at its highest potential, rather than thermal throttling.</p>
<p>At $1,199 for Prime members during its current Prime Big Deal Day sale, you are getting 2025’s current gaming technology at a sub-last-year’s-model cost.</p>

With the likes of Beavis and Butt-Head and American Dad hitting the game this year shortly after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-dutys-ongoing-420-obsession-sparks-debate-among-fans-some-have-had-enough-others-really-want-that-seth-rogen-skin"><u>weed-obsessed bundles starring Seth Rogen</u></a>, some fans said they’d had enough of what they called the 'Fortnite-ification' of their beloved Call of Duty, and pleaded with publisher Activision to return to its mil-sim roots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, last month, Activision shocked the Call of Duty community when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-battlefield-6s-commitment-to-gritty-realism-activision-makes-shock-call-of-duty-change-for-black-ops-7-we-hear-the-feedback"><u>it confirmed that Operators, Operator Skins, and Weapons from Black Ops 6 would no longer carry forward into Black Ops 7</u></a>. This came as a big surprise to players who had expected content they’d bought for Black Ops 6 to carry forward, as it has done with previous entries. Explaining the decision, Activision said Black Ops 7 “needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a positive reaction to the Predator in Black Ops 6, although some are saying they wish he was coming to Black Ops 7 instead. “See I’m perfectly fine when COD does collabs with other mature IPs,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1nzzf9r/comment/ni67u27/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor blackviking147</a>. “The Mil-spawn skin is still the only time I was genuinely interested in finishing a COD battle pass and I use it in Warzone to this day ‘cause it’s voiced by Keith David.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Predator, Rambo, Die Hard, Spawn all of those were amazing collabs that didn't destroy the game’s identity ‘cause they're movie properties from around the game’s time period and or decked out in milsim gear so it stays in the aesthetic.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Would have been great to use this skin in Blops 7,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1nzzf9r/comment/ni5wwfb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added LaylaLegion</a>. “Oh well.

Despite the online chatter, there are a number of Call of Duty players who have expressed frustration that their goofy skins won’t carry forward into Black Ops 7, lamenting the fact they won’t get the amount of use out of their purchases that they'd expected. Now, if these players move on to Black Ops 7, they will have to leave those expensive virtual items behind — including the Predator.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hades 2 Review</p>
      </div>
<p>“My game literally crashed when they all started rolling in,” they wrote in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/1nqrbys/comment/ng91mr8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow ">comment</a> on Reddit. “It was the most successful moment of a game breaking ever for me.”</p><p dir="ltr">That moment summed up the excitement around Hades 2 finally leaving Early Access. After more than a year of updates, patches, and community feedback, Supergiant’s follow-up to its award-winning roguelike is fully out. For players who have already spent hundreds of hours with Melinoë, it means their progress now carries the weight of an official release. For newcomers, it’s the chance to step into one of the most anticipated sequels in recent memory.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4581640-1145350_55.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581640" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4581640-1145350_55.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581640"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4581640-1145350_55.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Supergiant didn’t just flip the switch and call it a day. The 1.0 launch came with a long list of changes: dozens of balance tweaks, new relationship events between characters, fresh art, and even a brand-new song performed by Scylla, one of the game’s underworld bosses. Many fans decided to start fresh saves to experience the full scope of the game from the beginning, taking in the final version of its story and mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">The community has also carried over some quirks from the Early Access era. One infamous example involves Chronos, the Titan of Time and one of the game’s central villains. During his boss fight, pausing wasn’t an option. If players tried to hit pause, Chronos would interrupt.</p><p dir="ltr">“Excuse me?” he’d sneer before unpausing the game himself. “Time does not stop at your behest. It only stops at mine.” It was a clever design flourish that ended up being removed after community pushback, but veterans still laugh about it--especially when new players run into him for the first time.</p><p>Beyond these details, Hades 2 feels distinct from its predecessor in both pacing and progression. The combat remains fast and chaotic, but there’s a slower rhythm at its core. Melinoë’s cast ability encourages zoning tactics, creating circles that can be powered up with boons, while charge attacks force players to weigh timing and positioning.</p><p dir="ltr">Progression has also taken a strategic step forward. Instead of Hades’ Mirror of Night, which offered linear unlocks, players now work with Arcana cards--a system that opens up branching build paths. Some cards completely subvert series staples. The Strength card, modeled after Heracles, offers increased damage and defense if players give up Death Defiance, the extra lives that were critical in the original game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4581639-1145350_61.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581639" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4581639-1145350_61.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581639"></a><figcaption>Hades 2 run recap.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4581639-1145350_61.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">“I went Strength and never looked back,” one player, Rhuemis, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/1nsop35/comment/ngnfkgu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow ">wrote</a>. “Losing Death Defiances used to psyche me out too much, so getting rid of them made things way more fun and a lot easier for me personally.”</p><p dir="ltr">These changes all build toward what players have been waiting for since Early Access began: Hade 2's true ending. Within hours of release, veterans unlocked the final story beat for Melinoë, and discussion threads quickly filled with reactions to the payoff. For longtime fans, it’s the conclusion to more than a year of anticipation. For first-timers, it’s a chance to discover why Supergiant’s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/five-years-on-the-hades-fanbase-built-its-own-greek-mythology/1100-6534791/" data-ref-id="1100-6534791">take on Greek mythology</a> remains one of the most acclaimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-changes-what-it-means-to-be-a-roguelike/1100-6483420/" data-ref-id="1100-6483420">roguelikes ever made</a>.</p>

                <p>Square Enix recently announced that Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-release-date-confirmed/1100-6534646/" data-ref-id="1100-6534646">will be coming to Switch 2 and Xbox</a>--and with it, new "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-development-stable-despite-xbox-technical-concerns-director-says/1100-6535199/" data-ref-id="1100-6535199">streamlined progression features</a>." These are essentially cheats that let players skip the grind and finish the game much more quickly. The idea is to make the experience smoother and more accessible, especially for people playing it for the first time.</p><p>The decision to add these features came directly from game director Naoki Hamaguchi. In an interview with (and translated by) <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remakes-progression-boosts-and-sped-up-cutscenes-can-reduce-playtime-to-under-10-hours-director-hamaguchi-tells-us-why/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, he explained that he pushed hard for their inclusion. His reasoning? He believes players should have the freedom to enjoy games however they want, whether that's taking their time or speeding through the story.</p><p>"Naturally, when we announce features like these, we get responses like, 'This is sacrilegious!'" Hamaguchi said. "Even within the dev team, there are people who feel that way. But unless someone takes the initiative, it doesn't happen."</p><p>He went on to add that in today's world of digital entertainment, giving players options is key. "I personally believe that, with digital entertainment today, the player should have the choice in how they interact with content. That's why I pushed for it."</p><p>Hamaguchi also pointed out that these features can significantly shorten playtime, condensing a 40-50 hour game down to under 10 hours. He said the timing made sense because Remake is already a few years old, and the goal is to help new players catch up before the final part of the trilogy arrives. "If we were to add [progression features] to the third installment at launch, it would probably spark controversy. We'd risk disrupting the experience for fans who have been waiting the longest and deserve to enjoy it the most."</p><p>It should be noted that progression features are also coming to PS5 at some point. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/09/final-fantasy-7-remakes-switch-2-xbox-cheats-will-also-come-to-ps5-pc-at-some-point" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Square Enix has already confirmed</a> that they'll be implemented alongside with a future update.</p><p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 is also currently in development, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-will-get-proper-high-quality-part-3-despite-rebirths-disappointing-sales/1100-6535048/" data-ref-id="1100-6535048">and despite Rebirth's disappointing sales</a>, Hamaguchi said the saga will conclude with a "proper, high-quality" finale.
