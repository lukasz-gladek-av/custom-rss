			<p>Stellar Blade received a new update today that introduces support for PlayStation 5 Pro and two new graphic options that take advantage of the console's increased specs and new features to deliver an enhanced experience.</p>
<p>The new update introduces the PS5 Pro's exclusive Pro and Pro Max enhanced graphic options, which allow for enhanced image quality and better performance than on the base model. On X, the developer shared a quick comparison video showcasing how Pro Max mode improves image quality and performance over the base model's Priority Resolution mode.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">üî∂New update details!</p>
<p>üî∏ Stellar Blade also supports enhanced graphics on PLAYSTATION 5 Pro!<br>
üî∏ Pro and Pro Max, enhanced graphic options are available on PlayStation 5 Pro.<br>
üî∏ HFR is available on Pro and Pro Max graphic options.</p>
<p>üî∏Various other bug fixes.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StellarBlade?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#StellarBlade</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PS5?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PS5</a>‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/jc9sCLVuV5">pic.twitter.com/jc9sCLVuV5</a></p>

<p>Stellar Blade is among the best games released on PlayStation 5 this year. Despite some minor issues, the game developed by Shift Up is an impressive action role-playing game that is worth experiencing by all fans of the genre, as Kai highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta‚Äôs release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you‚Äôll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>
<p>Stellar Blade is now available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geforce-now-monthly-playtime-limit-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/geforce-now-to-impose-100-hour-monthly-playtime-limit-in-2025.1029843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geforce-now-monthly-playtime-limit-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia has announced that streaming service GeForce Now will begin imposing monthly playtime limits on new subscribers to two of its three currently available tiers, starting from next year.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeForceNOW/comments/1glr3yc/gfn_thursday_updates_november_7_2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit update</a>, Nvidia says it's renaming its Priority subscription tier to Performance, and that new subscribers to both the Performance and Ultimate tiers will be limited to 100 hours per month of playtime beginning "at the start of next year".</p>

<p>If you're an existing Performance or Ultimate member on or before December 31st this year, then you won't start seeing the monthly limits kick in until January 2026, which Nvidia says is a gift "to thank the GeForce Now community for joining the cloud gaming revolution".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/geforce-now-monthly-limits-tiers.jpg?itok=SXoZq7YD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/geforce-now-monthly-limits-tiers.jpg?itok=ZYJCMz87 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>GeForce Now is changing in some pretty big ways next year.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Nvidia, the new limit "comfortably accommodates 94% of members, who typically enjoy the service well within this timeframe", although the company doesn't provide any further info about exactly how long people mostly use the service for each month.</p>

<p>You'll be able to buy extra hours if you run over the limit, too; $2.99 will get you 15 more hours on the Performance tier, while you'll have to pay $5.99 for the same privilege if you're on the Ultimate tier, although naturally, the quality of your streaming is better on this tier.</p>

<p>In addition, up to 15 hours of unused playtime will roll over each month, so if you do find yourself going under the limit for one month, you'll be able to enjoy an equivalent amount of extra time the following month.</p>

<p>On the plus side, Performance members will be able to enjoy 1440p gaming instead of 1080p, and the tier is also getting access to ultrawide support, although 4K and 120fps remains reserved for Ultimate members.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nvidia-geforce-now-monthly-limit-october-games.jpg?itok=O4VP4IoF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nvidia-geforce-now-monthly-limit-october-games.jpg?itok=z8KvzP6U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many games, including recent releases like&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, are available to stream via GeForce Now.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering what GeForce Now is, it's a cloud gaming service that allows you to stream and play PC games on a range of devices via the cloud. It's similar to services like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-cloud-gaming-beta-available-now-on-xbox-series-xs-and-xbox-one">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-luna-announced-as-new-cloud-gaming-service-in-early-access">Amazon Luna</a>.</p>

<p>You can sign up for the service over on the official GeForce Now <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a> if you're interested.</p>

            <p>Got an email about this. Looks cool. Is free. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll write about that,‚Äù I thought. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll write about that for Rock Paper Shotgun, a place that semi-regularly posts articles about cool and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free</a> games.‚Äù So here we are. If you‚Äôre waiting for the other shoe to drop, assuming the only reason I‚Äôd open an article in a superfluous and straightforward manner is because I‚Äôm about to deliver some sort of third sentence twist, you‚Äôre completely wrong! There‚Äôs no twist at all. I‚Äôm simply going to deliver some information about the game in a neutral tone. You can find <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ved-purification">VED: Purificatio</a>n, a free prologue demo to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> VED, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2190370/VED_Purification/?curator_clanid=45226842">here</a>.</p>

<p>Ok, fine, here‚Äôs a non-neutral assessment: the voice acting is as rough as the cheap Asda cat litter I bought that was so close to gravel in consistency that I refused to subject my pet to it, so that‚Äôs bonus points to the art for carrying my interest. This one‚Äôs a turn-based RPG, but with cRPG elements like dialogue choices, multiple endings, and a series of intriguing ‚Äòcurses or blessings‚Äô, which sound somewhat <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>-like. There‚Äôs dice rolls and ability loadouts, and most importantly, the gifs on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1182420/VED/">Steam page</a> for the main game feature at least one very good giant mushroom bastard. Here‚Äôs how the game describes itself:</p>
<blockquote><p>In VED, you take on the role of Cyrus, a young hero who comes to the city of Micropolis in search of a new life. There he suddenly discovers the ability to teleport between two interconnected worlds full of mysterious flying islands, strange creatures, and dangerous monsters. Unfold an interactive story where each decision matters and help Cyrus discover the truth about this magical place, so that you can decide the fate of two worlds. To succeed in your quest, you will have to master the powerful magic of the Veds.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just once, I would like a game to just come out and tell me in the marketing that ‚Äúonly about one third of the decisions you make matter‚Äù. Would you not just buy that game immediately, purely out of respect for its honesty? I would. I haven‚Äôt played VED of course, so maybe each decision does matter, and maybe ‚Äúeasy to learn but difficult to master‚Äù is an accurate description of the combat, too. Who knows! The full game‚Äôs out in a week anyway. That‚Äôs the 14th of November, and your prologue progress carries over to the big release, should you find yourself a dedicated VEDhead.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>When multiplayer fishing game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/webfishing">Webfishing</a> came out last month, it offered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fishing-games-dont-come-much-cuter-than-the-animal-crossing-style-island-of-webfishing">a relaxing hangout zone for cats and dogs</a>. Everything revolves around catching, selling, and collecting the fish that gather in the rivers of a small island. It also lets you customise your character with clothing. Mostly simple hats and shorts, but some options let players celebrate their sexuality, such as a rainbow-adorned t-shirts, or titles that hang above your character which simply say "Trans" or "Bi". All this led one player to complain there was no "Straight" title. So, the developer added one. It costs 10 grand.

<p>That's in-game money, of course, earned by selling your catch. Not actual human dollars. But it's still a comically large price tag when compared to the other titles in the game, which generally cost $75. To declare your heterosexuality is now the most expensive thing you can do in the game. Nevertheless, the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3146520/discussions/0/4625852883021083340/">complaint from a bitter user</a> on Steam demanded a "straight" title, and that is what they got. What's funnier is that the title comes in quotemarks. So you're not straight, you're "straight". </p>
<p>I'm straight. I also find this incredibly funny. As a glib response to a bad faith complaint, it's perfect. Meanwhile, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3146520/discussions/0/4625853246786774999/">another player asked</a> if non-binary items of clothing would make an appearance. In that case, a non-binary title and an accompanying t-shirt were simply added to the game. </p>
<p>All these additions come as part of a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3146520/view/4467101633890746444">big "housecleaning" patch</a> that fixes bugs and adds other features. Other titles now available  include "creature" and "cryptid". I'm currently sporting "critter". </p>
<p>Plenty of non-cosmetic changes have been made too. Fishing on ripples in the water now gives you a larger chance of catching better fish. There are multiple save files now, meaning you can rock more than one avatar. Some items can be stacked up to 99. The inventory menus have been reworked. One note in the changelog simply says: "Added the ???????? which is accessed through the ???? ?????? and ??? ????????" - colour me intrigued. There are also now 18+ lobbies to try to ensure chat is safer for young players. (Although all this means is that players have to accept a pop-up when joining 18+ servers. Not exactly perfect but better than nothing.)</p><p>"The launch product was rushed and a bit of a mess," said creator "lamedeveloper" in the update post, pointing out that the entire development time of the game totalled just 5 months. "I ended up not really being proud of the product I had put out. Hopefully, this patch addresses most of the major issues with the game (and I can finally sleep a bit)."</p>

<p>Nvidia is making some major changes to its GeForce Now game streaming service, including putting a limit on how much people can play games on the service.</p>



<p>In a new post on the service‚Äôs <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeForceNOW/comments/1glr3yc/gfn_thursday_updates_november_7_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Reddit page</a>, Nvidia revealed that next year will see limits of 100 hours per month to play games using GeForce Now subscription service. </p>



<p>The company says its to ‚Äúcontinue providing exceptional quality and speed‚Äù as well as ‚Äúshorter queue times‚Äù. This limit will be placed on Performance and Ultimate subscribers. The Performance plan gives players 1440p streaming, ray tracing, and six-hour play seassions for $9.99 per month. Ultimate ups the resolution to 4K 120 or 1080p 240 with ray tracing, HDR, DLSS 3, and eight-hour sessions for $19.99 per month.</p>



<p>Free subscribers, which only offers one-hour sessions and has ads, won‚Äôt have a monthly limit.</p>



<p>‚ÄúThis ample limit comfortably accommodates 94% of members, who typically enjoy the service well within this timeframe,‚Äù Nvidia said.</p>



<p>The company added that up to 15 hours of unused playtime will be rolled over to the next month. Think of it like the minutes rollover from old school cell phone plans.</p>



<p>At its max, players can have up to 115 hours of playtime available in a given month. Should you go over your threshold however, it‚Äôll cost you. Nvidia says it will cost players $2.99 for 15 more hours per month on the Performance plan. Those on the Ultimate will get 15 hours at $5.99 for the month.</p>



<p>With the 100 limit starting in 2025, not everyone will be held to it right away. Nvidia says that those who are active paid members by December 31, 2024 won‚Äôt be affected by the changes until January 2026. That gives them an extra year of unlimited playtime.</p>



<p>Lastly, those with a Founders membership to will have unlimited playtime ‚Äúfor life‚Äù. Upgrading or changing their membership, however, will apply the new limits.</p>



<p>What do you think of the play time limits for Nvidia GeForce Now? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs always nice to see someone giving Escape From Tarkov a run for its money in the extraction shooter space, and the free-to-play Arena Breakout: Infinite appears to be holding its own. There were some controversies initially, like with its monetization system, but the first-person shooter garnered a following and has held firm. Now, they‚Äôre about to launch Arena Breakout: Infinite Season 1, complete with a new map, new weapons, unique gameplay elements, and more!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-arena-breakout-infinite-season-1-begin">When Does Arena Breakout Infinite Season 1 Begin?</h2>



<p>If you‚Äôre eagerly awaiting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-season-one-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the launch of season one</a> before returning to Arena Breakout: Infinite, or if you haven‚Äôt stopped playing the extraction shooter but desire more content, you should know you don‚Äôt have to wait long. It‚Äôs out on November 20, and it‚Äôs said to be the most significant update to the game since its launch.</p>

            <p>Nintendo's Legend of Zelda film adaptation will be released at some point in the next five years and two months.</p>
<p>Nintendo hasn't shared a specific year for Link and Zelda's hop to the big screen as yet, however the company has at least narrowed it down to 2020-something.</p>

<p>In this week's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106e.pdf">Corporate Management Policy Briefing</a>, Nintendo shared an update on its 'visual content', which means its movie projects.</p>
<p>"In the field of visual content, we are making direct investments and are deeply involved in the planning and development of multiple productions," it wrote, with an accompanying infographic showing that rather vague Zelda release window: 202X.</p>
<p>Here, it also noted the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">upcoming Super Mario Bros. sequel will make its debut in April 2026</a>. Last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">Super Mario Bros. animated movie was a huge success for the company</a>, with Nintendo stating it was viewed in theaters by approximately 170 million people.</p>

<p>Nintendo's own <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> first confirmed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-working-on-a-live-action-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">live-action The Legend of Zelda movie this time last year</a>, with a rather casual post on social media. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-being-made-in-close-collaboration-with-the-true-genius-of-miyamoto">Miyamoto will produce the movie</a>, which is being co-financed by Nintendo and Sony Pictures Entertainment (Sony will also handle worldwide theatrical distribution).</p>
<p>Film producer Avi Arad is also on board. Arad's previous video game to film projects include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-benefited-game-sales-despite-being-disappointing-flop-take-two-boss-says">this year's Borderlands adaptation</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharted-film-sequel-in-development-sony-pictures-confirms">Tom Holland-fronted Uncharted</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Nintendo news, yesterday the company gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-not-ruling-out-future-acquisitions-but-still-favours-organic-expansion-to-maintain-creative-culture">further insight on its approach to mergers and acquisitions</a>, while also confirming the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">Switch successor will be backward compatible with Switch games</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered patch is now live for the PC version of the game, fixing select issues and bringing performance and stability improvements.</p>
<p>Patch 1.1 focuses on introducing fixes that improve the experience, such as fixes for audio issues for pre-rendered cutscenes, which should now have the same volume as gameplay, a bug that causes disappearing or flickering shadows in Meridian when playing on ultrawide resolutions, HUD markers for objectives not rendering correctly with a custom FOV, Steam Input improvements and more. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2561580/view/4480612432780198115?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official patch notes</a> also mention various user interface, performance, and stability improvements, which, sadly, haven't been detailed in full, as well as the team working on future patches that will further improve the remaster.</p>
<p>Long considered a controversial remaster, given that the original is far from an old game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered is a worthwhile upgrade of the PlayStation 4 release, featuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-greatly-enhanced-visuals-performance/">greatly enhanced visuals and perfect performance</a> on both PlayStation 5 and PC. While the game doesn't look close in any way to its sequel, Forbidden West, the remaster's visual upgrades go a long way to competently close the gap between the two games.</p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-arc-line-coming-to-early-access-november-26.1029804/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-coming-to-early-access-november-26/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developed by Dreamate and published by Fulqrum Publishing, New Arc Line is officially announced to be entering the Early Access period as of November 26, 2024. The game originally received a demo during <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-5-games-you-should-try-during-this-steam-next-fest/">Steam Next Fest</a>, a period where a ton of demos are available, as well as games going on sale to showcase new and upcoming games. After receiving a lot of feedback during the demo period of New Arc Line, they have made the decision to opt into the Early Access period.</p>
<p>They've mentioned that they have opted to do this so that they can work closely with the fans to be able to make the full release of New Arc Line a smoother and more enjoyable experience for everyone involved. To celebrate the release of New Arc Line being in Early Access, a trailer has been released on YouTube to showcase some of the content that you can expect from the upcoming title. It's only 37 seconds long but shows off some of the main features of the game, including dice rolls, combat, and the expansive SteamPunk world that you'll get to explore.</p>
<p><iframe title="New Arc Line | Early Access Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/anrIQ4K6QXQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As addressed in the announcement, the developers and publisher are aware that there will be players who are on edge about New Arc Line going into Early Access, especially as it's a story-driven game. However, in the announcement, it's been confirmed that the initial Early Access launch will "only contain about a quarter of the main storyline." Of course, as they continue development during the Early Access period, there are plans to add in more areas and quests to do, released across multiple content updates leading up to the full release. However, they plan to do it in a way that contributes more to the game's side quests and world-building content rather than giving away the main story too early on.</p>
<p>In addition, they will be using the Early Access period to focus on adding more classes, abilities, and companions that you can explore the world with, as well as making current mechanics in the game as balanced as possible so that when the full game is released, it releases with minimal issues.</p>
<p>If you're interested in picking up New Arc Line while it's in the Early Access period, the game is currently at a significantly reduced price of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2458310/New_Arc_Line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$19.99 on Steam</a>, which has been confirmed that they will be increasing later on when the game is more developed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-xbox-release-kojima-ip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hideo Kojima's&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>has received a surprise Xbox release today, and the gaming legend has also announced that he and his studio Kojima Productions have acquired the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>IP.</p>

<p>Per a press release, <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>is now available on Xbox Series X|S (although not on Xbox One), as well as the Microsoft Store and, uh, Amazon Luna.</p>

<p>Kojima Productions says that this release is part of its strategy to "focus on bringing [its] award-winning IP&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>to more platforms and audiences", and as part of that mission, the studio also "now has full ownership" of&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>as an IP.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-stranding-xbox-kojima-dropkick.jpg?itok=jlin_5jD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-stranding-xbox-kojima-dropkick.jpg?itok=bIpoE2iv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>is now available on Xbox Series X|S, in all its weird glory.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that the version of <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>that's&nbsp;available on Xbox Series X|S now is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-directors-cut-is-coming-soon-to-playstation-5">the Director's Cut</a>, which means it includes a new location, new delivery items to help you out with your treks, and extra combat moves, plus lots more.</p>

<p>That's in addition to the base&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>game, of course, which remains the same profoundly odd and yet strangely compelling "walking simulator" it was when it first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-release-date-announced-along-with-new-trailer">launched on PS4 back in 2019</a>.</p>

<p>Right now, Kojima Productions is hard at work on a sequel to&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>. The appropriately-named&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em>will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-trailer-revealed-at-game-awards-2022">once again star Norman Reedus</a> as protagonist Sam Porter-Bridges, along with other returning stars like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-explains-additional-hands-on-fragiles-shoulders-in-death-stranding-2-on">L√©a Seydoux</a> and Troy Baker.</p>

<p>Said sequel is currently set to launch next year for PS5, although now that Kojima has gained control of the <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>IP, it may very well come to other platforms in due course as well.</p>




<p>Filming for <i>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</i>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-filming-and-recording-completed">completed back in May</a>, so it looks like progress on the game continues apace. Let's hope it doesn't get delayed.</p>

<p>While you wait for that, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/DEATH_STRANDING_DIRECTORS_CUT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA11260_00-DEATHSTRAND00001" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and now <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/death-stranding/9nkchzztl308" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> as well.

Starting today, a select number of users will have the ability to play around in their <em>NMS</em> universe across a collection of platforms with the new cross-save functionality. According to the announcement, adding cross-saving was a bit of an undertaking for the development team.</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very common for players to rack up thousands of hours of saves,‚Äù <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/11/cross-save-ps5-pro-normandy/">the announcement reads</a>. ‚ÄúAdding&nbsp;cross-save&nbsp;for us is a little bit like moving house, the longer people have lived there the more complicated it is to move them.‚Äù</p><p><em>No Man‚Äôs Sky</em> now supports cross-saves across PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Series S/X, Xbox Game Pass, PC, Steam Deck, PSVR 1 / 2, PCVR, GOG, and Nintendo Switch. Players can <a href="https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save">visit this site</a> to link their different platform accounts and read the cross-save FAQ. However, only a select few players will be able to play their saves across different platforms with Hello Games rolling out the functionality to more players in the coming days.</p><p>November 7th is known in the BioWare fandom as N7 Day (get it, <strong>N</strong>ovember <strong>7</strong>th) ‚Äî a semi-official community holiday celebrating all things <em>Mass Effect</em>. In 2021, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22446499/no-mans-sky-mass-effect-normandy-starship">Hello Games introduced <em>Mass Effect</em>‚Äôs famous starship</a>, the SSV Normandy SR-1 as a collectible ship. For this year‚Äôs N7 Day, the Normandy is back for players to claim for a limited time.</p><p>In addition to cross-saves and cool ships, to coincide with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">the launch of the PS5 Pro</a>, <em>No Man‚Äôs Sky</em> is also getting an enhanced version compatible with the souped up console. Updated features include 4K resolution at 60fps, support for 8K resolution at 30fps, and improved lighting. </p><p>All three updates are available now and are completely free.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile‚Äôs minimum requirements will be increased to iOS 17/Android 13 or higher from November 14, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the latest <a href="https://x.com/WarzoneMobile/status/1854249671994012087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a>, Warzone Mobile‚Äôs minimum specifications require devices with iOS 17/Android 13 or higher on a device with a GPU capable of bindless texturing. If players wish to receive updates and access to the latest game version for Season 1 and beyond, they must meet those requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All is not lost for Warzone Mobile players who don‚Äôt meet the minimum requirements. The developers have provided 6 months for players to transition to a new device. Players with older iOS and Android versions can play ‚Äúversion 3.10 for a limited time (approximately six months),‚Äù provided they were already on ver 3.10 before November 14.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Warzone Mobile developers have stated that the minimum requirements had to be updated for future updates and integrations with the Call of Duty franchise. They are currently working to bring new shared features such as Omnimovement and connected content coming with BO6/WZ S1. </p>



<p>IPhone X and below do not support iOS 17; you will need an iPhone XS or higher to play the latest version of Warzone Mobile. For other queries, check out their <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-minimum-specifications-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAQ section</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shift Up has just confirmed that Stellar Blade can take advantage of the PS5 Pro‚Äôs processing power. For those running the game on Sony‚Äôs latest iteration of the PlayStation 5, two new graphics presets can be found in the settings: Pro and Pro Max. Both of these prests introduce HFR, but Pro Max causes a noticeable frame rate drop.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-photo-mode-when">Photo Mode When?</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1854524305813717406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media platforms</a>, Shift Up posted a comparison video showcasing the difference between PS5 and PS5 Pro Stellar Blade gameplay. It takes something of a trained eye to truly spot the difference, but it‚Äôs there ‚Äì somewhere.</p>



<figure><p>
https://twitter.com/StellarBlade/status/1854524305813717406
</p></figure>







<p>Of course, in the comments under these posts, fans were quick to demand an ETA for photo mode, which was announced recently by Shift Up and is on the way. It doesn‚Äôt have a date for when it‚Äôs going to be added to the game, but it‚Äôs one of the most highly anticipated features that fans are holding out for.</p>



<p>It should have been present when the game was released, but who am I to judge?</p>



<p>The team also revealed recently that the game‚Äôs first major DLC is on the way. In September, the team at Shift Up announced a Stellar Blade x Nier Automata crossover that will ‚Äòbring post-apocalyptic universes colliding together‚Äô. </p>



<p>In April, when Stellar Blade was released, it topped the charts and shifted a million copies in just a few weeks, which isn‚Äôt bad for a new IP. It‚Äôs encouraging to see that Shift Up has plans to deliver more content, and this PR5 Pro Max upgrade is only the beginning.</p>

                <p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has spoken about the importance in creating new franchises, or "new IP," in the industry parlance. During <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/11/06/take-two-interactive-software-ttwo-q2-2025-earning/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Take-Two's latest earnings briefing</a>, Zelnick said nothing remains popular forever, so it's an essential business condition to always make new things instead of relying on sequels.</p><p>"We're different than a lot of other big companies. It's tempting for a big company to rest on its laurels," he said.</p><p>Take-Two would know a thing or two about having big franchises, as the company owns the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead franchises, both of which are enormously successful. Take-Two has referred to GTA and Red Dead as "permanent" franchises, meaning the company will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-reason-to-believe-red-dead-redemption-2-is-happening/1100-6419966/" data-ref-id="1100-6419966">never stop making sequels.</a></p><p>At the same time, though, Zelnick said Take-Two needs to create new franchises or else it runs the risk of business deterioration.</p><p>"We know that if we put out a sequel, it's a lower-risk proposition than new intellectual property. But everything degrades. And even though most of our franchise sequels tend to do better than the prior release, and we're really proud of that because that's not standard for the industry," he said.</p><p>Zelnick added: "The truth is there is this thing called decay and entropy, and it's a feature of physics and human life and everything that exists on earth. And so ultimately, everything does decay, including hit titles. So if we're not trying new things and making new intellectual property, we're... to say that we're resting on our laurels really understates it. We're really running the risk of burning the furniture to heat the house, and that doesn't end well."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="107486311" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

continue to try new things, even if they don't succeed. Gearbox's MOBA Battleborn is an example of a new Take-Two property failing to find an audience; the same can be said for Evolve. Beyond the console/PC space, Zelnick said Take-Two is trying new things on mobile and has found some success with games like Match Factory and Toon Blast.</p><p>Trying new things means that "the risk profile is higher," and Take-Two will sometimes slip up and take a hit financially. "But in the fullness of time, it's one of the key ways to create durable value," he said of new IP.</p><p>Looking ahead, Take-Two has a number of new IP in the works, including the multiplayer game<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/project-ethos/" data-ref-id="5000-647673"> Project Ethos</a>. Zelnick said on the call that he "couldn't be more proud" of the team at 31st Union and the game itself. 31st Union held an open test for the game earlier this year, and Zelnick said the team has been "enthused" about the feedback. "So we're off to a great start, and there's more to come," he said.</p><p>Another new IP coming from Take-Two is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/judas/" data-ref-id="5000-577619">Judas</a>, the next game from BioShock designer Ken Levine.</p><p>Take-Two's biggest upcoming game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, which launches in Fall 2025 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. The company also has Borderlands 4 coming up from Gearbox in 2025. These games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-borderlands-4-wont-be-released-close-to-each-other-take-two-boss-says/1100-6527624/" data-ref-id="1100-6527624">won't be released close together</a>, which suggests Borderlands 4 is coming earlier in 2025.</p>

            <p>
It barely seems like yesterday I was writing it barely seems like yesterday since we last had a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> update, but here I am doing it again as Hello Games' exploratory space sim ushers in cross-save support, PS5 Pro enhancements, and even the return of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>'s Normandy.
</p>
<p>
All this comes via No Man's Sky's latest update (the sixth this year, if you're counting, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-the-cursed-is-a-spooky-expedition-for-halloween-set-in-a-collapsing-reality">October's The Cursed update</a>), which begins with a feature "years" in the making: cross-save. Starting today, cross-save is available alongside cross-play for all platforms - including PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, Steam Deck, PSVR VR 1 &amp; 2, and PC VR - meaning players can pick up from where they left off regardless of which machines they're hopping between.
</p>
<p>
Hello Games says introducing the feature has been "especially difficult" given the range of platforms its catering for and the age of saves some players are still using. "It‚Äôs very common for players to rack up thousands of hours of... incredibly detailed saves," it explains. "Adding cross-save for us is a little bit like moving house, the longer people have lived there, the more complicated it is to move them! We also have players who played once at launch, eight years ago, suddenly loading up that save on a platform that didn‚Äôt even exist back then!"
</p>
<p>
As such, Hello Games is taking a cautious approach to cross-save and rolling out the feature gradually. Starting today, all players can <a href="https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save">link their various platform accounts together via the No Man's Sky website</a>, and a "subset of players" will be able to access cross-saves initially. "In the coming weeks," the studio adds, "all players will be invited to do so."
</p><p>
But there's more; to coincide with today's PlayStation Pro launch, Hello Games is releasing an enhanced version of No Man's Sky for the platform, introducing "crisp 4K resolution at 60fps" and 8K at 30fps. That's alongside improved lighting, plus ultra quality reflections and higher quality ambient occlusion across all modes. These enhancements are also available on PSVR2.
</p>
<p>
And finally for today's No Man's Sky update, Hello Games is joining in with BioWare's annual Mass Effect N7 celebrations by running an "overhauled" version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-unlock-mass-effects-normandy-sr1-as-a-frigate-in-no-mans-sky-for-a-limited-time">2021's limited-time Beachhead expedition</a>. Completing this quest unlocks Mass Effect's SSV Normandy SR1 as a useable frigate in-game, with players having two weeks to acquire it starting today.
</p>
<p>
As to what's next for No Man's Sky, we've yet to hear more about the Worlds Part 2 release Hello Games teased alongside the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-borrows-some-of-light-no-fires-fancy-tech-for-a-planetary-overhaul-in-latest-update">massive Worlds Part 1 update</a> back in July, but that one seems to have slipped so it's unclear if we'll see more of it this year. And, of course, we're coming up to 12 months <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">since the reveal of the studio's next game</a>, Light No Fire, so perhaps we'll learn more about that come December's Game Awards.

            <title><![CDATA[Take-Two Sells Indie Label Private Division to Undisclosed Buyer]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-private-division-sale</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-two-sells-indie-label-private-division-to-undisclosed-buyer.1029750/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-private-division-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Take-Two has sold off its indie label Private Division to an unknown buyer, citing a need to "focus [its] resources on growing [its] core and mobile businesses for the long-term".</p>

<p>In a set of <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e938f73a-cfd7-46ac-b308-3f5b55acaeb7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">prepared remarks</a> accompanying Take-Two's latest financial results, company president Karl Slatoff says that the transaction involved the mystery buyer "purchas[ing Take-Two's] rights to substantially all of Private Division's live and unreleased titles".</p>

<p>It looks like Early Access action RPG&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/no-rest-for-the-wicked">No Rest for the Wicked</a></em>, which was released back in April,&nbsp;wasn't included in that transaction, though, because Slatoff says that Take-Two "will continue to support" the game. He concludes by thanking Private Division for its "contributions" to Take-Two.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-rest-for-the-wicked-take-two-private-division.jpg?itok=WqMTJJ-U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/no-rest-for-the-wicked-take-two-private-division.jpg?itok=C1c891Eh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Private Division has been sold, but it looks like&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked&nbsp;</em>hasn't.</figcaption></figure><p>Private Division's fate has been uncertain for some time. When Take-Two <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs">laid off 5% of its workforce</a> back in April, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/take-two-interactive-shuts-down-two-game-studios" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bloomberg report</a> noted that many of the workers who would lose their jobs as part of that layoff wave were Private Division employees.</p>

<p>Later, in May, evidence began to pile up that Take-Two had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intercept-games-shut-down-kerbal-space-program-2">shuttered the developers</a> of&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rollerdrome</em>, both of which were games published by Private Division. Take-Two itself, however, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-denies-roll7-intercept-closure">denied shutting down those studios</a>.</p>

<p>Towards the end of that same month,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake developer Bloober Team revealed that its partnership with Private Division for an upcoming new horror IP <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-private-division-end-partnership">had ended</a>, with Take-Two being the entity that terminated said partnership.</p>

<p>That game may well be new horror project&nbsp;<em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em>, which will now be self-published by Bloober Team. It's circumstantial, of course, but this could be more evidence that Private Division was in the process of being sold even then.</p>

<p>According to Take-Two, this financial performance was mainly driven by "strength in the&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>franchises", and that's without the release of&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025">due to arrive next year</a>.</p>

We don't yet know to whom Private Division was sold, but it's possible we'll find out in the coming weeks. Stay tuned.</p>

            <p>A few months ago, the rumour took root that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>'s release date would <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-could-slip-to-2026-under-rockstar-fallback-plan-according-to-reports">slip back from 2025 to 2026</a>. An anonymous insider averred that studio heads were "worried" about the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> game's progress - hence, perhaps, Rockstar's decision to mandate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-reportedly-orders-gta-6-developers-to-end-hybrid-working-in-the-name-of-quality-and-polish">a full return to in-office work</a>. Pshaw, say publishers Take-Two CEO. They announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-grand-theft-auto-6-of-grand-theft-auto-6-likes-aka-grand-theft-auto-vi-is-coming-next-fall">a fall 2025 launch in March</a> and have just doubled down on it in <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e938f73a-cfd7-46ac-b308-3f5b55acaeb7">their latest financial briefing</a>, with CEO Strauss Zelnick subsequently going on the tellybox to say that Take-Two are "highly confident in the timing", though he still has nothing to share about GTA 6 on PC.</p><!--more-->
<p>Asked how Take-Two work out a game's release timing by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/17/take-two-ceo-on-gta-vi-release-upswing-in-mobile-gaming.html">CNBC</a>, Zelnick commented that "there are elements that you can actually measure, for example the number of bugs in a title, and every one of us will make sure we have as few bugs as possible before we launch.</p>
<p>"However, in the case of an extraordinary title, for which there are extraordinary expectations, it's not really about bugs," he went on. "It's about creating an experience that no one's seen before, and Rockstar Games seeks perfection in what they do. And perfection is indeed hard to measure, it really is more subjective than objective."</p>
<p>CNBC were not appeased by these scintillating philosophical <em>bon mots</em>. They pressed ahead, asking Zelnick how confident he was in the fall 2025 timing, given that it wasn't so long ago that Take-Two had GTA 6 pinned for 2025 at large.</p>
<p>"Well, there is slippage in the industry and we're not immune from that," Zelnick replied. "However, we narrowed the timing because we are highly confident in that timing."</p>
<p>Here's another GTA 6 release snippet by way of <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/take-two-interactive-sells-tales-of-the-shire-developer-private-division-strauss-zelnick-on-trump-election-1236202964/">Variety</a>, who had their own interview with Zelnick. In this latter chinwag, Zelnick commented that the game won't release at the same time as Borderlands 4, due between 1st April 2025 and 31st March 2026, because "it's safe to say that we wouldn't, and no one would, stack up huge releases unnecessarily." I think it's also safe to say that if it came to a conflict over launch windows, Borderlands 4 would be the one to make room.</p><p>The fall 2025 release only covers the game's console showing, of course. Take-Two have yet to spill the beans about the GTA 6 PC release date, but Zelnick did say in an earnings call last night that they're feeling pretty good about PC support in general.</p>
<p>"The audience is going to show up if you have great properties, so we just have to make sure to be on an array of platforms," he said, via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/gta-6-publisher-says-it-isnt-complicated-for-us-to-support-pc-and-great-cool-so-wheres-that-gta-6-pc-announcement/">Gamesradar</a>. "If one platform diminishes in value, there's always another one.</p>
<p>"We're seeing great growth in PC right now, for example. I have been of the view that open formats would continue to grow and PC is an open format. I do think PC will continue to be a more and more important part of the console business going forward, and that isn't complicated for us to support at all. So the bottom line is, we are selective about which platforms we support. We make the tech work when we can make it work, as long as the audience is big enough to make that worthwhile."</p>

<p>If I had been present during that CNBC interview, I would have asked Zelnick what he thinks of the fact that GTA 5 players are obsessively trying to predict the next GTA 6 marketing beat <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-fans-desperate-for-an-october-reveal-are-convinced-rockstar-are-trolling-them">based on the phases of the moon</a>. This has blown up again on reddit lately because somebody's realised that the Tom Petty song from the GTA 6 trailer, above, has the words "wait for the moon" in it.</p><p>I would have asked about this in the few seconds before somebody spotted the rando Britisher lurking behind the green screen and phoned security. "TELL ME ABOUT THE MOON, STRAUSS," I would have bellowed, as huge men in tuxedos dragged me away into an unmarked van.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Take-Two has two big releases coming up next year, GTA 6 and Borderlands 4, and the CEO has just confirmed that both titles will not be released close to each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/take-two-interactive-sells-tales-of-the-shire-developer-private-division-strauss-zelnick-on-trump-election-1236202964/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick stated that they would not release GTA 6 and Borderlands 4 in the same period, even though they have similar release windows. When asked about this, Zelnick stated, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs safe to say that we wouldn‚Äôt, and no one would, stack up huge releases unnecessarily.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>



<p>It‚Äôs worth noting that GTA 6 is scheduled to release in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fall of 2025</a>, as confirmed during the latest earnings call, and Borderlands 4 has been announced for fiscal year 2026, which falls between April 1, 2025 and March 31, 2026. It is hard to figure out Take-Two‚Äôs release plans for both titles, but they could reserve 2025 for GTA 6 and let Borderlands 4 find its glory in 2026.&nbsp;We will have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure. </p>



<p>In the same interview, Zelnick also acknowledged the Borderlands movie‚Äôs disappointing run; however, he added that<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-borderlands-movie-disappointing-but-helped-sell-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> it helped sell more video games within the franchise</a>. Zelnick stated that they are still looking forward to more adaptations of their intellectual properties and have selectively licensed some of them. Currently, they have a deal pending on the ‚ÄòBioshock‚Äô adaptation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the Red Dead Redemption series has sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-series-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 92 million units</a>. Also, a new PGA Tour 2K title has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-pga-tour-2k-game-confirmed-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed for 2025</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-weapon-customization/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-weapon-customization-lets-you-add-a-shotgun-to-a-sniper-rifle.1029732/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-weapon-customization/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Since the days of Army of Two, I‚Äôve been a fan of weapon customization in video games. It‚Äôs satisfying to take a standard rifle or submachine gun, modify it to your liking, and make it a memorable weapon that remains with you throughout the story. In Stalker 2, weapon customization proves extensive, and you have many unique options‚Äîpistols, SMGs, sniper rifles, and even light machine guns.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-weapon-customization-like-in-stalker-2">What‚Äôs Weapon Customization Like in Stalker 2?</h2>



<p>Thanks to a recent gameplay trailer, ‚ÄòSmoking Barrels,‚Äô we now better understand the weapon customization mechanics in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl. It appears GSC Game World borrowed plenty from past titles, including the weapon upgrade menu and mechanic, which is genuinely nice to see return. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl - Exclusive Smoking Barrels Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NAz3_4uvG0k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The trailer, which you can watch above in its entirety, showcases several unique weapons found across the Zone, along with customization, upgrade mechanics, and even jam and maintenance gameplay. According to the studio, we must account for our weapon‚Äôs cleanliness, ballistics, physics, and even the ammunition type we bring to each encounter.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-stalker-2-weapons-that-we-know-so-far">All Stalker 2 Weapons That We Know So Far</h2>



<p>In all, there are 35 weapons in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, ranging from early-game handguns to late-game machine guns and launchers. You‚Äôll likely wind up with a favorite. I have my eye on the OTs-02 Kiparis for close-range encounters and the AS VAL for everything else, but I know many will opt for the HK416 for its modularity and accuracy.</p>

Pulling five in one go will certainly speed this process along, however.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This has led many to desperately attempt to figure out if there's a hidden mechanic that can trigger god packs, though beyond the almost definitely not legitimate conspiracy theory about crinkled corners, it comes down to pure luck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Creatures Inc. has shared the actual odds behind these packs, however, which are officially just called Rare Packs.

While Wonder Picks are often reserved to middling packs, leaving plenty of common cards on the table for the random one in five chance, god packs obviously guarantee <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-has-a-secret-mew-card-thats-not-super-difficult-to-get">an incredibly rare card</a> even at their weakest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pok√©mon TCG Pocket arrived in October as a streamlined, digital version of the beloved trading card game. It has players opening packs, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">collecting cards</a>, building decks, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-love-farfetchd-and-theyre-absolutely-right">battling others;</a> a simple formula that's already proved popular given it made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">$12 million in four days</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. is busy adding all sorts of events to the game, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gets-first-pvp-event-today">a player versus player battle event released today, November 7</a>. This isn't quite a full competitive mode for Pok√©mon TCG Pocket but is certainly a step in that direction, and will certainly be the first proper competitive test of which decks are best, with both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">Mewtwo ex and Charizard ex having dominated so far</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Just like in the real world, you can find jobs to make a living while forming deep relationships through interactions. With a complete community simulation of every character acting on their free will, you can experience unexpected events to feel the various emotions life has to offer. With <em>inZOI</em>, we hope to share the message that ‚Äúlife itself is the true gift, and every journey has its own meaning.‚Äù</p><p><strong>Live the Life of Your Dreams!</strong></p><p><em>inZOI</em> provides a variety of creative tools, so that players can visualize the life they‚Äôve always dreamed of. Developed using Unreal Engine 5, the game‚Äôs realistic graphics allows the players to let their imagination run free, with easy creation of different resources. Customize your character‚Äôs appearance and outfit and build your custom home using a wide selection of freely-movable furniture and structures. You can also adjust different parts of your property and surrounding roads as well as aspects of your residing city for a fully customizable experience.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Here is a message from producer and director Hyungjun ‚ÄúKjun‚Äù Kim posted to the game‚Äôs official Discord server today:</p><blockquote><p>To <em>inZOI</em> fans around the world,</p><p>First, I want to express my sincerest gratitude to all of our fans. Your immense love and unwavering support mean everything to us. I was especially touched by the wonderful reception we received at gamescom. Seeing everyone create such unique Zois during our <em>inZOI: Character Studio</em> demo period was truly inspiring.</p><p>Initially, we were uncertain about introducing ‚ÄúCanvas‚Äù to the world, not knowing how many people would actually participate. However, the turnout was amazing, with an incredible amount of uploads. Seeing such engagement brought us so much happiness, and it was inspiring to see how deeply people connected with <em>inZOI</em>. Your response and feedback made us realize the responsibility we have to provide players with the most complete experience possible.</p><p>This message is about that realization. After reviewing your feedback from <em>inZOI: Character Studio</em> and analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests, we have made our decision to release <em>inZOI</em> in Early Access on March 28, 2025. We apologize that we could not bring you the game sooner, but this decision reflects our commitment to giving <em>inZOI</em> the best possible start.</p><p>It is said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings. The extra love and care that is required to properly nurture a child is how I see our journey with <em>inZOI</em>‚Äîa game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth. This change in our release date represents our dedication to giving <em>inZOI</em> a stronger foundation, so we can embark on this journey together in the best way possible.</p><p>Until the release date, we‚Äôll continue to improve areas that need attention, striving to create a game that truly captures the essence of life simulation. Our goal is to deliver an experience fans can enjoy for years to come. We‚Äôll keep you updated on our development progress, and we hope you‚Äôll continue to join us on this journey towards <em>inZOI</em>‚Äòs Early Access and beyond. Thank you.</p><p>With love,<br>Kjun</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/inZOI-EA_11-07-24_Art.jpg"></a></figure></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
