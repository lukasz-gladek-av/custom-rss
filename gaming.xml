            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and From Software have announced that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>sales have reached another impressive milestone just over a week before a major DLC expansion arrives.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1800890964925366476" rel="noopener" target="_blank">message posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter) earlier today, Bandai Namco revealed that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>has crossed 25 million sales, which is pretty impressive for a game that's more than two years old.</p>
<p>It's likely that a new surge of Tarnished discovered the game after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-release-date">release date</a> for its&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>expansion was announced back in February. Further information for the expansion, including the setup for its (characteristically oblique) narrative, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-trailer">revealed last month</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-sales-25-million-shadow-of-the-erdtree.jpg?itok=0dLuJHAt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-sales-25-million-shadow-of-the-erdtree.jpg?itok=XLaQN-h0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>sales have hit another impressive milestone.</figcaption></figure><p>In February 2023, Bandai Namco announced that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-grow-to-20-million-tarnished">had sold 20 million copies</a>, which means that the game has clocked up another five million sales between then and now.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>has been one of the publisher's most successful games to date; last year, Bandai Namco <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-announces-declining-financial-results-for-games-as-armored-core-6-cant">revealed declining game sales</a> owing to the fact that&nbsp;<em>Armored Core 6</em>, despite proving "popular", could not compete with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-announces-growing-financial-results-due-to-elden-rings-continuing-strong">sales boost</a> in the same period the year prior.</p>
<p>Around the time of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s release, Bandai Namco <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-top-12-million-as-creators-look-to-expand-ip">declared its intention</a> to "expand" the game's IP, and there have been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tencent-working-mobile-version-hit-console-game-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-02-06/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">murmurs</a> that the publisher is working with Tencent to create a mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, although nothing has been officially revealed yet.</p>
<p>Honestly, as a huge&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>fan, I'm rather hoping nothing comes of this desire, because I don't want to see the IP sullied by underwhelming projects that dilute the original game. Still, who knows? The&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>mobile game might be great. Ahem.</p>

<p>If you somehow haven't heard of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, it's an open-world action-RPG developed by&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>studio From Software.</p>
<p>The game transposes those games' characteristically brutal third-person combat into an open-world environment, tasking players with traveling to various locations and defeating demigods in order to become the Elden Lord of the Lands Between.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/poppy-playtime-pride-shirt<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Poppy Playtime&nbsp;</em>developer Mob Entertainment has created a new Pride shirt featuring some of the game's characters, and the net proceeds from sales of the shirt are going to a good place.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://poppyplaytime.com/products/smiling-critters-pride-tee" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Smiling Critters Pride Tee</a>, as it's called, features eight&nbsp;<em>Poppy Playtime&nbsp;</em>mascot toys arranged in the colors of the rainbow, with CatNap carrying a Pride flag in its disturbingly long tail.</p>
<p>Alongside CatNap, the other critters featured on the shirt are as follows: PickyPiggy, Bobby BearHug, DogDay, KickinChicken, Hoppy Hopscotch, CraftyCorn, and Bubba Bubbaphant. Naturally, PickyPiggy's color isn't in the standard rainbow, but he's just happy to be an ally, and you should be too!</p>

Now's your chance to do just that.</figcaption></figure><p>The shirt is unisex and made from 100% cotton, and what's more, every cent of its net proceeds will go to <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Trevor Project</a>, a charity specializing in suicide prevention for LGBTQ+ folks.</p>
<p>In fact, Mob Entertainment <a href="https://x.com/mobgamesstudios/status/1798397157344452945" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced earlier this month</a> that it has donated $2000 to The Trevor Project to celebrate Pride Month, further going on to affirm that "LGBTQIA+ rights are human rights". Good for you, Mob Entertainment.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Poppy Playtime&nbsp;</em>is a pretty popular franchise, with the first game (which is needed to play subsequent chapters) attracting tens of thousands of reviews on Steam.</p>
<p>As such, Mob Entertainment's message has the potential to reach a pretty sizable audience, and given the positivity of that message, that's something to be celebrated. Let's hope the shirt gets some serious sales.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/poppy-playtime-pride-shirt-gameplay.jpg?itok=ml_4p8Lp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/poppy-playtime-pride-shirt-gameplay.jpg?itok=g9ML2VFf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Poppy Playtime</em>'s Pride shirt could reach a pretty big audience.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Poppy Playtime</em>, it's a mascot-based horror franchise that's not a million miles away from&nbsp;<em>Five Nights at Freddy's</em>.</p>
<p>The games revolve around a series of toys that have, as you might expect, gone murder-crazy, and you must survive their rampage in a derelict toy factory filled with puzzles to solve and monstrous toys to avoid.</p>
<p><em>Poppy Playtime</em>'s first installment launched in 2021 and is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/poppy-playtime-chapter-2-released-chapter-1-free-forever">free to play</a>, but if you want to continue the story, you'll need to buy Chapters 2 and 3. Still, at least now you know developer Mob Entertainment is using the money for a good cause (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/poppy-playtime-faces-review-backlash-over-addition-of-nfts">well, mostly, anyway</a>).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-forward-presentation-and-impressions/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As the period fans have been begging Ubisoft forever since Desmond’s first days in the Animus, Assassin’s Creed is finally exploring Feudal Japan with a new story and dual protagonist setup. Book-ending the Ubisoft Forward press conference and our last appointment of Summer Game Fest’s Play Days, Ubisoft invited us to take a deeper behind-closed-doors look at <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-13-minutes-gameplay/">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>.</p>
<p>During a guided presentation on PlayStation 5, Ubisoft presented an intimate look following the first assassination mission involving Yasuke, the more brash and directly honorable of the dual protagonists. Standing approximately six feet tall, Yasuke is head and shoulders above most Japanese retainers and common folk that adorn the streets of Fukuchiyama. As Ubisoft Quebec puts it, there’s no social stealth for Yasuke for quite obvious reasons. Each presentation has been quite cagey about bringing up Yasuke’s skin color despite it being such a notable part of the history that resulted in him being one of the first foreign retainers under Nobunaga Oda. Yet at the same time, the music that builds up once Yasuke enters combat infuses the traditional Japanese shakuhachi and koto melodies with hip-hop beats.</p>
<p>It was the second half of the presentation that deviated greatly from what Ubisoft Forward showed off with the mission to infiltrate a castle and eliminate an allegedly corrupt Lord Hayashi. In the moments leading into the mission, the UI is populated with hints about surface-level information about the target rather than just another icon for the minimap. As players walk through the level and eavesdrop on conversations, information populates. Eventually, the lord is indicated as spending time wandering through the nightly gardens due to insomnia, giving a clear indication of the end goal.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ACSH_Screenshot_YasukeTraining_240610_1pm_PST-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As Yasuke, players lose the assassination tools, such as the grappling hook and eagle sight, in exchange for raw power. Rather than trying to jump over and scramble over a locked gate, Yasuke can instead shoulder tackle and burst through like a wrecking ball. Yasuke can go loud and alert anyone in the immediate vicinity by utilizing a matchlock tanegashima rifle that tears through armor and bone alike.</p>
<p>His playstyle in combat is about as far from the assassin’s style as one can get. A massive studded club was Yasuke’s primary weapon in the Assassin’s Creed Shadows demos, which would be swung around like a baseball bat and squish ashigaru skulls like overripe tomatoes. For enemies that take more than a single strike to down, Yasuke’s mighty swings rip through the air and smash into their armor to strip their breastplates off in the streets. Charged attacks and a trio of special skills each operated on cooldowns mix up his brutish swings all the while having the fortitude to shrug off intense blows.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Naoe hearkens back to the more refined assassination styles. In addition to the single hidden blade, this plucky shinobi wields a shorter katana and a chain-and-sickle weapon called a kusarigama. With the latter, Naoe can swing a massive chain around for crowd control but also stun enemies with the weighted end before closing the distance and stabbing the foe with the sickle end (sometimes taking more than one stab to finish them out in brutal fashion). As a much smaller and more nimble combatant, Naoe does more with her agile frame to dodge and jump around the battlefield to sidestep enemy attacks that glow red (blue-highlighted attacks, on the other hand, can be blocked and parried).</p>
<p>Ubisoft Quebec omitted a year for the period during which this particular Assassin’s Creed Shadows mission took place, although there’s still a certain range of possibilities, starting with 1579, when Yasuke arrived in Japan as a Jesuit slave and sword-bearer for the missionaries who touched ground. The Honno-ji Incident of Summer 1582 marks the death of Nobunaga Oda, so I would narrow down the majority of Shadows’ storyline to fall within the three-year window.</p>
<p>In talking with other journalists, there was the concern that Ubisoft would provide a cold opening and tutorial segment with Yasuke in chains before being brought to Japan, but there would have to be a great degree of sensitivity and care that I feel an Assassin’s Creed title is not yet capable of portraying despite the multinational development cast. Similarly, the assassination mission presented an early encounter between Yasuke and Naoe to work as colleagues rather than competing anti-Templar fellows. In the art centerpieces featuring Naoe, she is marked by a scar below her right eye that seems indicative of a key moment or failed mission.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ACSH_Screenshot_NachiFalls_240610_1pm_PST-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is looming on the horizon with a release that fans won’t have to wait much longer to check out. Ubisoft Quebec’s latest open-world action-adventure will be released on November 15th, 2024 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, PC (Luna, Ubisoft+ and<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/assassins-creed-shadows" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Epic Game Store</a>) and Mac (Apple Silicon), as well as iPadOS.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Wilds Preview – Wildly Impressive]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-wildly-impressive</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-%E2%80%93-wildly-impressive.899199/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-wildly-impressive<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>First-person shooters have let players carry two (or even more!) weapons for decades. But I can’t explain the excitement I felt when I saw the hunter swap weapons in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>.</p>
<p>This was mid-hunt, too—though <em>Wilds </em>also blurs the meaning of “mid-hunt,” thanks to its seamless world design. In many ways, this feels like the next generation of the franchise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feels like a more direct sequel to <em>World </em>than <em>Rise </em>did, if that makes sense. It looks beautiful in motion, with a certain level of grandeur that befits the monstrous scale of the creatures you can fight.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Mount and Do&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/monster-hunter-rise"><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></a>, <em>Wilds </em>features a companion mount called Seikrets. They move as quickly as Palamutes, but they seem more agile, able to dodge enemy attacks at a moment’s notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, you can pick up items and interact with the environment while on your Seikret, which is very handy considering that the map we saw is twice as large as usual, according to a Capcom spokesperson.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Players can attack while mounted as well. But more importantly, you can equip a second weapon and swap between them while on your Seikret.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the preview we saw at Summer Game Fest Play Days, the hunter started with a great sword and heavy bowgun, swapping freely between them depending on the situation. Afterward, he equipped a long sword and dual blades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re new to the franchise, it’s hard to explain how big of a paradigm shift this is. It’s sort of like going from a 1v1 fighting game like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/street-fighter-6"><em>Street Fighter</em></a> to a team game like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-ball-fighterz-review-new-saga-of-heroes"><em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em></a>. They’re both fighting games, but the approaches are wildly different.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Storming Into Battle&nbsp;</h2>
<p>For the preview, we saw a hunter take on an Alpha Doshaguma, a bulky four-legged beast. It could tank a lot of hits, and its speed required some mounted combat just to keep up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first, its herd of three fellow Doshaguma made it hard to deal with, but the cunning use of another monster’s sand trap quickly whittled down the numbers for a more even encounter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This incredibly mobile fight eventually found its way to a naturally occurring storm, bathing the entire field in an eerie blue light and buffeting winds. Lightning occasionally strikes in this space, at yours and the monsters’ perils.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To amp up the stakes, storms also contain a dreaded apex monster. In an attempt to lure the apex to the Doshaguma, the player got one-shot from full health, really illustrating the risks in the storm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the storm though, the plains sung green, as a period of abundance hit the field. It suddenly became lush and verdant, with vigorwasps (that can heal you) being plentiful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other local flora and fauna changes with the weather; special attention was given to some birds building nests during the green season. Like with other <em>Monster Hunter</em> games, planning is absolutely vital—but so are improvising and making the best of the hand you’re dealt.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Seamless World of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>This feels like the grandest entry in <em>Monster Hunter</em> to date, and a big part of it is just how few barriers there were in our preview. From the hub village, we saw the player talk to some NPCs, buy some cheese, set up camp, cook a meal, then find the Alpha Doshaguma.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There wasn’t a single loading screen here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can just walk out of the village, find a monster, and start hitting it. The map shows all sorts of icons about the monsters around you, and you can mark one to immediately create a quest for yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a monster marked and your scoutflies are tracking it, you can even make your Seikret auto run to it. It’s a small convenience, but it’s great for if you faint and have to return to the fight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After beating a monster, the usual 60-second timer to carve materials shows up, but you don’t have to return to the village after that’s done. <em>Rise </em>also let you continue to explore after a quest, but it still felt compartmentalized from the hub. Here, it all feels more like a living, breathing open world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are some logistic questions that I still have; like if you want to farm a specific monster, would you have to reload an instance of the world after killing it? What happens if you lead a monster to the village? Are there more maps with their own hub village within?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever the answers to these questions are, I’m absolutely on board for more of what Capcom’s serving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It took me five tries to learn how to enjoy <em>Monster Hunter</em>, with <em>Rise </em>finally being the first one I “got.” And now that I understand what I’m on board for, I’m ready to set aside another 100 hours for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>.&nbsp;</p>

  <p id="98cnF4">The Monster Hunter series has introduced players to an array of daunting biomes over the years. Forthcoming entry <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, however, invites you to inhabit an ecosystem with its own rules and cycles — as well as its own retaliations to your hostile presence.</p>
<p id="JLoXhQ">At a hands-off session presented by Capcom during Summer Game Fest 2024, the developer showcased the planning and execution of a hunt for around 40 minutes. Alongside some promising iterations on mechanics seen in recent entries — mainly drawing from <em>Monster Hunter World</em> and <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em> — <em>Wilds</em> has a bigger emphasis on presenting environments that breathe with life, and on reckoning with how your actions affect those environments.</p>
<p id="f2rIqL">The demo started with a short glimpse at the new central hub. The cat-like Palicoes are at it again, running the stands where you’ll be crafting and upgrading gear, prepping meals and feasting to gain buffs before hunts, and taking on requests. Once you get into an expedition, however, the structure is substantially different.</p>
<p id="19pHIV">In older Monster Hunter games, the hub served as the starting point for all missions. You’d often pick a quest to tackle, grab everything you needed, and the objective would automatically take you someplace else for a specific amount of time — rinse and repeat. Later entries, depending on the mission type, toyed with the idea of a more free-roaming approach, allowing you to perform multiple hunts or gather resources in one go within an interconnected area.</p>

<p id="pHdMv0"><em>Wilds</em> leans into this approach to such an absurd degree that the hub almost becomes an afterthought. As the developer guiding the demo explained, you’re free to stick around in a map for as long as you desire or need. Missions begin once you manually start the objective, such as attacking the monster you need to attack. Once you’re done, you get a flashy mission complete screen and you can continue on your way.</p>
<p id="hAf3qj">Moments after the demonstrator arrived at the Windward Plains biome, a number of notifications appeared on screen that indicated monster appearances and other key details. As time passed, I found their frequency a bit overwhelming. It’s not as bad as a social media feed — and certainly less toxic — but I’m hoping there will be options to filter information in the final game, so you can only get notified of what you need, instead of knowing everything that’s happening in the map while you’re busy trying not to get stomped or set on fire.</p>
<p id="6JYnaL">Considering just <em>how much</em> is happening, however, the notifications also seem like a necessary evil. A day-and-night cycle, as well as weather conditions, dictate what you’ll encounter within a map at any given time — not just whether or not the Rathalos you need to defeat to craft a new pair of boots is flying around, but also which resources and smaller wildlife you can find.</p>
<p id="FJ3Z4n">There are some extreme weather conditions that wildly affect the entire map. The demo took place in a desert-type biome that was quickly overshadowed by a sandstorm. This storm also led to lightning strikes at random, turning a gorgeous landscape into a series of death traps. Wildlife quickly took notice of this, too, with some monsters fleeing toward their nests inside a cavern to protect themselves, and birds flying away from trees.</p>

<p id="omx9u1">Such conditions might lose the element of surprise after a while. Similarly to notifications, I can see sandstorms becoming annoying if you’re being affected by them every 15 minutes. If the final game nails the pacing, however, the illusion of this living, breathing ecosystem will be much more believable.</p>
<p id="K5Az8j">Players can also take advantage of the environment and its hazards during hunts. In <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, you can make use of your gadgets to set environmental traps, like luring a creature that’s chasing you to a pile of rocks that will fall on its head from a cave’s ceiling. There are other returning mechanics, such as monsters fighting each other, that seem to interconnect with the protagonism of biomes in neat ways; for example, in the demo, a monster created a sand pit from underneath the sand, which became a trap for other creatures nearby that got dragged into it. I’m also intrigued to see how the herd system, in which a group of creatures of the same type patrol together with an alpha leading the charge, will play into the final game.</p>
<p id="VcvX0Z">It’s hard to judge how the overall experience of <em>Wilds</em> will feel, considering that repetition is a pillar of the series. Some of the new additions seem to be there to surprise the player at first glance, but there’s no knowing just how much they’ll interfere with your subsequent visits. From the bite-sized showcase I saw, however, it’s clear that the new structure of biomes invites you to stay for a good while, especially with the new mounts that make traversal faster.</p>
<p id="01rJz5">After the refinements made to the series in recent years, placing the focus on the spaces you wreck havoc in seems like the obvious next step. For all the marvelous detail packed into the biomes, I hope there’s stronger messaging around the environmental impact of taming not just wildlife, but an entire ecosystem, using its resources and rules to your advantage. As much as I enjoyed seeing Palicoes making cheese next to a monster farm or baby versions of creatures sitting in their nests, Monster Hunter has never been about sightseeing. Even if the environments of <em>Wilds</em> pose a challenge on top of the already deadly creatures inhabiting them, the tools at hand to overcome these obstacles are only increasing in number. Once more, it seems that damaging the ecosystem to craft better gear and become more proficient in your hunts is the point of the game.</p>
<p id="r1QRXi"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X at some point in 2025. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-preview-release-date-1851535133<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been six years since <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> showed what the beloved action series could accomplish when it made the jump from Nintendo’s consoles back to more powerful hardware. As fun as 2021's <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em> was, it was built for the Switch and pulled back in many ways from the ambition of its PlayStation 4 and Xbox One predecessor. With <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, Capcom is remaking the multiplayer monster-slaying  loop from the ground up for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S (and PC) with cross-play, and it shows. The game doesn’t just look bigger and better, it also promises to double down on the immersive fantasy of adventuring out in a monster-filled wilderness and all that entails. </p><p>Capcom wouldn’t let me try <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, currently slated to arrive in 2025, for myself at Summer Game Fest, but I did get to watch did get to watch director Yuya Tokuda play for 30 minutes in a closed-door presentation for press and content creators. We only caught a small glimpse of what’s likely to be another massive game, and it’s impossible to know how the final product will shake out many months from now, but what I saw looked impressive, and suggested that Capcom’s Monster Hunter team is focusing on the right things. Namely: making the world of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>feel as varied, vibrant, and alive as possible. </p><p>Our demo began with Tokuda riding across large desert fields into a village where he could choose his next hunt and prepare for the challenge accordingly. The creature he would set out to kill was an Alpha Doshaguma, a fanged bear-like beast on the Windward Plains with red fur and the weight of a freight train behind it. After double-checking his equipment and picking up some cheeses being aged in the sun from a local merchant, the director uses a minimap full of icons and depicting multiple elevations to head out into the plains in search of his quarry. </p><p>A representative for Capcom narrating the event said fields in <em>Monster Hunter Wild</em>s will be twice the size of those in previous games. Mounts are now a mainstay to help with navigating these sprawling spaces, and no load times between individual areas makes exploration look seamless. Before coming to the Doshaguma, Tokuda selects a random spot to build a destructible pop-up camp where he can cook a meal to get some stat buffs. A nearby creature is killed for its meet which gets cooked in a pan with the cheeses from the village in a mouthwatering dish the hunter consumes with glee.<br></p><p>From there it’s off to the fight. It’s unclear what the normal tracking segment of a <em>Wilds</em> hunt will look like (we weren’t allowed to ask questions), but in our presentation Tokuda essentially just followed a waypoint to a group of Doshaguma and then snuck up on the one that was marked to begin fighting it. Chaos immediately broke out. Smaller beasts were lured into a nearby bramble patch where they got stuck and took damage. Tokuda similarly got the alpha to follow him into a sandpit trap before heading off to a new area. </p><p>After some fighting the battle moved into a second phase at which point a sandstorm began rolling in alongside a lightning-filled thunderstorm. The Doshaguma began fighting a dragon that had wondered into the area, which Tokuda stressed was normally supposed to appear later in the encounter, suggesting unscripted collisions between the game’s monsters and changing weather patters might make repeat hunts more varied. As the storm raged, Tokuda tried to draw the Doshaguma into nearby lighting blasts while also grapple-hooking onto overhanging rocks to down-slash with his sword. Additional special moves targeted specific wounds that could be popped for extra damage. </p><p>After leading the beast on a chase through a large cavern full of falling stalagmites that could be pulled down with the grappling hook, Tokuda came out the other side into a part of the map where the storm had cleared and the sun shone from a clear blue sky. In addition to changing the look and hazards in the world, new weather also impacts what players will find in the environment. With the sandstorm cleared, healing resources were scattered more plentifully throughout the map and smaller creatures were more likely to be found wandering underfoot. It was also here that Tokuda summoned three AI-controlled NPCs to help him finish the fight. </p><p>Tokuda was there to kill a giant Doshaguma, and so he followed it to an alcove where it was attempting to sleep and put a bunch of powder kegs right next to it. What would a <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> demo be without a bit of the series’ infamous sleep bombing? The final moments of the fight involved characters circling on their mounts, shooting the beast from afar, and also grapple-hooking overhead to mount it and attack on its back. It’s the most spectacular a <em>Monster Hunter</em> fight has ever looked, and if the finished game runs that smoothly, fans are in for a great time.<br></p><p>We didn’t get a clear sense of the other things longtime fans will be obsessing over, like which precise monsters will be in the game this time around, how Capcom may have played with the way each weapon works, and dozens of other things that can sound small on their own but come to overwhelmingly define what a new <em>Monster Hunter</em> experience feels like after dozens if not hundreds of hours of play. Instead, our demo concluded with a much more lowkey reveal: migratory birds. Tokuda pulled out his spyglass, peered at a nest in a nearby tree, and revealed a few chicks waiting for their mama. </p><p>The director seemed exceptionally pleased with the promise that players will be able to birdwatch in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, seeing different ones come and go depending on the time and weather, following their own more naturalistic rhythms rather than pre-scripted rulesets. He said if a player waited around long enough, they might even see the mama bird come back and begin feeding the chicks. The possibility cut a sharp contrast with the crocodiles Tokuda had just slaughtered for getting in his way while he had been trying use his spyglass. </p><p><em>Monster Hunter: World </em>helped the dense series break out when it arrived in 2018. My sense of <em>Wilds</em> from my short time with it is that Capcom wants to build on that momentum and make the exploration feel both more natural and more streamlined, with players able to cook food, swap equipment, and choose their next hunt from the field rather than constantly trekking back to a social hub. Long known for its boss fight spectacles and involved loot tables, what I saw of <em>Wilds</em> showed its aiming to be every bit the immersive open-world experience fans of other action-RPGs might be expecting. Possibly even better. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Trooper is lying several feet away, sleeping in a sun spot.<br></p><p>“They named him Roadrunner at the shelter, and I was like, we can’t call him that, that was the most traumatic experience of his life. So I was talking to him about names, we were just chatting, and I said ‘you’re such a trooper’ and his little ears shot up. So that’s his name,” Sean explains.<br></p><p>“He <em>is </em>such a Trooper,” I coo, and watch as his ears twitch with acknowledgment.<br></p><p>Sean continues. “We spent about a year in the city—I don’t really believe in obedience training—learning trust together…and then after that year I started trying him off-leash, seeing what his boundaries were, and he just stayed next to me.”<br></p><figure id="" data-id="39d0cea25eb4e7a583a2751630dde2d8" data-recommend-id="image://39d0cea25eb4e7a583a2751630dde2d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="3024" data-height="4032" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Trooper walking behind Sean at Summer Game Fest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Trooper walking behind Sean at Summer Game Fest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Alyssa Mercante</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="39d0cea25eb4e7a583a2751630dde2d8" data-recommend-id="image://39d0cea25eb4e7a583a2751630dde2d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="3024" data-height="4032" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Trooper walking behind Sean at Summer Game Fest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sean works in theater and film as well, so Trooper has been trotting behind him in Broadway theaters and on film sets for the last nine years (yes, he’s met famous people). “I also teach yoga and meditation so he goes with me to all the classes. He loves sound baths.”<br></p><p>I ask how Sean feels about all the reactions to Trooper (several people stop as we’re talking to pet his extra-warm fur). “It makes me so happy. I think anytime that we can bring a little bit of joy and happiness to people’s lives no matter what it is, that’s the whole point of being alive. That he can do that for others, that makes me really happy,” Sean says, smiling serenely. It’s very clear where Trooper gets his vibes from.</p><p>When I tell Sean that Trooper’s being referred to as the mascot of Summer Game Fest, he laughs. “Summer Trooper Fest,” he suggests. “We were walking around at one point and the president of Xbox, Phil Spencer, came out of a building and he immediately just got down and started petting him. We have this amazing picture of it.”<br></p><p>“I think it’s important, this work is people’s lives, but to get out of a screen and get back into your body is important. Trooper’s whole role is to ground.”<br></p><p>Thank you for the moments of zen this weekend, Troop.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>During 2024's<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5449/"> Summer Game Fest</a>, Sumo Group showcased various games, including Critter Café, Deathsprint 66, Still Wakes the Deep, A Little to the Left, and Parcel Corps. Just one day after SGF ended, the studio announced that it would be laying off 15% of its staff.</p><p dir="ltr">The studio said reshaping "operations across the business to better navigate the upcoming challenges expected in the coming months is a path we must now take to ensure the security of the business going forward."</p><p dir="ltr">The post continues by explaining that the reshaping of operations will "unfortunately include a reduction in the number of people the business can support. Every alternate route to limit the impact to our people is being considered but sadly this process of transformation will affect up to 15% of our people across the Group in Canada, UK, Poland, Czech Republic and India."</p><p dir="ltr">Sumo Group currently has 1,790 employees, so the 15% figure amounts to over 250 people. It's also worth pointing out that Tencent also owns Sumo Group. Earlier this year,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/riot-games-lays-off-530-employees-sunsetting-riot-forge/1100-6520520/#:~:text=Riot%20Games%20Lays%20Off%20530%20Employees%2C%20Sunsetting%20Riot%20Forge%20-%20GameSpot"> Riot Games, which is also owned by the same company, laid off 530 of its employees</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Layoffs have been an unfortunate trend as of late.

<p>Elden Ring's first expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-bosses-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6522484/" data-ref-id="1100-6522484">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, releases on June 21 for $40. It is a meaty expansion, taking players to the Land of Shadow and introducing 10 new bosses to defeat. Players must reach a certain part of the game to access the DLC, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-than-60-of-elden-ring-players-on-steam-arent-ready-for-shadow-of-the-erdtree-yet/1100-6524150/" data-ref-id="1100-6524150">a good percentage of PC users have not done this yet.</a></p><p>Elden Ring's overall sales numbers are expected to grow with the expansion's launch, as Bandai Namco is also releasing a bundle that includes the base game and the expansion for $80. There is also a deluxe edition of the bundle with other extras for $100.</p><p>Developed by From Software, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-is-not-just-a-game-bandai-namco-says/1100-6492709/" data-ref-id="1100-6492709">Elden Ring may become more than a game and jump into other areas in the future.</a> Many are wondering if From Software might release a sequel, and that remains to be seen.</p>

<p data-characters="280" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s clear as day that Bungie has shot for the moon with the new <em>Final Shape</em> DLC for <em>Destiny 2</em>. On top of a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2s-the-pale-heart-location-leans-into-strangeness-and-wouldnt-look-out-of-place-in-warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compelling campaign</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-salvations-edge-raid-schedule-and-details-for-the-final-shape-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a stellar Raid</a>, and an impressive assortment of cool new goodies, there’s also the Dual Destiny mission, which features <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/prismatic-subclass-exotic-class-items-and-enemy-announced-for-destiny-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exotic class items</a>.</p> <p data-characters="661" data-current-count="661" data-injectable="true">Dual Destiny is, essentially, a bog-standard Exotic missions much as the ones we’re all accustomed to seeing as part of the usual seasonal content cadence. Dual Destiny’s unique party trick, though, is that it is very communication-heavy <em>and</em> it comes with no matchmaking <em>and</em> very specifically requires a two-person fireteam. In most cases, <em>Destiny 2</em> opts for three, or six-player fireteams with an occasional foray into four-player activities. Aside from the rare Crimson Days forays into two-player combat scenarios, we’ve never had something quite like Dual Destiny before, and the community isn’t sure what to make of it all just yet.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-destiny-2-s-exotic-class-item-mission-is-a-two-player-ordeal" data-injectable="false">Destiny 2’s Exotic class item mission is a two-player ordeal</h2> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="685" data-injectable="true">Of course, some players are quite thrilled with the Dual Destiny’s revelation. The mission feels like a two-person micro Raid, thanks to its hectic gameplay mechanics <em>and</em> a surprisingly aggressive timer working against the players. Its rewards, too, are quite phenomenal and highly coveted: the Exotic class items (i.e. capes, marks, and bonds) that roll randomized Exotic perks.</p>
 <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">Exotic class items obviously enable a huge array of previously inaccessible combat builds, and so the good news is that as long as you’ve completed Dual Destiny at least once, they will seemingly continue to drop at random from a variety of Pale Heart loot sources. However, not everyone is thrilled with how “limiting” the Dual Destiny mission feels.</p> <figure data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="452" data-current-count="452" data-injectable="true">Since <em>Destiny 2</em> is most pointedly <em>not</em> a single-player game, it’s a given that some of its activity simply won’t be playable for those who don’t want to jump into matches with other people. Raids, for one, have been established as tense six-player activities that basically necessitate constant communication from the get-go. It shouldn’t be <em>that</em> big of a shock to see Bungie experiment with this same concept on a smaller scale.</p>
 <p data-characters="518" data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true">On the other hand, I do get it, as a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-may-not-be-a-solo-game-but-its-how-i-like-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solo <em>Helldivers 2</em> player</a>. There’s certainly no concrete precedent for two-player PvE activities in <em>Destiny 2</em>, and Dual Destiny was, perhaps, always going to be controversial in this context. Whatever the case may be, there are <em>some</em> downsides to Exotic class items worth keeping in mind: you can’t transmog them (and they’re <em>extremely</em> visible), and you’re almost certainly going to have to grind a fair bit until you find something that suits your playstyle.</p>
 <p data-characters="211" data-current-count="211" data-injectable="false">With that in mind, some players are bound to just avoid Dual Destiny altogether and move on with their lives. Form my point of view, though, that’d be a bit of a shame, as the mission looks like great fun.</p>

However, what’s put it in the limelight lately is an allegation of unfair labor practice. The Communication Workers of America say that an entire 160-person team was laid off in retaliation for “engaging in protected organizing activities and protected speech when raising issues regarding their working conditions.”</p> <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false">This comes via <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/communications-workers-america-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-against-lionbridge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release from the CWA labor union</a>, which has already filed an unfair labor practice charge against Lionbridge. It has added that the 160-team based in Boise, Idaho was told they were being let go because work on a project had ended. However, the CWA asserts that separate teams in Mexico and Poland are still working on the very same project.</p> <p data-characters="542" data-current-count="904" data-injectable="true">As if that wasn’t enough, the CWA has brought to attention a similar incident from 2016. Per <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/communications-workers-america-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-against-lionbridge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GeekWire</a>, Lionbridge laid off all unionized employees in Bellevue, Washington who were testing Windows apps for Microsoft. This came only two months after temporary workers had signed their first union contract. At the time, Lionbridge insisted this was due to Microsoft offering less work though former employees believed this wasn’t the case. As such, the CWA has claimed both of these waves of lay-offs are retaliation for unionizing.</p>
 <p data-characters="789" data-current-count="789" data-injectable="true">Since the affected team provided quality-assurance services to Activision, now a Microsoft subsidiary, the CWA has said it expects the Xbox company to “hold its contractors to the same standards the company has set for itself.” In the past, Microsoft has stated it has no issues with unionization efforts, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/zenimax-union-microsoft-unionization-zenimax-workers-united/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly recognizing ZeniMax Workers United</a> (a union for ZeniMax Media’s Q&amp;A department) in 2023, and it even <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-washington-post-ad-pro-union-ftc-activision-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ran an ad in the Washington Post</a> all about how much it approves of unions. It’s worth nothing that this was during the period when Microsoft was seeking approval for its approximately $68.7 billion buyout of Activision. We’ve contacted Microsoft for a comment on the matter and will be sure to update this article should we get a response.</p>
 <p data-characters="539" data-current-count="539" data-injectable="false">There has been a noticeable surge in unionization efforts within the games industry in the last few years. For instance, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/blizzard-albany-qa-developers-vote-union-activision-labor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">QA workers within Blizzard Albany</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/raven-software-qa-employees-vote-to-unionize/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raven Software</a> (two Activision studios that are now part of Microsoft) voted to unionize in 2022. In early 2023, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cwa-activision-blizzard-files-charges-return-to-office-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two QA employees within Activision were fired</a> for expressing outrage with “strong language” in response to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/activision-blizzard-return-to-office-mandate-in-april/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a mandate for a partial return-to-office stipulation</a>, but the CWA said this was a violation of workplace laws and filed charges against the company.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-salvations-edge-raid-guide-second-encounter-dissipation/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=destiny-2-salvations-edge-raid-guide-second-encounter-dissipation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="352" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the winners crowned from&nbsp;<em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/destiny-2/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2</a></em>‘s 48-hour&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-crowns-destiny-2-salvations-edge-world-first-winners/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Salvation’s Edge Raid race</a>, it’s time for everyone else to see what The Witness is hiding in its monolith. The first encounter,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-salvations-edge-first-encounter-raid-guide/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Substratum</a>, set the pace for the puzzle-focused bouts in Salvation’s Edge, and the second encounter, Dissipation, continues that trend.</p> <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false">Not only will players continue the mechanics learned during Substratum, but Dissipation also throws a few extra twists into the mix. Everyone on the Fireteam will have to be ready to take on all roles, as the fight randomly assigns certain mechanics to players.</p> <h2 id="h-best-loadouts-and-gear-for-salvation-s-edge" data-injectable="false">Best loadouts and gear for Salvation’s Edge</h2> <figure data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="388" data-injectable="false">While a lot of the second encounter in Salvation’s Edge is like the first, one significant difference is the presence of a boss. As such, players will want to equip some heavy DPS weapons, with swords working exceptionally well. It’s even better if someone in the Fireteam has an <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-the-ergo-sum-exotic-sword-destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Ergo Sum Exotic sword</a> with Wolfpack Rounds, buffing all other Guardians using non-Exotic swords.</p> <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="790" data-injectable="true">Like the first encounter, players will find themselves alone at points throughout Dissipation. It’s vital that Guardians can keep themselves alive to perform mechanics as needed, so players should have something in their loadout to help them survive. This could mean a Solar healing grenade, a Warlock’s Healing Rift, or even health regen via armor mods like Recuperation or Better Already.</p>
 <h2 id="h-salvation-s-edge-raid-layout-for-dissipation" data-injectable="false">Salvation’s Edge raid layout for Dissipation</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="658" data-injectable="true">The Dissipation encounter occurs in one large, open arena. The boss resides in the middle, and there are three areas where Guardians must direct their attention. There are two plates and a conductor to the left, right, and where players enter the arena. The Fireteam will want to split into three teams of two, with each team taking over an area with plates.</p>
 <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false">Like the previous encounter, one of the two plates will be a starter plate, sending a burst of energy to its partner. This means both players on each team will have to bounce the energy back and forth reliably.</p> <h2 id="h-dissipation-phase-1" data-injectable="false">Dissipation: Phase 1</h2> <figure data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="527" data-current-count="527" data-injectable="true">Shooting the Blight in the center of the arena will start the encounter, and each of the three groups should position themselves at the start of their areas. Yellow bar Taken will begin to appear on the sides of each location, and after eliminating the foes on each side, a Taken miniboss will spawn. Soon after the miniboss appears, a random player on that team will get the Call to Reckoning buff. Those with Call to Reckoning should head into the middle area with the boss, taking down any Taken Knights along the way.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="514" data-current-count="514" data-injectable="true">Once within range, buffed players can start shooting the boss’ head, stopping to pop any Blights that appear within sight. The Call to Reckoning players cannot damage the boss’ head enough to progress the encounter until all Blights are eliminated, so taking care of those should be a priority. One Blight also spawns near the entrance to each of the three plate areas, so the Guardian that didn’t get Call to Reckoning should be on the lookout for a Blight as soon as they finish their miniboss.</p>
 <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true">When all the Blights are&nbsp;gone,&nbsp;and Guardians have done enough damage to the boss’s head, it’ll erupt with orange light. This will change the Call to Reckoning buff to Stolen Valor, allowing players with the buff to see which type of Resonance is required for their team’s conductor. Stolen Valor players should return to their teammate and communicate whether the Crux at the center of the conductor shows a circle or a triangle.</p>
 <h2 id="h-dissipation-phase-2" data-injectable="false">Dissipation: Phase 2</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="670" data-injectable="true">Players can take positions by their plates when all three teams are reunited, and the conductor callout has been communicated. From there, each group can begin bouncing energy back and forth to generate Resonance. Dissipation, unlike Substratum, throws more than one type of Resonance at players. In addition to Pyramidal Resonance, Spherical Resonance will also appear.</p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">The player closing the conductor will need the same type of Resonance as the Stolen Valor buff revealed. That said, Guardians can pick up any kind of Resonance for the first two, as the third Resonance will change all stacks to that type. As long as the last Resonance collected matches the conductor reading, players won’t have trouble closing their conductor.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="775" data-injectable="true">If all three teams close their conductor, a dunk box will appear at the back edge of the arena. Players should quickly move to the box and discard any remaining Resonance to extend the encounter timer before heading over to damage the boss. The boss will throw Blights and stomp on players, but a little healing and the oppressive nature of swords should leave Guardians in a manageable position.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">Once the boss is almost defeated, it will enter a final stand, leaving about 30 seconds for the group to finish the fight. If the Fireteam does not do enough damage to push the final stand, everything resets for another go around.</p>

            <p>Results of a Capcom poll designed to find out its players' most beloved games and characters have been published, and Dino Crisis fared pretty well overall.</p>
<p>When those taking part were asked if there were any Capcom franchises they would like to see get either a sequel or a new game, the Dino Crisis series came out on tricera-top, with 80,769 votes. "Please remake Dino Crisis or release a sequel. I know my message will be one of possibly millions but please release one for us fans," one respondent wrote.</p>
<p>When asked which Capcom games players liked the best, 10,978 of 254,148 respondents listed Dino Crisis. This put Capcom's reptilian survival horror in second place for this particular category, with Devil May Cry 5 taking first with 15,157 votes. Last year's Resident Evil 4 rounded out the top three, with 9017 total votes.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is clear that even years after its most recent entry, Dino Crisis remains beloved. In fact, when Capcom first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-announces-exoprimal-a-new-dinosaur-game-for-playstation">unveiled Exoprimal back in 2022</a>, many assumed and hoped this was Dino Crisis getting some sort of reboot. However, this was not the case.</p>
<p>But will Capcom ever look at its latest community findings and decide to give Dino Crisis the remake treatment? After all, it has been steadily doing that with its Resident Evil games, with latest reports suggesting Capcom has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-remakes-currently-in-development-leak-claims">remakes of both Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil: Code Veronica</a> in the pipeline. Sadly, I cannot say right now, but I have emailed Capcom to see if it has any comment on Dino Crisis' enduring popularity. It is quite impressive to see the series still rated so highly among the Capcom community.</p>

			<p>Microsoft's rumored Xbox Gamescom 2024 showcase is said to be a major event, according to Xbox insider and&nbsp;Kinda Funny XCast's Parris Lilly.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Microsoft's Xbox showcase from some days ago was among Xbox's best showcases to date. Granted, given the recent controversy over Microsoft's multi-platform route, a solid show was needed. Still, credit needs to be given where credit is due and Xbox delivered with bangers such as the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-new-gorgeous-trailer-finally-shows-actual-gameplay-launches-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fable</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-first-gameplay-footage-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perfect Dark</a>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gears of War reboot</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-revealed-release-date-xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>, but also <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-compulsion-games-upcoming-deep-south-folktale-receives-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight</a>.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, however, the Xbox team had much more up on its sleeve, and there's a lot more coming from Xbox as part of this year's annual Gamescom event in Cologne. At least, that is what Parris Lilly <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot31-perfect-doom.894510/page-81?post=124310400#post-124310400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has said</a> on the ResetEra forums recently. "told ya that Showcase was gonna be good and the wild thing is I had multiple people at Xbox tell me there was so much more they could have shown", the Xbox insider wrote. He added, "Gamescom is shaping up to be a big show too."</p>
<p>No additional details were shared, but we're pretty interested to learn if Microsoft indeed has more to show to the community. Games that spring to mind include Project Mara, Clockwork Revolution, Everwild, Blade, Kojima's OD, The Elder Scrolls VI, Contraband, and various others.</p>
<p>Microsoft has yet to officially confirm its presence during Gamescom 2024, but given its attendance during the annual event over the past decade, it's likely that the brand will be attending the event in Cologne this year as well. We'll update you as soon as we learn more about this year's Gamescom event. What are you expecting from Gamescom 2024? Which parties do you expect to attend the event? As covered back in April of this year - <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-skipping-gamescom-2024-switch-2-reveal-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo won't be attending the event</a>. Meanwhile, rival Sony has also yet to confirm whether it will attend the event in Germany.</p>

Picking up right after the cliffhanger ending of the first season—which saw Jinx launching a rocket at the Piltover council—the season is going to be a hectic battle between the cities of Piltover and Zaun. To set the stage, we see Caitlyn forming a special task force of enforcers with the mission of going into Zaun and taking down Jinx. Vi (Jinx’s sister and dual protagonist of the show alongside Caitlyn) is on the task force, decked out in an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/arcane-season-2-netflix-teaser-caitlyn-vi-enforcer-1851526004&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/arcane-season-2-netflix-teaser-caitlyn-vi-enforcer-1851526004">enforcer uniform</a></span> that signals how much her allegiances have changed. </p><p>A climactic confrontation between Jinx and Vi near the end of the trailer has Vi calling her sister Jinx rather than her original name of Powder, further showing that she no longer sees Jinx as redeemable. The dour tone of the trailer is starting to make me even more worried for the show’s finale, which Jinx actor <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-sex-bethesda-amazon-1851423433&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-sex-bethesda-amazon-1851423433">Ella Purnell</a></span> teased would be “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.techradar.com/streaming/netflix/i-cried-arcane-star-claims-season-2-of-the-hit-netflix-show-will-emotionally-devastate-fans&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/netflix/i-cried-arcane-star-claims-season-2-of-the-hit-netflix-show-will-emotionally-devastate-fans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">devastating</a></span>.”</p><p>But there is still hope for life after <em>Arcane</em> because while it is indeed the final season of the show, Riot doesn’t seem to be done with adaptations. Anticipating fan outcry, the official <em>Arcane</em> Twitter account posted a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/arcaneshow/status/1800545290241667414&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/arcaneshow/status/1800545290241667414" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">message</a></span> from show co-creator (and Riot Creative Director) Christian Linke directly under the trailer. First off, Linke assures fans that the team has always had a specific ending in mind, so the story of <em>Arcane</em> isn’t being rushed in the finale. Linke then goes on to say that the show is “just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey,” as well as revealing that Riot is currently working on new projects across film and television that will give other <em>League of Legends </em>characters the spotlight. Linke also revealed that Riot’s partnership with Fortiche, the animation studio behind <em>Arcane</em>, is not over.</p><hr><p>As for what other characters could possibly get the <em>Arcane</em> treatment, Linke didn’t drop any hints. I personally want a pirate story set in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-new-turn-based-league-of-legends-game-is-one-of-the-1848137822&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-new-turn-based-league-of-legends-game-is-one-of-the-1848137822">Bilgewater</a></span> starring Miss Fortune, though I think a project focused on the more magical side of the <em>League of Legends </em>world is also full of potential. But for now, I’ll just wait to watch <em>Arcane</em>’s end.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One of them is Emmrich Volkarin, a human necromancer who is part of the Mourn Watch faction in the magical country of Tevinter. He’s also a romance option. All the companions in <em>The Veilguard </em>are, but Emmrich being of, well, a more senior age has made him a lightning rod for extremely good fan memes poking fun at the character, and also each other, for how down bad they are for the old man.<br></p><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-confirmed-to-let-you-romance-any-companion-you-want-will-include-nudity-it-gets-pretty-spicy?utm_source=facebook,threads,twitter&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-confirmed-to-let-you-romance-any-companion-you-want-will-include-nudity-it-gets-pretty-spicy?utm_source=facebook,threads,twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span>, Busche discussed the RPG’s romance and sex scenes, and brought up Emmrich’s specifically. While she didn’t go into much detail, she did describe the mage’s love scene as “more intimate and sensual,” compared to other party members.</p><p>“Some of them are more spicy than others,” Busche told <em>IGN</em>. “Just like real life, our companions have such diverse personalities. Some of them are more physical, more aggressive, and some of them are more...we have a gentleman necromancer, for instance, that is more intimate and sensual.”</p><p>Fans proceeded to go absolutely feral.</p><p>Like the rest of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s party members, Emmrich will be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-veilguard-romance-options-dreadwolf-1851524102&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-veilguard-romance-options-dreadwolf-1851524102">romanceable by any variation of protagonist Rook</a></span>. So this is equal opportunity thirst for an old man floating around the <em>Dragon Age </em>fandom. Personally, I already fell in love with a mustached Tevinter mage in <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, so I’m not trying to repeat myself in the fourth game. But who knows, he may steal my heart just as Dorian did ten years ago.</p><p>If you want to learn more about Emmrich, he debuted in the <em>Tevinters Nights </em>anthology book, in which we get a sense of his necromancy skills. He has a skeleton assistant named Manfred, though it remains to be seen if he will have any opinions on the thirst people are feeling for his boss. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Epic Games has announced that legendary metal band Metallica is coming to Fortnite Festival with Season 4 alongside a brand new game mode called Battle Stage.</p>



<p>Battle Stage is a PvP mode where 16 players battle across a four-song setlist to be the last rockstar standing. Players will be able to attack each other in order to disrupt performances, and knockout them out of the battle.</p>



<p>“Each public Battle Stage match begins with up to 16 players, all competing to get the highest score on a randomly chosen song from Festival’s featured rotation,” Epic Games said. “You’ll play the same track as other players but get to choose your song part and difficulty as you riff your way to the highest score. Owned Jam Tracks cannot be selected, so no one player has an advantage. </p>



<p>“The four lowest-scoring players are eliminated at the end of each song until there’s a single victor!”&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As far as new songs go, six classic Metallica songs will be available in the shop through Season 4. Those songs include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Metallica – “Enter Sandman”</li>



<li>Metallica – “Fuel”</li>



<li>Metallica – “Master of Puppets”</li>



<li>Metallica – “Ride the Lightning”</li>



<li>Metallica – “The Unforgiven”</li>



<li>Metallica – “Wherever I May Roam”</li>
</ul>



<p>Epic Games is also teasing even more Metallica songs coming to Fortnite Festival at other points of the season.</p>



<p>Fortnite Festival Season 4 beings on Thursday June 13 and runs through August 16. You can get full details of what else Season 4 <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-festival-season-4-prepare-for-battle-with-metallica" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has to offer, including game fixes, from Epic Games</a>.</p>

<p>In the United Kingdom, it has been revealed that Valve is facing a £656 million ($840 million) lawsuit, with accusations surfacing that the tech titan is using Steam to ‘take advantage of UK gamers’. At the heart of the suit is the claim that Valve has been ‘rigging the market’ for years, shutting out competition and holding a monopoly over the PC gaming market.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-s-a-lot-of-damage-s">That’s a Lot of Damage(s)</h2>



<p>This landmark lawsuit seeks serious reparations from Valve in the United Kingdom. In 2023, Valve reported record-high revenues on Steam, pulling in more than $9 billion globally and selling more than 580 million games. This data comes courtesy of VG Insights (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpwwyj6v24xo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via the BBC</a>). </p>



<p>It has been alleged by the claim filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal that Valve charges excessive commissions on games, which forces UK-based PC gamers to purchase digital software at a price far higher than they would on other platforms, such as Xbox or PlayStation. In this collective action claim, Valve has been slammed by digital rights campaigners who have branded the company as ‘unlawful’.</p>



<p>In a statement, Milberg’s Natasha Pearman, the leading partner in this lawsuit, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>UK gamers spend billions every year and Valve has a stranglehold on the PC gaming market. Competition law is there to protect consumers and ensure that markets work properly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Historically, Milberg has worked with consumers to combat the likes of Sony – in 2022, the London-based law firm took the titanic Japanese tech company to court with a £5 billion class-action suit for similar claims.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite Festival</a> Season 4 is coming very soon, and before you head into it yourself, be sure to hydrate, remove your glasses, and wear your moshing shoes, because it's Metallica season. Following three seasons focused on major pop artists, Fortnite Festival is leaning into an entirely new genre for Harmonix's game within a game. Here's what to expect with the launch of Fortnite Season 4.</p><h2>Fortnite Festival Pass - Season 4</h2><p>This season's pass offers the customary free and paid paths, both of which include several new cosmetics. One big change this season, however, is how many more skins you'll get for buying into the premium track of the Festival Pass. All four members of Metallica have been turned into Fortnite outfits, with Lars Ulrich unlocking immediately upon purchasing the premium track, while Kirk Hamett, Robert, Trujilio, and frontman James Hetfield can be unlocked as you progress through the season's challenges.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmVDgkr1WIM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JmVDgkr1WIM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The premium version of the pass also includes Metallica's nearly eight-minute banger, One, which will make for quite an endurance test in the game. The band members' iconic instruments can be found in the premium pass too, such as Ulrich's TAMA drum kit and Hammett's Gibson "Greeny" Les Paul guitar.</p><p>The premium track of the pass can be unlocked for 1800 V-Bucks (about $18). If you stick to the free track, you'll still enjoy the new Slurp Blaster guitar, as well as several new songs from Epic Games: S.O.M.P., The Night Porter (Winnage), and Dreamer. Additionally, you can claim the mosh-pit-approved Dark Flame Aura and Roundhouse emote.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317605-1%2816%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317605" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317605-1%2816%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317605"></a><figcaption>Instrument rewards</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317605-1%2816%29.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317607-1%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317608-1%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317609-1%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317610-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317607,1300-4317608,1300-4317609,1300-4317610" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4317607-1%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4317608-1%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4317609-1%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4317610-1.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317607-1%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317608-1%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317609-1%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317610-1.jpg"></figure><h2>Fortnite Festival Battle Stage</h2><p>Fortnite Festival is getting a new competitive PvP mode, throwing 16 players into a last-rockstar-standing match. Played with a four-song setlist, four players will be eliminated after each song--three for the last song--until one musical maestro stands victorious.</p><p>To even the playing field, you'll choose your instrument and difficulty but can't select songs from your library. The Overdrive multiplier feature already seen in Festival will now allow for attacks to be launched at your rivals, which can disrupt their streaks and slow their scoring. The game also uses a skill-based matchmaking system so players can be grouped with others at their level rather than land in a lobby with Tosin Abasi.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317611-1%289%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317611" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317611-1%289%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317611"></a><figcaption>The Battle Stage has arrived.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317611-1%289%29.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317612-1%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317613-1%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317614-1%286%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317615-1%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317612,1300-4317613,1300-4317614,1300-4317615" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4317612-1%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4317613-1%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4317614-1%286%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4317615-1%287%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317612-1%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317613-1%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317614-1%286%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317615-1%287%29.jpg"></figure><h2>New Fortnite Festival Shop Items</h2><p>Like other seasons of Harmonix's social music game, you can also find alternative versions of Metallica's foursome in the Item Shop.

			<p>Shin Megami Tensei 5 Vengeance asks a very simple, but poignant question: what if the world had ended, and we didn’t even realise? From the Mayans to Nostradamus, many soothsayers have predicted the end times over the years, and while we laughed, we moved on…. what if they were right? What if God had plucked us from existence and let us live on in a parallel world while war rages in the real world? A war started the Christian God who took the throne at the top of the pantheon by turning His brethren into demons by taking their Knowledge.</p>
<p>The snake that tempted Adam and Eve? A demon trying to regain godhood by regaining its Knowledge. The end of the world? Legions of demons dethroning the God of Law who usurped the throne millennia ago.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance - Launch Trailer | NSW, PS5/4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Steam, PC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/esJS9uV4qYM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>For such an interesting narrative, Shin Megami Tensei 5 — and its new, definitive edition, Vengeance — has a paper thin plot that you really have to work to unlock. It’s always going to be difficult not to compare the SMT franchise to its spin off series, Persona, in part because of the shared pantheon and battle systems, but when the Persona franchise drips panache and charm at every turn, newcomers to SMT are going to come with extremely high hopes and standards.</p>
<p>While SMT5V is very good, long-time Persona fans should temper their expectations.</p>

<p>Initially a Switch exclusive when it launched in 2021, this fifth instalment in the franchise was well received for its interesting battle systems, excellent music, overall wit and charm. Even its graphics were heralded, as long as you didn’t look too far into the distance.</p>

<p>The core gameplay for the multi-platform Vengeance is much the same — you’re very swiftly swept into Da’at (a post-apocalyptic Tokyo), and forced to fight to survive. The gameplay, even on Casual mode, can be punishing, meaning that you need to start expanding your party by charming demons with your silver tongue, and grinding all of the XP you can out of lower-level demons. It takes a solid ten hours to fight your way back to the real world for the first meaningful, albeit short-lived, dose of the plot.</p>
<p>Vengeance is the definitive edition of the game, adding an entirely new storyline that runs in parallel. While the original did give you choices, they boiled down to basically ‘say yes’ or ‘gloomily say yes’; there was no meaningful difference to your decision. Vengeance offers you an actual choice from the start: do you chose the Path of Creation (the original story) or the all new Path of Vengeance?</p>

<p>It’s a little jarring for newbies to be presented such a meaningful choice so early in the game, with no idea or context as to how this will shape things. Still, seasoned veterans of Da’at will likely enjoy knowing early on that they’re locked into the new experience that they will pick up the game to play.</p>
<p>Talking of the new stuff, the graphics have been overhauled, as is standard for Switch games being ported to anything more powerful (which is basically everything). The things that you should care about, like your demon army and the cast of named characters look great. However, many other NPCs exist as creepy, faceless creatures. There aren’t that many NPCs that adding a pair of eyes would break the PS5 hardware, so it must be a strange creative choice that Atlus has stuck with.</p>

<p>Beyond that, there’s a couple of other new additions, from an expanded demon compendium to being able to save anywhere on the overworld map — a huge boon in such a difficult game where you could previously only save at specific checkpoints</p>
<p>The expanded compendium is always going to be a plus — the demons in this franchise have always been great fun, and talking to them is incredibly personable. Some are cute and meek, others are sweary brutes; each new encounter is an engaging conversation. Being able to talk to these demons in the overworld is also incredible, with friendly demons chatting to you or giving you quests. It all adds to the feeling of a lived in world, no matter how dark and unnerving the Tokyo wasteland has become.</p>

<p>Auto battle is also a nice addition, allowing your team to auto-pilot their way through battles, using the right spells against enemies you know the weaknesses of, and testing the water with newer enemies by trying different spells and seeing what works.</p>
<p>Everything else remains the same — a brutally tough grind that, if you can get past the rougher edges, reveals a very well put-together RPG that hardcore fans will love.</p>

		<p>It might feel like it’s been almost no time at all since the launch of Fallout 76, but what if I told you that it’s been over five years? You might feel yourself physically withering away, your face peeling away like it’s the claymation death of an Indiana Jones baddie, transforming you into a noseless Ghoul. Speaking of which…</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout 76: Skyline Valley Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2yHLtDrbLqw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The next big update for Fallout 76 is upon us, with Bethesda having pumped out content update after content update in the last few years, after that initial recovery drive from the game’s ill-fated initial launch. We’ve had big updates in the past, such as 2020’s Wastelanders bringing NPCs into the world, or the more recent addition of Expeditions to places like Atlantic City, but with today’s Skyline Valley update, we’re getting the first expansion to the core map of Appalachia.</p>
<p>This is the first of its kind, bolting a new area to explore onto the bottom of Appalachia, the forests of the Shenandoah National Park. Importantly, it’s been designed so that both newcomers and veteran players can explore this region as they see fit, allowing everyone to jump straight into the new stuff.</p>


<p>The Forest is blanketed by a permanent and ominous looking storm cloud, crackling with ozone, and playing home to some new creatures and creations to encounter. At its epicentre is Vault 63, a vault entirely inhabited by Ghouls… but not just any type of Ghouls. The Lost, as they call themselves, are strangely electrified, and are fiercely protective of their small enclave, willing to defend themselves against all outsides.</p>
<p>There’s basically just one exception to this in the character of Hugo Stoltz, a character that you’ll be able to befriend, or betray as you learn more about them.</p>
<p>Also stepping out from Vault 63 are the Storm Goliaths, supersized robo-brans with electrical attacks that have been developed by the geniuses in the vault. At the other end of the scale is the Thrasher, an oversized turkey velociraptor monstrosity that you’ll have to deal with.</p>

<p>In addition to the main story of this new locale is a hefty batch of quest content equivalent to the Steel Dawn and Steel Reign updates combined – there’s 12 quests to follow. Then there’s new camp themed rewards to earn with the mascot Marshal Mallow and Season 17, and a new public event, Dangerous Pastimes, which challenges you to go storm chasing and charge up a lightning rod with electrical energy.</p>
<p>More than anything, Skyline Valley will give Bethesda a fresh canvas to paint on in the months and years to come. Later this year they’ll bring more content into this space, including the Halloween themed Mischief Night event, and Milepost Zero, which introduces Blueridge Caravan Company routes that you’ll be able to take missions to defend from ambushes and attacks. Successfully run these convoy missions and you’ll unlock a caravan outpost of your own, similar in function to houses in Skyrim. You’ll be able to upgrade the decor, expand it and add specialty vendors that will sell exclusive gear.</p>

<p>It will all come to a head in early 2025 where the ability to play as a Ghoul will be added. This unlocks for players as they reach level 50, presenting them with a quest to start transforming into a Ghoul, doling out unique benefits that can be drawn from radiation as well as Ghoul-specific perk cards that will layer on top of everything you’ve already earned. This distinctive appearance will certainly help you stand out from other players, and it will also affect faction relationships and bring fresh in-game experiences to test your high level character.</p>
<p>But details on that will have to wait for another day…</p>
<p>For now, Bethesda are happily touting that more than 17 million players have dipped a toe into Fallout 76 at one time or another. With the series as a whole enjoying the warm glow of success from the Fallout TV show, and with Skyline Valley giving plenty of reasons to either get back into or visit Appalachia for the first time, I can see that number climbing a fair bit higher in the next few weeks and months.</p>

  <p id="zx7887">The world of <em>Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance</em> can be an unforgiving place.</p>
<p id="tpuERD">Tokyo is under siege by demons of all stripes. The throne of heaven sits silent and unoccupied. An extradimensional civil war threatens to rip reality apart. And just to add to insult to injury, Mothman is waiting to shake you down for cash during a random battle, leaving you with no choice but to fork over thousands of bucks and slink away with your tail between your legs despite fielding a team of literal gods because you’re still reeling from the poor choices you made in a previous fight and you don’t want to lose half an hour of progress returning to an earlier save.</p>
<p id="VWTvfI">Unlike, say, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/21/12992500/shin-megami-tensei-4-apocalypse-review-nintendo-3ds"><em>Shin Megami Tensei 4: Apocalyps</em>e</a>’s relationship to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/7/11/4512914/shin-megami-tensei-4-review-sympathy-for-the-devil"><em>Shin Megami Tensei 4</em></a> on the Nintendo 3DS, <em>Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance</em> acts as more of an expansion than a sequel to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22762591/shin-megami-tensei-5-review-atlus-nintendo-switch">the 2021 original</a>. The move from Switch exclusivity to also launching simultaneously on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Windows PC means the game looks gorgeous and performs a great deal better on those beefier platforms. More importantly, it also includes a handful of quality-of-life features as well as a reimagined narrative with new characters and story beats. But don’t worry if you skipped <em>Shin Megami Tensei 5</em> the first time around, as you get to choose between the vanilla and updated plots at the beginning of the game.</p>

<p id="enXoMA"><em>Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance</em>, at least on paper, stands tall among even the franchise’s best entries thanks to a mix of compelling gameplay and stylish aesthetics. Every battle, the foundations of which rely on exploiting enemies’ elemental weaknesses to earn yourself more turns for damage-dealing, health-healing, and status-effecting, plays out with the layered strategy of a chess match. Megami Tensei is unlike any of its genre contemporaries, sporting a combat rhythm made more exciting in <em>Shin Megami Tensei 5</em> and, now, <em>Vengeance</em> thanks to the introduction of a Street Fighter-like special meter used for activating techniques that range from guaranteeing critical damage to improving all of your team’s stats for a limited time.</p>
<p id="MMYjGc">Exploration in <em>Vengeance</em> is also far more easygoing compared to the original <em>Shin Megami Tensei 5</em>. Allowing players to save their progress anywhere rather than just at designated checkpoints and to utilize rail-grinding shortcuts for bypassing repeated trips through tough areas makes it so there are fewer opportunities for gut-wrenching game overs. That’s not to say there’s no danger at all, of course: Every battle, from boss encounters to those scary, random fights against Mothman and his buddies, carries the same weight. All it takes is one wrong move to see your entire turn disappear and your enemies given free rein to barrage you with their strongest attacks. Still, you’ll rarely lose much progress upon being sent back bloodied and bruised to the title screen if you take advantage of the game’s various quality-of-life adjustments.</p>
<p id="1SBddr">Unfortunately, useful safety nets like these only exacerbate my deepest criticisms elsewhere. <em>Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance</em> is so fun and user-friendly that, when combined with a narrative that’s paper-thin and lightweight during even the most serious story moments, it’s often too easy to overlook or even forget altogether the grim trappings the game should have inherited from its predecessors. Megami Tensei franchise heavyweights like<em> Nocturne</em>, <em>Strange Journey</em>, and the Digital Devil Saga duology balanced captivating combat and beautiful visuals with oppressive atmospheres that imparted the overwhelming weight of their almost Lovecraftian storylines. Imparting that weight effectively is not just about difficulty despite Megami Tensei games being known for their brutal, slogging campaigns.</p>

<p id="QSFXOS"><em>Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance</em> rarely treats the inherent horror of staring down ancient, supernatural forces that exist outside the realm of human consciousness with the gravity that the premise deserves, either through gameplay or in its dual plotlines. Put simply, the abyss blinks. Important characters die and are resurrected without so much as a double-take from the largely emotionless cast. Worldview-shattering revelations are given little room to resonate before the player gets sent off on their next mission. And rather than being characters who evolve naturally over the course of the story, allies and enemies alike deliver baffling soliloquies with all the passion of a middle school play. </p>
<p id="wsrwID">While it’s common to joke about the trend of role-playing games like Final Fantasy culminating in climactic “kill god” moments, the uppercase God of Christianity is very real (and often very pissed) in the Megami Tensei mythos, existing alongside a cornucopia of deities, spirits, and other supernatural entities from just about every real-world religion and culture across the globe. No matter your belief system, there’s a big difference between facing off against a <a href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Kefka_Palazzo">clown-makeup-wearing magician</a> elevated to artificial godhood and attempting to wipe the literal creator of all things from existence, but Megami Tensei’s operated with this level of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMGWWpyFGFU">Vince McMahon-style hubris</a> for close to four decades. It’s because of this pedigree that <em>Vengeance</em>’s failure to elevate <em>Shin Megami Tensei 5</em>’s narrative shortcomings as much as it elevated everything else in the original feels like such a disappointment.</p>

<p id="AHbNvW">I also can’t wrap my head around the addition of the new Demon Haunts feature, which provides players the opportunity to hang out with the ghouls and ghosts currently in their squad. You can chat them up and even give them gifts, and they’ll reward you with basic items and marginal stat gains. A diversion like this would feel right at home in Pokémon, where you’re encouraged to grow attached to your favorite pocket monsters, but it just winds up being confusing here. You shouldn’t form attachments to the monsters in this game because you won’t be seeing them for long, at least if you want to make any headway against late-game bosses. Due to <em>Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance</em>’s slow experience gains and limited move pools, you need to treat your allies as fodder for fusing into bigger, stronger demons, or else you’re leaving yourself open to copious ass beatings. Let’s face it: The usefulness of cutesy franchise mascot Jack Frost pales in comparison to a late-game powerhouse like Maria, the literal mother of Jesus Christ. I learned to mostly ignore the Demon Haunt system after my first several hours with <em>Vengeance</em> and didn’t feel like I missed out on anything important.</p>
<p id="zR1UUT">I, like many others, used to describe the Megami Tensei series as “Pokémon for adults,” but I no longer believe that shorthand is entirely accurate. Megami Tensei is Pokémon for the ruthless, those able to exchange compassion and attachment for the cold reality of spiritual warfare. <em>Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance</em>’s “save anywhere” feature, overworld shortcuts, and shallow storyline, however, result in a too-frictionless and therefore flat experience. The moment-to-moment gameplay may still be as fulfilling as any previous Megami Tensei game when it strikes a delicate balance between new and old mechanics, but <em>Vengeance</em>’s overall lack of texture fails to live up to the important narrative themes of struggle, loss, sacrifice, and rebirth established by the franchise over the last 40 years. </p>

  <p id="tn5zCw"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22979840/unmatched-hells-kitchen-board-game-review"><em>Unmatched</em></a>, the tremendous action board game franchise from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/22778194/thunder-road-kickstarter-canceled-restoration-games-interview">Restoration Games</a>, sends its newest standalone expansion into the world today. Titled <a href="https://restorationgames.com/shop/unmatched-slings-and-arrows/"><em>Unmatched: Slings and Arrows</em></a>, it stars The Bard himself, master William Shakespeare, alongside a handful of his most memorable creations. If you have ever suffered through sophomore English Language Arts class or, gods forbid, actually majored in English literature as I have, you’re in for a treat.</p>
<p id="aTVBAm">In Unmatched, players take on the role of beloved characters from pop culture only to pit them against one another in 1v1 or 2v2 battles. The system relies on action cards to power its combat, as well as collectible game boards that provide unique limitations on movement and line of sight. But beyond that solid foundation of gameplay, the franchise is best known for its ever growing collection of characters which include Robin Hood, Ms. Marvel, Houdini, and Bruce Lee, to name just a few. It’s the only modern board game I know of that will allow you to pit Spider-Man against the cast of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, then let the raptors from <em>Jurassic Park</em> take on the winner.</p>
<p id="V5V4SA"><em>Slings and Arrows</em> adds six new mainline characters to the <em>Unmatched</em> universe, as well as a smattering of sidekicks. Best of all, each of the four potent forces inside the box plays completely differently.</p>

<p id="TXisou">Shakespeare is accompanied by three sidekicks, which are essentially nameless actors. His cards are powerful enough, with plenty of ways to land a blow or take one in stride. The gimmick is that in playing cards to the table, you’re also trying to create a 10-syllable line of poetry. Once you string together enough words, you get a bonus effect from the first card played in the line. And yes, performance of that line, once formed, is required to score —  it’s in the rules!</p>

<p id="xtRduH">The Wayward Sisters, also known as the three witches from Shakespeare’s <em>Macbeth</em>, come with their own cardboard cauldron. Each of their action cards contains an ingredient, and by playing cards of the right type in the right order you’ll be able to cast spells granting additional movement, enhanced damage, and more.</p>

<p id="M6is3n">Unmatched gives some additional color to Hamlet, interpreting him in its own way just as the best actors have over the centuries. Here his “madness” is very much in his control, indicated by a token marked “To be” on one side and “Not to be” on the other. Depending on which side it up, Hamlet can either draw additional cards or do extra damage in combat. Meanwhile, his friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern look on approvingly.</p>

<p>As first spotted by fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1de51n0/screenshot_of_newly_announced_anno_117_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Reddit</a>, an early build screenshot of Anno 117 Pax Romana gameplay appeared to leak online. The image seemed to surface via the official Anno Union website itself.</p>



<p>The image shows an overview shot of a large coastal city, complete with major landmarks and homes. The leaked image also has a unique angle of the city, suggesting Anno 117 could introduce other new mechanics.</p>



<p>Ubisoft first announced Anno 117 Pax Romana during the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-forward-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Forward showcase</a> with a reveal trailer. However, it was a live-action trailer, so it did not feature any gameplay, or even cinematics. </p>



<p>Some fans of the series were dismayed no Anno 117 Pax Romana gameplay appeared, and the Ubisoft Forward <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-was-with-that-disappointing-ubisoft-forward-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generally seemed to disappoint</a> overall.</p>



<p>For now, Anno fans only have a clear look at some concept art on the Anno Union website.  In Anno 117 Pax Romana, players take the role of a Roman governor, exploring the strategies of unique provinces with choices that matter.</p>



<p>The most recent title in the economic strategy Anno series was Anno 1800, which launched in 2019. It focused on the Industrial Revolution, and still has Mostly Positive reviews on Steam. </p>



<p>There is currently no concrete release date for Anno 117 Pax Romana. It will launch sometime in 2025 for PC, PlayStation 5, and the Xbox Series X|S. </p>

Game director Corinne Busche spoke to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-the-first-preview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> recently about why a linear setup was in the best interest of the game.</p><p>"Yeah, so it is a mission-based game. Everything is hand-touched, hand-crafted, very highly curated," Busche said. "We believe that's how we get the best narrative experience, the best moment-to-moment experience."</p>

      </div>
<p>While The Veilguard is a mission-based, linear game, there are parts of the game that have more open sequences that offer players a greater sense of freedom of exploration, Busche said.</p><p>"Alternate branching paths, mysteries, secrets, optional content you're going to find and solve. So it does open up, but it is a mission-based, highly curated game," the developer said.</p><p>The Veilguard, which was previously known as Dreadwolf, launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It is the first new entry in the series since the highly acclaimed Dragon Age: Inquisition in 2014.

This formula can be seen across most of Ubisoft’s biggest franchises, including Assassin’s Creed, Watch Dogs, and Far Cry. In a quest for seemingly endless content, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> looks to be following in those footsteps. However, it can be a challenge to fill such big worlds with more intimate, tightly knit stories.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To tell a great story, game developers do need a good sense of visual direction. And there’s always unique challenges in working with a licensed property as tightly controlled as Star Wars.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At Ubisoft Forward, Game Developer sat down to play one hour of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, as well as had the opportunity to chat with associate world designer Cloe Hammond and associate drt director Marthe Jonkers discuss the inspirations behind the main characters’ designs and trying to aim for the Star Wars aesthetic while still making Outlaws look unique.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Star Wars Outlaws' "><span>Star Wars Outlaws' </span>heroine is a 'survivalist'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> follows rookie scoundrel Kay Vess and her pet companion Nix. Kay has a bit of Han Solo inspiration in her design, but the developers wanted to be clear that she’s still a rookie thief. Her survivalist mindset and scrappy nature lets her make tools out of anything, including her hairpin, which acts as a makeshift lockpick. These small details are what make Vess a much more relatable and grounded character. Her companion is a cute animal named Nix, and he’s part of a brand new species introduced in Outlaws called a Merqaal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His design was inspired by creatures that could survive in jungle-like environments. For example, his scales could protect him from harsh weather. Nix closely resembles an axolotl with his whiskers too, and the development team wanted to give him something that he could emote with. In the game, Vess can call on Nix to distract, attack, and even steal from enemies.</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many open-world video games typically have distraction methods, with characters throwing stones or having robots to short circuit nearby electronics to lure away enemies. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Nix himself is used, as sometimes he’ll lie stretched out on the ground while enemies walk over to him confused as to what he’s even doing. This adds a layer of personality to Nix, and it’s unsurprising that Nix embodies the “cute” alien creature trend ever since the baby Yoda-looking Grogu companion exploded in popularity in the hit Star Wars spin-off TV show, the Mandalorian.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The constant interaction between Vess and Nix really lends the idea that they’re family and constantly looking out for each other.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“There were many inspirations that were very grounded to make sure that Nix steel feels like a believable creature that can really survive in a world of Star Wars,” said Jonkers. “But at the same time, it'd be a very nice companion to Vess.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Vess also has access to her own ship, the Trailblazer. Like Nix, the Trailblazer was also inspired by a real-world animals, in this case, the humble turtle. Its design was influenced by 60s and 70s monorail and hints of retrofuturism—or imagining what the future might have looked like in the era when George Lucas was first cooking up Star Wars. Back then, people were imaging a future in the 2000s with flying cars and robot servants, which isn’t too off the mark of what Star Wars has.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On planets, Vess can ride on her motocross called the Speeder, which Jonkers added was also inspired by the retro futuristic style. “There's a familiarity in every Star Wars design,” she said. “But there's also a small percentage of exotic and alien to it.” While retrofuturism had its roots in the late 1800s, it continued into the 60s with the Space Age and into the 70s when Star Wars became a cultural phenomenon.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Crafting a new world">Crafting a new world</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While the demo didn’t include any open-world portions of gameplay,Hammond explained that the team wanted to craft open-world content through three unique ways. The first was to make sure that cities are dense where players can overhear conversations and rumors, something that a scoundrel like Vess would be interested in. Vess can gain intel and track down characters to learn new skills, giving a gameplay incentive for players to engage with open-world activities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second way is through the use of vehicles and traveling. With the Trailblazer, players are able to discover new space stations and orbital regions. What makes this aspect stand out is that players can actually fly closer towards planets before the option to embark appears, which is a much more engaging gameplay feature than just only being able to select a planet and choosing to land on it like in games such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starfield </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mass Effect</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The third aspect was to convey the spectacular environments and wide vistas on worlds that Vess comes across throughout her journey. The demo placed Vess in different biomes, including tropical and snow-filled ones, which gave glimpses into the variety of settings players can expect.</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the surface, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> seems like a Star Wars skin on the typical Ubisoft open-world formula with a checklist of activities to complete. However, the relationship between Vess and Nix is what will keep players invested throughout the entire journey. It’s also clear that developer Massive Entertainment poured a lot of heart and soul into creating this world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“They're going to start really small as a rookie thief duo and navigate the underworld,” Hammond said in allusion to Vess and her alien sidekick. “I think we’re providing diversity. Whether it's in locations, quests, or different characters, all of it is very tailor made to this authentic storytelling that we’re trying to do.”</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/visions-of-mana-closer-look?utm_source=sqex-social&amp;utm_content=launchdatetrailerblog&amp;utm_campaign=VisionsofMana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new blog post</a>, Square Enix announced that the anticipated new entry in the Visions of Mana series will launch on August 29, 2024. Pre-orders will be available today for all available platforms. </p>



<p>Today’s post also breaks down the various characters, combat mechanics, and other key details coming to Visions of Mana. </p>



<p>The central heroes are Val, the newly appointed soul guard to the alms, and their childhood friend Hinna. However, players will have access to multiple heroes they can “fully control in battle and when exploring the world.” </p>



<p>Square Enix also released a new trailer featuring gameplay, including both combat and exploration.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Players can use companion creatures to traverse the map, with a unique companion for different types of terrain.  A Pikul helps players travel on land, the Vuscav can travel across water, and the Flammie is used for air travel. </p>



<p>Combat is resolved in real-time, and today’s blog did confirm the Ring Menu is returning for the new Visions of Mana title. So, battle will pause for the Ring Menu, again encouraging players to use strategy.</p>



<p>There will also be an Elemental Vessel system, where mystical artifacts grant players elemental powers they can use both in combat and during exploration.</p>



<p>Visions of Mana will be available on PC via Windows and Steam, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S when it launches this August.</p>

                <p>When you've suffered several consecutive defeats at the hands of a particularly tough boss in a game like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a>, there's no shame in consulting a guide for some tips. That's something From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki is aware of, and in a new interview, he explained how the studio doesn't aim to create a cottage industry for guides writers or in-depth lore historians with its games. Instead, From Software aims to make games that players can progress through organically.</p><p>"Of course, players are going to consult guides, and there's going to be a wealth of information on the web and in their communities where they have access to the secrets and the strategies. We expect that," Miyazaki said to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-rings-developers-know-most-players-use-guides-but-still-try-to-cater-to-those-who-go-in-blind-if-they-cant-do-it-then-theres-some-room-for-improvement-on-our-behalf/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "We obviously understand [players use guides], but we don't make or plan anything with that as a prerequisite. If anything, we try to cater to the player who is completely blind and wants to go through organically. If they can't do it, then there's some room for improvement on our behalf, and we'd like to try to embrace those players more in the future."</p>

                <p>Game developer Goichi Suda, who is also known as Suda51, has promised that his studio will work on games for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">the Switch successor</a>. Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/suda51-on-switch-2-twin-peaks-western-culture-and-his-favourite-beer/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, Suda51 said he has "no idea" what the next Nintendo console will look like, but is excited to see what it turns out to be.</p><p>He went on to say that the Switch, which launched in 2017, is a great "all-around" platform and that he struggles to think of anything about the console that isn't "good enough." As such, he wasn't able to pin down any one specific thing he hopes the next Nintendo console delivers, but in any case, he's promised that his team will show up to develop for it.</p>

<p>"I don't have anything in particular that I can think of as far as new features I want to see in the next-gen iteration of it are concerned, but I'm really looking forward to seeing what Nintendo does with it. They've always done revolutionary stuff for software and the video game industry in general. I'm super excited for the next console, especially since we're definitely gonna cook for it."</p><p>Suda51 is the founder and CEO of Japanese game developer Grasshopper Manufacture, and some of the work he's best known for includes The Silver Case, Killer7, No More Heroes, and Lollipop Chainsaw.
