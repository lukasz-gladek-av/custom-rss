                <p>In the latest blow to the video game labor community, Electronic Arts has confirmed layoffs at Apex Legends developer Respawn and the cancellation of two "incubation" projects at the studio. About 100 people at Respawn have been affected by the changes, a report said.</p><p>More widely, EA is making cuts that affect many people, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3lnxurth7xs2y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reporter Jeff Grubb of GameSpot sister site Giant Bomb said</a>. EA Sports FC and Apex Legends underperformed, leading to this latest wave of cuts at EA, GameSpot understands. Dragon Age: The Veilguard might not have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-comes-up-short-bioware-undergoes-changes/1100-6529105/">performed up to EA's sales expectations</a>, but we understand its performance is not related to the cuts across EA generally.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-believe-those-titanfall-3-rumors-youve-heard/1100-6530730/" data-ref-id="1100-6530730">skunkworks project from Titanfall veteran Steve Fukuda</a> is not going ahead within Respawn, Grubb added, and "there is no Titanfall 3." That shouldn't come as a surprise, though, as Titanfall 3 was never a sure thing.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1917273189001974166" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">That Steve Fukuda project is in the bin.

One of the game cancellations was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-and-titanfall-studio-appears-to-cancel-unannounced-fps/1100-6529955/" data-ref-id="1100-6529955">multiplayer FPS that we first heard about earlier this year.</a></p><p>Respawn itself confirmed the changes in a memo posted online. In the statement, Respawn said it is a studio that embraces "bold ideas" and "creative risks," but they don't always pan out.</p><p>"Our commitment to player-first experiences remains unchanged," Respawn said.</p><p>EA said it is offering "meaningful support" to affected staffers.</p><p>People affected by the layoffs at Respawn include staffers working in publishing, QA, and members of the Star Wars Jedi and incubation teams, IGN reported.</p><p>Respawn will continue to develop more content for Apex Legends and build the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawn-to-develop-final-game-in-star-wars-jedi-trilogy-says-ea/1100-6526559/" data-ref-id="1100-6526559">next Star Wars: Jedi game</a>, but EA declined to confirm if any incubation projects are currently in the works.</p><p>For a long time already, EA management had signaled problems for Apex Legends. CEO Andrew Wilson said the game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-teases-a-bigger-newer-apex-legends-2-0/1100-6529289/" data-ref-id="1100-6529289">"not headed in the direction that we have wanted."</a> The executive also has talked about plans for something called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-teases-a-bigger-newer-apex-legends-2-0/1100-6529289/" data-ref-id="1100-6529289">"Apex 2.0."</a></p><p>Respawn said it wants to expand "what Apex can be," with developers continue to refine gameplay and "bring new ideas to upcoming seasons." Respawn added that it wants to "push the boundaries of competitive play while staying true to the spirit of competition, creativity, and integrity that our community expects."</p><p>As for the Star Wars: Jedi team, Respawn said the next entry in the series aims to "raise the bar again for storytelling and gameplay."</p><p>In February 2024, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-laying-off-around-670-people-sunsetting-unspecified-games/1100-6521460/" data-ref-id="1100-6521460">EA laid off around 670 people</a>, which was about 5% of its global workforce. The new round of cuts across EA are said to be "similar" to that round of layoffs in 2024, Grubb said, though the exact number is unclear. EA is making these reported changes just ahead of its next investor briefing on May 6.</p><p>The new changes at Respawn come at a time of uncertainty in general in the economic market for most companies due in part to Trump's scattered tariff policies and other factors. Leading global bank JP Morgan says <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/recession-probability" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the risk of a global recession stands at around 60%.</a></p>

        <p>Arriving later this week.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> is about to get a little messier - and marginally more fashionable for those in a certain generational bracket - as it prepares to launch a fresh wave of newly announced Kit DLC.
</p>
<p>
These new small-scale DLC packs begin with The Sims 4's Kitchen Clutter Kit, which does exactly what it sounds like, providing various bits of decor players can use to give their cooking spaces a more lived-in feel. You've got fridges adorned with magnets, open cereal boxes, kitchen timers, recipe tablet, and "much more" - useful for when you're looking to create a living space with more personality than a showhome.
</p>
<p>
There's more mess to be found in The Sims 4's Restoration Workshop Kit, which looks to provide fixtures and furnishings players can use to build a well-utilised workshop. "With [this kit], Sims can take well-loved, broken-down appliances, including reviving a microwave, coffee maker, refrigerator and stove with the Handiness Skill," EA explains. "Restore the appliance to its former glory, and make it fully functional again."
</p>

</figure>
<p>
Rounding out The Sims 4's latest batch of DLC drops is the Golden Years Kit, featuring fashionable looks and accessories Elder Sims can use to "express their individuality". EA is a bit vague on the details for this one, but expect the likes of toupees, gardening gloves, and glasses with straps - meaning Elder Sims with a penchant for partying won't lose them mid-swing.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
The Sims 4's Restoration Workshop Kit, Kitchen Clutter Kit, and Golden Years Kit all arrive this Thursday, 1st May. They'll likely cost £4.99 apiece, and will be available on all platforms - which is to say PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the world of The Sims, footage from EA's new The Sims "game concept" - which may or may not be the much-discussed Project Rene - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-minutes-of-eas-new-the-sims-game-concept-leak-online">recently surfaced online</a>, and fans eager for a proper Sims 4 sequel weren't exactly thrilled to see what looked like a naff mobile game.

			<p>EA has canceled yet another project that was in an early incubation stage at Respawn, one month after it canceled a<a href="https://wccftech.com/respawn-cancels-another-unannounced-multiplayer-fps/"> multiplayer project at the same stage</a>, and according to a report from<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-dev-respawn-cancels-another-incubation-project-lays-off-unknown-number-of-individuals-again"> IGN</a>, EA will also be laying off an unknown number of employees at Respawn across the Apex Legends, Star Wars Jedi, and incubation teams.</p>
<p>In a statement published to <a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/1917267367144423543">X</a>, Respawn announces that it has "<em>made the decision to step away from two early-stage incubation projects</em>," which refers to the project canceled last month, and another cancellation we're hearing about today for the first time. Respawn continues to add that there will be layoffs across the Apex Legends and Star Wars teams, though it doesn't mention the cuts to the incubation team, which come from IGN's sources.</p>
<p>It's unclear how many people have been cut from Respawn, which currently employs approximately 100 developers, though the cuts are reportedly being made across departments and aren't focused on one part of the studio.</p>
<p>"<em>As we sharpen our focus for the future, we've made the decision to step away from two early-stage incubation projects and make some targeted team adjustments across Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi. These decisions aren't easy, and we are deeply grateful to every teammate affected - their creativity and contributions have helped build Respawn into what it is today. We're offering meaningful support to those impacts, including exploring new opportunities within EA,</em>" the studio's statement reads.</p>
<p>The statement also addressed what these cuts mean for Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi, saying of the former that&nbsp;"<em>while the team will continue to refine gameplay and bring new ideas to upcoming seasons, we're also investing in what's next for the franchise - exploring bold experiences that push the boundaries of competitive play while staying true to the spirit of competition</em>."</p>
<p>Regarding the latter, Respawn simply added, "<em>We're excited to keep building new stories</em>—<em>with the next chapter of the Star Wars Jedi series aiming to raise the bar again for storytelling and gameplay</em>."</p>
<p>The booming success of Apex Legends and the Star Wars Jedi series in 2019 has, in many ways, made Respawn the crown jewel studio for EA's <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-split-up/">entertainment side</a> of the business. But it's worth asking how long it could keep that status if EA consistently shuts down the new ideas the developers at Respawn come up with.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-project-cancellations<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Star Wars Jedi&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Titanfall&nbsp;</em>studio Respawn Entertainment has been hit by further layoffs, and the studio has also opted to cancel two of its "early-stage incubation projects".</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/1917267367144423543" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Respawn announces its decisions to "step away" from the aforementioned projects and to "make some targeted team adjustments" to teams working on&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends</em>. The projects in question aren't named, though.</p>

<p>The studio says it's "offering meaningful support to those impacted, including exploring new opportunities within EA", and that the decisions to cancel the projects and lay off the staff members in question "[weren't] easy".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apex-legends-respawn-layoffs.jpg?itok=gt0PpKXs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apex-legends-respawn-layoffs.jpg?itok=efjA4CKk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Staff members working on&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi&nbsp;</em>series have been laid off.</figcaption></figure><p>Respawn doesn't say which staff departments have been particularly affected by these layoffs, but it does say that the "next chapter" of the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi&nbsp;</em>series will "raise the bar again for storytelling and gameplay", so that's not one of the canceled projects.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-zero-company-respawn-bit-reactor" rel="nofollow">recently-revealed&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Zero Company</em></a>, a turn-based tactics game set in the dying days of the Clone Wars, also won't be affected; it's not an early-stage incubation project, after all, but one that's been fully unveiled.</p>

<p>Rumors are swirling that&nbsp;a third&nbsp;<em>Titanfall&nbsp;</em>game is in development, but those rumors are fairly insubstantial at the moment, so it's impossible to say whether that was one of the games Respawn decided to can.</p>

<p>We do, however, know that this isn't the first time in the last year or so that Respawn has been hit by layoffs. In March last year, it was revealed that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games" rel="nofollow">EA would lay off 5% of its workforce</a>, and that a&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>FPS in development at Respawn would be canceled, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-developer-respawn-hit-by-layoffs-among-cuts-at-electronic-arts" rel="nofollow">layoffs also hitting the studio</a>.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see how these layoffs and project cancellations affect Respawn. Stay tuned for more on this as soon as we get it.</p>

The Texas Chain Saw Massacre to name just a few--Evil Dead: The Game was first revealed at the 2020 Game Awards. After being delayed beyond its initial planned launch date of 2021, the game arrived in 2022 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S, and it scooped up generally favorable reviews. Post-launch support for the game included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/evil-dead-the-game-splatter-royale-update-launch-trailer/2300-6460548/">Splatter Royale</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evil-dead-the-game-adds-army-of-darkness-update-update-with-new-map-exploration-mode-and-more/1100-6505459/">Army of Darkness</a> updates, and on console, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/evil-dead-the-game-game-of-the-year-edition-launch-trailer/2300-6461252/">Game of the Year Edition</a> was released</p><p>"Evil Dead: The Game is faithful, but sometimes to a fault. If there were more game modes or even more varied objectives in its one attractive game mode, it would feel more like a game for horror fans to play for a long time, maybe even moving competitors like Dead By Daylight or Hunt Showdown off their vaunted pedestals," Mark Delaney wrote In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/evil-dead-the-game-review-somewhat-groovy/1900-6417881/">Evil Dead: The Game review</a>.</p><p>Like the monsters constantly tormenting Evil Dead protagonist Ash Campbell, the IP regularly shows up in new forms. One of the more recent examples is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/retrorealms-review-a-new-horror-multiverse-is-born/1900-6418302/">RetroRealms by developer WayForward</a>, as this gaming hub allowed players to grab Campbell's boomstick and take on the Deadites in a 2D platformer inspired by 16-bit classics.</p>

Now, EA is sharing more details on its efforts and has even given its software a new name: <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/introducing-ea-javelin-anticheat" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA Javelin</a>, one it said was chosen to communicate defense, strength, and agility in the face of cheaters.</p><p dir="ltr">In a newly published progress <a href="https://www.ea.com/security/news/anticheat-progress-report" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report</a>, EA head of game security Elise Murphy said EA Javelin Anticheat has blocked 33 million cheating attempts across 2.2 billion PC gaming sessions since its 2022 launch. She said the software currently sports a 99% accuracy rate when it comes to identifying and banning cheaters, and that on the off chance it bans someone unjustly, EA has overturned those bans.</p><p dir="ltr">"We take player disputes very seriously as we never want to impact a legitimate player's ability to play one of our games," Murphy said.</p><p dir="ltr">New features introduced to EA Javelin last fall in Battlefield 2042 look to have had a big impact as well. Murphy said the game's "match infection rate"--how often a regular player would encounter a cheater--was cut in half following the new updates to EA Javelin.</p><p dir="ltr">Murphy used the report to try and ease some concerns players may have over EA Javelin's kernel-level approach, one that is also used by Riot Games' Vanguard and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-has-led-to-a-significant-drop-in-cheaters-activision-says/1100-6504694/" data-ref-id="1100-6504694">Activision's Ricochet anticheat</a> systems.</p><p dir="ltr">"While having a kernel driver is essential to protecting fair play in our games, we also understand the concerns that a kernel driver can raise," Murphy said. "EA Javelin Anticheat only runs when one of our protected games is running, and it will uninstall itself if you have uninstalled all of your EA games that have EA Javelin Anticheat protection. We have partnered closely with internal teams and 3rd party assessors to validate that EA Javelin Anticheat will only inspect what it needs to for anti-cheat purposes…everything else is off-limits."</p><p dir="ltr">Though EA has been relatively quiet on its anticheat efforts since 2022, Murphy said it will be sharing updates and deep-dives on the subject more often going forward in the name of transparency.</p>

			<p>Sandfall Interactive has a much bigger success on their hands than they could have predicted with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, so naturally, players who have already gorged themselves on the game since its launch are hoping to hear that there's more to come from the studio.</p>
<p>Which there very well could be, as lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen hints to fans in a conversation on Instagram (spotted by <a href="https://n4g.com/articles/playstation-chances-for-clair-obscure-expedition-33-dlc-are-good-says-lead-writer/">N4G</a>) that the chances are "<em>good</em>" that the team at Sandfall will begin working on DLC, or at least "<em>something more</em>" from the world of Clair Obscur.</p>
<p>"<em>Nothing concrete that I can say at the moment, we're honestly still just trying to process everything that's happening. It's been a lot to take in!</em>" Svedberg-Yen began when trying to answer the question of whether DLC for Clair Obscur is incoming.</p>
<p>"<em>We've always said if there is strong desire from the players that we would love to do something more, and based on the responses so far, I'd say chances are good</em><em>.</em>"</p>
<p>It's not by any means a definitive answer, but it does point in the right direction for fans of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. And as Svedberg-Yen points out, the team is still just taking everything in at the moment. If there will be DLC incoming, it'll be a while before it's ready to be shown. The new RPG has been a hit, <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-surpasses-500k-copies-sold-at-launch/">surpassing half a million</a> copies sold during its launch day and <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-a-million-seller/">then exceeding the one million mark</a> over its launch weekend.</p>
<p>Which is an even bigger feat when you consider that it entered the market as a brand-new series, just days after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> was released. Both titles were available on Xbox Game Pass, and still, Clair Obscur reached the one million milestone of copies sold in such a short amount of time, not just <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-breaks-4-million-players-in-4-days/">player engagement</a>.</p>

Another interesting tidbit about the game for Nintendo's upcoming hybrid console is utilizing "one of your Joy-Cons to fight with your katana," according to CD Projekt Red game director Adam Badowski.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/flcl-reanimated<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I love fan-animated projects. I love it when they do <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-fan-film-legend-goku-vegeta-broly-super-s-1849153117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what-if <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> and give Vegeta</a> his due. I love it when they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ndBoc6R8_A&amp;t=6s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emulate Saturday morning cartoons and <em>Dr. Slump</em></a>. I love it when they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf7bsmT-Jn0&amp;pp=ygUhaSBkb24ndCB3YW50IHRvIGJlIGEgbWFnaWNhbCBnaXJs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">put a spin on magical girl tropes</a>. My favorite kind of animated project is when a group of artists unite to craft something that combines the polished flair of a professional animation studio with the charming, rough edges of fan works. <a href="https://youtu.be/p13E4a_Iy9Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>FLCL Reanimated</em></a> has been added to my pantheon of favorite anime fan projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A little while ago, I wrote a piece for Gizmodo<em> </em>about the oral history of <a href="http://www.bartkira.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Bartkira</em></a>, specifically how its <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-history-behind-that-viral-bartkira-anime-trailer-2000533127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">animated trailer came into being</a>. <em>Bartkira </em>was a collaborative fan project that started on Tumblr in 2013, in which 768 artists each contributed five pages to redraw six volumes of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/animation-cel-auction-akira-batman-bugs-bunny-disney-1851504043" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Katsuhiro Otomo</a>’s <em>Akira </em>manga in distinctive art styles reminiscent of <em>The Simpsons</em>. It's all trippy to behold, especially with how seamlessly each painstakingly drawn manga panel blends into the next, creating an almost mural that encapsulates how each artist perceives the formative manga series in their unique styles. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SWt6OQ4Nl4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The animated trailer</a>, which had 31 animators working on it for nine months, is chef’s kiss. Now, history appears to be repeating itself once more with yet another group of artists who united their forces on the internet to reanimate one of anime’s most outlandish and special series, <em>FLCL</em>, just in time for its 25th anniversary.&nbsp;</p><p><em>FLCL Reanimated</em> was first announced back in 2021 when Twitter user Kobe Kendall, aka Sleptboi, sent out a feeler on an <em>FLCL </em>fan account asking if folks thought it’d be cool if <em>FLCL </em>got reanimated. Like <em>Bartkira</em>, <em>FLCL Reanimated</em> saw over 300 artists divvy up clips to remake <em>FLCL</em>’s fifth episode, “Brittle Bullet,” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/563432/flcl-reanimated-interview-premiere-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to <em>Polygon</em></a>. <em>Polygon </em>also notes that they went the extra mile by creating <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DImNjfCpmyS/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cover albums</a> and a <a href="https://heyzine.com/flip-book/d659cb0d2a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zine that emulated Newtype magazine</a> filled with behind-the-scenes production materials, which just so happens to be my favorite thing about an animated work. A joke that the creators poked fun at in a promotional video, the work began to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/flclreanimated.bsky.social/post/3lnnnvrizhk23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">become a question of whether it would ever come out</a>. And come out, the episode did. Clocking in at just over 28 minutes, <em>FLCL Reanimated</em> is sick as hell.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="FLCL REANIMATED" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p13E4a_Iy9Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Admittedly, <em>FLCL </em>is an anime series that, despite watching, I’m still not entirely sure I comprehend on a strictly narrative basis. There’s a space-faring robot; a pink-haired, guitar-wielding, moped-riding lady who is also from space; and a boy with a rather obvious metaphor for puberty—a bulge on his forehead. From this bulge, the robot and various other oddities emerge, brought forth by the coaxing of said pink-haired cosmic lady. That’s all you need to know, plot-wise. All that matters is that the show is a fucking vibe filled with iconic one-liners, sick music, and fluid action choreography that only old school Gainax could’ve gotten away with in the span of six episode– a trick that’s proven to be diminishing returns whenever Adult Swim has attempted to recapture lightning in a bottle, <a href="https://kotaku.com/flcl-progressives-premiere-is-a-little-tame-1826196547" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time and time again</a>, with its <a href="https://kotaku.com/flcl-fooly-cooly-grunge-adult-swim-premiere-review-1850809316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subsequent sequel series that no one asked for</a>. Fortunately, <em>FLCL Reanimated</em> does a superb job of showcasing how bonkers <a href="https://aftermath.site/gundam-gquuuuuux-is-the-sum-of-its-parts-in-the-best-way-possible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kazuya Tsurumaki’s directorial debut</a> was when it was first shown in the States on Toonami. Watching the fan-made episode was like gazing through a kaleidoscopic viewfinder, shifting effortlessly between surreal settings. Each flip revealed a new art style that ranged from dogmatically faithful renditions of its manga to quirky, <em>South Park</em>-esque cardboard cutouts, and an eclectic array of vibrant, kinetic visuals that brought a new texture to the already out-there anime series.</p><p>What’s more, like <em>Bartkira</em>, the lower third of the fan project features the social media handles of its artists, allowing viewers to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbk5weEd5Rk5rOEVZaDdRSGlvWTd1ZE1mb2l5Z3xBQ3Jtc0trQkV2dk5NT0FEc0wyMDBZWFNVbkN5SDlGRkRKUHk3dHR1UjlrVUxwNWV5VFNpTWh2b2NvVmRWdnNSQVNrRndLSGV0NE0xWWdfZURac2M0cUxROTV5QklQWmV4bVdFYnQzbktmMWsxVEZwM1NBSE9Maw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2F1f5EUWcc-zvLzgrIhc0xOZvTGAICyyfBuNg3ejwAM9vs%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing&amp;v=p13E4a_Iy9Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explore more of their work</a>. The damn thing even has eyecatches that give off that kind of modern day Adult Swim Toonami commercial break vibe (and spoof commercials to boot). It’s a slight, old-hat anime touch that does wonders for making a series feel just that extra bit special. I’m particularly fond of the D.A.R.E. ad with Mamimi Samejima smoking a bowl.&nbsp;</p><p>Watching <em>FLCL Reanimated</em> absolutely delivered, reigniting the magic that makes <em>FLCL</em> a one-of-a-kind visual masterpiece. It showcased a stunning tapestry of creativity, proving fan artists can transcend the label of "fan art" to craft something extraordinary. Here's hoping it sparks a fresh wave of fan-animated projects.</p><p><em><strong>Correction 4/29/25, 12:28pm</strong>--An earlier version of this article misstated the number of artists involved in the project.</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grace-sinners"><h3>Grace Did Nothing Wrong</h3></a><p>Some Sinners fans need to ease up on homegirl

		<p>Netmarble has announced that Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will be released on May 21st for PC and mobile devices. This Game of Thrones title puts you in the boots of the heir to House Tyre, a small noble House from the North. You are instructed by Jon Snow to travel around Westeros to rally the Great Houses and the lords of the realm to fight against the White Walkers.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Game of Thrones: Kingsroad] Launch Date Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fpdoaR8N_a4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There will be a fully featured character creation tool, so you can get your heir looking just right, and players will be able to select from one of three classes inspired by iconic roles within the original series – Sellsword, Knight or Assassin, with a a focus on player vs player combat as well as combat against threats that stalk the wilds of Westeros. Players will have the chance to roam freely through familiar settings including Castle Black, King’s Landing, and High Garden.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/22/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-shows-just-how-far-mobile-gaming-has-come/">Game of Thrones Kingsroad shows just how far mobile gaming has come</a></h2>
<p>Dom spent some time earlier this year playing Game of Thrones: Kingsroad, and in his preview he said, <em>“The mobile-centric free-to-play side of things does rear its head when you make your way to the upgrade tree, and the first of your upgrades is worth a 1% improvement in your skills. While it isn’t surprising to find that artificially slow progression here, what is surprising is that Kingsroad feels so much like a ‘proper’ action title, that it feels incongruos. Playing on PC I was immediately impressed by just how good Game of Thrones: Kingsroad looks, from the high-quality main visuals to the painterly effects laid over the animated cutscenes.”</em></p>

<p>As mentioned in Dom’s preview, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will be a free to play title, though people can buy founder’s packs to play<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/"> the early access version of the game</a> on PC via Steam. If you are a mobile player, you can pre-register your interest by following the links; <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/game-of-thrones-kingsroad/id6483917232">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad on the App&nbsp;Store</a> &amp; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netmarble.got&amp;pli=1">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad – Apps on Google Play</a>.</p>

If a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell-remake">Splinter Cell</a> remake fell in the woods, would over the top industry secrecy and NDAs even allow us to hear it? That's the million dollar question literally no one is asking, because who phrases things that way, but enough about that game that may or may not exist at this point in time, we've got a different <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> to talk about: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-blacklist">Blacklist</a>. Yes, the, technically speaking, most recent entry in the series just received a little update on Steam yesterday which… <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/235600/view/519711795144819220">adds achievements into the game</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As a reminder, Splinter Cell: Blacklist is a 12 year old game that did in fact release on other platforms, where it also had achievements, so why <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> have decided to add them in now all this time later is anyone's guess. Seriously, I'm sure this is something that at least one person wants, it's just such an odd thing to do.
</p>
<p>
There is a slight caveat to the announcement that mostly depends on how much you like achievement hunting. Ubisoft explains that "achievements will be retroactively earned for the accomplishments already completed in your game." That means if you've already played the game on PC you'll have up to 28 achievements already achieved, for lack of a better word. Oh, and don't worry, all 19 online achievements that you needed online services for haven't been added in, because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-give-online-services-for-older-games-a-stay-of-execution">those services aren't actually offered any more</a>.
</p>
<p>
I do appreciate that a game this old has received a little update like this, but you can't help but wonder what's going on with that remake. The last real update for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth game</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splinter-cell-remake-team-share-concept-art-before-going-dark-for-a-little-while">back in 2022</a>, where some concept art was shown off. Since then… not much else has materialised. It's no secret that Ubisoft have been struggling for a while, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">Tencent having to give them a whole lot of money recently</a> to keep things running. Maybe with some cash coming in, the time for the remake is almost upon us.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">These days Call of Duty is filled with outlandish shop bundles, including animal-themed operators, neon-colorful outfits, and characters like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. However, a wacky new operator bundle in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a> is causing controversy, as some players are calling the bundle's emote a sneaky pay-to-win tactic.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the latest shop items in Call of Duty is the Cardboard Commando bundle. This includes an operator constructed out of cardboard boxes, and everything in the bundle is themed around cardboard, too. The controversy comes from the bundle's "Surprise Gift" emote, which allows you to turn into a cardboard box mid-game.</p><p dir="ltr">The emote can be seen in the clip above, as shared by <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1916567772387070072" rel="nofollow ">ModernWarzone</a>, and several comments on the video are already calling the emote a pay-to-win feature.</p><p dir="ltr">Being able to quickly conceal yourself in Call of Duty can be quite the advantage, especially in more competitive modes like Search and Destroy or Warzone's battle royale. This cardboard box is fairly large and should look out of place in most settings. The emote also only temporarily lets you disguise yourself as a box. So, while this paid emote could potentially give you a competitive edge over your opponents, it's unlikely to fool anyone who isn't a new player. Still, this is a 2,400 CoD Points ($20) bundle that probably shouldn't let you hide.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty recently had another pay-to-win bundle controversy with the game's frustratingly hard-to-see Terminator T-800 operator skin. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-patch-notes-include-nerf-for-terminator-skin/1100-6530740/">Terminator skin has been adjusted</a> to include better visibility, but it was a very minor visual change.</p><p dir="ltr">In other news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/youll-never-guess-who-the-next-cod-operator-might-be/1100-6531191/" data-ref-id="1100-6531191">Seth Rogen may become a future Call of Duty operator</a> as part of the stoner-themed content arriving with the Season 3 Reloaded update. Here are all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-3-reloaded-start-date-and-details/1100-6531027/">major announcements for Season 3 Reloaded</a>, including a new weapon, Ranked Play for Warzone, and more multiplayer maps.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a> amped up its production last November, though it won't launch until at least 2027. We know that it will continue the story of the previous games, albeit with Ciri now serving as the series' protagonist, and that former hero Geralt (and his long-time voice actor, Doug Cockle) will still be around in some capacity. However, the voice artist behind The Witcher 3's Yennefer of Vengerberg has said she doesn't know yet if her character will return for the upcoming sequel.</p><p>Denise Gough, who now stars in the Star Wars series Andor as Imperial Officer Dedra Meero, wasn't sure if Yennefer would return, much less the level of progress of the game.</p><p>"I don't know any of this," Gough told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yennefer-voice-artist-doesnt-yet-know-if-shes-back-for-the-witcher-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. She also looked back at her initial signing on for the role and was confused by the process.</p><p>"I didn't know what I was doing," Gough continued. "I'd never done a video game before. And then lots of, usually men, would come up to me in sound departments on film sets, would come up and go [whispers] 'are you Yennefer?' And I was like 'who's Yennefer?'"</p><p>The sorceress Yennefer is part of The Witcher's main character trinity, along with Ciri and Geralt. Her 'complex' relationship with Geralt, is featured in numerous Witcher stories as well as a prominent part of Netflix's The Witcher TV adaptation. In the series, she is played by actress Anya Chalotra.</p><p>Fans got their first proper look at Liam Hemsworth in the role of Geralt back <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth-first-look-as-geralt-revealed-by-netflix/1100-6523641/" data-ref-id="1100-6523641">in May last year</a>. The Witcher Season 4 production started a year ago, with Netflix announcing that the series will end with Season 5. The final two seasons will adapt the events from The Witcher books, Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake.</p>
