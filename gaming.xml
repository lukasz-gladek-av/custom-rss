			<p>Following yesterday's PC Gaming Show Most Wanted 2025 announcements, the last remaining showcase before the end of the year is The Game Awards. It's also the biggest show, usually, although there have been slow years when host Geoff Keighley himself has tempered fans' expectations in advance to avoid disappointments.</p>
<p>This is not one of those times, at least according to VideoGameChronicle Founder Andy Robinson, who undoubtedly inherited a lot of contacts from his former career as an industry professional. In a tweet <a href="https://x.com/Andy_VGC/status/1864973090263900372?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> on X, Robinson teased a very big show, adding that it's not a guess.</p>
<p><em>Expecting a VERY big The Game Awards next week. Fire up the hype train. </em><em>Definitely not a guess.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps that shouldn't be surprising. 2024 may not have had as many big releases as 2023, but 2025 is looking better thanks to games like Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, Civilization VII, Assassin's Creed Shadows, Avowed, Monster Hunter Wilds, Borderlands 4, Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, Doom: The Dark Ages, Fable, Ghost of Yōtei, Grand Theft Auto VI, Mafia: The Old Country, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, South of Midnight, Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2.</p>
<p>There's a solid chance to see at least some of these 2025 games at The Game Awards 2024, but Robinson seems to refer mostly to game reveals for titles we haven't really seen anything yet. This category could include the likes of Ark 2, the upcoming BioShock title, Rare's Everwild, Archetype's Exodus, Marvel's Wolverine, Monolith's Wonder Woman, the next Metro from 4A Games, and even projects we haven't heard before. Let us know in the comments which of these games (or other titles we haven't mentioned) you'd like to see unveiled.</p>
<p>As a reminder, here's the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-gets-nominated-in-the-game-of-the-year-section-at-tga-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of candidates</a> for the coveted Game of the Year award:</p>
<ul>
<li>Astro Bot</li>
<li>Balatro</li>
<li>Black Myth: Wukong</li>
<li>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</li>
<li>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</li>
<li>Metaphor: ReFantazio</li>
</ul>
<p>The Game Awards 2024 goes live on December 12 at 4:30pm PT / 7:30p ET / 12:30a+1 GMT from the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-redemptions-top-1-million-queues-over-the-weekend-are-expected/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today's Path of Exile 2 Early Access launch is setting out to be a smashing success, considering the huge number of EA redemptions reported by developer Grinding Gear Games.</p>
<p>A few hours ago on X, the Path of Exile 2 developer confirmed they reached 1 million Early Access redemptions, thanking players for the unexpected level of support. With so many players, however, unforeseen issues may arise during the launch window, and queues during the weekend should be expected, according to the developer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We’ve just reached 1 million Early Access redemptions. The support you have all shown for Path of Exile 2 Early Access is far beyond anything we could have ever predicted. However we want to be upfront with you all and let you know there may very well be queues over the weekend. <a href="https://t.co/bwGpsVNdGU">pic.twitter.com/bwGpsVNdGU</a></p>
<p>— Path of Exile (@pathofexile) <a href="https://twitter.com/pathofexile/status/1864880645228630299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The smashing success of the Path of Exile 2 Early Access release is completely deserved. The very first version of the second entry in the series will launch with<a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access/"> a lot of content</a>, which includes six playable classes with two Ascendancy classes each, three story acts, and a fully featured endgame that introduces new mechanics that will push the gameplay mechanics to their absolute limits. Everything that Grinding Gear Games revealed so far only reinforced the positive opinion I had of the game after having tried the game during Gamescom earlier this year.</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 Early Access launches later today on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. While the full game will be free-to-play like its predecessor, the Early Access version is only available after purchasing any of the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/purchase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supporter packs.</a></p>

But the true concurrent figure will be much higher given Marvel Rivals launched on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S also (Sony and Microsoft do not make player numbers public).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems to be going down well on Steam, too, with a ‘mostly positive’ user review rating from over 5,700 reviews (76% of the reviews are positive). Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-review">Marvel Rivals Review in Progress</a> to find out what we think.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For NetEase, it will be hoping not only to keep Marvel Rivals’ player count as high as possible for as long as possible (something that’s proved particularly tricky for live service games of late), but to make enough money from players to meet the company’s internal revenue projections. To that end, Marvel Rivals sells a battle pass and premium skins. But is it paying off? The game is currently third in Steam’s top-sellers list, which is sorted by revenue, behind only the pricey Steam Deck and Grinding Gear Games’ Path of Exile 2. This suggests Marvel Rivals is already convincing players to open their wallets.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/06/unnamed-11-1733478165414.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Marvel Rivals Twitch Drops Season 0.

This month-long kick-off season starts with a total of 33 heroes, all available to play for free, eight maps for Quick Match and Competitive modes, a Conquest map, and a Practice Range. Dooms' Rise serves as the opening chapter “for the chaos caused by each of Doctor Dooms’ time experiments colliding and unleashing the Timestream Entanglement,” NetEase said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a Twitch Drops event for Season 0, as you’d expect from a live service game of this type, an 'Entangled Moments' seasonal event to unlock spray rewards, gallery card rewards, and stories for completing tasks, and a global launch gift: a special code for a free Iron Man costume.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

		<p>Eternal Strands, the debut game from Yellow Brick Games, now has a release date and you will not have to wait much longer for it. Eternal Strands will be available on January 28th, and it will be coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox Game Pass. Yellow Brick Studios has also revealed a partnership with Square Enix’s Creative Studio III for some free post launch content.</p>
<p><iframe title="Eternal Strands - Release Date Trailer | Yellow Brick Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VhMT5IWrTlk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Jeff Skalski, COO and Executive Producer at Yellow Brick Games said, <em>“As a long-time fan of Square Enix and the games Creative Studio III have made under the helm of Naoki Yoshida, member of Square Enix’s board of directors, and studio head of Creative Studio III, this is a dream come true for all of us here at Yellow Brick Games. To first have the opportunity to create our own original fantasy IP and then have the chance to work with the Creative Studio III team to further enrich it with all-new content is just a once in a lifetime moment. As an independent studio working on our first game, we will forever be thankful to them. I can’t wait for the players to experience the new cool designs from the master artist Yusuke Mogi when our first free post-launch update for Eternal Strands arrives in the spring of 2025.” &nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Eternal Strands’ story puts players in the shoes of Brynn, a Weaver on a mission to push back the Surgeborn and reclaim her people’s home. Brynn has access to magical abilities and weapons to aid in her fight that will take her across expansive world of the Enclave where everything can be explored.

		<p>“Stay away from the water” is pretty easy advice to follow in many parts of the inhabited world, but it’s less handy when you’re trapped on an underwater research station that has awoken some kind of deep sea terrors. That’s exactly what you will encounter in sci-fi horror shooter Deepest Fear.</p>
<p><iframe title="DEEPEST FEAR™ | Horror FPS | Worldwide Exclusive Reveal | 4K 60fps" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zsw5hRbtd7A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So what the heck are you doing down there? Dr. Danni Carrol has to fight to the heart of this secret project, which has been masterminded by her estranged father. Whatever he’s been up to, it’s brought bizarre watery monsters out of the ocean. Thankfully they can still be blasted with a big gun.</p>
<p>Inspired by 80s horror action films like The Abyss, The Thing, and The Fly, and Total Recall, you’ll immediately spot the retro futuristic tech that sets the visual aesthetic of Deepest Fear’s world. For the gameplay it leans in on Metroidvania world design and FPS immersive sims, where there’s puzzles to unravel and a degree of improvisation that’s possible to get the job done.</p>
<p>It’s a pretty great looking reveal, to my eye, feeling a bit like modern horror classic Alien: Isolation thanks to that retro-futuristic tech, but then with a much greater emphasis on combat and gunplay. This will be really interesting to keep tabs on as development continues.</p>

<p>Developed and self-published by Variable State, there’s no word on release date targets or platforms beyond PC.</p>

            <p>Gwent, the card game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, is finally getting a physical release.</p>
<p>It's been almost 10 years since the release of the video game, which has spawned a couple of spin-off card games in The Witcher: Thronebreaker and mobile app Gwent, but only now is a physical reproduction of the game being created.</p>
<p>The set will come with over 400 cards and a playmat to replicate the full experience from The Witcher 3, and will have variant rulesets from casual play to tournament rules.</p>

<p>It will cost £44 and arrive in Q3 2025.</p>
<p>The set is being created by Hachette Boardgames UK and new publisher No Loading Games, which is focused on bringing licensed brands to tabletop gaming - an Asterix set is also planned for next year.</p>
<p>"Gwent is the biggest 'game within a game' in media history," said Rob Trounce, marketing manager for Hachette Boardgames UK.</p>
<p>"After a 10-year wait, we are proud to be working alongside No Loading Games to bring this beloved game to tabletops in a stunning package - whether it's a souvenir for fans of Geralt and his adventures, or a game for competitive card game enthusiasts, Gwent will be one of the hottest games of 2025."</p>

            <p>NetEase Games' free-to-play, team-based PVP shooter Marvel Rivals has got off to a rather heroic start on Steam.</p>
<p>Following its debut earlier today, the game - which boasts a vast roster of characters from across the Marvel universe - has managed to already reach a peak concurrent player count of 444,286 over on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/">Valve's platform</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there are still 181,057 Marvel-ites (not sure that is actually a word, but let's go with it for now) still battling it out amongst each other. This number may well rise further again over the weekend, when we are free from the shackles of the work week.</p>

<p>It isn't all numbers and no praise. Marvel Rivals currently sits with a "mostly positive" review average on Steam.</p>
<p>"Marvel Rivals is proving that the competitive multiplayer space does indeed have room for new titles. Just gotta get the execution right," reads one positive review. "Finallyyyyyy, a game that's actually fun," adds another. "First off, the team is amazing, and the gameplay is fantastic - I just love it."</p><p>One area the game is receiving particular praise for, is its roster of characters. Prior to its launch, the team confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-next-five-characters-have-been-confirmed-heres-the-list">Black Widow, Cloak and Dagger, Iron Fist, Squirrel Girl, and Wolverine would all be joining the line up</a>. Other characters include Iron Man, Hulk and Scarlet Witch.</p>

		<p>During the PC Gaming Show last night, Nightdive Studios surprise released The Thing Remastered, making it available on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch. You can check out the brand new trailer to celebrate the game’s launch, and also see the improvements that Nightdive Studios has brought to the classic game.</p>

</ul>
<p>The Nightdive team has worked with the original developers to bring some gameplay improvements. One key area is with the interface for the fear/trust system that determines whether an AI will cooperate with you or defy you, depending on their psychological state. It’s well known that Computer Artworks had to make a few… creative decisions to get things to work and fit with the game’s technical limitations in the early 2000s, and just designing an open-ended structure like this to work with the story. There are improved models, textures and environments, and there’s also new dynamic lighting and 4K resolutions at up to 144 FPS, depending on the platform.</p>

		<p>Raccoon Logic has announced that Revenge of the Savage Planet will release in May 2025, the sequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/journey-to-the-savage-planet">Journey to the Savage Planet</a> coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PS4, Xbox One and PC.</p>

<p>The new trailer features Kindred Aerospace CEO Martin Tweed from the first game, as he reveals his new nemesis, Gunther Harrison, the CEO of rival Alta Interglobal, and some brand new gameplay.</p>
<p>You’ll notice one big change for this game compared to the original, in that it’s shifted to a third person view, letting you really soak in the bombastic cartoony animations of the characters as they run, slide, leap and blast their way through the game.</p>
<p>You’ve been abandoned on an alien planet after your mission to colonise it has been deemed a bit too spendy for Alta Interglobal. So, you’ll head out to explore, scavenge and salvage from habitats that were sent on a one way trip before the cutbacks, capture animals, upgrade gear and discover secrets. Also… there’s actually four planets in this game, all of which are savage.</p>

<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet can be played solo or co-op (both split screen local or online) and with full crossplay.</p>
<p>Journey to the Savage Planet originally launched in 2020, shortly after developer Typhoon Studios had been acquired by Google. It still launched crossplatform, though was ported to Stadia a little while later. Of course, we all know what happened to Stadia, and Google shutdown Typhoon Studios in the process. Thankfully the founders were able to set up Raccoon Logic with some backing from Tencent, and they reacquired the Savage Planet IP from Google, allowing this to be a full sequel and not one of those spiritual successors.</p>
<p>We had a great time with the original. Dom said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/01/27/journey-to-the-savage-planet-review/">our Journey to the Savage Planet review</a>, “A rollicking space adventure, Journey to the Savage Planet has the smarts to make you laugh out loud while taking shots at consumerism and big business”</p>

			<p>The 2D/2.5D platformer has become a somewhat neglected genre in recent years. Aside from Mario Wonder, many of the main standout series have been dormant for some time. A few months ago the cancellation of Crash Bandicoot 5 was reported and it’s been 10 years since Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze (6 since the Switch port). As a big fan of this style of game I was pleasantly surprised to hear about Nikoderiko – through a YouTube advert of all things. Initially, I was concerned that the game would turn out to be Crash from Wish but the full game is a well-made and polished platformer that is a welcome addition to the genre.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nikoderiko: The Magical World - Feature Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ExG4ce6anoM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Moving away from the antipodean marsupial of Naughty Dog’s series, you play as a pair of mongooses (mongeese?) who are depicted as Nathan Drake style treasure hunters – a portrayal which feels like a deliberate nod again to Crash’s original developers. This conscious reference is confirmed late in the game when a side character incorrectly identifies Niko and Luna as bandicoots, a clear sign both of the self-awareness of this game and also its meta sense of humour. The broader story is that the Cobra King has stolen a treasure chest found by the mongoose pair and they must venture across the land to track it down again.</p>


<p>Graphically, Nikoderiko is very much in keeping with the style of its influences. Bright and bold cartoony visuals abound with a variety of traditional biomes all present and correct. Enemies are very reminiscent of both DK and Crash’s foes, with the boss battles perhaps being more influenced by the former with larger-than-life encounters. Both Niko and Luna are well designed but it can be a little too easy to get them mixed up when playing in coop.</p>
<p>To make your way through the 30 or so levels of this adventure you’ll be running and jumping in very traditionally organised levels with regular checkpoints and lots of collectables. Instead of the genre’s popular double jump, the two heroes can glide across long distances (a characteristic that would better suit a flying squirrel surely?) &nbsp;Enemies can be defeated by jumping on their heads or using your slide attack, the latter also being needed to traverse small gaps at times. At set points during levels you’ll also find barrels and chests that you can pick up to throw at more stubborn enemies. Towards the end of the game some challenging combinations of enemies require you to string together all your abilities in order to overcome them.</p>


<p>The majority of the time you’ll be travelling from left to right in the style of Donkey Kong Country with the occasional swimming level included for variety. The latter control really well and aren’t the low point that subnautical sections often are. You even unlock animal friends to help you through some levels with these often being designed around the special abilities of each. Alongside these level-specific appearances, however, you can also buy extra uses of the mounts to bring along to other levels – although this wasn’t something I used in my completed playthrough.</p>
<p>More in keeping with Crash Bandicoot, though, are the parts of some levels where you turn away from the camera (and less often run toward it) and take on a third dimension. These are a relatively smaller part of the game than the 2D sections but play out almost identical to the Bandicoot, even to the point of having some of the same issues with depth perception at times. Boss fights vary between the different perspectives too and are mostly challenging enough to be fun without being too annoying – unless you are trying for some of the more tricky boss-based trophies.</p>
<p>In terms of collectables, there are fireflies that serve as your main currency, coins and trophies that are used to unlock extra material via ingame lootboxes, letters that spell out NIKO (in a huge borrowing from DK), and finally large purple crystals. There is one crystal hidden on every main level and finding some of these adds an extra layer of exploration to your travels. The aforementioned lootboxes are not as egregious as that description might suggest since they are entirely self-contained and don’t require any microtransactions although some grinding will be necessary if you want to unlock everything.</p>

<p>Finally, one of the most positive aspects of Nikoderiko is the ability to play the whole game in local coop, with two players controlling each of the mongooses. This is always a huge addition to a game and should be celebrated. The main question with any single-screen coop is how it handles one player being too far ahead and Nikoderiko goes for the bubble mechanic. The trailing player will lose a heart and teleport back to the leading one in a protective bubble. This can be a little annoying, but as long as one player survives then the game continues so it isn’t as frustrating as it could have been.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		I really enjoyed my time with Nikoderiko: The Magical World. It's a blast in singleplayer, and after a good few evenings playing in coop with my kids I and can absolutely recommend it as a local multiplayer experience too. If you're a platforming fan, then this is one you won't want to miss.	</p></div>

			<p>Today, Square Enix <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1864846226392588539" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake has already sold two million copies between retail and digital. Given that the game launched less than a month ago, it's a great result for the Japanese publisher.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>, Kai Tatsumoto rated the remake 8.6 out of 10:</p>
<p><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake has been given a complete graphical overhaul, instead giving the iconic RPG a makeover in the same vein as Square-Enix’s Octopath Traveler and other similar titles. The entire world is brightly colored and blooming with light. Even if you’re intimately familiar with every step retracing Ortega’s journey, the complete reimagining of the adventure makes this feel like a brand new adventure rather than just another release of Seeds of Salvation. All I can say now is that I can’t wait to go through Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake next year.</em></p>
<p><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D, while not the definitive edition that includes all of the previous side content, embodies the perfect version of Erdrick's adventure that both old and new fans can appreciate as if a brand new adventure from Yuji Horii.</em></p>

		<p>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector, the follow up to the incredible Citizen Sleeper, will be releasing on January 31st for PC, Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and will also be available day one on Game Pass. There is a limited time <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2442460/Citizen_Sleeper_2_Starward_Vector/">Hexport demo</a> available now on Steam, but will only be playable until December 8th.</p>
<p><iframe title="Citizen Sleeper 2 - Date Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ryA2lZ-FEp8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector’s story will take different route than the one in the original, though a few similar elements remain. As a Sleeper, you are on the run trying to escape from your past, but have little memory of it. In the first game, the goal was to survive and outwit your pursuers upon a space station, while trying to keep your android body functioning. In Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector, the goal is to get a ship, put together a crew, and explore the Starward Belt. You will still need to keep your body functioning, and decisions will be need to be made that will alter the course of your relationships and the story.</p>
<p>We awarded Citizen Sleeper our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/24/game-of-the-year-2022-best-narrative/">Best Narrative Game of the Year award for 2022</a>, and it was absolutely deserving of it. While we didn’t cover the original release, Aran checked out the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/04/citizen-sleeper-episode-purge-review/">final DLC</a>&nbsp;for the game, saying, <em>“As a finale Purge is an excellent way to finish the tale of Citizen Sleeper. It ties up so many loose ends and gives fitting finales to many of the influential characters that you have met. There is one loose end regarding a particular character that I feel was not properly resolved, but at the same time it ties into the confusion of the events in the final stages. Yet, the door remains open for more stories set within this universe be it on The Eye or by following what happens out in the cosmos. This may be the end of the Sleeper’s story, but there are so many more characters who embark on new beginnings that offer worlds of narrative possibilities.”</em></p>

			<p>Among the many new game announcements featured in yesterday's PC Gaming Show Most Wanted 2025, Deepest Fear certainly stands out as one of the most intriguing.&nbsp;It is being developed by Variable State, a British independent studio known for games like Virginia, Last Stop, and the upcoming Polaris.</p>
<p>According to the developers, Deepest Fear is a sci-fi horror first-person shooter game featuring inspirations from the likes of James Cameron, John Carpenter, David Cronenberg, and Paul Verhoven in terms of atmosphere. On the other hand, Metroid Prime, Half-Life 2, System Shock 2, and Dead Space were cited as inspirations for the gameplay, which is said to mix Metroidvania design with immersive simulation elements, allowing the player to come up with interesting solutions to the various situations presented throughout the game.</p>
<p>There's also a particular twist in that Deepest Fear features a full-fledged real-time fluid simulation, which protagonist Dr. Danni Carrol will use to fight otherworldly entities that manifest spontaneously from any water source. Moreover, the surrounding environment can flood and take in water at any moment, sweeping her away with unpredictable currents and plunging the protagonist into the suffocating depths.</p>

			<p>Today, CCP Games announced Founder Access for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ccp-games-announce-new-title-eve-frontier-same-universe-as-eve-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVE Frontier</a>, which gives those who purchased it the opportunity to have a say on features within the space survival simulation game while also being given access to the in-development build of the game on a continuous basis. This access begins on December 10, when those who hold the Founder Access pass will be able to join the exclusive, always-on server in Closed Alpha. This gives them the opportunity to provide crucial feedback to the developers and leave their mark on the game before it is released.</p>
<p>Releasing Founder Access marks the start of the next phase of development of EVE Frontier by allowing those who have purchased the pass to access it permanent pre-launch access. By doing this, it means that players will be able to play and experience EVE Frontier before it has launched and will be able to give feedback to the developers on features that may need tweaking or adding or even bug fixes that CCP Games may have missed. Of course, that is not the only thing that players can get by purchasing Founder Access. Players will also get additional benefits, such as name reservations, cosmetics, Discord roles, and special access to CCP Games Developer streams. Additionally, when the game launches in the future as free-to-play, Founders will be able to redeem their included premium subscription time.</p>

<p>CCP Games CEO Hilmar Veigar Pétursson said:</p>
<p><em>In EVE Frontier we are deepening the contribution and connection players have over a living galaxy. A virtual world where developers and players are equals, where the rules apply to all. Our long-term vision is to create an open ecosystem built, operated, and governed by the Frontier's inhabitants themselves.</em></p>
<p>From today, those interested will be able to purchase Founder Access to EVE Frontier, with three different tiers to purchase. The cheapest tier is $29.99 and includes a Unique Awakened Portrait and one month of Premium Post-Launch Subscription Time. The second tier, named Initiated, is $59.99, including two exclusive skins, a portrait, two months of Premium Post-Launch Subscription Time, and a 24-hour early start at launch.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the third tier, which is the most expensive and provides the most benefits. This comes with a unique Ascended Portrait and three exclusive skins. You'll also get four months of Premium Post-Launch Subscription Time, a Name Reservation, and a 72-hour early start at launch. To get all of these benefits, you'll have to pay $89.99.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/m80-acquire-beastcoast-rainbow-six-team-out/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/m80-acquires-beastcoast-and-throws-manchester-r6-major-champs-out-in-the-cold.1053627/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/m80-acquire-beastcoast-rainbow-six-team-out/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>M80 has moved to acquire Beastcoast, adding the likes of Dota 2 and Pokémon-focused esports to an already stacked roster. The organisation will now cover these games in addition to Rainbow Six Siege, Counter-Strike 2, and VALORANT, but the move hasn’t been completed without a few upsets.</p>



<p>The losers of this deal are represented by Beastcoast’s former Rainbow Six Siege team, which claimed a victory at the BLAST R6 Major in Manchester, England earlier this year. They’re now left without an organisation to represent at the Six Invitational 2025, which is fast approaching.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-last-minute-change">Last-Minute Change</h2>



<p>M80 posted on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>M80 is pleased to announce we have acquired Beastcoast and their esports and media businesses. Excited to welcome them to the M80 family!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In June, Beastcoast and Cloud9 partnered in the Rainbow Six Siege space ahead of the Esports World Cup. It didn’t turn out to be too fruitful a partnership, given that the team failed to qualify for the EWC, but it was also a very short-lived one. Per the <a href="https://m80.gg/article/m80-acquires-beastcoast-moves-into-dota2-pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official statement released by M80</a>, some key staff members are being pulled over from Beastcoast, but it’s bad news for some:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As part of the acquisition, M80 will absorb several of Beastcoast’s esports operations – including a top team in DOTA 2 – one of the largest Pokemon media businesses in gaming, and key staff, including CEO Grant Zinn. </p>



<p>In his new role at M80, Zinn will serve as Chief Business Development Officer, where he will support M80’s expansion and double-down on fandom in exciting, but underserved esports like Pokemon and fast-growing regions like South America.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The core trio that represented Beastcoast – Hotancold, SpiriTz, and Gaveni – has been left out in the cold following this move. They’ve resigned to stay together and add a couple of new players to their squad, but they currently have no banner to fly at the Six Invitational, which takes place in Boston in February.</p>



<p>Previous members of the Beastcoast roster, dfuzr and Gunnar, have unknown futures ahead of them.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Beastcoast beat Team BDS in an unlikely finish in Manchester to secure the trophy at the BLAST R6 Major, the first such win for the organisation in Rainbow Six.</p>

You can begin “Drawing” at your base.</p><p><em>—You can turn on guide lines, so that you will not lose your place when drawing.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_001.jpg"></a></figure><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>—You are not limited to human characters. It is possible to create characters of all types of shapes, including sushi or fish.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—By making the feet like seaweed, you can make it look like your fish character is swimming.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_004.png"></a></figure><p>If you feel like it is too difficult to draw from scratch, you can choose from 90 types of existing characters to start, and then create your own based off of it.</p><p>It is possible to edit portions of a character, so let’s create a character with pigtails using an existing character as a base.</p><p><em>—We are going to edit this side-ponytail character to create a pigtailed character. You can choose from three skin colors and 10 hair colors.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_005.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Take the original hair, copy and paste, and adjust the position by flipping the pasted hair.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_006.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_007.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Now you have easily created a character with pigtails!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_008.jpg"></a></figure><p>If you are new to this “Draw” tool, try editing an existing character.</p><p>Not only can you create the front of your character, but you can also create facial expressions such as when your character takes damage. In addition, you can create walking or running animation, as well as attachments, such as weapons, armor, and wings.</p><p><em>—Customization isn’t limited to appearance. Your character’s name, description, dialogue, and even your standby motion can be changed.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_009.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_010.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_011.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Editing Tool: “Music”</strong></p><p>In the <em>Cladun</em> series, players are also able to create their own background music and sound effects. It is a bit hard to use and could take some time to get used to, but do try this tool starting from this entry in the series.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_012.jpg"></a></figure><p>Compared to the last entry, <em>Cladun X3</em> allows for more expressions through more tones. New capabilities to set tone, envelopes, pink noise, and macro have been added, allowing for stronger expressions. In addition, you are allowed four times more characters compared to previous entries, which will let you create longer compositions.</p><p>To those who want to make music, but are intimidated by the process, we plan to release support tools on our official website.</p><p>Created music can be set as background music to the map of your created town, and can also be sent to other players through the “Network” tool.</p><p><em>—The available “Sample Music” can be used as background music as well. Background music of the Story Dungeon can be changed.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_013.jpg"></a></figure><p>By creating and setting background music that fits your created map, it creates better atmosphere to your town.</p><p><strong>■ Network Advanced Mode: Create Your Own Map and Share With Other Users</strong></p><p>In the “Advanced Mode” of “Network,” you can share maps, characters, and background music with other players.</p><p>In Advanced Mode, you can create your own Town Maps and then upload them for other players to see. You can also download maps that other players have created and explore.</p><p><strong>Town Map Creation Mode: Create Maps</strong></p><p>You can create a variety of maps, from maps that fit your created character, to maps that you yourself would like to explore.</p><p>Choose from a variety of chips located at the top of the screen, and place them anywhere on the map.</p><p><em>—There are many types of chips, and they can be chosen through the “Chips List” for use in map creation.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_014.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Chips can have either “Floor” or “Wall” properties.

Create your own chips, and build buildings and towns in your own distinct taste!</p><p><em>—You can combine multiple chips to create one build building. The possibilities are endless!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_020.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Drawing Placement Mode: Place Your Own Characters in Your Town</strong></p><p>Once you create your map, use the “Drawing Placement Mode” to place your created characters on the map! You can decide your characters’ dialogue, whether they walk or not, whether they open up shop when talked to, and many other settings.</p><p><em>—The behaviors of characters can be set in great detail—whether they walk or not, talk, open shop when interacted, provide maps after being talked to, and changing the music following interactions.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_021.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—You can actually purchase items through the shop.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_022.png"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_023.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Internet Upload: Share Your Map With Other Players</strong></p><p>If you’d like other people to play your maps and see your characters, try uploading your creations to the Internet! Other players of <em>Cladun X3</em> may come and pay your maps a visit.</p><p><em>—Using “Network” to upload your characters and maps makes it possible for other players to freely download your creations. Using “Specific Release Upload” will allow you to choose specific people to share your uploads to.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_024.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>World: Connect Your Towns to Create Gigantic Maps</strong></p><p>“World” is a large map created by connecting multiple Town Maps. A maximum of 900 Town Maps can be connected. Towns of the same atmosphere can be created to create a large city. Town Maps that have hidden “Magic Maps” can be strung together and explored at once. There are many ways to use and enjoy maps!</p><p><em>—Detailed information can be seen, such as if a map has cartographs and if they have characters placed in them. You can create a world by choosing only the maps that interest you. (The screen and map names are still in development.)</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_025.png"></a></figure><p><strong>Likes: Stress-Free Communication</strong></p><p>Players can “Like” maps that they really enjoyed.

<p>The Esports World Cup is set to return in 2025 in Riyadh. Over the next month or so, the EWC team will be announcing the full line-up of games appearing at the event, which is expected to top 2024’s showcase in every way possible. It’s the most valuable event in esports where sponsorship and prizes are concerned, and it’s a competitive ground for a staggering array of titles.</p>



<p>Here’s every game announced for the Esports World Cup 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-game-at-the-ewc-2025">Every Game at the EWC 2025</h2>



<p>This list is subject to evolve as the EWC team unveils more games, but here’s the full breakdown so far:</p>



<p><strong>Games Confirmed for Esports World Cup 2025:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li>



<li>Honor of Kings</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Warzone</li>



<li>Free Fire</li>



<li>Street Fighter 6</li>



<li>Dota 2</li>



<li>Rainbow Six Siege</li>
</ul>



<p>By the end of January, every game appearing at the Esports World Cup 2025 will have been announced.</p>



<p>The 2024 iteration of the Esports World Cup was a monumental event that saw tens of millions of dollars handed out in prizes. Some of the most prolific competitors in the esports world took to the stage in Riyadh, and despite concerns about the setting of the event, it managed to secure solid viewership worldwide.</p>



<p>I had a chance to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-ralf-reichert-esports-world-cup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview Ralf Reichert</a>, the CEO of the Esports World Cup Foundation, as the first EWC event came to a close:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can’t go into detail yet on what you can expect at future events, one thing to be sure of is our commitment to deliver a one-of-a-kind celebration of competitive excellence and gaming culture for our global fans. We’ve set a new standard, and it’s our responsibility to raise it going forward.</p>



<p>All this is part of Vision 2030 and how Saudi has embraced a forward-looking attitude that creates a perfect home for the Esports World Cup. There is long-term thought here that makes me very optimistic about the future of gaming and esports in Saudi Arabia and the MENA region as a whole.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games is hard at work preparing the next major update for Escape from Tarkov. In a series of images uploaded on social media, the team revealed snapshots of the ‘Customs rework’, an overhaul being made to what many consider to be Tarkov’s most popular map.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed when the Customs rework will drop, but it’s expected that it’ll arrive in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-escape-from-tarkov-wipe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next Tarkov wipe</a>, due to drop later this month.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-overhauled">Overhauled</h2>



<p>Customs is an extremely popular map in Escape from Tarkov, as it’s often the first environment most players will come to explore when they pick up the game. It’s the host of several early-game tasks, and it has some great PvP engagement areas as well as a couple of boss encounters that make for high XP, high loot runs.</p>



<p>In a series of images uploaded on social media, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov revealed some of the updates being made to Customs.</p>



<p>It started with a shot of a much more detailed and immersive ‘New Gas’ interior, and then hours later, Buyanov showed some new interiors showing remarkable attention to detail.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Recently, the team at Battlestate Games overhauled Factory, taking the small-form map that had existed for almost a decade and turning it into something much more expansive and complex. It became ten times more detailed overnight, with the update adding much more verticality and depth to the iconic map.</p>



<p>In recent years, the squad at BSG has been working to expand and alter almost every map in the game, and it’s all in preparation for Tarkov launching as a full-release game, in ‘1.0’. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/league-of-legends-card-game-project-k/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Riot Games has unveiled a League of Legends TCG that’s going by the name Project K. In a four-minute video uploaded today, the team introduced Project K, marketing it as a ‘League IP game that we think deeply serves the need of a different kind of audience’. It’s set to feature recognisable locations, characters, and abilities pulled straight from the League universe.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-to-the-table">To The Table</h2>



<p>Project K is an ambitious game that Riot Games dubbed ‘the best social TCG out there and something that you will really enjoy’. It’s designed to be played with a group in an ideal world, but one-on-one gameplay is also entirely supported.</p>



<p>The team envisions a competitive ecosystem that starts at the grassroots level but escalates to global tournaments.</p>



<p>In the introduction video, the team said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We want to get cards into everyone’s hands as soon as possible. But we do want to ensure that wherever you live, you have the best experience from your day one, including that competitive ecosystem and of course, cards and accessories in your language.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Project K will launch first in China, with Riot Games having already identified a manufacturer and distributor in the region. The English versions of the launch box set will be available to pre-order later this year. </p>

</p></figure>







<p>Admittedly, the introduction video was light on the gameplay details, which is uncharacteristic for a TCG that intends to launch internationally within a few months. And of course, many fans were quick to make comparisons to Legends of Runeterra – which surfaces in Project K in some artistic decisions.</p>

<p>Electronic Arts has once again made good on a promise to support inclusivity and accessibility in the games industry. Recently, the company unlocked 23 patents tied to accessibility, including speech recognition and photosensitivity innovations. In 2021, the team pledged to share in-house technology with the wider industry.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sharing-is-caring">Sharing is Caring</h2>



<p>On December 5, Electronic Arts made 23 patents open-source, making them available to third-party developers operating outside of EA. These patents mostly concern speech-based technology and testing tools that recognise photosensitivity issues.</p>



<p>One key deliverable is an Unreal Engine 5 plugin that unlocks EA’s IRIS technology, an analytical tool that can help developers identify photosensitivity issues in their game while testing. It’s now free to use and open-source, which means developers are free to ‘play around’ with the software.</p>



<p>In a post <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/news/2024-accessibility-patent-pledge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on EA’s blog</a>, it was said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For years now, EA has strived to make gaming&nbsp;as inclusive as possible&nbsp;and to minimize barriers between our players and our shared love for video games. And today, in this spirit and following International Day of Persons with Disabilities we have added 23 accessibility-centered patents to our&nbsp;industry-first accessibility patent pledge. </p>



<p>Through this pledge, launched in 2021, we share our accessibility-related technology with the wider industry royalty-free, so that together we can work towards meeting the needs of our diverse gaming community at EA and beyond.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>IRIS works by identifying potential issues in a game such as flashing lights and sequences that could trigger something like an epileptic fit or seizure. It compares visuals against a simple baseline that tracks in real-time, assessing whether a sequence is a pass, warning, or fail. </p>



<p>Previously, EA has delivered patents focused on text issues, such as Fontikk, a tool that was open-sourced in 2022 that analyses text to determine its readability.</p>



<p>Do you think this is a good move by EA, or is it just a ploy to earn some positive PR? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Google Reveals AI Tech That Can Create Playable 3D Games in Seconds]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/google-genie-2-ai-tech-3d-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/google-reveals-ai-tech-that-can-create-playable-3d-games-in-seconds.1053597/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/google-genie-2-ai-tech-3d-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Google has unveiled Genie 2, a revolutionary AI-driven technology that can generate playable 3D environments based on image or text-based prompts in seconds, depending on the level of compute used. In a blog post, the DeepMind team shared footage of explorable worlds being traversed after being created by Genie 2 based on nothing but an initial text prompt.</p>



<p>It’s rudimentary at this stage, but it’s a direct evolution of Genie 1, which could generate 2D environments. It’s enough to make you wonder what Genie 3 might look like, that’s for sure.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-age-of-ai">The Age of AI</h2>



<p>Developers have been toying with AI for a while to <strong>aid </strong>game development, but Genie 2 goes one step further. This technology is a foundational step towards using AI to generate an entire game, as shown by the DeepMind team in a recent blog post.</p>



<p>In one clip, the team prompts Genie 2 to generate ‘a playable world driving a sailboat on a lake’, and although what follows is <span><strong>obviously</strong></span> an AI-generated segment, it’s exactly what the prompt asked for.</p>



<p>In another scene, it’s a robot running around a forest, and in another, it’s someone exploring an abandoned spaceship.</p>



<p>Here’s a description of <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Genie 2 from DeepMind</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Genie 2 is a&nbsp;<em>world model</em>, meaning it can simulate virtual worlds, including the consequences of taking any action (e.g. jump, swim, etc.). </p>



<p>It was trained on a large-scale video dataset and, like other generative models, demonstrates various emergent capabilities at scale, such as object interactions, complex character animation, physics, and the ability to model and thus predict the behavior of other agents.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s still limited, though. Genie 2 can only generate consistent worlds for up to 60 seconds. In the showcase, everything from racing gamers to platformers was explored, with Genie 2 going so far as to create interactable environments containing bursting balloons, working doors, and exploding barrels.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/deepmind.mp4"></video></figure>







<p>It can even accurately render reflections and directional lighting, and it can take a single shot of concept art and use it to bring that envisioned environment to life.</p>



<p>Is this technology dangerous or do you want to see more of it? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>Walmart might be trying to clear out its inventory of select video game-inspired mini fridges, because two of the coolest little coolers are now available for only $29 each. Minecraft fans can grab an officially licensed mini fridge modeled after the iconic Creeper mob from the game.

It originally had a rather ridiculous $168 asking price.

These run louder and aren't as good at chilling drinks, so they aren't as practical as real mini fridges. But for $29, these are pretty cool novelty devices, whether you wind up using them to store cans of Game Fuel or as little cabinets on your desk for storing accessories.</p><p>If you're interested in buying a themed mini fridge or thermoelectric cooler this holiday, Walmart has a number of other budget-friendly options that we've listed at the end of this article.</p><div title="[Various] Minecraft Mini Fridge" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2945" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Minecraft Mini Fridge" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/2670909566&amp;subId1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/goto.walmart.com\/c\/1804712\/565706\/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https:\/\/www.walmart.com\/ip\/2670909566&amp;subId1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/2670909566&amp;subId1=subid_value">Minecraft Creeper Mini Fridge (25 Inches, 8L)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/2670909566&amp;subId1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/goto.walmart.com\/c\/1804712\/565706\/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https:\/\/www.walmart.com\/ip\/2670909566&amp;subId1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/2670909566&amp;subId1=subid_value">$29 (was $168)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>This <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2670909566%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-minecraft-creeper-mini-fridge-is-on-sale-for-only-29-at-walmart%2F1100-6528276%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Minecraft Creeper</a> is 25.2 x 9.5 x 9.1 inches and has eight liters of storage capacity across its two compartments. You can store four 12 ounce cans of your favorite drink inside the Creeper's head and eight cans inside its hollow body. Both compartments have removable shelves, so taller, bottled drinks can be stored as well (just not as many).</p><p>If you're storing anything besides drinks, you'll want to keep the Creeper's cooling limitations in mind. It's capable of cooling up to 32 degrees Fahrenheit below ambient temperature. Depending on how cool you keep your home, the temperature inside the cooler might not get as low as it needs to be to safely store certain food and drink products. Kitchen refrigerators operate at 40 degrees or below.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/414202579&amp;subId1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/goto.walmart.com\/c\/1804712\/565706\/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https:\/\/www.walmart.com\/ip\/414202579&amp;subId1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/414202579&amp;subId1=subid_value">Xbox Series X Thermoelectric Cooler (14.4 Inches, 4.5L)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/414202579&amp;subId1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/goto.walmart.com\/c\/1804712\/565706\/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https:\/\/www.walmart.com\/ip\/414202579&amp;subId1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/414202579&amp;subId1=subid_value">$29 (was $70)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F414202579%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-minecraft-creeper-mini-fridge-is-on-sale-for-only-29-at-walmart%2F1100-6528276%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original Xbox Series X Mini Fridge</a> received less-than-stellar reviews when it released back in 2021. There were several reasons for this. Many Xbox fans thought it was a true mini fridge, not a thermoelectric cooler that resembles a mini fridge.</p><p>Also, be warned: it's quite loud--loud enough that there's a chance it'll annoy you enough to unplug it. It's also small, measuring in at 14.4 x 7.3 x 7.3 inches. For a frame of reference, the Xbox Series X console is 11.9 x 5.9 x 5.9 inches. The fridge has one door and 4.75L of storage space. You can snugly fit eight cans of Mountain Dew Game Fuel inside.</p><p>It has one removable shelf that can be placed in two slots: in the center if you plan on storing cans, or at the top if you want to place bottled drinks inside. It also has a small basket on the interior door for storing.... something. Just like with the Creeper, be careful with perishable food and drink products, as this one is limited to 36 degrees below room temperature, slightly worse than the Creeper.</p><p>The Xbox logo on the front of the fridge lights up just like the power button on the real console. It also has green LED lights on top that shine through the cooling grate.</p><p>The <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXBOX-3-2CF-1D-FRIDGE%2F3082591196%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-minecraft-creeper-mini-fridge-is-on-sale-for-only-29-at-walmart%2F1100-6528276%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2023 Xbox Series X Mini Fridge</a> is larger, operates as a real fridge, and runs quieter.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review.1053501/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been over 30 years since I wore out my VHS copy of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-1989-had-batman-ghostbusters-indiana-jones-freddy-and-more-and-the-box-office-was-never-the-same-again">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a>. Since then the film franchise has been in a state of escalation. Where do you go after uncovering the literal Holy Grail? Aliens, then time machines, apparently. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is the perfect antidote to all of this; one that uses its own figurative <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-review">Dial of Destiny</a> to propel us back in time to Indy’s prime. The result is easily one of the best Indy stories across both the games <em>and</em> the movies, with painstakingly detailed environments, wonderfully atmospheric tomb raiding and puzzle solving, a pitch-perfect score, and quite possibly the greatest punch sound effect in the business. While it does stumble occasionally as a stealth-focused sneak ’em up, The Great Circle is an otherwise grand and gorgeous globe-trotting adventure that left me giddy as a schoolboy. Yes, it’s true that bringing Indiana Jones back to the big screen (twice) after he literally rode off into the sunset was probably a poor choice. But having MachineGames craft an Indy experience inspired by all the best games in that development team’s past?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda chose wisely.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">MachineGames’ most immediate legacy is the modern Wolfenstein series, and there’s certainly some of that on show in The Great Circle. Like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/20/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review">The New Order</a> and its excellent prequel and sequel, The Great Circle is first-person and highly story-driven, and I’d wager if there’s anyone who hates Nazis as much as Indy, it’s the Gestapo-gutting, SS-slaying BJ Blazkowicz. The Great Circle is not, however, a bloodthirsty exercise in double-fisted, lead-flinging fury. Unlike Wolfenstein, The Great Circle’s focus is patient and slower-paced exploration and stealth – where guns are rarely (and barely) a viable option. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, with the founding members of MachineGames all hailing from fellow Swedish studio Starbreeze, MachineGames’ DNA admittedly runs much deeper than Wolfenstein. For many of the team, it dates back to 2004’s outstanding and highly acclaimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/05/29/the-chronicles-of-riddick-escape-from-butcher-bay">The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay</a>. Riddick’s first-person fisticuffs and adventure elements appear to have been a huge inspiration on The Great Circle, and it’s refreshing to be playing a game like Butcher Bay again – particularly when it’s done with this much verve and commitment to a storied franchise. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For clarity, I doubt anybody would’ve been shocked to see an Indiana Jones game in 2024 arrive as a clone of the blockbuster Uncharted series. It certainly wouldn’t have been unprecedented. After all, both 1999’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/12/16/indiana-jones-and-the-infernal-machine">Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine</a> and 2003’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/07/02/indiana-jones-and-the-emperors-tomb-3">Indiana Jones and the Emperor’s Tomb</a> both followed a fairly strict <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/10/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-review">Tomb Raider</a> template. Pivoting to pay tribute to the man who usurped Lara as the premier grave-robbing vagabond of modern video games would hardly have been surprising – particularly as games today have become increasingly homogenised overall.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Great Circle isn’t an Uncharted clone, and it’s all the better for it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But The Great Circle <em>isn’t</em> an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/30/uncharted-the-nathan-drake-collection-review">Uncharted</a> clone, and it’s all the better for it. It’s an Indiana Jones game I didn’t even know I wanted, and sometimes that’s the best surprise. I like highly cinematic, quality third-person shooters as much as the next man, but not <em>every </em>game needs to be one. And besides, you can do a lot worse than taking notes from Butcher Bay – another licensed tie-in with the extremely rare distinction of being even better than the film upon which it was based.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Genius of the Restoration</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The first-person perspective blesses The Great Circle with a fantastic sense of scale. Looking up in awe of the Great Pyramid – or staring out at a giant Nazi battleship perched atop a mountain in the Himalayas – simply has a more pronounced effect at eye-level. It also does wonders for immediacy, with puzzle solving in particular benefitting greatly. Picking up and poring over documents and clues, directly manipulating and placing objects, and watching the results unfold in front of your eyes makes it feel like you’re personally inside some of the world’s most expensive escape rooms. Puzzles come regularly, and they’re mostly light lifting, but I’ve encountered at least a couple of slightly curlier ones that left me smugly satisfied that I wasn’t stumped. If you do hit a roadblock, there’s a baked-in hint system that will only interject if you take an extra photo of the offending puzzle with your in-game camera. It’s a smart and courteous way of offering aid only when asked that will keep players off their phones and in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of this, it’s really the best showcase for the incredible amount of granular detail MachineGames has stuffed into seemingly every surface in The Great Circle. From streak marks on freshly wiped glass to the slow trickle of wax from a candle lighting your way down an ancient stairwell, these are things that wouldn’t be noticed from any other viewpoint. Are they entirely necessary to make The Great Circle a great game? Maybe not, but they <em>do </em>paint a picture of a project where no flourish is too small if they make the world look and feel even a <em>fraction </em>more authentic. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After beginning with a short flashback to Raiders of the Lost Ark as a tutorial – one that might’ve been a tad indulgent had it not been so utterly well done – The Great Circle’s second level is a wonderful (and equally nostalgic) trip through Connecticut’s Marshall College. It’s a magnificent rendition and draped in layers upon layers of bespoke details that distracted me constantly on my way to the objective. Busts and other paraphernalia related to the history of the school. Cabinets full of exotic items. Notice boards cluttered with handmade signs. If you’d shown this version of Indy’s famous school to the eight-year-old version of me who cut his teeth aimlessly point-and-clicking his way around Marshall College in 1989’s Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure, I might have had you burnt at the stake. Or at least lowered into a sacrificial lava pit without a heart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The eye-catching environments keep coming: The ornate Italian architecture and crusty catacombs of Vatican City; An ancient town and multiple Nazi dig sites in the shadow of the Egyptian pyramids and the Great Sphinx; Sukhothai’s winding waterways and flooded temples, which are being reclaimed by the jungle. It’s all excellent stuff, and bolstered by exemplary ray-traced lighting to boot. I love the huge contrasts between the levels, and “the great circle” as a fanciful archaeological concept is an admirably effective premise to justify Indy hopping all over the globe during a single story.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>David Shaughnessy's unerring version of Marcus Brody may go criminally unnoticed in Baker’s shadow.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The strength of that story here is one of The Great Circle’s true assets, and it’s been brought to life with some very impressive performances. For the most part, Troy Baker’s Harrison Ford impersonation is close to spot-on, and Baker’s otherwise distinct voice disappears in the role. Credit too must go to voice actor David Shaughnessy, whose unerring version of Denholm Elliot’s Marcus Brody may go criminally unnoticed in Baker’s shadow. This could have very much felt like a gimmick considering Elliot passed away back in 1992, but Brody’s small role feels meaningful and respectful, and not like a stunt. Marios Gavrilis also kills it as the slimy and sinister Nazi archaeologist Emmerich Voss; he spits his dialogue with such venom I imagine his microphone may have required a tiny umbrella. Most of the meaningful conversations occur in well-directed cutscenes, which are on par with those in modern Wolfenstein, albeit punctuated with an appropriate amount of slightly slapstick Indiana Jones humour when the fists start flying. There are basically <em>two movies</em> worth of cutscenes here, but it never felt like too much. This is Indy in his prime, and I’m on board for every extra minute of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a rule, the Indiana Jones series is always at its best when it involves a desperate race to track down an artifact before the Nazis can nab it for what they believe will be an unbeatable, world-conquering advantage. Those movies were video game fetch quests before video game fetch quests, and The Great Circle naturally embraces it, immediately beginning on the right foot by setting its action in 1937 – directly between the events of Raiders and The Last Crusade, as the world simmers towards the Second World War. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s honestly quite remarkable how convincingly The Great Circle fits into the hole between those two impeccable films, successfully exploiting the odd chronology of the original Indy trilogy. That goes far beyond just providing a little extra context on Indy’s separation from Marion Ravenwood, too. In fact, one of the greatest compliments I can pay The Great Circle is that it may well be the best Indiana Jones movie you’ve never seen. The music, too, is a victory on all fronts, and I love how in sync it feels with Raiders and The Last Crusade. I was especially thrilled to see The Great Circle crescendo to a showdown that follows tightly in the footsteps of both of those films – yet still managed to knock me out with a brilliantly unexpected twist.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Aid our own resuscitation</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On the topic of knockouts, combat in The Great Circle is satisfyingly brutal without being gratuitously violent, which is in keeping with its family-friendly, swashbuckling adventure serial roots. I love the deeply impressive sound design, which makes every strike sound like a golf club being slammed into a huge bunch of celery, and I love how visceral the fighting is in first-person. You block and parry blows with the correct timing, and deliver quick jabs and loaded up power punches. On top of that, Indy’s bullwhip can be used to quickly disarm enemies, and stun them long enough to either wade in and whack them or scoop up their dropped weapon and bludgeon them with it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I enjoy how Butcher Bay-adjacent the fighting is but I’m a little unconvinced by the stamina system that rules over it, which depletes as Indy exerts himself climbing, sprinting, and throwing hands. It just creates pauses throughout the action where you’ll be compelled to wait for a beat, or jog backwards as a gaggle of goose-stepping morons march towards you with their dukes up. I can’t really detect what it adds other than something to be arbitrarily upgraded to the point where it’s no longer an inconvenience.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat escalates with your actions so, if you do grab a gun and start blasting, expect all armed enemies in your vicinity to respond with hot lead of their own. Indy can’t survive this kind of barrage so, for the most part, the best thing to do is forget the firearms. This does, admittedly, create a bit of silliness if you stir up a large enemy response and park yourself anywhere your attackers need to climb to reach. You can, for instance, stand at the top of a ladder and clobber the crap out of everyone who climbs it for some time, and no one will figure out that they have guns and can simply shoot at you (on regular difficulty, at least). But you’d be colouring outside the lines here, playing like this. Indy doesn’t mind leaving bodies in his wake when necessary, but he’s not some moustache-twirling mass murderer. You can always fire up Wolfenstein if you need to get some of that out of your system.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Indy doesn’t mind leaving bodies in his wake, but he’s not some mass murderer.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">On the topic of guns, though, Indy’s personal revolver is sadly a big disappointment. I used it all of twice, but both were still total anticlimaxes. The first was an early boss battle where Indy’s pistol really should’ve been written out of the fight before the showdown began. After placing several bullets into a man’s unarmored head, it became clear that shooting this bloke wasn’t the way MachineGames intended me to clear this encounter. The second was late in the story, where I thought, ‘There’s no point rolling credits with revolver rounds in the cylinder!’ and figured I’d quickly plug two Nazis that suddenly appeared ahead of me in an open elevator. They simply took too many shots to go down. It seems like a weird fumble, when the scene of Indy actually using his pistol and taking out the Raiders swordsman in a <em>single shot</em> is one of the most memorable moments in the whole film franchise. Revolver rounds should absolutely remain exceedingly rare, but the pistol itself really should have shipped with the consistent stopping power of its cinematic counterpart. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also rarely feels logical that high-ranking enemies within the levels can automatically see through disguises, particularly in Vatican City. It <em>is </em>a mechanic I’m accustomed to thanks to the likes of Hitman, which I’ll be clear is another game I love, but it’s definitely a little sillier here. It really is total nonsense that a random Italian officer would physically attack a stranger who is, for all intents and purposes, a visiting priest. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is only a mild annoyance though and, to be fair, The Great Circle actually has a very smart approach to difficulty overall. There’s a lot more fiddling you can do than just adjust a single setting from easy to very hard. Enemy attributes are split into several categories, meaning you can tweak it so that there are tougher enemies, but fewer of them. Maybe you want to pump up their awareness, but make them weaker than wet newspapers. (This is something I think I may try for a second run.) It’s good that these options are here because, on regular difficulty, the stealth <em>is </em>quite basic; enemies have pretty limited vision and they’re easier to sneak past than I first assumed. I definitely became progressively less cautious once I realised I could sneak across seemingly dangerously open places as long as I did it fast enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, The Great Circle does allow us to return to previously visited locations to complete all the extra side missions, even after the main adventure is complete, so I may focus on that instead of starting over. I suspect I have many more hours of auxiliary objectives to keep me busy; I only got around to ticking off a handful of them on my first run through the story, which took me about 17 hours. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s based in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> IP and revolves around playing with friends in-person.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Riot said Project K is made by a “small” development team within the company led by game director Dave Guskin and executive producer Chengran Chai. It’s not publishing the game itself; rather, it’s found a publishing partner in China for an initial launch there in early 2025. A global launch is planned, however, and Riot is on the hunt for a publishing partner for the U.S. and other countries.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Riot said Project K is not a physical version of its existing digital collectible card game Legends of Luneterra, but "it does inherit some of the rich champion design philosophies of lore," and also benefits from art drawn from other League IP games. Riot added that it wants to create “a thriving community with a competitive ecosystem," and hopes for national and even global tournaments.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Project K Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Project K appears to be Rune Battlegrounds, which was teased earlier this year by Riot’s team in China. A trailer showed off popular League characters such as Darius, Ahri, and Miss Fortune. At the time, Riot said it had no plans for a global release, but those plans have now changed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a busy time for League, which has just wrapped up Netflix animated show <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/arcane-league-of-legends">Arcane</a> with the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arcane-season-2-act-iii-review-netflix-league-of-legends">Season 2</a>. As well as continued work on the hugely popular MOBA, League of Legends, it’s working on a League fighting game called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/2xko">2XKO</a>, and has a digital card game called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/legends-of-runeterra">Legends of Runeterra</a>. There’s a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/league-of-legends-mmorpg">League MMO</a> in the works, too, although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riots-league-of-legends-mmo-is-being-reset-likely-going-dark-for-several-years">Riot has indicated it will be some time before it's ready to show it off</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
