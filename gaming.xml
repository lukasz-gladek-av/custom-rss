The large Lego kit is priced at $170 and is made up of over 1,900 pieces. The new build recreates Mario in a go kart and features posable arms.

<p>Battlefield 6 Classes dictate how you approach every match. The franchise has notoriously stuck by the same few Classes throughout the years. EA’s early work on Classes for the 2025 Battlefield sequel has been revealed, and each one favors a particular playstyle.</p>



<p>The Class system has always helped Battlefield stand out from its competition. Whereas Call of Duty allows users to create bespoke loadouts—usually factoring in the best meta gear and equipment—Battlefield is more restrictive. DICE gives the community a small handful of Classes to pick, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> looks to be much the same in 2025.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs test</a> is an early pre-Alpha designed to test the game’s foundations. But <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-leaks-reveal-battlefield-4-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked gameplay footage</a> has already shed light on the direction the full Battlefield 6 release is heading.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-class-in-battlefield-6-revealed-so-far">Every Class in Battlefield 6 Revealed so far</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Is it the same Classes again? Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Leaked Battlefield 6 Labs footage reveals four familiar Classes: Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon.</strong></p>



<p>Like the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield</a> 2042 image I’ve posted above shows, Battlefield 6 looks to be a continuation of the popular Classes. Apart from Battlefield 1—which had Assault, Medic, Support, Scout, Pilot &amp; Tanker, Cavalry, and Elite Classes—most Battlefield games use the same Classes.</p>



<p>As we’ve covered, the Battlefield Labs pre-Alpha has already leaked. In-match gameplay footage clearly shows you can choose from Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon. This doesn’t mean these are the final Classes though: Everything is subject to change between a pre-Alpha and a full release.</p>



<h3 id="h-assault">Assault</h3>



<p>This is your typical Battlefield, on-foot infantry with automatic weapons designed to eliminate the opposition at close-to-medium distances. They get stuck in, offer limited healing properties, and are an all-round killer.</p>



<h3 id="h-engineer">Engineer</h3>



<p>An Engineer gets stuck into the technical and mechanical side of things. Repairing ally vehicles, sabotaging enemy vehicles, and using a full breadth of equipment to be as impactful as any other role.</p>



<h3 id="h-support">Support</h3>



<p>Your Support are your healers, the fastidious individuals scurrying around the Battlefield resupplying and restocking teammates. They can also hinder the enemy team with their unique equipment and are very important.</p>



<h3 id="h-recon">Recon</h3>



<p>If you prefer to engage at long distances, pick off enemies, and remain unseen, Recon is the way for you. The role is known for Sniper Rifles and players capable of highlighting and identifying threats for the rest of their team.</p>



<hr>



<p>There’s plenty of time between now and the full Battlefield 6 release. We know Battlefield Labs is a testing ground and nothing more. We’ll have to wait and see, but are you happy to see Battlefield 6 stick to the same four Classes? Or should the shooter be more ambitious?</p>

<p>As for what's next for Remedy and its Control series, the world is set to expand this year with the developer's multiplayer release, FBC: Firebreak.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">FBC: Firebreak is scheduled to release later this year</a>, across PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, Xbox Series X S and PlayStation 5. It will also be available across PC Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate, as well as day one onto the PlayStation Plus Game Catalogue, which is available for all Extra and Premium members.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-2-tease-lies-in-alan-wake-2s-lake-house-dlc-fans-say">Alan Wake 2's Lake House expansion last year provided what looks to be an intriguing tease for where Control 2's story is headed</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Control update has gone live today on PC, introducing a new ray tracing preset, official HDR support, NVIDIA DLSS updates, and more.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://controlgame.com/control-march-2025-update-notes-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.30 update</a> brings to all users content that was previously available only as a pre-order bonus, such as the Astral Dive Suit, the Tactical Response Gear, and the Urban Response Gear, as well as the Dr. Yoshimi Tokui's Guided Imagery Experience featuring voiceover by Hideo Kojima, which was only available as a PS4 Digital Deluxe Edition pre-order bonus.</p>
<p>Besides making pre-order exclusive content available to all, the new Control March 2025 PC update introduces plenty of technical improvements, such as a new ultra ray tracing preset which gets the user more rays per pixel and higher temporal stability, ultrawide resolution support up to 48:9 aspect ratio, updated SDR to 10 bits to reduce visible color banding, support for resolutions higher than 4K and more. Additionally, the new update also updates NVIDIA DLSS to version 3.7 with higher temporal stability and adds DLAA and arbitrary resolutions support, among other things.</p>
<p>The Control 1.30 update also finally brings official HDR support to the game, but <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-new-patch-for-remedys-control-just-dropped-adds-fake-hdr-despite-true-hdr-being-available-via-semi-official-mod.1129878/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to online reports</a>, it only caps the overall brightness value without adding additional highlight detail, so the<a href="https://wccftech.com/control-unofficial-hdr-ultrawide-patch-version-1-4-brings-hdr-and-dlss-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> unofficial implementation</a> still continues to be the way to go for those with HDR monitors.</p>
<p>Control is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One worldwide. <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-alan-wake-2-has-sold-1-8-million-units/">A sequel</a> is currently in the works, alongside a spin-off multiplayer game called FBC: Firebreak, which will launch<a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/"> later this year.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-1m-48-hours<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and Hazelight Studios' new co-op action-adventure platformer&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has reached a major sales milestone, the two studios have announced, and it only took the game a measly two days to get there.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hazelightgames.bsky.social/post/3ljztto3sws2v" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Hazelight's Bluesky page,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>managed to sell a million copies within its first 48 hours, which is a pretty impressive milestone. Hazelight says it's "beyond happy" with the result and that it "can't stop enjoying [fans'] amazing reactions".</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction</em>'s strong performance probably shouldn't come as a surprise given that it was EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-ea-second-most-played-game-steam" rel="nofollow">second most-played game of all time on Steam</a> just a day or so after its release, losing out only to battle royale shooter&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>(and I can't exactly blame it on that score).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-sales-1m-sci-fi.jpg?itok=kYAo-5hT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-sales-1m-sci-fi.jpg?itok=EV7NyvLS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has done pretty well for EA and Hazelight sales-wise.</figcaption></figure><p>For context, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-takes-two-sales-hit-1-million-copies-in-month" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">took around a month</a> for&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>to reach the same milestone. That game would go on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">sell more than 20 million copies</a> at last count, so it's entirely possible that&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>will do even better for itself.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's the latest game from&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight Studios.</p>

<p>Like the studio's previous games (with the exception of&nbsp;<em>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</em>),&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>can only be played as a co-op game; there's no single-player mode here, since the story and gameplay both revolve heavily around two individuals.</p>

<p>However, if you do happen to want to try out the game, the Friend's Pass <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay" rel="nofollow">means you can play it with anyone on any platform</a>, whether they own the game or not (as long as you do, of course).</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001120/Split_Fiction/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/split-fiction/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/split-fiction/9N1WXXD1RL8D" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

Lego has revealed a new Mario Kart Lego set today, March 10, with almost 2,000 pieces and an "18+" age recommendation, arriving on May 15, 2025. It's available to <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wXvkb?object_uuid=dd9b580c-ead5-4882-b0b5-bf79e0f3a7d8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">preorder now at the LEGO Store</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally spotted <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-new-lego-mario-kart-set-aimed-at-adults-has-appeared-online-ahead-of-an-official-announcement/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">popping up on some store listings</a>, Lego has officially unveiled the set, which includes both Mario and his Standard Kart from the Mario Kart series. It's a detailed model, meant for display and decor, with a special stand meant to showcase Mario and his kart at various angles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/mario-kart-mario-standard-kart-72037" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lego's site</a>, the company clocks the Mario Kart build at 1,972 pieces with a recommended "18+" Ages rating. This is due to the complexity of the build, it seems, and the intention of the product versus sets meant for play. "This building kit is part of a large assortment of LEGO Sets for Adults designed for people who enjoy hands-on creative activities to relax," Lego said in its description.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Here we go! 🏆 Launching May 15th 🏁 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LEGOSuperMario?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#LEGOSuperMario</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarioKart?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MarioKart</a> <a href="https://t.co/NZ13sCIFHo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/NZ13sCIFHo</a></p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1899083988142092785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The tenor of this build certainly seems aimed at the older, "advanced" builder of Lego. It also works with the Lego Builder app, which offers in-app building instructions and tools that let builders zoom and rotate around a 3D image of the model as they build. The final result is a posable, Lego-made Mario in his Kart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lego and Mario have built up a solid relationship over the years, with the collaboration resulting in numerous crossover sets. There's the Lego Super Mario line, which erred more on the side of interactive play and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-super-mario-is-great-once-it-clicks">incorporated some game elements into its set design</a>.</p><div catalogid="c504915f-8be6-46c4-874c-f7103df9f4c4" id="216537"><div id="216537" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Mario Kart – Mario &amp; Standard Kart</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, some other options were aimed more at the older crowd who might like to build for relaxation and display over interactivity, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/my-first-adult-lego-purchase-was-this-mario-set-and-i-have-no-regrets">the Pirahna Plant</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-super-mario-world-mario-yoshi">the Lego Super Mario World set featuring Mario and Yoshi</a>. Some offer activities for the kids, while others offer nostalgia and complex builds for the adults.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lego Mario Kart build is up for pre-order now, at a price point of $169.99 / £139.99 / €169.99. The set will fully launch on May 15, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Mar 10, 2025 2:40 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I did everything except the music and some other sound effects for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Extreme Evolution</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which were composed and recorded by DL Salo.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What's your background in making games?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is my 4th standalone game and the follow-up to the</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Space Hole </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">trilogy. Before my own games, I made mods especially on the Source (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Half Life 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) engine (I generally made level pack style single-player mods).&nbsp;I've got a background in general software, so I approach game development from a holistic/ synergistic approach (i.e. mix tech and design).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you come up with the concept for </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Extreme Evolution: Drive to Divinity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It started as a vague project called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flesh</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which was going to be more of a horror game about an organism seeking humanity through the mechanical accumulation of human parts.&nbsp;It was a brain in a void, and the game would have been in first person, with real-life footage of hands/organs as the tools you use. These tools would be used to, for example, paddle your hand to swim the psychic-brain around.&nbsp;Accumulation and the imitation of humanity were themes; but it was more body horror.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What development tools were used to build your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity, chatGPT, VSCode, Blender (lightly for certain 3d), Unity ProBuilder (the majority of custom 3d meshes), Paint.NET, Davinci Resolve, Audacity, and my camera phone! I take videos/photos of natural patterns, such as waves or light reflecting on water, or fire, and loop those in the video editor (by flipping and tessellating the videos).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Extreme Evolution: Drive to Divinity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> explores many different forms of movement as you explore its dizzying visual landscapes. What thoughts went into creating the various ways players could evolve to move around? What made a form of movement feel interesting to you to include in the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One core design idea for the game was "a platformer where every pickup extends your range."&nbsp; The main design idea here was to begin stumbling—a speck of dust or a pebble rolling/shambling—and by the end to be a maximally-empowered platformer (i.e., fling yourself, drive up walls, hang in the air indefinitely etc). So, a lot of the form design derived from trying to find a middle ground between "can go anywhere" and "can only tumble along the ground."&nbsp; The name "Extreme Evolution" alludes to this: starting at the most basic (a clunky, oblong egg) and eventually the most obscene (Deity, a hovering orb that spits out projectiles that seek pickups and count as part of your body). "Drive to Divinity" is also a reference to this, and another literal description of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Movement often comes with unique shapes that feel alien, but also convey some of their capabilities to the player through shape and form. What thoughts went into making movement feel somewhat clear while also keeping things mysterious?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For this, I think the key is to make the rules of the world consistent and to use visual cues to explain how objects interact. Furthermore, I have a short flavor text for each form, which, when combined with its name, was intended to convey some efficient expectation to the player. For example, "Cor" is "the oblong car," and it is both a corrupted motorcycle and a corruption of the word "Car."&nbsp; But as is the case in nature, the "Car" remains around in the world as well. I wanted the world to have a sense of logic and consistency to it, as well as a mix of earth-references and references that seem alien.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You put a great deal of thought and work into the visuals of your games, crafting this sense of moving through higher realities of color and shape. What feelings were you looking to evoke in the player with the cosmic visual work in this game?&nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My goal is to create an environment that you haven't seen before. I think the fun of the game is a repeating cycle of "what's over there?" and following intuition. I want to encourage the player to feel in control of their experience. I make games essentially by playing through them extremely slowly, making the levels in front of me as I go. So, whichever game I make tends to represent my feelings during development, or the feeling that I wanted.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into birthing this whole new visual cosmic universe? How do you craft whole worlds to platform in that capture this sense of being otherworldly and alien through your use of color and shape?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Iteration, willingness to cut ideas/areas, and gradually narrowing the focus of my work as a level progresses. It takes many, many coats of paint (and sometimes major cuts) to make sure each zone has a good feeling.&nbsp; For this game, the whole overall thing was "playable" a year before release in an alpha form, but everything went through major revisions following that.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Basically, I become more focused/editorial as I get deeper into development, but every level starts with some kind of simple idea (for example, "Thyroid" was conceived as "Jump," a delta where you are given many exits to choose between; the name "Thyroid" was chosen due to the geographical notion of the thyroid as a gateway to the body from the head). Sometimes, the name of the level is a remnant of that original idea and separate from the actual level (which sometimes is funny, so I leave it in). Often, levels become most extreme at some middle point in development—the most visual elements, the most pickups, etc. Then, over time, like a sine wave, I cut/uncut stuff until it feels right.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What challenges do you face in creating visuals that can be so powerful they border on overwhelming? What is it like to pore over these visions as you weave them together while developing the game?&nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I like to develop the game intuitively, so the border between "too much" and the right amount is always revealed only by the end of the project (but really, many years after).&nbsp;I also will sometimes revert to an earlier version but keep a single element from the newer (cut) revision, resulting in a hybrid that is mostly the old but with some specific improvement. I also have learnt to be sensitive (and un-offended) to the way people respond to visuals; people respond in a very specific way (they avoid playing) if it's making them nauseous, so I do mix my own feelings with the (sometimes visceral) player reactions. If you go too far everywhere, it also reduces the sense of change when entering spaces that are more or less intense.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You have put in some systems to help players who may have difficulties or health issues that are affected by the game's visuals, but they cannot be turned all the way off. What ideas go into balancing the need to protect the player with preserving the vital visual style of </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Extreme Evolution: Drive to Divinity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think of accessibility as a natural tool to make games better. I think it's absolutely a balance; another element of this issue (ensuring people don't have a physically painful experience playing the game) is to represent the game as accurately as possible in marketing materials. And, while you can turn lots of the effects off, there is a limit because I wanted to make sure every version of the game at least emphasized the separation of foreground and background.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using the Mod menu (unlocked about an hour into the game) you can go further into untested effects. However, because of the large amount of complex color correction, there are cases where turning an effect off might result in the ground and sky being too close in color. The major effect which produces nauseous feelings in my game is using uncleared buffers; this results in pixels which can change each frame as their behavior becomes so unpredictable. To balance this, I've tried blurring in the past, but now I use blur (and motion blur) as sparingly as possible because I find it tends not to be worth its nauseousness-to-budget, so to speak.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The representation of nothingness as infinitely-complex static feels too perfect and fitting for the game and the game's themes (nothingness/everythingness) to not be on by default in my mind, but I also have no qualms about the idea that some future playerbase might prefer it off. Ownership and setting your own goals is an intention of the game. I mostly focus on making sure the geometry of the level still reads and making sure the default modes reflect what I personally prefer when enabling accessible graphics options. I'm happier with how I've managed the accessibility features in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Extreme Evolution</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> over </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Space Hole 2020</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but it's something I spend a lot of time thinking about for future projects.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Call of Duty's original Verdansk map is set to return on 3rd April.</p>
<p>Activision shared the news on social media, adding "it's time to revisit a place of unforgettable memories".</p>
<p>The map return will coincide with Season 3 of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone, as a celebration of Warzone's fifth anniversary.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-warzones-classic-verdansk-map-returning-next-year">return of Verdansk was revealed last year</a> - it's the original map for the battle royale that's no longer available.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-season-delayed-verdansk-return-now-expected-next-month">Activision announced a delay to Season 3 last week</a>, which was widely expected to include the Verdansk map. Now it's officially confirmed.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>As we celebrate Call of Duty: Warzone’s 5 Year Anniversary, it's time to revisit a place of unforgettable memories 🪂</p><p>Verdansk returns to Call of Duty: Warzone on April 3 💥 <a href="https://t.co/Ot7i77VOtd">pic.twitter.com/Ot7i77VOtd</a></p></div>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1899083215802904607?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Verdansk's return follows a similar move from Epic with the return of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s classic OG map, which resulted in its highest-ever player count of 44.7 million participants in 24 hours. It's now a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">permanent addition to Fortnite</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-is-doing-a-fortnite-and-bringing-back-its-original-island-map">PUBG also brought back its original map</a>, Erangel.</p>
<p>It's hoped this new season can turn around the fortunes of Call of Duty so far this year.</p>
<p>Ahead of the second season's launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-bans-another-136000-cheaters">Activision stated it was dealing with rampant cheating</a>, acknowledging cheaters "are frustrating and severely impact the experience for our community".</p>
<p>Before that, the company was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-block-ops-6-players-accuse-activision-of-using-ai-slop">accused of using "AI slop"</a> following artwork of a six-fingered zombie Santa.

            <p>A concept album for the now-cancelled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/earthblade">Earthblade</a> from the studio behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/celeste">Celeste</a> has been released by composer Lena Raine.</p>
<p>Back in January, Extremely OK Games cancelled its "2D explor-action" game, which would have followed up the widely celebrated platformer Celeste.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-devs-show-first-look-at-earthblade">first look at Earthblade</a> was shown in December 2022 at The Game Awards, but nothing has been shown since. As such, this new album from Raine provides a taste of what we could have expected.</p>

<p>Raine worked on the soundtracks of Minecraft, Celeste and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/guild-wars-2">Guild Wars 2</a>, as well as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a> and Chicory: A Colorful Tale.</p>
<p>Earthblade - Across the Bounds of Fate is available to listen to on <a href="https://radicaldreamland.bandcamp.com/album/earthblade-across-the-bounds-of-fate">Bandcamp</a> and can be purchased in full for $7.</p>
<p>It's typical of Raine's style, particularly with the focus on striking melody and a mixture of electronic and real instruments. The beautiful track Verdant Mysteries includes a strange vocal too, while the eight-minute long Lineage is a mesmeric piano piece and the opening Accept Your Fate begins with Vangelis-esque chords before a mournful tone takes over.</p>
<p>"[Earthblade] was in development for a number of years, and over that period of time I wrote quite a few pieces - both conceptual, and implemented tracks - that began to depict the world of the game," wrote Raine in the album's description. "Because we'll never get a chance to tell that story in game form, I decided to cobble together every bit of music I'd written for the game to the point of its cancellation in order to tell my own version of it.</p>
<p>"Across the Bounds of Fate, more so than a soundtrack, is a concept album. The music I wrote for the game is highly dynamic, in the tradition of what I wrote for Celeste. I took it many steps beyond, in ways that temporally-constrained pieces of music can't really do justice. But I did my best to arrange them into the emotional arc of their progression, much like I would for any soundtrack release."</p>
<p>Raine's inspiration includes the aforementioned Vangelis (best known for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a>), as well as Joe Hisaishi's score for Studio Ghibli's Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, and Yoko Kanno's work on animes Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell.</p>
<p>Said Raine: "For now, tuck in and enjoy around 30 minutes of music that paint the picture of what I hoped Earthblade might be."</p>
<p>Extremely OK Games studio director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-studio-cancels-2d-explor-action-game-earthblade-nearly-four-years-after-its-announcement">Maddy Thorson called the cancellation of Earthblade</a> a "huge, heartbreaking, and yet relieving failure".</p>
<p>One factor leading to the cancellation was a disagreement about the IP rights of Celeste between Thorson and Noel Berry on one side, and studio founding member Pedro Medeiros on the other.</p>
<p>However, Thorson stressed "Pedro isn't to blame", adding: "In fact the split with him has given us the clarity to see that we have lost our way, and the opportunity to admit defeat. I feel many ways about it, but one big feeling is undoubtedly relief."</p>
<p>Thorson and Berry are now prototyping again for a new project. In the meantime, we have Raine's score as a lasting reminder of what Earthblade could have been.</p>
<p>"Melody encompasses so much of how I relate to music that it's hard for me to just write a piece that sinks solely into texture and rhythm. I do it, obviously, but I'm always humming something on top," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-composer-lena-raine-on-her-musical-style-im-a-big-fan-of-musical-metaphor">Raine told Eurogamer in a discussion about her compositional style</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>I did it. I made it through the week with the kids! Honestly, it was a blast. I've made a habit of taking a picture of the three of us before my wife arrives back home whenever we have weeks like this, and now it's turned into this really beautiful timeline of my kids growing up. It makes me feel a lot better than re-watching <em>Interstellar</em> did over the weekend. (The <em>tears.)</em> Great movie, nonsensical plot, who cares?

One of these apparently included a Scooby-Doo theme complete with mini-figures, sound effects, and an “incredibly elaborate” PowerPoint presentation.</p><p>“It was <em>Scooby-Doo and The Haunting of Merkmiss Manor</em>, and they had to go and figure out who the Merkmiss monster was, and unmask a bunch of local townspeople, and then clearly they weren’t the real villains,” he told Semafor. “It was evil Lyle Blackwood who was trying to steal the Blackwood fortune.”</p><p>It’s unclear exactly how much of that particular session was made with the help of AI, but Cocks said he believes AI is “supercharging fandom” and will be “a great leveler for user-generated content” in the future. He also sees financial upsides for Hasbro. Possible examples mentioned by <em>Semafor</em> are “subscription services letting other Dungeon Masters enrich their D&amp;D campaigns, or offerings to let parents customize Peppa Pig animations.”</p><p>This isn’t the first time Cocks has praised the possibilities for generative AI in the toy and gaming space. “I’m probably more excited, though, about the playful elements of AI,” he said <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://futurism.com/hasbro-ceo-ai-dungeons-dragons&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://futurism.com/hasbro-ceo-ai-dungeons-dragons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during a Goldman Sachs conference last year</a></span>. “I play with probably 30 or 40 people regularly. There’s not a single person who doesn’t use AI somehow for either campaign development or character development or story ideas. That’s a clear signal that we need to be embracing it.”</p><p>In the past, Cocks pointed to having ChatGPT help with scripts and Bing’s image generator create the art. It seems like it’s only a matter of time before Hasbro is trying to sell <em>D&amp;D</em> versions of those features directly to players. “We can leverage all of that to be able to build very interesting and compelling use cases for AI that can bring our characters to life,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://venturebeat.com/games/how-hasbro-is-jumping-on-the-game-opportunity-chris-cocks-interview/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://venturebeat.com/games/how-hasbro-is-jumping-on-the-game-opportunity-chris-cocks-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said last fall</a></span>. “We can build tools that aid in content creation for users or create really interesting gamified scenarios around them.”</p><p>That philosophy appears to be on a collision course with the current official stance by Wizards of the Coast’s D&amp;D team, which currently bans the use of AI in generating final products. “For 50 years, D&amp;D has been built on the innovation, ingenuity, and hard work of talented people who sculpt a beautiful, creative game,” the team wrote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://dnd-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/26243094975252-Generative-AI-art-FAQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://dnd-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/26243094975252-Generative-AI-art-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a 2023 statement</a></span>. “That isn’t changing. Our internal guidelines remain the same with regards to artificial intelligence tools: We require artists, writers, and creatives contributing to the D&amp;D TTRPG to refrain from using AI generative tools to create final D&amp;D products. We work with some of the most talented artists and creatives in the world, and we believe those people are what makes D&amp;D great.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Death Stranding 2 On The Beach is the sequel from the mind of Hideo Kojima. Its release date was finally confirmed, and if you want to hear more about the follow-up, we’ve got the main details you need to know.</p>



<p>Hideo Kojima springs to mind when I think of auteurs across any medium of media. He’s produced and directed games featuring over-the-top mecha combat, hallway-based horror, and most notably strategic stealth and surrealism. Death Stranding was arguably his most “out there” work to date, and Death Stranding 2’s release will inevitably try to one-up it.</p>



<p>With a stellar cast and even a curious homage to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-luca-marinelli-solid-snake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solid Snake</a>, let’s check the latest on one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-playstation-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest PS5 releases</a> coming soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-coming-out">When is Death Stranding 2 On The Beach Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No words. Credit to Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Death Stranding 2 On The Beach has a June 26 release date—making it one of the Summer’s biggest launches if it meets its announced release date.</strong></p>



<p>Originally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2 was a rumor</a>. The worst-kept secret became official at The Game Awards 2024. Screenshots, trailers, and gameplay have been shown off periodically over the last several years, but a release date was notably lacking.</p>



<p>This was until Kojima Productions unveiled an official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2 release date</a>. It was great news, and fans also got to see the full extent of the action title’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-colelctors-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Collector’s Edition</a>.  </p>



<h2 id="h-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-platforms">Death Stranding 2 On The Beach Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>A <strong>Death Stranding 2 On The Beach</strong></strong> <strong>PlayStation 5 exclusive launch is happening, with PC, Xbox, and any other platforms having to miss out for now.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a rare PlayStation-only launch. Exclusives are seemingly coming few and far between in 2025. Death Stranding 2 On The Beach can only be purchased on its June 26 release date for PS5.</p>



<p>But all is not lost if you’re a PC player without a PS5 console. The original Death Stranding was one of a few PlayStation-exclusive titles that eventually came to PC. Sony has made a habit of releasing its recent library of exclusives on PC—exposing titles to a wider audience, and making more money.</p>



<p>Meaning, <strong>a Death Stranding 2 On The Beach PC port is not out of the question</strong> a year or two from now.</p>



<h2 id="h-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-editions-amp-price">Death Stranding 2 On The Beach Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>You must choose between Death Stranding 2 On The Beach’s Standard Edition ($69.99/£79.99), Deluxe Edition ($79.99/£79.99), and Collector’s Edition ($229.99/£249.99).</strong></p>



<p>Look at each Death Stranding 2 edition below, and see which one is the one for you.</p>

<hr>



<p>Death Stranding 2 On The Beach is without doubt one of the biggest games (on paper) in 2025. Expect more to be added as it looks to shake the reputation of being a walking simulator. Are you picking up the sequel? What did you think of the OG Death Stranding? Let us know.</p>

Compared to the smaller-scale Mario Kart playsets for kids that launched in January, the finished build has a lot more detail. This is the most realistic recreation of the mustachioed character's modern design--his head and arms are posable--and the kart looks ripped straight from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.</p><p dir="ltr">The completed model measures in at approximately 12.5 inches long, 7.5 inches wide, and 8.5 inches tall. The set can be displayed flat or at a drifting angle with the included, buildable display stand.</p><p dir="ltr">Like other Nintendo display models, Mario &amp; Standard Kart comes with a physical instruction booklet and support for an interactive guide in the Lego Builder app on iOS and Android. With the free app, you can watch each step of the build process in 3D and manipulate the diagram to look at the work-in-progress from any angle you desire.</p></div>                      </div><p dir="ltr">The new display model will bring the total number of Mario Kart-themed Lego sets to six. As mentioned, the five existing building kits are playsets geared toward kits. Mario's Standard Kart is one of those five kits, though the $20 build is substantially smaller and less detailed at just 174 pieces.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the six retail sets, there's a <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D13923%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2FMario-Kart--Toad-Pit-Crew-30702&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2F1972-piece-lego-mario-kart-display-model-revealed-on-mario-day%2F1100-6530000%2F%3Fftag%3Dcad-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Store-exclusive Toad Pit Crew figure set</a> that's available through March 11 to all customers who <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D13923%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fthemes%2Fsuper-mario&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2F1972-piece-lego-mario-kart-display-model-revealed-on-mario-day%2F1100-6530000%2F%3Fftag%3Dcad-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spend $40 or more on Lego Super Mario sets</a>.
