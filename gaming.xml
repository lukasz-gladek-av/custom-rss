<p>In a flagrant travestying of the whole sequel concept, Greedfall 2 actually begins three years <em>before</em> the first game's events, and casts you as a grizzled native of the island of Teer Fradee, who has been uprooted and taken to the continent of Gacane. In this rotten imperial heartland ravaged by plague, war and factional disputes, you'll fight, talk and scheme your way to freedom while trying to head off some arsehole who wants to conquer the universe. </p>
<p>"Experience the unique world of GreedFall again by exploring the old continent!" expounds Monsieur Press Release. "Travel across new landscapes, from Olima - the city of stars of the Bridge Alliance - to the shores of Uxantis, and uncover the secrets of these ancient lands." Bridges and cities aside, there are companion characters to accessorise, befriend, seduce, turn into rivals, and play as during combat. We can also expect "an even deeper RPG experience" with story paths ranging from being diplomatic to being manipulative to being a sneaky mass-murderer.</p>
<p>I didn't play a whole lot of the original Greedfall - I think I got as far as boarding a ship for Teer Fradee and being sat on by a very unreasonable tree. RPS reviewer Astrid Johnson (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/greedfall-review">likened it to BioWare's creations</a>, especially Dragon Age and Mass Effect, but found that it wasn't on par with either. She was moderately tickled by the game's real-time-with-tactical-pausing combat, and confessed herself a fan of the outfits, too, despite the "unforgivable crime" of not being able to pop a feather in her tricorn hat.</p>
<p>Asrid was much less sold on the setting, however, commenting that "it's either standard historical fantasy, or it's so bogged down in cultural stereotypes that it all just feels a bit overdone." Khee Hoon Chan had more to say on the subject in <a href="https://www.vg247.com/greedfalls-rpg-framework-exacerbates-colonialist-impulses">a piece for VG247</a>, observing that Spiders are trying to have their cake and eat it by critiquing European colonialism at the level of the writing while nonetheless inviting you to make the entire island your oyster. I'm cautiously interested to learn how Spiders might address that by recasting you as a Teer Fradee native, hollowing out the imperial centre. I suspect the same old contradictions are in play, but let's see.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-outlast-trials-announces-brand-new-killer-and-map/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Outlast Trials is a great game to experience horror full of blood, scares, and survival horror elements with friends. Whether you play it alone, with friends, or with other people waiting in the lobby is up to you. This game has been incredibly popular in the horror scene since its release, and there is now a brand new killer on the loose to keep the game fresh.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outlast-trials-the-rich-mans-lethal-company/">This game</a> is already home to some truly iconic killers that are sure to haunt your dreams, but the latest killer to be teased for The Outlast Trials is said to be "the most depraved killer yet."</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eADhlVfwAg4">the trailer</a> released by Red Barrels doesn't seem to show off too much, it does show that Franco "Il Bambino" Barbi is a heavily infantilized killer who has a deep fascination with everything to do with childbirth and the miracle of life.</p>
<p>Franco "Il Bambino" Barbi is a deeply perverse, gun-wielding man-child who is the outcast of a Mafia don. The trailer was announced on July 10, and the YouTube video description promises that more content will be released today.</p>
<p>Before Il Bambino's release, the game's killers predominantly used melee weapons to catch their victims. Aside from the latest killer to join the sadistic family, the only other killer to use some ranged weaponry is The Pusher. They utilize a gas that turns the victim insane and requires an antidote to resolve the issue. Additionally, The Screamer disorients the player by screaming loudly when anyone comes near them, which alerts other enemies to your presence.</p>
<p>This brand-new map takes you to the docks, where Franco has a giant drug manufacturing domain full of trickery and difficult puzzles to bypass. This domain is where this freakish new killer takes all of his victims and infantilizes them until they are down to his level.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Outlast Trials - Franco &quot;Il Bambino&quot; Barbi | New Villain Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eADhlVfwAg4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With Franco Barbi's intense fascination for doing experiments on pregnant women, it takes The Outlast Trials to a brand new horrifying low with this new killer. Players will experience a new level of madness and disgust as they become far too well acquainted with this killer.</p>
<p>This new update brings a lot of new content to The Outlast Trials. The new killer and new map are part of a huge update titled "Project Lupara," which will be released on July 16. Alongside the killer and map that are being introduced into the game, we get to see a new game mode being added to The Outlast Trials.</p>
<p>The game mode is called "Escalation Therapy," and players can participate in a rogue-lite game mode in which they have to go through several randomized trials with various variations until they eventually succumb to a Permadeath.&nbsp; Like any rogue-lite, the longer you survive, the bigger the reward!</p>
<p>The developers are calling it a huge overhaul to make the game more fun and exciting, with more thrills around every corner. From new cosmetics being introduced to new daily and weekly tasks that allow you to get rewards for completion and the introduction of difficulty settings for players who are new and masterful, The Outlast Trials is changing for the better.</p>

All of the content featured in the mod is based off of a leaked demo of <em>Van Buren</em>, as well as extensive design documents for the game that eventually came to light. The mod has been playable as a work-in-progress for Patreon backers, but a massive new update to <em>Fallout Yesterday </em>has now prompted a full release on Nexus Mods. The update introduces countless features, including more than 100 new items and weapons and numerous quests, which take place in environments like the Hoover Dam, a prominent locale in the much-more-official installment in the series, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-things-never-say-fan-bethesda-xbox-1851467599&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-things-never-say-fan-bethesda-xbox-1851467599"><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a></span>.While it is only as finished as a canceled game <em>can </em>be, <em>Fallout Yesterday </em>now appears to be essentially content complete.</p><p>That’s because <em>New Vegas</em>, developed at now-Microsoft-owned Obsidian Entertainment, was led by Josh Sawyer, an RPG developer who worked on <em>Van Buren </em>during his time at Black Isle Studios. <em>Van Buren </em>would’ve followed a prisoner who managed to escape in the American Southwest, and whose journey included interactions with Caesar’s Legion, a notable faction featured in <em>New Vegas</em>. Despite borrowing some elements from the canceled game, <em>New Vegas </em>is mostly its own thing and features original characters and storylines developed by Sawyer and his team.<br></p><p>Though <em>Van Buren </em>never officially saw the light of day, it’s clearly haunted the series ever since its cancellation in 2003. We don’t often learn much about canceled games due to the industry’s penchant for secrecy, but <em>Van Buren </em>flies in the face of that standard. It’s great to see how much the <em>Fallout </em>fan base clearly cares for this game if they’ve gone so far as to unofficially resurrect a game that’s been dead for decades.</p><p>More <em>Fallout </em>can’t possibly be a bad thing at this point in time.

                                        <p dir="ltr">Few side-scrolling shooters have withstood the test of time quite like SNK's Metal Slug series. From soaking up coins on arcade screens to bringing that same frantic arcade experience to home consoles, Metal Slug has kept the genre alive and well with its unmistakable cartoonish charm wrapped around fast and frantic run-and-gun action.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, Metal Slug is heading to our mobile and PC screens with the release of Metal Slug: Awakening. Awakening isn't just set to be the most portable Metal Slug experience yet, it's also evolving the classic formula by revamping everything from the iconic visuals to the gameplay mechanics, multiplayer options, and more--all while retaining the core run-and-gun philosophy that has kept the franchise so popular over the last 28 years.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4329909-metalslug6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329909" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4329909-metalslug6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329909"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4329909-metalslug6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Metal Slug: Now in 2.5D!</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Metal Slug: Awakening is the latest chapter in the franchise's story, following the iconic heroes Marco, Eri, Tarma, and Fio as they battle to thwart the plans of evil dictators, supernatural monsters, and ancient deities. With the move to 2.5D, Marco and his squad now have full 3D models, with more fluid movement to complement the dynamic action and breathe even more personality into each hero.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not just the heroes either; everything from the weapons and vehicles to the enemies and levels has been rebuilt with 3D models, allowing for a crisper look that adds new depth to the side-scrolling shooter gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Revamped Single-Player And Multiplayer Modes</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Awakening features an immersive single-player 'World Adventure' mode, where you face a series of increasingly difficult missions split across ever-expanding seasons. These missions follow the traditional arcade-style run-and-gun gameplay and include a mix of new and returning levels and bosses.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to World Adventure, there are new game modes that introduce unexpected challenges. 'Arcade Carnival' presents objective-based missions such as defending areas from waves of enemies, while 'Hot Pursuit' adds a roguelike twist to the action by rewarding players with randomized upgrades after each mission is cleared. These are just two of the fresh and challenging modes that flip traditional gameplay on its head, requiring players to rethink their approach to combat.</p><p dir="ltr">Co-op also makes a return with 'Joint Operation,' where up to three players can battle through missions to take on specialized bosses. Alternatively, pit your trio against another team of three in high-stakes, chaotic PvP action in 'Prime Showdown.'</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>New Controls for Classic Gameplay</strong></p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to creating great side-scrolling action titles, simplicity and accessibility in gameplay are key. It's this approach that helped Metal Slug retain its fanbase and introduce new gamers to a classic game genre. Metal Slug: Awakening embraces this concept, with simple controls and a focus on speed as you run, shoot, and jump your way through enemies and obstacles, but also adds just enough new elements for a fresh take on the formula.</p><p dir="ltr">For starters, in Awakening, players can choose between two different control schemes: auto-aim and manual aim. Manual aim follows the traditional Metal Slug controls, allowing for free aiming to deliver precision shots to target enemy weak points, while auto-aim targets the nearest enemy on-screen, ensuring that gameplay remains fast-paced on mobile devices.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4329910-metalslug6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329910" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4329910-metalslug6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329910"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4329910-metalslug6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Unlock and Customize Powerful Heroes</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Alongside finding the right control scheme, choosing the right character has never been more vital, as all playable heroes have unique skills and abilities, such as Marco's ‘Bullet Time' which slows down time, making it easier to dodge enemy fire. Each hero's skills and abilities not only add powerful options for players but also reference the character's history and personality, providing new insight into Metal Slug lore.</p><p dir="ltr">At the start, you'll have only Marco available, with five other classic Metal Slug characters to unlock. As you unlock more heroes, you'll also unlock new gear to change their appearance, as well as new accessories that add new skills and buffs, like the ability to throw three grenades at once instead of just one.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Guns, Gear, and More Guns!</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Metal Slug's vast array of weapons featured across its many titles is arguably just as iconic as its playable characters. Whether it's the decimating flame shot, the overwhelmingly heavy machine gun, or the powerful rocket launcher (or rock-it-lawn chair, if you're a Metal Slug veteran), Metal Slug has always featured larger-than-life, bombastic weapons that are practically a requirement for making it through levels intact.</p><p dir="ltr">Awakening includes most of the classic weapon archetypes alongside unique, never-before-seen weapons such as sniper rifles, saw launchers, and a boxing gun (a literal spring-loaded punching glove attached to a firearm). All weapons also have variants, some of which can inflict different status effects such as freezing or burning enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">Weapons can also be upgraded with special items to increase firepower and unlock stronger abilities. This level of customization for character gear and weapons adds a new layer of strategy, opening the door for new playstyles and mechanics not seen before in run-and-gun-style games.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4329911-metalslug5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329911" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4329911-metalslug5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329911"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4329911-metalslug5.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>A Slug for Every Occasion</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Of course, it wouldn't be called Metal Slug without featuring the signature metal behemoths known as Slugs. Slugs add a new element to the gameplay, giving players access to powerful vehicles capable of receiving and dishing out tons of damage. In Awakening, players can unlock Slugs from past games as well as a few new ones.</p><p dir="ltr">Once unlocked, Slugs can be summoned onto the battlefield, giving players a massive advantage with each Slug's unique set of skills and weapons: the classic SV-001 tank can launch nine devastating ballistic missiles, while the unassuming twin Gatling gun-mounted camel, SV-Camel, can summon a powerful lightning storm. Slugs can be further upgraded, enhancing armour, firepower, and abilities.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Metal Slug: Awakening lands on Android, iOS and PC on July 17!

                <p>After hosting several smaller events earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outlast-trials/" data-ref-id="5000-505577">The Outlast Trials</a> is getting its first major post-launch update. Project Lupara is a free update coming on July 16 that adds a new roguelite mode, as well as a new map, missions, abilities, cosmetics, and another villain at the center of it all, who is likely to become as haunting as Mother Gooseberry and Sergeant Coyle. Several quality-of-life changes are coming with the patch, too. Here's everything you need to know about The Outlast Trials' Project Lupara.</p><h2>New villain, map, and missions</h2><p>The centerpiece of the update is Franco "Il Bambino" Barbi, the son of a New Orleans mob boss, with proclivities as disquieting and deranged as this series has become known for. Red Barrels studio has gone and given the "infantilized" Il Bambino a shotgun, which makes for a unique threat that the other melee-focused Big Bads of the game don't have.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Outlast Trials - Project Lupara Update Full Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Tying into the mobster via the game's story, the new Docks map will host a new Trial (main mission), as well as several MK-Challenges (shorter side missions). The game's final mission has also been given a makeover. It remains a solo experience, but now escalates in difficulty as you continue to release Reagents (player characters) into the world--essentially Prestiging your character. A new ending can be seen when you manage to escape, too.</p><p>A fifth cooldown ability, collectively called Rigs, is also being introduced to the game in the form of The Barricade. This is a denial-of-entry maneuver that blocks off pursuers and forces them to bash down the blockade, giving Reagents some precious time to perform a task or widen the gap between their shoulders and a killer's reach.</p><h2>New roguelite game mode - Escalation Therapy</h2><p>Alongside all of this comes a brand-new game mode, Escalation Therapy, which acts like a rougelite endless mode that gets increasingly more difficult as players progress through its twisted Trials. Each mission includes different variables, such as increased damage or more traps littered around the map, so no two playthroughs are ever the same.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330966-tot_projectlupara_ss_franco.png" data-ref-id="1300-4330966" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330966-tot_projectlupara_ss_franco.png" data-ref-id="1300-4330966"></a><figcaption>A look at the new Docks map and its starring villain</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330966-tot_projectlupara_ss_franco.png"></figure><p>Players are tasked with surviving as many as Trials as they can, with permadeath eventually resetting them back to the beginning of a new run. Loadouts will also be empty to start a run, demanding players create something like a sensible build as they progress through the Trials and obtain buffs.</p><h2>New live-service metagame</h2><p>The Outlast Trials is designed as a living game, and with Project Lupara, it's getting more telltale signs of that intent in the form of daily and weekly challenges, as well as new Catalogs, which act as the game's battle pass-like cosmetic rewards path.</p><p>Two new Catalogs will be there to kick off the update. The Standard Catalog, "A New You," offers a collection of previously available cosmetics as well as some new ones, while a paid Deluxe Catalog offers a host of even more new cosmetics. Players progress through Catalogs by obtaining Stamps, and new daily and weekly challenge systems are designed to tie into this new metagame. The Catalogs also never expire, so players won't need to complete them in a set amount of time.</p><h2>Difficulty options and more</h2><p>On the quality-of-life front, The Outlast Trials is getting difficulty options for the first time. Four difficulties--Introductory, Standard, Intense, and Psychosurgery--will be available for players to choose from. This should help ease some players into the game's intense missions, while giving veterans of the Murkoff Facility a more brutal challenge if they're into that.</p><p>The Programs menu has also been revamped and matchmaking will now group players based on their difficulty settings. Loadouts can be altered in the shuttle before heading into any mission, too, and if players fail a mission, they can opt to restart it right away rather than needing to head back to the lobby first. Lastly, the max player level has been bumped up to 70.</p><p>The shared social space in the facility is also adding a new attraction to go with chess and arm wrestling. The Stroop Effect Test, based on the real-life delayed reaction people have when viewing conflicting stimuli, will challenge players to correctly select the color of a word when the word itself spells a different color. It's another low-stakes way to pass the time while you wait to form your group and load into a mission.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330965-outlasttrials_exoticapack.png" data-ref-id="1300-4330965" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330965-outlasttrials_exoticapack.png" data-ref-id="1300-4330965"></a><figcaption>The Exotica Pack</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330965-outlasttrials_exoticapack.png"></figure><p>A new DLC pack is coming to the store, too. The Exotica Pack adds four new skins, several new profile icons, and a range of personal items for players' private cells for $20.</p><p>For players deeply invested in the lore, another free comic book is coming to the studio's website. You'll <a href="https://redbarrelsgames.com/comic-books/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">find it here starting on July 12</a>. It tells the backstory of the latest Big Bad.</p><h2>Limited-Time Bambino event</h2><p>To introduce the new villain and other features coming with Project Lupara, The Outlast Trials will kick off the update with another limited-time cosmetic event. For four weeks, Il Bambino will appear in various Trials when players are loading into the event from the mission selection screen. Depending on the mission, he will be there not in place of but <em>alongside</em> Mother Gooseberry or Sergeant Coyle.</p><p>At the midway point of the event, the Trials featuring the game's latest enemy will be updated, so players who have experienced a lot of the event in the first two weeks will get a fresh take in the back half.</p><p>The Outlast Trials Project Lupara update arrives on July 16 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greedfall-2-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Spiders and publisher Nacon have revealed the&nbsp;<em>Greedfall 2&nbsp;</em>release date, and it's not too far off at all.</p>
<p>Per a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1997660/view/4245287299554888114" rel="noopener" target="_blank">community update on Steam</a> and a release date trailer,&nbsp;<em>Greedfall 2&nbsp;</em>launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on September 24th. As a reminder, this is the release date for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-and-more-unveiled-at-nacon-connect">the Early Access build of the game</a> rather than a full launch.</p>
<p>Prior to the Early Access launch, you can look forward to a new&nbsp;<em>Greedfall 2&nbsp;</em>gameplay trailer dropping in August, followed by the reveal of the game's updated roadmap in September.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/greedfall-2-release-date-city.jpg?itok=U0XXIGVs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/greedfall-2-release-date-city.jpg?itok=W_v9hZGv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Greedfall 2&nbsp;</em>is almost upon us.</figcaption></figure><p>For&nbsp;<em>Greedfall 2</em>, Nacon and Spiders are promising an "even deeper" RPG experience than the first game offered, complete with new lands to explore, new alliances to forge, and more.</p>
<p><em>Greedfall 2&nbsp;</em>will serve as a prequel to the original game; it takes place around three years before the adventures of&nbsp;<em>Greedfall</em>'s hero De Sardet, and you'll play as a native of the island of Teer Fradee, uprooted from your home and forced into a conflict that could decide the fate of the continent at large.</p>
<p>As you'll probably expect if you played the first game,&nbsp;you'll be able to recruit party members, help them out with their personal problems, and even romance them, not to mention being able to control them in combat.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to meeting and doing deals with&nbsp;<em>Greedfall 2</em>'s various factions, as well as a world that responds to "diplomacy, manipulation, infiltration, and combat" as viable approaches to the situations in which you find yourself.</p>
<p><em>Greedfall 2&nbsp;</em>is the followup to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-newest-rpg-greedfall-comes-to-pc-and-consoles-this-september">2019's&nbsp;<em>Greedfall</em></a>, which quickly earned itself a reputation as a janky but ambitious RPG in a similar vein to Piranha Bytes' games on launch. Given that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report">future of Piranha Bytes looks shaky</a>, this may be the next best place for&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Risen&nbsp;</em>fans to get their RPG jollies.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Greedfall 2&nbsp;</em>when it launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/Greedfall_II_The_Dying_World/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010517" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S on September 24th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

His influence can even be seen outside of his streams as his catchphrase “what’s up brother” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@titans/video/7355591151639891243&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@titans/video/7355591151639891243" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">went viral on TikTok</a></span> and even became well known in professional sports circles. On Sunday, July 7, the YouTube channel Pocketbook posted a video with screenshots of what it alleged was Cox’s OnlyFans content. The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/07/09/sketch-onlyfans-leak-explained-twitch-streamer-confirms-he-created-adult-content-during-dark-time/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/07/09/sketch-onlyfans-leak-explained-twitch-streamer-confirms-he-created-adult-content-during-dark-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resulting fallout</a></span> has been a mix: some streamers and influencers have expressed, support, while others have slammed him in predictably homophobic and anti-sex work ways. On July 8, Cox hosted a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2192642945&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2192642945" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">short response stream</a></span> to address the situation, confirming the legitimacy of the screenshots and saying he made OnlyFans content when he was going through a “dark time” and struggling with addiction. It is real fucking sad that he feels the need to apologize for this, as there should be no shame.</p><p>Cox said that his support system helped him avoid a crisis moment, and he’s already joking about the scenario, so good on him for taking it in stride. A bizarre side effect of all of this is that some of Cox’s (mostly young, male) fans are suddenly learning empathy for queer people and sex workers. It’s an unfortunate reality that homophobes can’t conceptualize queer people and their struggles as real until it’s someone they care about, but if one good thing has come from all of this mess it’s that bigoted people are becoming less so.</p><p>“I clowned him at first I won’t even lie about it,” a TikTok user wrote. “Then I just realized how he must be feeling man. Seeing those texts [<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Banks/status/1810399338667147753&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Banks/status/1810399338667147753" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">between Sketch and FaZe Clan’s Banks</a></span>] and then him talking about it just hurt so much to hear man.”</p><p>We’ve reached out to Sketch for comment and will update this story if we hear back. Hopefully, these unfortunate events will lead to more hateful people denouncing their bigoted views. In the meantime, audio from Sketch’s video <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@miss.exclamation_point/video/7389679733220363550&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@miss.exclamation_point/video/7389679733220363550" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is going viral on TikTok</a></span> in which he parodies U.S. President Bill Clinton’s infamous <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aGbdni7QNs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aGbdni7QNs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“I did not have sexual relations with that woman,”</a></span> sound bite. Even in a rough situation, the dude’s got impeccable comedic timing.</p><p>This controversy comes not long after both top streamer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-sexting-twitch-ban-youtube-elden-ring-1851556854&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-sexting-twitch-ban-youtube-elden-ring-1851556854">Guy “Dr. Disrespect” Beahm admitted to inappropriately messaging a minor on Twitch</a></span> and was subsequently stripped of almost all of his brand deals, and Nick “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nickmercs-twitch-ban-slur-mrbeast-drdisrespect-1851566196&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nickmercs-twitch-ban-slur-mrbeast-drdisrespect-1851566196">Nickmercs</a></span>” Kolcheff was banned from Twitch for saying a transphobic slur. Unsurprisingly, some still voiced support for both controversial streamers, highlighting the often regressive ideologies of those who are plugged into the lives of popular Twitch personalities. So after seeing that unfold, it’s heartening to see some Twitch controversy help people escape bigoted mindsets rather than emboldening them.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Duvall is best known for her portrayal as Wendy Torrance in Stanley Kubrick's 1980 horror film The Shining. However, she is also known for her lead role in the 1980 live-action film Popeye, in addition to her roles in 1974's Thieves Like Us and the 1977 film 3 Women.</p><p>According to her IMDb page, Duvall took a break from acting in 2002, with her last appearance at the time being the 2002 independent film Manna from Heaven.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-patch-102-makes-some-big-changes-heres-what-it-does<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-first-descendant">The First Descendant</a> developer Nexon has issued a significant update for its popular looter shooter and explained some of its thinking behind the game.</p><p>Patch 1.0.2, out now across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, adds <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-hotfix-will-add-much-requested-feature">the promised matchmaking for hard mode Infiltration Operations</a>, renames monster patterns, eases the punishing grind ever so slightly, and makes a raft of bug fixes. Other highlights include slowing down the speed at which the Instructor robot talks (which was too fast to keep up with, really).</p><p>As part of the <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2601132" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch notes</a>, Nexon insisted it has no plans to nerf meta builds players are currently using to destroy bosses, called Colossi in-game, in just a handful of seconds. These sorts of builds, which revolve around character Gley and rare machine gun Tamer, were expected, Nexon added.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The First Descendant Screenshots </h3></div></output><p>“It has come to our attention that the community is worried about possible nerfs to Tamer and Gley's infinite magazine builds,” Nexon said. “This meta is very strong, but since it is within the scope of what the dev team has planned, there are no immediate plans to do so.</p><p>“In addition, some weapons are more powerful than Tamer and there are a variety of character builds that rival Gley's infinite magazine, so please enjoy them fully. We've been looking forward to seeing Descendants use creative builds to take down powerful Colossi swiftly, so we're quite delighted to see this in action now.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The First Descendant will continue to communicate transparently and honestly.</p></div><p>There’s also an interesting note addressing community concern that the drop rates of certain much-needed items were not accurately displayed in-game. In short, some players felt that The First Descendant’s displayed drop rates were not the actual drop rates in gameplay, after many struggled to get these particular items as part of the free-to-play looter shooter’s punishing grind.</p><p>“We are well aware that as many Descendants begin farming in earnest, various discussions are taking place regarding drop rates,” Nexon acknowledged. “There is no variable drop rate system in The First Descendant. We are using the fixed rates displayed in the game.</p><p>“The dev team has reviewed the acquisition rates across all servers and confirmed that they are dropping according to the rates displayed. We are currently working on various measures to ensure the community can trust the dev team such as disclosing item drop amounts for each content. And we also prepare ways to improve the farming experience. The First Descendant will continue to communicate transparently and honestly.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>However, the patch does not address the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-enjoys-big-player-numbers-on-steam-despite-microtransaction-hell"><u>The First Descendant’s ultra aggressive monetization</u></a>, nor has Nexon explained <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-hit-with-destiny-icon-plagiarism-accusations-but-theres-seemingly-more-to-the-story"><u>the remarkable similarities between icons used in The First Descendant and Bungie’s rival looter shooter, Destiny</u></a>.</p><p>Still, The First Descendant is pulling in players, with a peak Steam concurrent player count of 264,860 so far — enough to break into the top five most-played games on Valve’s platform. Microsoft and Sony do not provide player numbers for PlayStation and Xbox.</p><h2>The First Descendant update 1.0.2 patch notes in full:</h2><p><strong>Content Improvements</strong></p><p>- Added the 'Start Public Operation' function (matchmaking) to Infiltration Operations (Hard). 'Start Public Operation' is available even if you change the selected reward, but if you select an additional option, only 'Start Private Operation' will be available.</p><p>- Removed the sequential type Immunity Spheres from Named Monsters. They have been changed to either the default or extermination types.</p><div><p><u><strong># Director's Comment</strong></u></p><p>The Dev Team acknowledges the community's concern about the monotonous patterns of Named Monsters and strives to enhance them.</p><p>In particular, we've noted that the pattern involving breaking spheres in a specific order isn't appropriate for public matching and have decided to remove it immediately.</p><p>As new patterns are developed, we will soon update the patterns of existing Named Monsters one by one.</p><p>As Named Monsters frequently appear in Hard difficulty and Special Operations, we will continue working towards diversifying their patterns.</p></div><p>- Increased the quantity of rare basic materials dropped from Encrypted Vaults three-fold. The Elite Vulgus that appear in Field Missions and Infiltration Operations will now drop them too.</p><div><p><u><strong># Director's Comment</strong></u></p><p>The most efficient way to farm rare basic materials is still through Encrypted Vaults, but for those who prefer hunting monsters, we have updated Field Missions and Infiltration Operations to drop these materials too.</p><p>The Dev Team will closely monitor the overall farming status and do our best to create a joyful environment for all our Descendants.</p></div><p>- Reduced the time from two 90-second to two 60-second occupations for the Kingston 'Vulgus Data Transmitter' Hacking Mission.</p><p>- Improved the Battle Pass Battle Supply Shop button's visibility by redesigning it in the format of the Bonus Shop banner.</p><div><p><u><strong># Director's Comment</strong></u></p><p>You can get season-limited skins for free from the Battle Supply Shop. Complete pre-season challenges to claim your special skins!</p></div><p>- Updated the Library window from closing when the map is opened and closed through the Acquisition Information pop-up.</p><p>- Improved the duration of party invitation messages to make them easier to confirm and accept.</p><p>- Improved the duration of the Descendant Instructor's lines.</p><div><p><u><strong># Director's Comment</strong></u></p><p>Many Descendants have commented that the Descendant Instructor's dialogue contains many useful game tips.</p><p>Currently, it's not possible to revisit previous dialogues, but we are planning to fix this.</p><p>We will continue to make improvements so that Descendants can easily access the information they require.</p></div><p>- Moved the guide NPC you meet after first arriving in Albion closer.</p><p><strong>Optimization Improvements</strong></p><p>- [PC] Improved the stability of the shader preparation process by reducing the CPU load during shader generation.</p><p>Currently, we are actively monitoring this issue, and if you encounter issues with a 13th or 14th gen Intel, please refer to <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/June-2024-Guidance-regarding-Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-K-KF/m-p/1607807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intel's official guide</a>.</p><p>- [PC] Lowered GPU memory usage when set at High or higher quality.</p><p>- [PC] Fixed an issue where character skins were displayed abnormally in low graphics settings intermittently during extended play.</p><p>- [PC] Fixed a bug that allowed frame limits to be set when using Nvidia and AMD's Frame Generation.</p><p>- [Common] Fixed an issue where shadows were intermittently displayed abnormally depending on the view.</p><p>- [Common] Made various other fixes for optimization purposes, and we will continuously monitor them.</p><p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p><p><strong>(1) UI/UX</strong></p><p>- Fixed an issue displaying unused items in the Library.</p><p><strong>(2) Descendants</strong></p><p>- Fixed an issue where Descendants could not get out of DBNO when their HP was below -100% from module settings.</p><p>- Fixed an issue where Kyle would occasionally go up into the air when using 'Superconductivity Thrusters' during 'Repulsion Dash'.</p><p>- Fixed an issue where Esiemo could not get back up while using 'Arche Explosion' and being inflicted with Knockback.</p><p><strong>(3) Modules</strong></p><p>- Fixed an issue where the increase in Firearm ATK per stack in the 'Sharp Precision Shot' module was summed instead of multiplied.</p><p><strong>(4) Equipment</strong></p><p>- Fixed an issue where a weapon's attribute damage did not apply damage over 100,000.</p><p>- Fixed an issue where higher values were displayed as the Ultimate (Gold) option despite the Reactor's Skill Cooldown and Skill Cost stats being preferable with lower values.</p><p>- Fixed an issue where lower values were displayed as the Ultimate (Gold) option despite the Weapon Change Speed stat being preferable with higher values.</p><p><strong>(5) Field</strong></p><p>- Fixed an issue where 'Amorphous Material Pattern: 118' and 'Shape Stabilizer Form 8' were not dropped at 'Frozen Valley: Vulgus Strategic Outpost' in Fortress (Hard).</p><p>- Fixed an issue where Elite Vulgus in the White-night Gulch 'Upper Hatchery' Battlefield Missions did not drop rewards.</p><p>- Fixed an issue where monster spawning was interrupted at some Vulgus Strategic Outposts.</p><p><strong>(6) Instance Dungeon</strong></p><p>- Fixed an issue where Vespers resource box materials were dropped from Echo Swamp, Agna Desert, White-night Gulch, Hagios, and Fortress Infiltration Operation resource boxes.</p><p><strong>(7) Research</strong></p><p>- Fixed an issue where the core materials of Ultimate Descendants were incorrectly displayed as Rare instead of Ultimate Tier.</p><p><strong>(8) Miscellaneous</strong></p><p>- [French] Fixed an issue where the 'Go to title screen' menu was displayed with the same phrase as 'Exit Game'.</p><p>- [French] Fixed an issue in the story where 'Ultimate Chimera' was used for 'Dreadful Abomination'.</p><p>- [French] Added missing words in the probability display for Executioner Tier 3 Set 4.</p><div><p><u><strong># Director's Additional Comment</strong></u></p><p>It has come to our attention that the community is worried about possible nerfs to Tamer and Gley's infinite magazine builds.</p><p>This meta is very strong, but since it is within the scope of what the Dev Team has planned, there are no immediate plans to do so.</p><p>In addition, some weapons are more powerful than Tamer and there are a variety of character builds that rival Gley's infinite magazine, so please enjoy them fully.

                <p>Publisher Arc System Works and developer Yuke's have announced Double Dragon Revive, the next entry in the Double Dragon series. It is due out sometime in 2025 for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</p><p>The game is a 3D revival of the series that debuted in 1987, so it's unclear right now whether this is a remake of a previous title or a completely brand-new adventure. Protagonists Billy and Jimmy Lee return, as well as enemies Roper and Abobo.</p>

<p>Players will be able to pick up weapons scattered throughout stages and use their surroundings to pull off gimmicks. The game's development is being overseen by a staff with experience on previous Arc System Works fighting game titles and is aiming to bring the series to the modern area with refined controls.</p><p>Double Dragon is traditionally a 2D beat-'em-up series, and Revive looks to be keeping the 2D side-scrolling aspect while implementing 3D character models and environments. Arc System Works has been bringing the series back recently. Last year, the developer ported <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-long-missing-double-dragon-games-are-finally-coming-back/1100-6516379/" data-ref-id="1100-6516379">Double Dragon Advance and Super Double Dragon to modern platforms</a>, as well as released a new game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/double-dragon-gaiden-rise-of-the-dragons-brings-billy-and-jimmy-back-this-summer/1100-6513790/" data-ref-id="1100-6513790">Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons</a>.</p>

What appealed to you about returning to this style of game and creating something of your own in this genre?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lauridsen</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: First of all, the games that inspired </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SKALD</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (RPGs from the early '90s) have a lot going for them that appeal to me: Turn-based combat, lots of exploration, wonderful pixel art, etc. I genuinely think they had qualities that hold appeal to this day and that have become a bit less prevalent in modern RPGs. As RPGs developed as a genre, there were some features that were "thrown out with the bathwater."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/leveraging-emotional-design-features-to-enhance-character-perception-in-pixel-art" target="_self">Leveraging Emotional Design Features to Enhance Character Perception in Pixel Art</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The downside with these classic games is that they tend to be less than accessible these days. For me, I had the experience of coming back to a lot of older titles that I liked the idea of playing more than actually playing them. So, this was a big driver for me: Scratching my own itch for old-school CRPGs! That being said, if you look past the retro graphics, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SKALD</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> really is a lot more modern in how it actually plays than you would think.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The elevator pitch is "to make a game that plays like our nostalgia-tinged memories of the CRPGs of yore but not how retro CRPGs ACTUALLY played."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>These retro RPGs could be incredibly ruthless and difficult to figure out during their era. What elements did you want to keep from retro party-based RPGs, and which did you wish to change or update to make this game a little less overwhelming for a modern audience?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've been pretty strict about maintaining a certain graphical expression for the game, which imposes some limits on things like UI design due to the small screen real estate, etc. I also wanted a game with a lot of mechanical complexity. So, in other words, a game where you, the player, actually find it more fun to play the more you learn the "rules" of the system.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But all that being said, it's always been important to me to make a game that is as accessible as possible within those constraints. It's been really important not to come across as a gatekeeper for this genre, and this certainly isn't always easy: there's a balancing act between having a game that's fair and welcoming but also challenging and complex. You never get there 100%, but I've done what I can with tutorials, quality-of-life features, a lot of settings, and a customizable difficulty. There are even hundreds of console commands, so you can cheat as much as you like. It's important to me that players get to play the game on their terms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beyond that, there are very few (if any) old-school features that I've added just to make life hard for the player. Modern audiences are sensitive to games wasting their time, and though it may not always seem like it, I have tried to make the experience as smooth as possible for players (within the limits of my core design pillars).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yes, the game is old-school on the surface, but if you can get past that initial layer, you'll find a pretty modern CRPG underneath.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Can you tell us a bit about some of the games that inspired </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SKALD: Against the Black Priory</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>? What about them that helped inspire elements of your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Games like the</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Gold Box series and the early Ultima games were a large inspiration for the retro aspect of the game. And then the games I REALLY mainlined in my formative years were the Infinity Engine games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 1 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Planescape Torment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Icewind Dale</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, etc. and games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout 1</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I think the narrative experience for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SKALD</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is much closer to those games than </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima 5</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, for instance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, there's been a lot of great CRPGs coming out lately with games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pillars of Eternity 1 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the Pathfinder games, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rogue Trader</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and so forth. I've stolen copiously from these, especially in terms of features and secondary systems.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>There are many different characters players can enlist with various personalities, skills, and goals that can really shake up how they play through the game. Can you tell us the ideas that went into creating interesting party members that can add many unique elements to a playthrough?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Honestly, I'm a "discovery writer," and NPCs tend to spring forth from who knows where and then assert themselves in the narrative. I genuinely have little influence on what they say and do.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I planned to have a lot more of them, but there is an issue where balancing their screen time and interactions takes a lot of work for a solo developer, and it also makes testing very complex. Simply put, the tools I had today meant a lot of manual testing would be needed for a larger stable of NPCs, and there simply wasn't time for it. So, for this game I opted to reduce the number of pre-made characters to ensure the ones that were there had a minimum amount of meaningful interactions. And even then, I left a lot of intra-party lying on the cutting room floor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What challenges come from creating a whole vast world filled with different, disturbing places to explore and sidequests to follow up on, as well as an array of classes and abilities, when you're a single developer working on the game? How do you create vast swaths of things to see and do without working yourself to death?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A lot of challenges come from this and I </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>did</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (almost) work myself to death. Making roleplaying games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SKALD</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is beyond complex. The game has a near-infinite number of potential worldstates that each create new and unforeseen interactions and it's very challenging to keep this relatively bug-free. And if you then choose to do this whilst trying to add an interesting narrative on top of it, that increases the challenge substantially. There is a reason so many RPGs feature a lot of fetch quests.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The only way to solve this (as far as I am concerned) is to develop high-quality, purpose-built tools and to continually seek to evolve workflows. In other words, it's at least partially an engineering challenge.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Part of the challenge with this project was that I made the tool set while making content. That meant that portions of the game were made using tools that varied wildly in quality. Not only that, but since the tools were continually developing, it also took time for me to "learn" them well. Let's just say I learned a lot as a designer as well during development, and as a result, a lot of my best work came at the late stage of the project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's inevitable to wistfully think, " Oh, if I could only go back and redo the game starting with the tools I have now."&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You have to communicate a lot of visual information about a character with only a handful of pixels in the game's top-down viewpoint. Can you tell us about how you design a character or place with a minimum of pixels? How do you still convey mood and character when you only have a tiny amount of room, pixels, and visual details to work with?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's the question, right?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First of all, I had excellent freelancers do most of the non-human models and complex environments. So that's a bit of a cheat, but at the same time, since everything is so minimal, there is a large degree of technical design that goes into making every component work well together. The key here is to first do a lot of work on my end in finding some core principles for the graphic design and then managing to convey that to the artists in a way that ensures I get what I need in terms of technical specs whilst still allowing them to infuse it with as much of their artistry as possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Among other things, this requires good communication. It begins with a good, written asset order. Then, a first draft from the artist and then iterating over feedback until we're there. The secret to this workflow (because it can be time-consuming) is that if you have good chemistry, you end up at a spot where you become very well-attuned, and the back-and-forth becomes a lot faster. In the end, it was enough for me to ask one of my illustrators to "Giger it up," and they would know exactly what I was referring to. That's when magic really begins to happen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beyond that, when it comes to stuff like "How do we make combat readable?" it's honestly just trial and error. Just iterating over feedback until it feels good. Removing friction and adding "juice".</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>That said, the game goes into great detail with many of the characters and monsters in cutscenes and specific moments and often excels at capturing gruesome, discomforting, or bizarre things. What thoughts went into really going into detail with this visual style and into creating a sense of unease and fear from these detailed visuals?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once again, this is, first and foremost, the skill of my artists. Secondly, it comes down to the workflow I outlined below. Lastly, I also had a strong core concept of what I wanted the world to look and feel like and how these concepts should feed each other in a way that "permeates" the world with a sense of wrongness. There are a lot of hidden details and subtle stuff that might not register on a surface level, but that come together to form a whole.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another important aspect is that I, very early on, had an idea that I wanted to challenge a bit of the tired "ren-faire" aesthetics that are so common in a lot of fantasy RPGs. I think that it subtly pushes the game towards a more believable look for the mundane aspects while pushing the horrific aspect more in a direction that is closer to the body horror of a lot of sci-fi horror classics. The mix is something that might strike closer to home than a lot of stock standard fantasy horror tropes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What additional challenges or benefits came from taking inspiration from the Commodore 64 palette for making the visuals?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This goes beyond just pure aesthetic preference: I started the project by asking myself, "What is the most simplistic graphical expression I can choose that still allows me to tell the kinds of stories I want to tell?". The reason for this is that I always knew I would be working alone or, at the most, with a handful of freelancers, and I really wanted to keep down asset production logistics whilst still having something expressive. That, in turn, also influenced the game design by driving it closer to a style of game-play that was also more common in the low-fidelity graphics era.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>It's not pure visuals but also the writing that creates that unsettling feeling. Can you tell us about how you created the game's particular tone with the writing? How did you use words to weave the mood?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How to write cosmic horror, especially for games, is an entire interview unto itself. I'm not saying I'm an expert, but I think I did something right.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The big issue with doing it for a roleplaying game, in particular, is that CPRGs tend to be power fantasies. There are, of course, things you can do to lean into the grim darkness and horror aspects of the game, but it was outside the scope of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SKALD</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to create a game where your character is going slowly insane while losing limbs. There's also something about this being a very mechanistic approach and that's not particularly conducive to horror.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead, my approach for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SKALD</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was to adopt a concept of "subtle wrongness." You may be vanquishing your foes fight after fight, but the deeper you progress into the maze of the narrative, the more clear it becomes that something you can't quite put your finger on is terribly wrong and by the end… Well, let's just leave it at that for now.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And this is part of the trick: I tend to try to free myself from explaining too much to the player. I try to have a strong canon in my own head but then only drip-feed it to the players. I think this is a large part of successfully pulling off this increasing feeling of subtle wrongness. At the risk of sounding morbid, I kinda want to replicate that terrifying feeling of growing unease you get if you've ever begun to suspect that you might be suffering from some slowly-evolving, but horrific, disease. That anxious looking for symptoms, trying to Google it, and then instantly realizing you would do anything to go back to being ignorant—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>that</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is true cosmic horror.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How do you feel about some of your old favorite games now that you've created your own party-based RPG? How has this affected your opinion of the classics of this genre now that you've lived through everything it takes to create one?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As I said above, I think RPGs are some of the most complex projects you can take on and I have an incredible amount of respect for anyone who does it successfully. What's also abundantly clear is how incredibly passion-driven you need to be in order to make a good RPG. It takes pain and suffering and brutal honesty to make a game like this and that's just as true for a game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SKALD</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as it is for a game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s a very good thing, as it yields a sense of realism and intimacy that raises the bar for this series.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193897" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="418" data-playlist="193897,194664,194499" data-current="193897"><div><p>10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19360.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Episode 7,&nbsp;“Choice,” is the flashback episode we’ve been awaiting since the series began, promising the big reveal of the inciting incident that has caused years of remorse and spun the web of revenge all characters are connected to. We open on the planet Brendok with Jedi Masters Sol (Lee Jung-jae), Indara (Carrie-Anne Moss), and Kelnacca (Joonas Suotamo), and Padawan apprentice Torbin (Dean-Charles Chapman). Immediately, we can feel each Jedi’s sense of self with a beautiful wide shot given to us by episode director Kogonada and cinematographer James Friend. The Jedi are in search of a “Vergence”—a powerful centralization of the Force that can create life, such as the lush forests of Brendok. </p><p>This tone of exploration echoes <em>Star Trek</em> in every beat, and affords us a more intimate character portrait for each Jedi. We even get to see them eat together, and without the pressure of any “star war,” we get to see them as people striving for ideals of self mastery and cultivation of wisdom for the benefit of the galaxy. We often hear about these principles when it comes to Jedi, but we don’t often get to feel them without some external pressure distracting us. I absolutely loved this tone, and hope an entire series about the Jedi can be built around it. We don’t always need fighting and chasing to feel something as audience members.</p><p>The search for the Vergence leads Sol to discover the mystical child twins, Mae and Osha (played by real life twin actors Lauren and Leah Brady). Sol sees that Mae has markings of dark magic on her body, while Osha does not, leading him to believe that she may be in danger of being sacrificed by their witch coven, given that a celestial event is about to happen. Sol, who lacks a Jedi apprentice, is bent on making sure the children are safe, and he feels a special connection to Osha, who bears no mystic markings. This desire in the supposedly desire-less Jedi leads to an intentionally muddy web of events that don’t reveal many story points that we haven’t seen in previous episodes. The meaning in this episode has very little to do with what’s happening on the outside and far more to do with what’s happening within each character. It’s this exploration of interiority and character that makes it enjoyable.</p><figure id="" data-id="3bee737079c5e164d43cc807be66c110" data-recommend-id="image://3bee737079c5e164d43cc807be66c110" data-format="jpg" data-width="2857" data-height="1608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kelnacca (Joonas Suotamo) in The Acolyte." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kelnacca (Joonas Suotamo) in The Acolyte." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3bee737079c5e164d43cc807be66c110" data-recommend-id="image://3bee737079c5e164d43cc807be66c110" data-format="jpg" data-width="2857" data-height="1608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kelnacca (Joonas Suotamo) in The Acolyte." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On the other hand, the episode also suffers from the same Wookiee bias as the original <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy, missing an opportunity to share Kelnacca’s journey. Whether it’s a member of an alien race or a human being from a marginalized group, writers have to be cautious with underrepresenting characters that are killed off (see the old movie stereotype of the “Black guy dies”) or who get their minds controlled by an outside force, both of which happen to Kelnacca as of this episode. There was an anime trope of deeply exploring characters who would be promptly killed off, and as a kid, I always felt the difference in how much more I wanted to know about the characters that died in those stories. Consistently failing to develop characters in a given race is a writing flaw that leads to—for lack of a better term—the dehumanization of that race, even if they’re alien. And since stories educate us on how to view our reality, this can contribute to a lack of consideration and negative treatment of others. So you see, I can’t stop my campaign for Wookiee equal rights.<br></p><p>Amidst all the conflict in this episode, the most overtly significant moment we see is Sol killing Mae &amp; Osha’s mother, Aniseya (Jodie Turner-Smith). Even here, the filmmaking doesn’t emphasize the action. Rather, we are focused on the emotion of Sol’s reactionary fear that led him to draw his lightsaber on her amongst the air of confusion and defensiveness from both the coven and the Jedi. Sol’s remorse is instant, and we feel it in how he allows himself to be hit repeatedly by Aniseya’s partner, Mother Koril (Margarita Levieva). These moments convey one of the greatest gifts we’ve ever received from the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise—the gift of misunderstanding.</p><p>Misunderstanding is hard to write. But&nbsp;<em>The Acolyte</em> has taken its time to articulate all of the players, the cultures, the differences in perspective, and demonstrates how they can all clash. We understand why they aren’t aligned with each other on a very human level. From my training in martial arts and meditation, I know that a sense of peace can be found in conflict. Now, all I’m left seeking is a sense of purpose and completion to the chaos. Let’s hope the finale in episode 8 delivers.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/HYPERMYSTx/status/1811415902480699859" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X, longtime reliable leaker HYPERMYST teased images of a potential new map for Apex Legends called “District,” also courtesy of leaker Osvaldatore.</p>



<p>The images showcase a circular, neon area full of amusement rides and similar attractions along a coastline. HYPERMYST claims the images reveal “every major POI” from the leaked map. </p>



<p>They also say District is “expected to be released in Season 22.” There are over a dozen detailed images for fans to break down.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Initial fan responses are fairly positive for the “District” map, and new content is always welcome in the game. However, it’s unclear if District will help smooth over interest in Apex Legends, should the map ultimately release in Season 22. </p>



<p>EA faced a lot of fan backlash after announcing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-overhauls-battle-passes-abandons-in-game-ac-currency-option/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive changes</a> to the Battle Pass system for Season 22. That includes breaking the Battle Pass into two separate purchases, one for each seasonal split. </p>



<p>It will also remove the Apex Coins pricing option, so fans can only buy Battle Passes with real-world currency.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-new-season-new-legend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current season</a> saw the return of Solos, and also introduced the new legend Alter. There was also a recent Double Take Collection Event.</p>



<p>At this time, EA did not officially confirm anything about the District map, nor its potential release window for Season 22.</p>
