<p>In his monthly thread detailing sales figures and retail highlights, Piscatella confirms that a total of 1.6 million hardware units were sold across all platforms in the US during November. This is the lowest total since 1995, during which a total of 1.4 million units were sold.</p>
<p>To potentially explain this figure, Piscatella also notes that the average price paid for a new piece of hardware was "an all-time November high of $439", which is up 11% compared to a year ago.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Ty8h-8gLSNk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytTy8h-8gLSNk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed63b0c7kxonjs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>Looking at the data a bit closer, the PS5 managed to beat the Switch 2 to be the highest-selling platform during November, which is the first time Sony has managed such a feat since the launch of Nintendo's new console. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/12/xbox-series-xs-had-no-black-friday-deals-so-they-lost-to-a-console-weve-never-heard-of-us">the NEX Playground came in third place</a> in units sold, though the Xbox managed to bag third in dollars.</p>
<p>In terms of software, the highest-selling game of the month was, rather predictably, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_black_ops_7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. Nintendo's highest-charting title was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[AdHoc Studio’s Dispatch Will Arrive On Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 Next Month, According to AU Store Listing]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/adhoc-studios-dispatch-will-arrive-on-nintendo-switch-and-nintendo-switch-2-next-month-according-to-au-store-listing/</link>
            <guid>1386076</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Dispatch, the interactive narrative from former Telltale developers at AdHoc Studio that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">secured a nomination at The Game Awards</a> despite releasing its final episode only five days before the nominations were announced, appears to be coming to the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 next month on January 29, 2026.</p>



<p>At least that's according to <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000105332">a store listing on the Australian eShop</a> listing that was spotted online. There's been no official word from AdHoc Studio through its social media channels or its website acknowledging the new release, but an official store listing is, at the very least, a strong sign that Dispatch will be available on Nintendo's hybrid consoles in the new year.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even though Dispatch didn't arrive until later in the year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-telltale-devs-announced-release-date-new-dispatch-game/">with its first batch of episodes releasing on October 22</a>, followed by the rest of the episodes releasing weekly up until November 12, it still made a significant impact on the year in the eyes of players. Featuring Aaron Paul as the lead, supported by actors like Jeffery Wright and Laura Baily, along with other voice actors players know from other games and from Critical Role, Dispatch is easily one of the year's most successful indie titles.</p>



<p>Not only has it <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-reportedly-closing-in-on-7m-copies-sold/">continued its strong sales since launch</a> and since the release of its finale episode for Season 1, according to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/novembers-best-selling-steam-games">Alinea Analytics</a>, it was also one of the best-selling games on Steam for November 2025.</p>







<p>Currently, AdHoc Studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dispatch-season-2-cant-take-gta-6-amounts-of-time-fret-adhoc-as-they-decide-whether-or-not-to-make-it">is still weighing up whether it'll make a Season 2</a>, though that appears to be highly likely based on the reception the first season received and the success the game has had so far. It might be the case that we'll get a Season 2 after Dispatch has made it to all major platforms, since it is currently only available on PC and PS5. Once it arrives on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 next month, and Xbox sometime later, then we might finally get confirmation of Season 2, if AdHoc decides to make it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Mini computers offer a great way of enjoying powerful performance while keeping things minimal and mess-free. If you’re after a solid option from Apple, Amazon is making the upgrade quite easy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">If you act fast, you can grab the 2024 Mac mini desktop computer (16GB memory, 256GB storage) with the super-fast M4 chip for $479, after a nice 20% discount.</a> It’s rated as Amazon’s Choice at the retailer, and has plenty of good reviews backing it up. Those looking to have it delivered before Christmas should place their orders today, as delays can push the delivery past the holiday season. Not married to the Apple brand? There are plenty of other mini PCs going at a discount right now, too. We’ve been covering the best drops (across multiple retailers) out there, so be sure to check our Deals page to find the one that fits your needs and budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Supercharged By M4</h2>
<p>This mini, yet mighty PC is five by five inches of incredible power. Design-wise, it’s quite sleek and is made to sit nicely next to a monitor, or anywhere else, without cluttering things up. It runs on the powerful M4 chip, which delivers incredible performance for all your tasks, whether you’re working on a group project for school, editing a creative project, developing a presentation, or brainstorming ideas. The chip also makes it up to 13x faster than the fastest Intel-based Mac mini, which means you can rely on it for your everyday tasks, as well as those busy, productive days where you’re handling a bit too much at the same time. Additionally, macOS is quite convenient to use and lets you run all your favorite apps responsively.</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence integration takes the experience even further. It’s Apple’s personal AI system that lets you search, write, develop ideas, communicate, and create stuff with ease. You’re getting personalized tools for a bunch of tasks, which can help you get a lot more done throughout your day.</p>
<p>There’s a 16GB memory to keep things running smoothly. It’s not massive, but you should be able to perform some light multitasking with ease. Storage is taken care of by the built-in 256GB SSD. Again, it’s not the biggest out there, but it does a good job at housing all your important files and content in a single place.</p>



<p>The PC also includes Thunderbolt, HDMI, and Gigabit Ethernet ports on the back, plus, for the first time, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack. These are enough to connect all your important peripherals without feeling limited. What’s more, the Mac mini plays nicely with other Apple devices like iPhones and iPads, too. When using it with your iPhone, for instance, you can mirror your smartphone on the monitor and control it from there. You can move things around, copy something on the iPhone and paste it on the Mac, reply to texts, take FaceTime calls, and more.</p>
<p>There are a lot of other features to like here, but to wrap it up, if you’ve been looking to upgrade your workstation by grabbing something fast and efficient, we highly recommend considering the 2024 Mac mini desktop computer. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">It’s now going for $479, meaning you can save over $100 on your purchase, but only if you grab it quick.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">There's always Game Pass.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launched last month to become the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-physical-software-and-hardware-sales-just-had-the-worst-november-in-the-us-since-1995">best-selling game of November</a> in the U.S. by dollar sales. It's both a huge sales feat and a common Call of Duty W, as the franchise has topped the charts in its launch month every year for 18 straight years. However, it looks like its rival Battlefield 6 will reign at the top of the U.S. sales charts at year's end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from Circana's monthly report, which has Black Ops 7 debuting as the best-selling game of November and the seventh best-selling game of the year-to-date, behind Battlefield 6 at No.1, NBA 2K26 at No.2, Monster Hunter Wilds at No.3, Borderlands 4 at No.4, EA Sports College Football 26 at No.5, and Madden NFL 26 at No.6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of those games have a few more months on the market on Call of Duty, but it's still a lot of ground to make up in a single month, and Call of Duty's at a bit of a disadvantage. The game launched into Game Pass, meaning its actual dollar sales on Xbox consoles are much lower than that of its rivals as people use the subscription service to access it instead, and there's no good recent data on how Call of Duty's presence on the service impacts subscriptions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It is worth noting, though, that Black Ops 7 doesn't seem to be doing as well as Black Ops 6, a fact that's reflected in everything from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">critical review scores</a> to fan response to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-suffers-terrible-launch-in-europe-with-63-fewer-copies-sold-than-battlefield-6-but-theres-important-context-to-consider">European sales figures</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games">Activision's own admissions</a>. Circana reports that the Call of Duty franchise saw a double-digit dollar sales decline compared to November 2024, and Circana senior director Mat Piscatella tells me that November full game dollar sales of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 finished below those of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 last November, with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launching in the October 2024 tracking period. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is Piscatella's projection that Battlefield 6 is "extremely likely" to finish as the best-selling game of 2025 in the U.S. This would not be the only time Call of Duty didn't top the annual charts in recent memory. In 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-beats-modern-warfare-3-as-best-selling-game-of-2023-in-the-us">Hogwarts Legacy defeated Modern Warfare 3</a>, and that was with Modern Warfare 3 not launching into Game Pass. However, Black Ops 6 still dominated in 2024, and prior to that only Rockstar's GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 had been able to dethrone Call of Duty going all the way back to 2008's Rockband.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Call of Duty Campaigns</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Given all that, it's perhaps unsurprising that Activision is considering <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games">significant changes</a> to how it plans and releases its Call of Duty franchises year after year. Then again, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-just-had-the-best-month-of-sales-in-the-us-of-any-game-in-the-last-three-years">while Battlefield 6 had an incredible launch</a>, it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-lay-out-game-plan-after-winter-offensive-update-introduces-widespread-issues-across-pc-and-consoles">recently introduced an update</a> that broke the game in pretty significant ways across PC and consoles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a weird November for all, I guess. Game sales in general had a shockingly weak November in the U.S., as we covered in our larger roundup of Circana's numbers. You can see what's going on and why gaming hardware and physical software just <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-physical-software-and-hardware-sales-just-had-the-worst-november-in-the-us-since-1995">had the worst November since 1995 right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>1386043</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">November 2025 was a shockingly terrible month for video game sales in the U.S. While we traditionally think of November as a huge sales month what with Black Friday and all, November 2025 was the worst November in video game hardware unit sales, and the worst in physical software dollar sales the U.S. has seen since 1995.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's according to Circana's monthly report, which paints a pretty dismal picture of last month's commercial performance. The industry in the U.S. saw declines across the board in hardware, accessories, and console spending for an overall drop of 4% year-over-year, at $5.9 billion in total spending.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hardware</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">More specifically, hardware spending was down a whopping 27% year-over-year to $695 million, the lowest hardware spending total for November since 2005's $455 million. Even worse, unit sales reached 1.6 million, which is the lowest November total since 1995's 1.4 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's representative of declines across the board. Xbox Series hardware sales were down 70% year-over-year. PS5 sales were down over 40%, and combined unit sales of Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 were down over 10% from Switch sales last year, despite this being a launch year for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What's going on? As pointed out by Circana senior director Mat Piscatella, video game hardware has never been more expensive, reaching an all-time November high of $439 per unit, up 11% year-over-year. The Xbox specifically saw its average price per unit increase by over 30%, perhaps confirming one reason why folks aren't so keen to buy Xboxes specifically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the Nintendo Switch 2, Piscatella says he's watching its sales "very closely," and offers this analysis of its current situation:</p><blockquote>With six months in the market, it remains the fastest-selling video game hardware in U.S. history. However, part of what was driving that was its availability to be bought during its launch window. It's been extremely rare to have such a successful new device not suffer supply constraints going into its first holiday sales period. Unit sales of Switch 2 were lower than those of Switch 1 during each console's first November, but the price points are also quite different. The average price paid for a new Nintendo Switch in November 2017 was $309 (which, if adjusted for inflation, is approximately $405 in November 2025 dollars), compared to the $486 for Switch 2 in November 2025. Perhaps it is a case of demand having been pulled forward earlier in the year because people could find them. Or perhaps the mass market is not as quickly adopting Switch 2 as it did Switch. Or perhaps consumers are looking elsewhere for holiday gifting as the prices continue to rise in video game hardware. Tough to say at the moment.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">There's one piece of hardware that's doing okay, and it's not what you'd expect: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-box-that-looks-like-the-ouya-and-kinect-had-a-kid-outsold-the-ps5-in-the-us-the-week-before-thanksgiving">the NEX Playground</a>. It was the third best-selling piece of video game hardware of November by unit sales, surpassing the Xbox Series, while the more expensive Xbox Series beat it in dollar sales (the PS5 was first in both categories, the Switch 2 was second). Piscatella calls the NEX Playground a "remarkable story," noting that while everyone else is having a bad time, it just had a superb November by comparison:</p><blockquote>November 2025 tracked unit sales at U.S. retailers for NEX Playground were just 7% below its entire tracked lifetime sales at retail through October. With an average selling price of just over $200 in November, strong placement at retail, and some successful influencer and viral marketing efforts, the NEX Playground became one of the hottest video game products of the holiday season during the month. We'll have to see how well the pace can keep up, as there are reports that the NEX Playground is now largely sold out, with secondary market prices on sites like eBay soaring accordingly. </blockquote><blockquote>There could be a lesson here that more affordable, family friendly gaming devices carry appeal during holiday gifting season.</blockquote><h3 data-cy="title3">Software</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Things aren't looking much better on the content side. While Circana reports that content spending was up 1% year-over-year to $4.8 billion, that's with subscription spending rising 16% and 2% growth in mobile. Physical software sales, meanwhile, dropped 14% year-over-year to the worst November since 1995, the year Circana began tracking them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 put the Call of Duty franchise back on top for another debut month in November as the month's best-seller, marking the 18th year in a row a Call of Duty has launched to the top of the charts. That said, Circana reports that the franchise saw a double-digit percentage full game dollar sales decline when compared to November 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a little tricky to make precise comparisons between Black Ops 7 and its predecessor, Black Ops 6, given both games launched into Xbox Game Pass, and Black Ops 6 released in October last year, not November. Still, Piscatella tells me that Black Ops 7's full game dollar sales finished below those of Black Ops 6's last November. Additionally, Black Ops 7 is currently the seventh best-selling game of the year-to-date, and Piscatella anticipates that its rival, Battlefield 6, will end the year as the best-selling game of 2025. This isn't the first time in recent memory it's been beaten, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-beats-modern-warfare-3-as-best-selling-game-of-2023-in-the-us">Hogwarts Legacy coming out on top in 2023</a>. Notably, that year, Hogwarts Legacy beat Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, which did <em>not</em> launch into Game Pass, while Black Ops 7 this year did, almost certainly making its actual dollar sales total lower as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting as well that accessories spending was down 13% year-over-year.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Red Flags</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This is shaping up to be a pretty weird year. I asked Piscatella what he makes of all this, and what it means for the games industry. He pointed out that much of the story remains to be told in December, and that it's possible consumers are waiting for better deals closer to the holidays. Alternatively, it's possible that economic factors and price of consoles are pushing people to hold off on gaming purchases. Here's what Piscatella had to say:</p><blockquote>Retail spending had been holding up relatively well until now, despite the pressure from higher prices we've been seeing in the market. More affluent consumers have kept on spending so far, which has made up for some of the declines in spending from the less affluent portions of the market. Perhaps this is a sign that those higher prices are beginning to impact purchases of pricier items, like consoles. Perhaps not.</blockquote><blockquote>However, if the crunch on RAM pricing continues, if we see rising prices on consoles and gaming PCs over the coming months it could, theoretically, be potentially devastating to the dedicated gaming device market. Which would, of course, have potential carryover effects on the content side. </blockquote><blockquote>I certainly see some of the relationships between hardware unit sales and pricing we're seeing in the November results as a red flag. </blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">We won't get the December and full-year results in until January, which will tell us a lot more about whether the games industry is about to enter a lean period, or if this November was just a goofy one-off.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">November 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 (NEW)</li><li>Battlefield 6</li><li>NBA 2K26</li><li>Madden NFL 26</li><li>EA Sports FC 26</li><li>Pokemon Legends: Z-A*</li><li>Ghost of Yotei</li><li>EA Sports College Football 26</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Kirby Air Riders (NEW)*</li><li>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment (NEW)*</li><li>The Outer Worlds 2</li><li>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza*</li><li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li><li>Borderlands 4</li><li>Forza Horizon 5</li><li>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>You don’t need me to tell you that the world is a hellscape lately, but a fun thing about living in it is that it’s full of people with specific interests or niche areas of expertise, and they know all kinds of things you don’t know that you can go learn from them. Recently-released video game <em>Morse</em> is about Morse code, a very niche interest, and is even getting some people into telegraphy, an even <em>more</em> niche interest.</p><p>I feel like I’ve been hearing about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1976860/MORSE/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Morse</u></em></a> for years (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playmygame/comments/1ovfric/my_game_morse_released_yesterday_after_10_years/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>10 years</u></a>, apparently!), and it finally released in November. It’s changed quite a bit from the <a href="https://aftermath.site/steam-next-fest-demos-summer-game-fest/"><u>demo</u></a> I played last year, which featured a narrative; now, you fend off growing waves of enemy ships on a grid you navigate with Morse code.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bSLMGwQ2nsI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="MORSE - Official Launch Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>You tap out letters to move your cursor between grids and squares, all while enemy ships steadily approach from the right side of the screen. You can’t see them at first, so you need to set up mines to reveal them, or fire exploratory rounds to get a sense of what’s happening. As you move through the game, you unlock and upgrade weaponry, but things also get tougher: more ships to beat back, and more rows and columns to frantically dot-and-dash your way around.</p><p>I’ve only spent about an hour with the game, but I’ve really enjoyed its very specific mix of stressful and calm. In one way, it’s frantic; there’s way more ground to cover and problems to deal with than I feel like I can, and I’m constantly scanning the field and clicking away with my mouse to dart around. On the other hand, there’s something particularly slow about the whole thing. Tapping too fast will cause you to enter the wrong letter or nonsense instead of letters, so you need to take your time to keep from getting jumbled up. There’s a bit of a delay before you move, and shells take some time to load in. So peppered among a chaotic battle are all these micro-moments of downtime, and the whole game requires a kind of intentionality and level-headedness to succeed at that, when I pull it off, really makes me feel like I’m mastering a skill.</p><p>The ideal way to play this game, obviously, would be with an actual telegraph, which has been an option at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8KyM6g-WUw&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>festivals</u></a> but less so at home.

In an email, developer Alex Johansson said he hopes to use <em>Morse</em> to introduce more people to a hobby with an <a href="https://rsgb.org/main/publications-archives/radcom/silent-keys/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>aging</u></a> population, which is an issue I have literally never considered before–what happens if there’s no one left alive who knows Morse code? I love how such a simple little game has given me a peek into a whole world I knew nothing about, with its own customs and lingo and values. Instead of doomscrolling the news, you could be learning Morse code! Maybe the world isn’t so bad.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Templar Media is a new publisher in the video game industry that was founded earlier this year by John Gibson, former chief executive officer of the publisher and developer Tripwire Interactive. Templar Media's first published title is set to be Gate Zero, a time-travelling action-adventure game where you can "<em>play the Bible</em>," <a href="https://gatezero.game/">according to its website</a>, and today Templar Media announced it would be doing more than just publishing Gate Zero;<a href="https://templarmedia.com/templar-media-acquires-gate-zero-developer-bible-x-cementing-commitment-to-entertainment-first"> it will acquire the studio making the game, Bible X</a>.</p>



<p>Gibson, you might recall, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tripwire-appoints-new-interim-ceo-following-backlash-against-john-gibsons-views-on-abortion/">stepped down from Tripwire Interactive in 2021</a> after the studio received significant backlash due to Gibson sharing his views on abortion on X (formerly Twitter) and advocating in favour of the abortion ban that, at the time, had recently been passed by Texas.</p>



<p>Within hours of Gibson sharing his views, studios that had previously worked with Tripwire had made public statements that they would be cutting off ties to the publisher. A few short days after the tweet, Tripwire announced that Gibson would be stepping down.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>After all that, for Gibson to return with a studio called 'Templar Media,' and for the first game it publishes to be a game by a studio called Bible X, a studio they are now acquiring as they work on a game where you play as a rebellious teenager from the future who is mistakenly sent back in time and experiences Biblical stories first-hand is perhaps one of the least surprising elements of 2025.</p>



<p>All that said, it's not like Gibson, his team, and Bible X are making a game that only they want to see. Gate Zero raised $330,000 in a Kickstarter campaign to help fund the game across 4,145 donations, and over $6 million euros raised through separate donations. That's nothing to sneeze at. </p>



<p>"<em>From the moment we saw Gate Zero, we knew it had enormous potential as a high quality game that was being created for a massive, yet underserved gaming audience,</em>" said Gibson in the acquisition announcement. "<em>With this acquisition we can now apply the full experience, support and resources of Templar Media into creating the incredible ‘Entertainment First’ experience that gamers worldwide have been asking for.</em>"</p>

<p>Arve Solli, Bible X studio head, added, "<em>As proven by the commercial success of TV and movies like </em><em>The Chosen</em> and <em>The King of Kings</em>, there’s a massive audience seeking top-tier content that explores their values. With Gate Zero, we plan to meet that demand with a full-featured, story-rich video game that allows the player to explore the history and stories found in the Bible, in a grounded and historically accurate way."</p>



<p>There's currently no release date for Gate Zero, though it is slated to arrive on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 when it's ready.</p>

            <p>Steam Replay, Valve's yearly roundup of where all of the hours spent playing games in the Steamy place have gone, has emerged from its hidey-hole yet again. 2025's edition is out now - you've likely already seen it if you've hopped into Steam since yesterday afternoon. Amid all the bits telling you that you've spent 1000 hours playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/uma-musume-pretty-derby">Umamusume: Pretty Derby</a> thus far, the annual report's dished out some fresh stats about how old the games everyone across the platform's user base has been playing this year are.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To get a bit navel gazey for a second, these <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/replay/">Replays</a> usually stand more than anything to remind me how much doing this job generally warps the game playing habits of myself and my peers away from the norm. For instance, 28% of my personal playtime this year was spent on games which came out in 2025, a decent chunk more than the worldwide average of 14% across the entirety of the Steamaverse. For context, that's also with some new releases I've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review">spent a lot of time with</a> this year - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> chief among them - not having been counted as part of that total due to circumstance dictating I didn't put my hours into them via my personal Steam account.</p>
<p>That 14% figure across all Steam users is only down a single percentage point from last year's total of 15%, with 2023 and 2022's figures sitting at 9% and 17% respectively. So, things very much look to have settled into a mid-teens ball park. The game playage this year's rounded out by 44% of our collective time being dedicated to games which have been out for one to seven years and 40% being dedicated to games eight years or older.</p>
<p>Those last two also generally stack up pretty similarly to previous years, though there was a pretty weird flip-flop in terms of the largest majority from 64% of the older lot to 52% in favour of the one-to-seven crowd from 2022 to 2023. Sadly, the data doesn't go back any further than that, let alone to pre-2008 so we could see what these numbers looked like prior to the first of the approximately ten million financial belt-tightenings we've all lived through since that point.</p><p>Anyway, as a palette cleanser following that maths, here's a very tragic personal factoid. Last year, I managed a longest streak of 69 consecutive days firing up a game on Steam. It was totally by accident that this ended up being the sex number, I swear. This year, I regret to inform you that my longest streak ran to 97 days, which - aside from inferring a slightly more dire state in terms of my ability to drag myself away from my keyboard - is not a funny number.</p>
<p>And what is life if you're not accidentally racking up funny numbers whenever possible?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been playing, reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends-the-mitchells-vs-the-machines">Patrick Recommends: <em>The Mitchells vs. The Machines</em></h3><figure></figure><p>Okay, so this movie isn't new—it came out back in 2021—but it's become the latest movie my children are watching over and over and over again, to the point that sometimes they won't even watch it from the start and will instead choose a favorite part they're into, load the movie there, and watch until the credits hit.</p><p>Fuck, man, this flick makes me cry every time. Hell, I'll be on the other side of the house and start tearing up when I hear certain musical notes being hit. Which is probably not shocking to learn when you combine a sap (me) with a movie about a father and daughter relationship (also me) and a parent who hopes they'll find a way to graduate from parent to friend when their kids are older (again, also me).</p><p>Do I think I'm as obviously aloof as the dad in the movie (Danny McBride)? Of course not! I <em>know</em> I'm not! But I also don't know <em>what </em>I'll be aloof about until it's too late; it's the very nature of an evolving relationship between kids and parents.</p><p>I remember quite liking it back in 2021 but over the course of the past month, I've probably watched the movie in totality, in some mangled form, a half dozen times. And now it's gone from a movie that I liked to a movie I love and, quite frankly, probably one of my favorite animated films. It really seems to understand the complicated dynamics driving modern relationships between parents and kids in a way that has only become more relatable as my oldest becomes, well, older. (She's nine now. She would've been 5ish when the movie originally came out on Netflix. That's basically a generation of time.)</p><p>The message at its core is a good one, imo, and it's part of why I managed to have such a good relationship with my parents as I got older: they <em>saw</em> me. Or tried. The key to navigating the maturing of a kid/parent relationship, I think, is seeing one another, and for the parent, it's realizing it's your responsibility to see them before they can see you. Maybe you think they're making a mistake, maybe you don't "get" them. But say you do. You <em>try</em>. Getting that feeling back at you is going to take longer for a kid, young adult, whatever—you <em>know</em> better. You went through this already!</p><p>Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7s1tcl4fhM&amp;ref=remapradio.com">the song that plays over the soundtrack is <em>so</em> good</a>. What a bop.</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends-superman-2025">Rob Recommends: Superman (2025)</h3><figure><figcaption><span>Sad robot is sad.</span></figcaption></figure><p>I tend to find James Gunn’s stuff a little grating. Enjoyable, but a bit twee and cloyingly “feel good”. So I was not excited about his <em>Superman </em>and the way it was seen as a return to what the character “ought” to be: pure uncomplicated goodness and optimism. The moment in the trailer where a little kid in some Distant War Torn Land did the Iwo Jima flag-raising with a Superman pennant did not, to put it mildly, inspire confidence.</p><p>You know what, though? <em>Superman </em>ruled. Even that moment ends up being more nuanced than expected, as (spoilers) Supes is not going to come save that kid at that moment and the happy outcome is ambiguous even as it’s delightful.</p><p>The slightly peevish, needling dynamic between Clark and Lois? Krypto the Superdog being a little asshole chaos gremlin? Alan Tudyk doing what he does best: playing a charismatic robot? Loved all of it.</p><p>It’s also fascinating in the ways, like all great superhero movies, it reflects its moment. Superman’s parents are revealed to be would-be colonizers whose tragic backstory does not diminish their authoritarian, violent vision for how Superman should conduct himself on earth. The US government views Superman as a dangerous alien threat to its unipolar world order and banishes him to a extradimensional black site run by a private contractor. In Nicholas Hoult’s Luther and his army of STEM lackeys, the movie has the Musk cult pretty neatly dialed-in. We see Superman helping firefighters a lot. Cops and troops? Not so much. We even have an early scene where Lois nails Clark with a lot of “gotcha” questions predicated on “view from nowhere” reporting that pretends to have no memory or judgment about the subjects of its stories.</p><p>All in all, it was a pretty great thing to fire up on <em>HBO Max Plus Discovery </em>or whatever they’re calling it now. It also made me wonder: should I watch <em>Peacemaker? </em></p><hr><h3 id="chia-recommends-star-wars-rebellion-with-the-rise-of-the-empire-expansion">Chia Recommends: Star Wars Rebellion (with the Rise of the Empire Expansion) </h3><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Fantasy Flight Games</span></figcaption></figure><p>I’m a bit of a mark for most anything Star Wars, so it’s a bit of a shock to me that I’d missed out on <em>Star Wars Rebellion </em>for so long. I’d spent the better part of the late 2010s getting into and then watching the slow “death” of <em>X-Wing, </em>the miniature dogfighting game from Fantasy Flight Games that has one of the best feeling skill curves of any miniatures game I’ve ever played (you have to learn how each ship flies because unlike most minis games you can’t pre-measure your moves, which makes “piloting” feel dangerous and extremely satisfying once you’ve gotten a handle on the “feel” of a certain ship). All the while, Fantasy Flight Games were also making one of the best asymmetric two player board games I’ve played in a long time, also set in the Star Wars universe, whose thematic trappings and asymmetric mechanics are so strong that the second my first nearly 5 hour spanning game was done, I was immediately chomping at the bit to run it back.</p><p><em>Star Wars Rebellion </em>puts two players into the roles of the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance, each working towards their own specific end game goals. The Galactic Empire has to find the Rebel Base and destroy all rebels on that planet (or you know, take the death star over there and destroy the whole planet) while the Rebels have to complete specific objectives that gain them reputation. Reputation is a marker that starts at the far end of the round timer track, and if the round timer ever meets the Rebel reputation marker, then the rebels have convinced enough of the galaxy to join their cause that the Empire is overthrown.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Fantasy Flight Games</span></figcaption></figure><p>You each plan your turns out by assigning a pool of Leaders to specific mission cards, first the rebels, then the empire. This is important because each leader that doesn’t get assigned to a specific mission can be used across your turns to move your units across the board, initiating combat, or to try to counter your opponents missions. This balancing act of trying to do missions but also being cognizant that there might be something you need to contest directly gives the game a lot of strategic depth, and with the Empire being able to plan after the Rebels it gives this added layer of the Empire always knowing the shape of their opponent’s turn before they have to commit to any missions themselves. It makes the near omniscience of Empire really felt, even if they don’t know <em>what</em> you’re doing, they know <em>that</em> you’re doing something, and that’s dangerous.</p><p>The magic of this game comes from this asymmetry and the Probe Deck. Each space on the board is a different system, planets from across all sorts of Star Wars media, and each planet has a corresponding card in the Probe deck. At the start of the game, after the Empire has set up on a randomized set of Empire specific systems, the Rebel Player chooses one card out of the leftover 26 cards to designate as the rebel base. The base has it’s own separate space on the board which allows you to build and move units in and out of while at the same time keeping the actual location of the base secret. Each turn the Empire player is going to draw two new cards from the remaining 25, understanding that if you draw a card from the Probe deck that means it can’t be the rebel base, creating an inevitability dwindling amount of safe spaces to house the scrappy rebellion as the game goes on.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Fantasy Flight Games</span></figcaption></figure><p>This cat and mouse game, the feeling of slow suffocation as the Rebels, the sense of growing insurgency and popular opinion slowly turning against you as the Empire, is so strong from these mechanics alone that if you were to wholesale shift these mechanics to a different themed Oppressor vs. Oppressed setting it would still be as compelling, which makes for the best kind of franchise based game in my opinion. The <em>Star Wars </em>special sauce sprinkled on top however does give it that extra oomph that makes pulling off certain moments really sing if you’re a fan of the series. In one of my playthroughs as the Empire I was able to take Luke and turn him to the dark side, effectively stealing one of my opponents commanding pieces, while in turn they were able to kill one of my generals with Leia, who in the absence of her brother almost naturally seemed to step into his role as the Jedi in training. It’s really fun thematically, but so strong mechanically that it doesn’t lean on it’s themes to prop it up. All in all it’s an excellent way for two people to spend a really tense and exhilarating 4-6 hours, one that I’m so glad I’ve had the opportunity to enjoy.</p>

It will ship with the September-released version 2.0 update “LASTBOSS, Genius Gyaru Doctor,” as well as cross-play support. <span id="more-1015756"></span></p><p><em>UNDERWARD</em> first launched for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3025290/UNDERWARD/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on February 5, followed by PlayStation 5 on June 22.</p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>UNDERWARD</em> is a one-to-four-player cooperative horror exploration game.</p><p>Investigators must carry “TEST-SUBJECT” monsters from a deadly underground abandoned hospital ward.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Can you uncover the truth hidden deep within the depths of <em>UNDERWARD</em>?</p><p><strong>Single Play: An Extreme <a title="Genres > Stealth [106 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">Stealth</a> Challenge</strong></p><p><em>UNDERWARD</em> is also playable single play, but be warned—single play is an ultra-high-difficulty mode where getting caught means instant game over. The game includes many trial-and-error challenges, so in solo play, you’ll need to learn through death and keep progressing.</p><p>(Version 1.0.2.0 introduced extra lives and solo play adjustments for a better experience.)</p><p>Without the ability to perform chained carries, you’ll have to carefully transport your cargo while constantly fearing an enemy ambush, making for an intensely thrilling experience. You’ll need to avoid detection, watch out for traps, and proceed with extra caution. While the gameplay differs significantly from <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [665 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a>, this mode is perfect for players seeking a truly spine-chilling horror experience.</p><p><strong>Mission</strong></p><p>Explore the depths of <em>UNDERWARD</em> and carry the “TEST-SUBJECT” monsters to the elevator.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Search “Test Subjects”</strong></p><p>Once you exit the elevator, scour the floor for “TEST-SUBJECT.”</p><p>But beware—traps and dangers are lurking everywhere. Some areas and mechanisms can only be accessed by cooperating with your teammates. It’s best to avoid venturing alone if possible.</p><p>You might also find useful tools left behind in the area. Be sure to check out lockers, shelves, and any other hiding spots for gear. With luck, you may even find some highly advanced equipment.</p><p><strong>Step 2: If They See You, Run or…</strong></p><p>There’s a chance you will encounter unknown enemies during your search.</p><p>They’re attracted to noise, so stay cautious. If you hide quietly, they might pass without noticing you. Adapt to the situation as needed.</p><p>But if you get spotted, run as fast as you can! Throw items you have at them—it might just help you fend them off.</p><p>Even if someone gets taken down, there’s still hope for rescue.</p><p>Your teammate’s location will be displayed on the screen, so act quickly and stay calm. Minimizing casualties will strengthen the team bond.</p><p>But remember: the window for rescue is shrinking by the second.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Carry and Carry and Carry!</strong></p><p>Once you’ve found “TEST-SUBJECT,” carry it to the elevator with all your might.</p><p>Carrying the capsule creates a lot of noise, attracting enemies, so stay vigilant.</p><p>Although a single investigator can’t handle the heavy capsule alone, you can perform a “Connected Carry” system with multiple players to move it faster than the enemies can catch up.</p><p>However, if your teamwork falters, it could mean a one-way ticket to the afterlife.</p><p>Each “TEST-SUBJECT” has a different value.</p><p>We hope the team can retrieve the most valuable “TEST-SUBJECT” possible.</p><p><strong>Then… Deeper into the “UNDERWARD”</strong></p><p>Once you’ve met the recovery quota, proceed with the verification of the “TEST-SUBJECTS.” We will operate the elevator to the next floor, so investigators should close the elevator door and wait inside.</p><p>We take great pride in the investigators who choose to venture deeper into the more dangerous floors.</p><p>…Please note that we do not guarantee the safety of your life on this mission.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>One-to-four-player cooperative horror exploration game.</li><li>Proximity-based voice chat.</li><li>Randomized, labyrinthine underground hospital floors (with some areas that don’t feel like a hospital at all).</li><li>Deadly and seductive nurse monsters that hunt you.</li><li>Vicious hunters that can be unleashed over time.</li><li>Retrieve capsules containing “TEST-SUBJECT.”</li><li>Supply Machine System: Exchange retrieval rewards for randomized items.</li><li>“Connected Carry” system for high-speed carry with multiple players.</li><li>Various useful items that can be carried over to the next floor.</li><li>Total wipeout = all is lost.

<p dir="ltr">The Nintendo store listings note that there will be a free Switch 2 upgrade for Dispatch. That edition of the game sports "enhanced resolution and improved frame rates" and will take up an estimated 14.6GB of storage space. The listed price is $43.95 AUD--with a launch discount--but keep in mind Australian prices are usually higher than in the US. For example, <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000084767" rel="nofollow ">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on Switch 2</a> is $109.95 AUD. In comparison, Dispatch costs $30 on Steam and PS5.</p><p dir="ltr">Dispatch is one of <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000084767" rel="nofollow ">GameSpot's 10 best games for 2025</a>. The game sees you taking on the role of Robert Robertson's Mecha Man, though his suit has become damaged. As such, Robert has to adapt from working out in the field to working in a dispatch center.

                <p>For years, EA Sports was the one-stop shop for FIFA-branded soccer, but that partnership officially ended in 2023. Since then, FIFA has been absent from the video game scene, but today Netflix Games and Delphi Interactive have announced that they will be bringing officially branded FIFA soccer back in a new game slated to launch in 2026.</p><p>The unnamed FIFA soccer game will be available via the Netflix app on both iOS and Android devices, and it is planned to launch "this summer," just in time for the FIFA World Cup 2026. The official announcement calls the new game a "newly reimagined FIFA football simulation game," but no other details were provided.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624666-fifa-netflix.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624666" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624666-fifa-netflix.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624666"></a><figcaption>FIFA and Netflix Games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624666-fifa-netflix.png"></figure><p>"This major collaboration is a key milestone in FIFA’s commitment to innovation in the football gaming space, which aspires to reach billions of football fans of all ages everywhere in the world and will be redefining the pure notion of simulation games," FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in the offical announcement. "Our reimagined game truly marks the beginning of a new era of digital football."</p><p>The FIFA partnership marks the latest splash from Netflix Games, which also added WWE 2K and Grand Theft Auto to its service in recent months. Its parent company has not been quiet either, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-announces-purchase-of-warner-bros-for-over-82-billion/1100-6536717/" data-ref-id="1100-6536717">Netflix recently reaching an agreement to purchase Warner Bros.</a> for $82 billion.</p><p>Delphi Interactive is a California-based development studio headed by Casper Alexander Daugaard and ex-Zynga executive Andy Kleinman. The studio is also working in partnership with IO Interactive on 007: First Light.</p><p>More information on this new FIFA soccer game will "come in 2026."</p>

                <p>The Last of Us co-director Bruce Straley has shared his thoughts on using generative AI to aid in game development, saying the technology cannot "grow and think for itself."</p><p>The technology "just consumes, and tries to mimic what it's consumed," he told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/bruce-straley-generative-ai-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>. "That's the best it can do right now." He also described generative AI as "a snake eating its own tail."</p><p>One of the reasons why AI has been such a contentious issue in gaming is that not everyone defines it the same way. For his part, Straley said "NPCs are AI" and have been for decades already in gaming. Straley's new game, Coven of the Chickenfoot, has players taking on the role of Gertie, an elderly witch who works alongside a "creature companion" who can "observe, learn, and evelopment new behaviors based on contextual situations."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRNAbGYwvgg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mRNAbGYwvgg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This setup has led some to wonder if the creature was made using generative AI or other types of artificial intelligence technologies. But Straley said the creature was human-crafted.</p><p>"If you feed it too many bad apples, it gets indigestion and poops in the woods. These are the things you can discover, but it's because we can create a world and craft those moments," he said.</p><p>The goal was not to create a "human" companion with "human intelligence," Straley said. He pointed out that the human brain is a "miracle" and trying to replicate that in a machine isn't something Straley is interested in pursuing.</p><p>"I don't know who wants it, I don't know who's asking for it, I don't know who's pushing for it, but I don't think it's the way as a human species we need to be evolving," he said.</p><p>For Coven of the Chickenfoot, Straley said there was no machine-learning or large language models used in the game's development. "No, we did none of that. This is hard work, and a lot of problem solving, and a lot of creative thinking," he said.</p><p>Finally, Straley said he believes generative AI systems can "maybe" create compelling content in some contexts where the systems are limited to a specific game world. But Straley said he is "not interested in the slightest" to pursue this. "I have zero interest in looking at art that is generated by a computer. I don't think prompting is art. I don't like AI!" he said.</p><p>Straley <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-bruce-straley-shares-more-details-about-why-he-left-naughty-dog/1100-6536947/" data-ref-id="1100-6536947">left Naughty Dog in 2017</a> after 18 years and started a new studio, Wildflower Interactive, in 2022.</p><p>In other AI-related news, the CEO of Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian recently responded to backlash to his comments about how the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">may use AI in early-production work for Divinity.</a></p>

            <p>Arkane Studios' Harvey Smith has reflected on Microsoft's closure of the studio last year, describing it as "a shock" after its run of successes.</p>
<p>Smith was lead game designer on the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> in 2000, before eventually joining Arkane in 2008. After working as co-creative director on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>, he worked on its sequel, Prey, and the studio's final, ill-fated live-service game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/redfall">Redfall</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">studio was shut down by Microsoft in May last year</a>, following the poor sales of Redfall.</p>
<p>"Every company makes the decisions they make for the reason they make them," said Smith  on the <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console/episodes/harvey-smith-game-director-deus-ex-dishonored-redfall">My Perfect Console podcast</a>. "I don't agree with them often, but the main shock there was this studio made Dishonored, along with the Lyon studio, and then they made Prey. Then we were working on Redfall for a number of years during the pandemic and everything else. The industry exploring games-as-a-service games... It is what it is. Creative efforts are unpredictable."</p>

<p>He continued: "It was a shock at first, but who I really felt for were the people who were new, this was their first project or they'd only been in the industry for a while."</p>
<p>Smith admitted his own privilege with the situation considering his years of experience and the ups and downs he's worked through, but lamented the loss of junior staff through studio closures and layoffs for whom developing the game was a "mind-blowing experience".</p>
<p>"It was a shock," he said. "It was not a decision I agreed with. I did believe very much in the future of the studio, we were working on something super cool."</p>
<p>At least, the studio was able to release its 1.4 update to Redfall after the announcement of its closure, what Smith described as a "huge upgrade to the game". "If we had launched with that and then built from there it might have been a different story," he said, adding the update allowed the team to get "as close as we could" to the vision of the game.</p>
<p>Smith also discussed the difficulties of receiving feedback from players online, which perhaps led to the downfall of Redfall and the studio - particularly the "vitriol" on social media.</p>
<p>"I feel like video game developers get it worse," he said, comparing the reaction to games to that of artists or musicians. "You release your game, it took years to get there, maybe it flops, maybe it does ok, maybe people hate it. Even if they love it, there's a social media caustic, acidic vitriol that gets thrown at you. And every time you ship a game there's always going to be that, every time there's that vitriol no matter what you do. Then you hope that the number of people who love it swamp that, overwhelm it."</p>
<p>Before Dishonored, Smith said he worked on a couple of games at Arkane that never saw the light of day. One of those was a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> game, which certainly would've suited him well after Deus Ex.</p>
<p>"We were working for a while on a Blade Runner game, which was super exciting to me. What we could have done with Blade Runner…," he said, before tailing off. Alas, perhaps we'll never know.</p>
<p>After Redfall's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-apologises-for-redfalls-disastrous-launch-we-let-a-lot-of-people-down-this-week">Microsoft Gaming boss Phil Spencer apologised for its disastrous launch</a>. "We let a lot of people down this week," he said.</p>
<p>"Arkane's vampire thriller is muddled and deeply compromised, but has moments of real charm," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-review-a-bit-of-a-mess-but-not-without-its-pleasures">Redfall review</a>.</p>

You don't need yet <em>another</em> reason to pick up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, right? Well, you know us, we're here to deliver the goods.</p>
<p>GameStop has announced that it will be issuing a free tote bag (gasp!) for in-store pre-orders for Requiem on all available platforms. It depicts the ruined landscape of Racoon City with the game's title at the top. Form an orderly queue folks, come on now!</p>

<p>Look, to be serious for a moment, we know it's not the coolest pre-order bonus ever, but heck, it's free. For diehard fans of the series, it could be a cool little thing to hang off the end of a shelf, or something. We're grasping, sure, but still...</p>
<p>Regardless of where you wind up purchasing it, Resident Evil Requiem will launch on the Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>. It sees the return of veteran Leon Kennedy and the introduction of FBI agent Grace Ashcroft, whose mother – Alyssa – was a key character in the classic PS2 title, Resident Evil: Oubreak.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/845376/xbox-games-pass-best-games-2025</link>
            <guid>1385941</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>From <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/693535/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-xbox">pervasive layoffs</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">continued price hikes</a>, things didn’t go so well for Xbox in 2025. But even though Game Pass, the Xbox subscription service, isn’t quite the deal it once was, there are still a lot of excellent titles to check out. This was an especially good year for indie titles, with breakout hits like <em>Blue Prince</em> and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> dominating much of the conversation. Here are the best things to check out right now.</p><p>Who the heck knows when Bethesda will finally release the next <em>Elder Scrolls</em>. But in the meantime, <em>Avowed</em> fills in that gap quite nicely. It’s a more contained fantasy RPG in terms of scale, but it’s still pretty big, and features a fascinating world to explore and combat that lets you mix and match with swords, guns, and magic. You can lose yourself in it without giving up all of your free time.</p><p>For some people, the idea of a game where you play as a sentient lighthouse solving puzzles in a world devoid of people is probably enough of a sales pitch. For everyone else, let me just say: <em>Keeper</em> is an incredible puzzle-platform game and unlike almost anything else I’ve ever played. Perhaps most impressive is that it’s constantly shifting, so that once you come to grips with its weirdo world, it changes into something new and different.</p><p>What really sets this action-adventure game apart is its distinct world. <em>South of Midnight</em> is set in the deep South, and weaves together Black and southern folklore and culture to create the kind of setting you almost never see in video games. On your quest you’ll fight various monsters and creatures in order to heal a blighted landscape, which involves wielding magic powers and partnering with a sentient stuffed toy.</p><p>One of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837245/expedition-33-was-the-most-popular-third-party-game-on-game-pass-this-year-rightly-so">most popular games on Game Pass this year</a> seemingly came out of nowhere. Developed by a brand-new studio called Sandfall Interactive, <em>Clair Obscur</em> is built in the mold of classic Japanese role-playing games like <em>Final Fantasy</em>, but with a distinctly French sense of style. Its mixture of sweeping story, incredible soundtrack, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/656552/clair-obscur-expedition-33-battles">open-ended combat</a> helped it stand out in a very crowded genre.</p><p>More than a decade in the making, <em>Routine</em> is a harsh sci-fi horror game with a very old-school sense of style inspired by the <em>Alien </em>films. That means lots of chunky retrofuturistic gadgets to get your hands on, and a very bleak and terrifying moon base to explore — if you can summon the guts.</p><div><p id="fallout-4-anniversary-edition"><h2><em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em></h2></p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/844926/fallout-season-2-review-amazon-prime-video">The return of the <em>Fallout</em> TV series</a> means there’s a good chance you’ll be looking to explore the post-apocalyptic wasteland in video game form, too. This new edition of <em>Fallout 4</em> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/9/9693246/fallout-4-review-ps4-xbox-pc">which first released back in 2015</a> — brings together the base game and all of the previous DLC, but otherwise mostly leaves the experience intact. As they say, war never changes.</p><p>How much time do you have? Because the thing about <em>Blue Prince</em> is that, if it gets its hooks in you, it’s going to be very hard to put down. The architectural puzzle game has you exploring a vast mansion at the same time you build it, all in an attempt to uncover its secrets and find an inheritance you’re owed.</p><p>We called this “the feel-good game of the summer,” which should make <em>Wheel World</em> ideal for the gloomy and grey winter months. It’s an open-ended adventure where you bike your way through a fantasy world in order to perform an ancient ritual, which involves assembling a bicycle of legend. Mostly, though, it’s a peaceful way to take in some beautiful sights while speeding down the street.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/845376/xbox-games-pass-best-games-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There won’t be any prizes for correctly guessing that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>’s first expansion, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-first-big-expansion-sea-of-sorrow-flows-into-our-lives-for-free-next-year">Sea of Sorrow</a>, will involve a) a sea and b) some kind of adverse emotion. But there is mounting evidence that the watery DLC will restore, or at be inspired by, places and bugs that developers Team Cherry had previously left on Silksong’s cutting room floor – yet had been shown in in marketing for the main game as far back as 2019.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>All credit for this goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD0EZHwb9Zo">YouTube’s Hollow Knight loremaster Mossbag</a>, along with the loveable sickos that maintain the (non-Fextralife) <a href="https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Cut_Content_(Silksong)">Hollow Knight wiki</a>. Mossbag’s rain-lashed compass points towards Sea of Sorrows being at least partially based on <a href="https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Cut_Content_(Silksong)/Areas">Pharloom Bay</a>, which according to early development materials, would have been plopped at the far east of Silksong’s map, next to (eurghh) Bilewater. Pharloom Bay never made it into the game that finally released in September this year, but there is a distinctly nautical-lookin’ region shown at 1:13 in Silksong’s original reveal trailer, covered in barnacles and housing at least one conch-dwelling NPC:</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFAknD_9U7c">
</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFAknD_9U7c" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>

<p>That area was never found in-game either, so it’s a pretty safe bet this was meant to be Pharloom Bay. And, as Mossbag notes, that old footage also shows the area being lit by distinct scythe-shaped bell lamps of an almost identical design to the lashed structures we see in the very first shot of Sea of Sorrow’s own teaser.</p><figure>

<p>Pharloom Bay might not be the only resurrected concept, either. The mysterious, lightning-struck glass chamber shown halfway through the Sea of Sorrow trailer looks an awful lot like the Lifeblood Spire, another cut area that’s been documented since before Silksong’s release. Specifically, by helpful Australians, who <a href="https://x.com/arfa2706/status/2000736787040203098">snapped photos</a> of a Hollow Knight exhibit at Melbourne’s ACMI (Australian Centre for the Moving Image) museum in Melbourne. That one never made it into a trailer so, y’know, cheers mates.</p>
<p>I absolutely don’t want to sound like I’m disdaining the practice of developers recycling ideas for DLC or expansions. If anything, it’s quite cool to see individual concepts float in and out of the gamesmaking process, and to wonder – aloud, sometimes – how they might’ve changed in the meantime. Silksong itself has another interesting example of this, which I’ll spell out if you don’t mind light spoilers. See the coral-coated, seemingly underwater environment at 0:23 in the reveal trailer? Seasoned skongers will know that colourful design only accounts for a tiny, optional segment of the game’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-act-3">infamously tricky final act</a>, but paying attention to lore snippets will reveal that Team Cherry reworked the wider region into the Sands of Karak: the same coral kingdom hinted at in the earlier trailer, but lost to time, dried out, and claimed by the desert.</p>
<p>Whether or not Pharloom Bay has been as drastically rejigged, Sea of Sorrow is currently aiming for release in 2026. Like the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>’s expansions, it’ll be free to owners of the base game.</p>

              <p>LEGO sets is a holiday gifting staple that works for kids and adults but as Christmas approaches, finding products that actually arrive before December 25th becomes increasingly critical. This <em>Hogwarts Castle and Grounds</em> building set <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/">currently sells for $140 on Amazon, down from its regular $169 price</a>, and more importantly, it ships with guaranteed delivery before Christmas through Amazon’s fast shipping network.</p>
<p>This 2,660-piece display model recreates the most iconic location from the Harry Potter universe in impressive detail which makes it perfect for adult collectors and Harry Potter fans.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full Castle Recreation with Amazing Detail</h2>
<p>The model shows how complicated the architecture of Hogwarts Castle is by including the <strong>Main Tower, Astronomy Tower, Great Hall, several courtyards, bridges, greenhouses, the Boathouse, and even the Black Lake</strong>. Each part fits together to make a complete picture of the castle grounds that matches the size and layout fans know from the books and movies.</p>
<p>The castle’s interior details make famous places come to life, like the <strong>Chamber of Secrets</strong> with its snake-shaped architecture, the Winged Key room from the Philosopher’s Stone challenges, the Potions Classroom where Snape scared students, and the Chessboard Chamber with its checkered floor pattern. These hidden details are worth looking for closely, and they add depth to the model beyond its impressive shape.</p>



<p>The grounds around the castle add to the experience by including important parts of the larger Hogwarts setting. The Durmstrang Ship is ready to take students who are visiting, and the Beauxbatons Carriage is a nice touch that fits with the story of the Triwizard Tournament. The Whomping Willow is standing there with its unique twisted branches, and the crashed Ford Anglia is nearby as a nod to Chamber of Secrets.</p>



<p>One of the best things about the model is how good it looks: When finished, <strong>it is over 8.5 inches tall, 13.5 inches wide, and 10 inches deep</strong> and the castle stands out on a shelf, desk, or display area without taking up too much space or needing a whole bookcase to hold it. The gold-colored Hogwarts architect statue mini-figure that comes with it is the icing on the cake, and the <em>“Hogwarts Castle”</em> nameplate makes it a collectible display piece.</p>
<p>You’re saving here almost $30 on a big LEGO set that has a lot of pieces and detail for the price. In this size range, LEGO sets that are similar to castles or buildings usually cost the same or more, so this deal is a good deal for adults who like LEGO and the promise of delivery before Christmas takes away the stress of ordering gifts so close to the holiday.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[It’s Horrifying Just How Little Time Steam Users Spend Playing New Games]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Just about every app you use will be serving up its own equivalent of Spotify Wrapped right about now. This morning the New York Times Puzzle app humiliated me with the news that I mostly solve yellow first in <em>Connections</em>, and my average&nbsp;<em>Wordle</em> guess rate is 3.97. Thanks for that. Also joining in once more is Steam, with its fourth annual Steam Replay, summarizing your year in PC gaming with fun stats and details on every game you played. And if you’re a part of the vast majority, that won’t be including any games from 2025. In fact, nearly half of you will have dodged games released since 2017.</p> <p>Alongside your own stats and details, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/replay/">Steam Replay</a> measures you against the average Steam user, and in doing so reveals some extraordinary statistics about how people really play games. So where the page tells you about how many achievements you unlocked this year, it’ll compare that to the median of just 11, or how the average longest streak of days on which games are played is only 6. Then there’s the really astonishing fact that the median user of Steam plays just <em>four</em> games a year.</p>

 <p>Not “buys” but “plays.” And given the frequent Steam sales that mean squillions of games are available for as little as a dollar, and the ease with which multiple free games can be played, to get an average as low as four suggests <em>vast</em> numbers of Steam users are playing far, far fewer than that.</p>

 <p>Then comes perhaps the most shocking statistic. Where you’re told how much time you spent playing games released in 2025 (mine was 58 percent), you’re told that the average percentage is just 14. Of all the time all Steam users (estimated to be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1i4bez6/epyllion_estimates_steam_to_have_over_185m/">around 185 million people in September 2024</a>) play games, just a seventh is on a game from this year.</p>

 <p>But it gets more extraordinary. 40 percent of playtime from all Steam users is spent in games released eight or more years ago, with 44 percent spent in games one to seven years old. Now, that doesn’t directly correlate to 84 percent of people <em>only</em> playing ages-old games, but it demonstrates a strong bias toward them olden days. Given that <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dota 2</em>, and <em>PUGB</em> dominate the top of the Most Played Games data by some margin on a daily basis, perhaps this shouldn’t be quite so surprising, but it still feels bonkers.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654167" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654167"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654167">© Steam / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>These numbers do seem to swing around a little wildly. Last year it was 37 percent of time spent with eight-year-old games and 15 percent with new releases, and you might suggest it makes sense for this to have slightly shifted with a bunch more games slipping into the 8+-years-old range, but then jump back to 2022 and a colossal <em>64 percent</em> of time was spent with the oldest games, and only 19 percent on games from one to seven years back. Wild stuff.</p> <p>I’ve done my best to counter this with 205 games played, of which 183 were new in 2025, but then I’m perhaps rather cheating by this being my job. But seriously, people, there are&nbsp;<em>so</em> many great new games to try! Yes, get your&nbsp;<em>Dota</em> time in, but please make sure not to miss out on, you know, [broad sweeping gesture to the entirety of <em>Kotaku</em>‘s output].</p>
