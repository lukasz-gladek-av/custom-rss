            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-cool-boarders</link>
            <guid>1435669</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Hamster Corporation is on something of a winning streak, with the fantastic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-arcade-archives-game-on-nintendo-switch-plus-our-top-picks">Arcade Archives</a> series continually dusting off and polishing hundreds of notable games from the annals of history. Well, those wizards are back with the fresh <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/hamsters-console-archives-starting-lineup-revealed-includes-more-than-10-titles">Console Archives</a> brand, and the now 30-year-old ‘radical’ PlayStation sports game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-cool-boarders">Cool Boarders</a> is one of the first. Yes, 1996, three whole years before anything <strong>Tony Hawk</strong>-related would reach consoles.</p>
<p>Much like the difference between skateboarding and snowboarding, in Cool Boarders, your character feels heavy, and your movements must be slow and deliberate if you want to pull off tricks. All this while carving fresh powder to avoid hitting trees or plummeting to a mountainous death. 'B' lets you jump, which will build speed and help you initiate tricks when leaping off heights. Meanwhile, 'Y' works as the Drift button, letting you quickly change direction and better handle corners.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you are aiming to either get the highest trick score or the best time on each of the courses. You’ll start out meagrely, shrugging yourself off a ledge and maybe pulling off a 180, but there’s a high skill ceiling waiting to be found. When you ready a jump, the amount of time you press and hold a directional button before you leap dictates how fast you spin. Combine this with a Grab by holding 'R', and with a bit of patience, you’ll be hurtling down courses while pulling off sick 900 Nosegrabs.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the stubborn gameplay is accentuated with great and suitably audacious '90s music, and some silly but nostalgic sound effects and narration. But, compared to its favourably reviewed peer, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/1080d_snowboarding">1080 Snowboarding</a>, Cool Boarders doesn't quite compete in either the pure fun of the gameplay or the amount of content.</p>
<p>Hamster has preserved the visuals beautifully, glitches and all. Here, the PS1 original's 240p pixels are polished and presented faithfully, especially compared to the smooth anti-aliasing sheen found in the 2024 PS5 version, but anyone hoping for any upscaling options is out of luck. You can play around with the aspect ratio, either to fill the screen or condense it to perfect-pixel parity, but there's not much in the way of borders or other presentation options. However, the emulation seems to run perfectly, with no noticeable drops in frame rate or frame pacing, and thankfully, the CRT filters are gorgeous.</p>
<p>One issue is that while there is Quick Save and Quick Load, I would have just preferred a rewind option, or something as wild as the ability to slow the game's speed. I mapped the Save/Load buttons to the controller, but it still got things muddled up. Rewind would feel better, especially in a game where one mistake can ruin a run.</p>
<p>Neither the visuals nor the gameplay has aged as gracefully as 1080, but Hamster has done good work in presenting the snowy vistas and demanding gameplay for the modern day. Cool Boarders is a blast to play for short sessions, especially if you loved it back in the '90s, and while a couple of extra options might have been nice, this is the best way to play this beloved early entry in the ‘extreme’ sports genre.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-cool-boarders]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-update-1-2-1-adds-limited-time-modes-and-new-map/</link>
            <guid>1435660</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Updates have been announced for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6 </a>in version 1.2.1.0</p>



<p>The Battlefield Communications team announced the next major update to the game. This next update adds new weapons, the “Contaminated” map, new limited-time modes, and more.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-modes-coming-to-battlefield-6">New Modes Coming to Battlefield 6</h2>



<p>The update, scheduled to go live on February 17, adds new modes. These limited-time modes are built around a new psychoactive weapon, VL-7</p>



<p>VL-7 Strike is a limited-time mode where psychoactive smoke spreads across select areas in multiplayer and REDSEC. Players must wear masks and carefully manage their filters, as running out will leave them vulnerable to the disorienting effects of VL-7.</p>











<h2 id="h-map-and-mode-fixes-weapon-balancing-coming-in-new-update">Map and Mode Fixes, Weapon Balancing Coming in New Update</h2>



<p>The update fixes numerous map exploits, traversal issues, capture logic problems, and world reset bugs across Conquest, Breakthrough, Strikepoint, Gauntlet, and other modes.</p>



<p>Additionally, the update delivers a broad recoil tuning pass across automatic weapons, alongside targeted balance fixes to improve consistency, clarity, and long-term weapon handling.</p>







<p>Other issues related to Portal stability, audio, and more were addressed. Players can check out the full statement <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/2022340361868198355?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/waymo-ai-taxi-robocars-close-doors-pay-doordash-drivers-atlanta-real-2000668711</link>
            <guid>1435591</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Robotaxi car company Waymo and food delivery app DoorDash confirmed that, yes, they are working together to send people out to close car doors left open by careless riders. We live in a sad and horrible future.</p> <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorDash_Dasher/comments/1r170zc/craziest_offer/">a Reddit post from a DoorDash driver went semi-viral</a> as it seemingly showed the app offering the user $6.25 to go drive a few blocks and close a Waymo door that was left open. Once the task was completed and verified, the driver would be paid an additional $5. The user had never seen an offer like this before and asked others if they had been asked to go close a robotaxi’s door. Some even wondered if the driver was faking the order entirely for some odd reason. But nope, this is real.</p>   <p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/waymo-is-asking-doordash-drivers-to-shut-the-doors-of-its-self-driving-cars/"><em>TechCrunch</em> reached out</a>&nbsp;to Waymo and DoorDash about the post, and the two companies confirmed they are indeed working together and paying people to close doors.</p> <p>“Waymo is currently running a pilot program in Atlanta to enhance its AV fleet efficiency. In the rare event a vehicle door is left ajar, preventing the car from departing, nearby Dashers are notified, allowing Waymo to get its vehicles back on the road quickly,” said the companies in a joint statement.</p>

 <p>Yes, this means that DoorDashers are getting paid to close doors on vehicles that are designed to one day replace them and other drivers completely. But hey, $11 is nice, I guess. And maybe the robots will remember the ones who closed the doors for them and be nicer to them when they run everything.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-release-date-netflix-songs-2000668712</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-netflix-release-date-2029-2000641414"><span>getting a sequel</span></a><span>, and since it’s going to take a long time to animate, it’s going to take a long time before it eventually arrives on Netflix. For a time, the movie was projected to come out in 2029, a good four years after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381"><span>the original blew up last year</span></a><span>. But now, it sounds like it might take even longer than that.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/sony-kpop-demon-hunters-2-spider-verse-pressure-3-goat-1236503016/"><i><span>The Hollywood Reporter</span></i></a><span>, Sony Pictures Animation president Kristine Belson didn’t say much about </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters 2</span></i><span>, but did heavily imply that the planned 2029 date is probably not going to pan out. When </span><i><span>THR</span></i><span> said that a 2029 release seemed “far-fetched,” Belson responded by, as the outlet describes, placing “her pointer finger to her nose, to indicate that’s correct thinking.” Could we be waiting until 2030? 2031? That’s brutal.</span></p>

 <p><span>From the sound of it, even in these very early stages the team has been so busy during awards season that directors Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans have had little time to buckle down on the project. </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>has been doing very well at award shows, with wins at the Academy Awards and the Grammys, among many others. I guess all that flying back and forth between different events does have a way of complicating things. Larian expressed </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-too-many-awards-winning-larian-goty-1851593323"><span>a similar sentiment when </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>was winning a bunch of awards</span></a><span> after it launched in 2023, which had staff out of the office and at award shows so much it got in the way of the studio’s work.</span></p> <p><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters 2 </span></i><span>has a lot of potential threads to follow whenever it does eventually come out. The first movie doesn’t end on a cliffhanger, per se, but </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-theories-questions-netflix-2000620717"><span>there are a lot of character beats it only briefly touches on</span></a><span> that could be expanded into a full-blown sequel. </span></p>

(And yes, you can remove those red Virtual Boy lenses.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Viewing the four classic Switch games in their VR modes, players are treated to a VR effect, and can look around naturally by moving their head — which is tracked by the console's motion sensors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Does Nintendo intend for you to use your new Virtual Boy accessory this way? It's debatable. On the one hand, using the actual Virtual Boy accessory for this is a little difficult, since it is designed to sit on a flat surface, removing your ability to look around easily. On the other, VGC notes that Breath of the Wild's Switch 2 upgrade retains its VR mode option, so perhaps this was the plan all along. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo will officially launch its Virtual Boy Nintendo Classics collection next week on February 17, which you'll need a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription on either Switch or Switch 2 to access. You'll also need a Virtual Boy ($99.99) or cardboard Virtual Boy ($24.99) accessory, sold via the My Nintendo Store. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Virtual Boy for Nintendo Switch</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As of next week, the Virtual Boy library will arrive with the following games:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Galactic Pinball</li><li>Teleroboxer</li><li>RED ALARM</li><li>Virtual Boy Wario Land</li><li>3-D Tetris</li><li>Golf</li><li>The Mansion of Innsmouth

No, probably not," IGN wrote after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/virtual-boy-on-switch-2-discovering-nintendos-greatest-failure">going face-on with the Virtual Boy accessories recently</a>. "There are only seven of them to play at launch, and they are more enjoyable from a historical perspective than an entertainment one. You could buy seven superior indie games for 100 bucks that come in more than just one color. But if you love exploring wacky bygones from past eras and want a really cool accessory to display in your game room, you’ll probably really like the new Virtual Boy like I did."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

      <p>This week, Gita and Luke are joined by Brendan Caldwell of the new independent media website <a href="https://www.jank.cool/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jank.Cool</u></a>, which has maybe the best domain name of all time.</p><p>Jank is a website about PC gaming, started by Caldwell and his colleagues from Rock, Paper, Shotgun, John Hicks and Graham Smith. As far as I can tell, it is also a website for absolute sickos. It features blogs about <a href="https://www.jank.cool/three-game-devs-climb-a-mountain/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>forcing game developers to play <em>Peak </em>while answering interview questions</u></a>; <a href="https://www.jank.cool/i-wish-videogame-culture-would-take-more-cues-from-readers/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>taking more cues from book reading nerds</u></a>; and just <a href="https://www.jank.cool/its-a-car-mechanic-sim-where-your-mates-do-all-the-work/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>straight up torturing your friends in a video game about running a car shop</u></a>. Other than the website you are reading currently, this is the platonic ideal of a website about video games.</p><p>We also discussed Luke's life of constantly being attacked by Magpies, Gita’s frustrations with the romances in Cyberpunk 2077, the trials and tribulations of having your own website, and then Gita’s cat Ella meows directly in the mic, sidetracking everyone.</p>

<p>As shared on the movie's official <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DUtDqY9gExC/">socials</a>, the poster shows Nintendo's prized plumber in his iconic Galaxy 'spin' pose. A heap of enemies soar through the clouds behind him, with Spike, Piranha Plant, Koopa Paratroopers, Lakitu and even Sledge Bro making an appearance.</p>
<p>"Same hero, new adventure. Mario returns in The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, only in theaters April 1," the accompanying caption reads — hey, it's always nice to have a reminder about that release date moving forward.</p>

<p>We last got an extended look at The Super Mario Galaxy Movie in last month's dedicated Direct presentation, where we were <em>officially</em> introduced to Yoshi. A handful of smaller 'teaser' trailers have since been released, showcasing a little more Yoshi and giving us another look at that Odyssey dinosaur.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-will-reportedly-headline-februarys-ps-plus-extra-games/">Leaked earlier in the week by Dealabs</a> and confirmed at yesterday's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">State of Play</a></strong>, the latest web-swinging adventure from <strong>Insomniac Games</strong>, 2023's <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</strong> is the headlining title for the February 2026 batch of <strong>PS Plus Extra</strong> games entering the Game Catalog. It enters the library of games that players have access to through their subscription, alongside <strong><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-february-marvels-spider-man-2-test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-neva-season-a-letter-to-the-future-and-more/">eight other games</a></strong>, including several of the more notable indie releases from the last few years.</p>



<p>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 wasn't the only game that was leaked ahead of this batch's official confirmation. <strong>Neva</strong> and <strong>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</strong> were also part of the leak, with the remaining seven games being surprises. </p>



<p>All of the games entering the PS Plus Extra Game Catalog this month will be available as of <strong>February 17, 2026</strong>. Of the nine joining the library, <strong>four</strong> of them are indie titles that you should take the time to check out if you've not played them before, particularly if you're a fan of strong narrative storytelling. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/venba/"><strong>Venba</strong>,</a> Neva, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/season-a-letter-to-the-future/"><strong>Season: A Letter to the Future</strong>,</a> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/echoes-of-the-end-review/">Echoes of the End</a></strong> are all indie games worth checking out, especially as games you can play as part of a larger subscription.</p>



<p>While Echoes of the End may be the weakest of the bunch in terms of its narrative chops, it does have more action-focused gameplay and a few puzzle mechanics that could keep you intrigued. This version of the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-the-end-enhanced-edition-free-update-improves-combat-and-more/">is also a much better one than what we played at launch</a> when we reviewed it, where it still featured several glaring technical and design issues. </p>



<p>Two other notable entries in this month's batch are the first two <strong>Monster Hunter Stories</strong> titles, which arrive just in time for anyone who has been intrigued by trailers for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2/">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a></strong> but missed the first two games.</p>



<p>As for PS Plus Premium subscribers, they are only getting one game in this batch of releases, which is <strong>Disney Pixar's Wall-E</strong>, a game made by <strong>Asobo Studio</strong> that first arrived on the PlayStation 2 back in 2008.</p>

<figcaption><em>Reanimal </em>is getting hammered on Steam over its lack of a Friend Pass.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Friend Pass does appear to be available on PS5 and Switch 2, so it's PC (and Xbox Series X|S) players who are missing out here, even if they do want to play with their buddies on those platforms.</p><p>Players are <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199468943824/recommended/2129530/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">pointing</a> to the lack of a Friend Pass as a critical issue for them; <em>Reanimal </em>is, at least in part, being sold on its co-op nature, so the fact that such a crucial feature for co-op play is <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/yveris/recommended/2129530/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">missing</a> serves as a reason to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/MooseSteakIsNeverAMistake/recommended/2129530/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">criticize the game</a> for many.</p><p>Rest assured, though, that if you're one of the people waiting for the Friend Pass, Tarsier Studios and THQ Nordic are working on it. In a Steam Community <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2129530/discussions/0/796709978759015686/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">post</a>, the publisher says the PC Friend Pass "will come later today" and that it's the team's "top priority".</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Reanimal</em>, it's the latest game from <em>Little Nightmares </em>creator Tarsier Studios, and like the developer's previous work, it pits helpless characters against untold horrors in an obscure world full of grotesque creatures.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does God of War Sons of Sparta Have Co-op or Multiplayer?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-co-op-multiplayer/</link>
            <guid>1435543</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The confusion surrounding co-op and/or multiplayer being present in God of War Sons of Sparta at launch was so big that it threatened to consume Olympus itself. If you’re also wondering the same thing, we’ve got the latest on the co-op controversy.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/god-of-war/" id="106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a> games have always been without co-op or multiplayer—apart from Ascension’s additional multiplayer add-on. Traditionally, every Greek and Norse tale has revolved around our sometimes bearded, sometimes goatee’d God of War on his lonesome.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-2/" id="3594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sons of Sparta</a>‘s marketing and advertising have made everyone think twice, though.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-in-co-op-or-multiplayer">Can You Play God of War Sons of Sparta in Co-op or Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Disappointment, boy. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Officially, there seems to be no way to play God of War Sons of Sparta with another player in co-op or multiplayer, and it’s unclear if this is an accident or a bug.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, the reveal trailer only showed Kratos battling alone; no second person was controlling Deimos. Which begs the question: Why do people think Sons of Sparta has local or some sort of online co-op multiplayer (there’s 100% no competitive multiplayer, that’s for sure)?</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-trophy-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Complete God of War Sons of Sparta Trophy List</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The official PlayStation Store listing for God of War Sons of Sparta CLEARLY states that up to “1-2 players” can enjoy the game in “Offline play.”</p>



<p>Again, just to reiterate, there is <em>no</em> online component.</p>



<p>If you check Reddit, X, and various forms of social media, you’ll see that many players have bought Sons of Sparta on the pretense that the 2026 God of War title has co-op integration.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has done some testing and tinkering, and there is simply <strong>no way to play co-op in Sons of Sparta so far</strong>. </p>



<p>Leaving us to assume one of three things:</p>



<ul>
<li>God of War Sons of Sparta NEVER had co-op, and it’s a miscommunication issue falsely letting consumers believe it’s the case.</li>



<li>God of War Sons of Sparta DOES have co-op, but it’s currently bugged and not working as intended.</li>



<li>God of War Sons of Sparta DOES have co-op, but you need to unlock it somehow.</li>
</ul>



<p>Realistically, the most likely outcome is the <strong>first explanation</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-ever-get-co-op-or-multiplayer">Will God of War Sons of Sparta Ever Get Co-op or Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, your guess is as good as anyone’s, as neither PlayStation nor Santa Monica has commented on the co-op confusion, at the time of writing.</strong></p>



<p>You’d think something this big would’ve been addressed quite quickly if it were a simple bug. More than likely, it’s a misunderstanding, and the game was not intended to have co-op.</p>

</ul>



<p>That’s not to say Sons of Sparta won’t get a co-op mode in the future, and maybe it’s even being worked on behind the scenes. You’ll have to enjoy GOW Sons of Sparta as a single-player title until any announcement or confirmation.</p>

<figure data-uuid="4b32181d91b66"><a title="Pokemon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4b32181d91b66/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>27th February marks the anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon Red</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_green">Green</a> in Japan, but this year's event is an extra special one: the Pokémon series is turning 30 years old.</p>
<p>Yes, that little RPG about catching cute and not-so-cute monsters and doing battle with your pals has been going for three entire decades. In that time, it's evolved from mere gaming phenomenon that rejuvenated interest in Nintendo's Game Boy seven years after it launched to the world's biggest media property.</p>
<p>'If in doubt, stick a Pikachu in/on it' probably <em>isn't</em> a mantra at The Pokémon Company, but you'd be forgiven for thinking it is, given the proliferation of that particular 'mon across every facet of the franchise. The series' success, though, goes well beyond the near-universal appeal of the electric yellow mega mouse who became its mascot.</p>
<p>Anyone who's <em>ever</em> been a Pokémon fan has a story that sticks in their mind; a particular Pocket Monster you caught and named, a story moment that stuck with you, a tense, skin-of-your-teeth battle you triumphed in, or a more personal memory about where you were in your own life's story while playing Pokémon.</p>
<p>Or maybe something outside the games entirely! With the anime, TCG, and the wider world of Pikachu and co., it's become so much more than <em>just</em> the games.</p>

<p>Now, Red/Green/Blue/Yellow recollections are more than welcome, but we want to hear from you <em>whenever</em> you jumped on the Pokéwagon, whether you were there with your DMG-01 Day One, hopped aboard with a dual-screen console, got into the series more recently on Switch, or anywhere in between.</p>
<p>If you'd like to contribute and be in with a chance of having your memory shared, check out the submission instructions below. Remember, short and sweet is the name of the game! (Actually, <strong>Pokémon Short &amp; Sweet</strong>... y'know, that's not bad.)</p>

<li><strong>Remember, we can't pick 'em all!</strong> - We imagine we'll have a <em>lot</em> to choose from, so please understand if yours doesn't feature in the finished article. We will be reading 'em all, though!</li>

            <p>Brutal boss battler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a>'s first major post-release patch has arrived today, February 13th. Among its array of tweaks is a "partial" fix for a pretty serious issue - it sometimes being impossible for your character to down any healing elixirs in battle.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's not difficult to imagine such an occurrence being a source of serious frustration in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh">Nioh</a>, far, wherever you are, but if you had any doubts Sherif from our network mates <a href="https://www.vg247.com/nioh-3-patch-1-03-01-elixir-healing-bug-crash-fixes">VG247</a> has personally testified as much in pointing out the fix. I'd have asked our very own Jeremy to get double verification on this, however, knowing that the game pushed him to the point that he put a hole in his desk while playing it for review, I've decided to spare him the displeasure of having to recall any points when his healing abilities might have gone AWOL.</p>
<p>Beyond that and a bunch of other fixes - some of which are for specific bugs affecting bosses like Takasugi Shinsaku, Minamoto no Yoritomo, and Kajiwara Kagetoki - Koei Tecmo have made some broader adjustments to the game with this patch, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3681010/view/565900410925088838?l=english">version 1.03.01</a>. They've "greatly increased the Health of enemies in the Training Ground Battle Scroll and made it possible to pray at the shrine during battle" and "made changes so a backup copy of save data will be automatically generated when the player loads save data".</p>
<p>Personally, my favourite not from the patch is this one: "Fixed an issue where if the player selected 11, 32, 33, or 43 under Base Hair in Character Creation, they would be able to select 14 under "Hair - Back of Head (Top)" even if the hair was floating above the head." Begone, misbehaving trims.</p><p>Despite the toll it took on his furniture, Jeremy opted to give Nioh 3 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nioh-3-review-a-superb-blend-of-soulslike-splendour">a bestest best</a>. "Wonky performance aside, Nioh 3 is excellent," he wrote. It's not as elegant and practiced as FromSoftware's efforts, and I daresay that the creativity present in recent Chinese soulslikes like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-walkthrough">Black Myth: Wukong</a> isn't matched here either. But it still warrants a Bestest Best, because what this game does do is deftly borrow from modern titles in a variety of genres, mingling their flavours into one delicate Miso soup. There's a word in Okinawan - chanpurū - which means to mix together. That's what Nioh 3 is - a chanpurū of influences that manages to entertain in a wonderful fashion. Even if you're biased against samurai like I am, it's still worth your while to fire this one up, tackle the Crucible, and cuddle a Chijiko or three."</p>

              <p>PlayStation in the UK has paired up with a company called Raylo to offer rental options for a huge range of its hardware. For a whacking £24.49 ($33) a month you can get a 1TB PS5 you don’t own, or make that £28.49 ($39) if you want a second controller with it.</p> <p>Called PlayStation Flex, it purports to lease out PS5s and accessories “starting at £9.95 per month,” deliberately aimed at customers who aren’t able or willing to pay the full price up front. But the reality is much more grim.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Join your friends on PlayStation 5 with Flex. Lease a PS5 Digital Edition console starting at £9.95 per month, for a limited time only: <a href="https://t.co/7O84kquQ89">https://t.co/7O84kquQ89</a> <a href="https://t.co/RCeCNQfdZF">pic.twitter.com/RCeCNQfdZF</a></p> <p>— PlayStation UK (@PlayStationUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStationUK/status/2021926500245639184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The “starting at £9.95 per month” claim in the promotional materials is extremely misleading. This is the price for the bizarre Europe-only <a href="https://playstation-flex.raylopay.com/products/new-sony-playstation-5-digital-edition-console-model-group-slim-white?term=12-months">825GB digital edition of the PS5</a>, roughly working out to $13.50 a month, but crucially only at that rate if you commit to a 36-month plan from which it is very difficult to opt out. In reality, to rent that lowest-tier console for a month without a contract would cost you £19.49 ($26.50), more than twice as much as the implied price.</p> <p>For clarity, let’s focus on the <a href="https://playstation-flex.raylopay.com/products/new-sony-playstation-5-disc-edition-console-model-group-slim-white?term=12-months">1TB standard PS5</a>, which purports on the front page of the store to be available for £11.59 a month ($16), but for a single month would actually cost you £24.49 ($33). The same console, to buy and own outright, costs £479.99 ($654, with tax included in that figure).</p>

 <p>If you signed up to that 36-month (three-year) commitment, which you cannot cancel, at the cheapest rate this would cost you a total of £417.24. So maybe a bargain, right? That’s £60 cheaper than buying it day one! Except, no, because at the end of those three years you’ve spent your £417 on owning <em>nothing</em>. You have to give the PS5 back. The person who bought it for a not dissimilar price three years ago gets—most importantly—to keep it, and also has the option of reselling it to make back a chunk of their cash.</p>

 <p>This situation obviously gets considerably worse if you rent the PS5 for a shorter period of time. If you were unable to commit beyond a monthly rate (which of course is the case for many with low incomes looking to find cheaper access to this tech, unable to commit to 12-month contracts, let alone three-year ones), for the equivalent three years you’d have paid out £882 ($1202) for a console you don’t even own.</p> <p>Oh, and let’s not forget, we did all this math for consoles that come with just one controller. Run that again with a couple of DualSense included and it’s £450 at the cheapest, £1,026 at the monthly rolling rate. That’s $1400 for a console you didn’t buy. (And just for fun, the PS5 Pro? $834 to $1840.)</p>

 <h2>If you cannot keep up payments…</h2> <p>This becomes more insidious when you note the ease with which these contracts can be entered into. <a href="https://playstation-flex.raylopay.com/#how-it-works">Sony’s store states</a> that applying for the deal takes “60 seconds,” and that “We only do a soft credit check and applying has no impact on your credit file.” Which is to say, it’ll allow you to sign up to a long-term contract costing hundreds of pounds without checking if you can afford it.</p> <p>There is nothing mentioned on the store pages for what happens if you’re unable to keep up your payments years after making the commitment, and the site’s AI assistant fought hard against telling me this, but eventually revealed that cancelling early requires having paid a minimum of 18 months of charges, plus that month’s and the next. So if you’ve signed up for two years but need to cancel after 12 months, you’ll need to pay another eight months’ worth of charges to get out of the contract. What happens if you can’t? It wouldn’t tell me. I’m waiting on a human response.</p> <p>Renting electronics was once a peculiarly popular phenomenon in the UK, with 1970s retailers like Radio Rentals and Granada renting out color TVs and washing machines to those who couldn’t afford to buy them outright. And of course those people would go on to spend far more in monthly payments than the item would have cost up front. There was another resurgence of this model, but <em>far</em> more predatory, in the 2010s with companies like BrightHouse working on a “rent-to-own” model, preying on those with the lowest income, designed <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47452571">to trick customers into spending five times the real price</a>, although people did at least get to keep the product. (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52090976">The company collapsed in 2020</a> under the weight of its own cruelty, after <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41732865">it was found to have deliberately sold contracts to those who couldn’t afford them</a>.)</p>

 <p>Raylo pushes its rental scheme as a “circular economy,” claiming renting tech is in some way more sustainable and environmentally friendly, <a href="https://internetretailing.net/dyson-and-raylo-set-new-standard-for-circular-tech-as-eu-ramps-up-sustainability-push/">as was declared during its partnership with Dyson last year</a>. Meanwhile, the company has rather embraced its own model <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/tech-rental-subscription-service-raylo-clicks-on-30m-fundraising-13499275">by taking on board more than £180 million of debt and equity funding</a> in the last few years, all with a view to launching in the U.S. later this year.</p>
