<p>Last night, an incident occurred in Pennsylvania that saw presidential candidate, Donald Trump, shot at by an alleged assassin intent on taking his life. It’s already an event riddled with conspiracy theories and sensationalist claims, and minutes after the incident occurred, social media was ablaze with responses.</p>



<p>One response that has drawn a lot of shocked impressions online came from FaZe Clan, the prolific esports, gaming, and lifestyle brand.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-hitmarkers">‘Hitmarkers’</h2>



<p>In a simple post on X (formerly Twitter), FaZe Clan’s social media interns posted an image of Donald Trump, smeared with blood, standing in the crosshairs of a rifle optic with a ‘hitmarker’ icon sitting front and centre. It was accompanied by the caption, ‘They really hitmarkered Trump’:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Almost immediately, responses started pouring in, with many of them being geared towards positions of disbelief and disappointment. In the moments following the shooting, it was confirmed that one innocent bystander had been hit in the head by a stray bullet and died on the scene, and the shooter himself was eliminated shortly after opening fire. It’s no big secret that Trump isn’t the most loved person in the world, but he was shot at and wounded – no matter how minor that wound was, it’s still a harrowing event.</p>



<p>Many comments reflected the sentiments of the community:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘I’m no Trump fan, but this post is sickening and makes me lose a lot of respect for FaZe. It’s not funny’ – TheRedgear</li>



<li>‘Not really something to joke about no matter who it is you. Faze down. Disgusting’ – IVIILITIA</li>



<li>‘Not a good look, you may consider deleting this one.’ – RiseUp44</li>



<li>‘A person died in the crowd, and more wounded. What the f*** is this tweet.’ – VinceMetuz</li>
</ul>



<p>Do you think people are being too soft, or is there a real cause for concern about this post?</p>

<p>Driver is a legendary series that first surfaced in 1999 and enjoyed a relatively popular spree through the 2000s – but the latest game dropped way back in 2011. It has been a very long time since Driver: San Francisco was released, and as a result, it’s now one of those ‘forgotten franchises’ that players would love to reboot.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, representatives from Ubisoft confirmed that the company <strong>is </strong>still working on Driver-related projects, but it revealed that a television series – that was in production – was canned in January 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-didn-t-even-know">We Didn’t Even Know</h2>



<p>Ubisoft announced a partnership with Binge, a streaming platform, in 2021. The basis of this alignment was to create a Driver-themed television series, but per a report written by Game File’s Stephen Totilo, that’s no longer happening. Ubisoft said outright that it has been canned and that hte studio set up to work on the Driver television adaptation – Hotrod Tanner LLC – was liquidated in January 2024.</p>



<p>When grilled on the future of Driver, Ubisoft said to Totilo:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are actively working on other exciting projects related to the franchise and can’t wait to share more information in the future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not much, but it’s something. I have many a fond memory of tearing around the streets of Miami and Istanbul in Driver 3 (stylised as ‘Driv3r’) and making mini-movies with the game’s on-board theatre mode. Those were the days – who remembers hunting down Tommy Vercetti parody characters littered around the map? Don’t get me started on 2006’s Driver: Parallel Lines – that was a genius game with a fantastic story.</p>

<p>An internal presentation for Aliens Fireteam Elite 2 has leaked online under the codename ‘Project Macondo’.</p>



<p>The document, which has been posted across social media, suggests that the game is scheduled to release in Q3 FY2025, which could indicate that an announcement is imminent if the game hasn’t been delayed or canceled.</p>



<p>According to the document, Aliens Fireteam Elite 2 is poised to have 13 missions with 12 hours of gameplay for its “ideal scope”. It’s also said that the game will feature nine different enemy types, 5 DAGGER characters, and 13 total weapons. The document also reveals that the game was not planned to have any post-launch microtransactions, but post-launch content, including “additional Annihilation maps” or “story mission DLC” was TBD. Annihilation is said to be the game’s “new spin on Horde Mode”.</p>



<p>You can see the full document below:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>At first glance, the game seems to be a significant downgrade from the original title, and many fans of the first game have expressed their disappointment on social media. The seemingly huge downgrade has even resulted in some fans questioning the credibility of the leak.</p>



<p>Reddut user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Rafjell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">u/Rafjell</a> said, “Is this some kind of fan made “leak”. I dunno but it doesn’t sound legit to me.”</p>



<p>According to Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/firemonkey11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">u/firemoney11</a>, who originally posted the leak, it originates from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/disney-hack-1tb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.1TB Disney leak</a>, which allegedly compromised unannounced Disney projects, login credentials, and more. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/driver-tv-show-is-canceled-but-ubisoft-says-it-has-plans-in-store-for-the-ip/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In September 2021, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/driver-is-coming-back-as-a-live-action-tv-series-exclusive-to-binge-com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a partnership with up-and-coming free streaming platform Binge to create a live action Driver TV show.</p>
<p>It's been nearly three years, though, and with no more news on the project, many fans assumed it wouldn't be happening anymore. Ubisoft has now <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-yves-guillemot-driver-skull-and-bones?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=146552277&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=5eh0e&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that much to Stephen Totilo's Game File; however, the publisher has also reassured fans that there are projects in store for the franchise.</p>
<p>The most recent mainline installment of the IP was Driver: San Francisco. Developed by Ubisoft Reflections (the original creator of the franchise, also known for games like Stuntman, Just Dance, and The Crew), it launched in September 2011 for PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Nintendo Wii.</p>
<p>Its storyline was set only six months after the events narrated in Driver 3. Players once again reprised the role of John Tanner, a police detective and former FBI agent who falls into a coma while pursuing his nemesis, the criminal Charles Jericho, and finds himself piecing together his plan in a dream world as it unfolds in real life.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, this latest entry was a return to the original roots. Whereas Driver 2 and Driver 3&nbsp; allowed players to step out of the car and roam the city on foot, San Francisco once again limited this feature. However, the game introduced Tanner's ability to 'teleport' from one car to another, inspired by Google Earth.</p>
<p>Driver: San Francisco also added split screen and online multiplayer for the first time in the franchise, with 19 gameplay modes available to choose from. The game's multiplayer remained playable until October 1, 2022, when Ubisoft permanently closed the servers.</p>
<p>In a potential future entry, would you rather keep the car focus of the original and latest Driver game, or should Ubisoft make it more like Grand Theft Auto, allowing freeform on-foot exploration of the environments? Let us know your opinion in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/aaa-fallout-crpg-was-larians-alternative-pick-if-they-didnt-get-the-baldurs-gate-license-from-wizards-of-the-coast/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Did you know that a triple-A Fallout cRPG from Larian could have happened if the studio hadn't obtained the Baldur's Gate license from Wizards of the Coast? Larian CEO Swen Vincke revealed as much in a retrospective interview on the making of Baldur's Gate 3 published in the latest <a href="https://www.magazinesdirect.com/az-magazines/6936449/edge-magazine-subscription.thtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EDGE Magazine (issue #400)</a>.</p>
<p><em>It’s [<strong>editor's note: Baldur's Gate</strong>] one of those IPs that you know a lot of people will want to work on, so it would be great for attracting other people to the studio. I felt like there was a glass ceiling that we wouldn’t be able to break through unless we had triple-A production values, budget, marketing, all the triple-A things.</em></p>
<p><em>It would have been Ultima, it would have been Fallout, it would have been Baldur’s Gate. There was not a lot to choose from.</em></p>
<p>Out of all these three, Ultima is today the less relevant, with the latest installment (Ultima IX) dating back to 1999. Fallout, on the other hand, would have been extremely relevant. Besides, ever since Bethesda grabbed the license in 2004 and turned it into a first-person/third-person action RPG, a rather sizable niche of fans of the original cRPG games has been voicing its discontent on the change. Of course, there was still the little matter of petitioning Bethesda to lend its IP for such a project, a far from trivial endeavor. While Bethesda did allow Obsidian to make Fallout: New Vegas, the cries for a sequel to that beloved game have largely gone deaf, even in the face of the global mainstream success granted by the Amazon Prime Video TV show. The studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fallout-games-wont-be-rushed-says-howard-bethesda-game-studios-had-25-million-players-last-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remains highly protective of the franchise</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it didn't matter because Larian eventually got the Baldur's Gate license, albeit not without some drama. As Vincke revealed, the studio had agreed to send Wizards of the Coast a detailed design document for Baldur's Gate 3. However, the first draft they sent wasn't great due to the creative strain caused by Divinity Original Sin 2.</p>
<p><em>It was really bad. But we didn’t have the brainpower to deal with it because we were trying to do Divinity Original Sin 2. Wizards then sent it back with the corporate equivalent of, ‘This is really shit’. And we said, ‘We know, but we’re releasing a game – don’t ask us to make this now. Give us an extension’. Luckily, they understood, and so we got another chance.</em></p>
<p>Given the outstanding outcome, we should all be glad it went this way. Those pining for a Fallout-like cRPG have a few alternative options, starting with inXile's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wasteland-3-nothing-without-providence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wasteland 3</a>, not to mention indie titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/encased-a-sci-fi-post-apocalyptic-rpg-the-post-dome-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Encased</a> and the two <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atom-rpg-nintendo-switch-a-baffling-console-conversion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ATOM RPG</a>s.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-screenshot/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bioshock-4-reportedly-shown-in-early-build-screenshot-showing-ui-and-ricochet-shotgun.926841/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-screenshot/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>BioShock 4 has reportedly been shown via a screenshot of an early demo build featured in a 2021 showcase reel.</p>
<p>Outlet MP1st posted the in-development BioShock 4 screenshot and wrote that the screenshot in question comes from a Visual Effects Artist at 2K. "For the sake of privacy (and we don’t want the person getting fired), we are refraining from naming or linking their online profile", the outlet writes.</p>
<p>Apparently, the screenshot showing the "Parkside" codename comes from an early demo build of the next BioShock. Interestingly enough, back in 2021, this <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-sequel-set-in-antarctica-1960s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">codename was already mentioned</a> by journalist Colin Moriarty during&nbsp;<a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/sacred-symbols-59475841" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Sacred Symbols video</a> back then. This video was <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bioshock-4s-setting-and-time-period-have-reportedly-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picked up</a> VGC. According to Moriarty, BioShock 4 will be set in the 1960s era of the original BioShock games and will take place in a new Antarctic city called Borealis. “It takes place in a 1960s Antarctic city called Borealis,” Moriarty said in 2021. “[The game is] codenamed ‘Parkside’… I’ve been told that the development team has incredible latitude to get it right. That seems and sounds right to me.”</p>
<figure><figcaption>The alleged leaked Bioshock 4 of an early-build demo</figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the screenshot that was supposedly leaked, it again has to be said that the shot is said to be from an early build, and the quality is pretty low. Still, we can discern the Ricochet Shotgun as well as two other weapons in the interface. Looking at the UI, the number of weapons that can be carried is limited, and both Vigor and Plasmid meters appear absent in this shot.</p>
<p>The screenshot also shows a large glowing structure with a ball-shaped object on top. This structure might be related to the franchise's Lighthouse, but this is speculation at this point. We're pretty sure that there's more to be seen in the screenshot if you look closely enough, and we're interested in what others can discern. Hit the comments below.</p>
<p>The next BioShock is currently in development at Cloud Chamber. As covered earlier this month, the studio recently appeared to have greatly increased recruitment with 30 new job offerings at the studio.</p>

<p>Ibai Llanos Garatea – known simply online as Ibai – is the most powerful and impactful streamer in the world, and it’s not even close. Last night, he obliterated the Twitch concurrent viewer record, netting a peak of 3.8 million users while streaming his iconic ‘La Valeda’ boxing series. It was the fourth edition of the series and it saw the Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid sell out.</p>



<p>That stadium has a capacity of 85,000 people.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-unparalleled-aura">Unparalleled Aura</h2>



<p>Ibai is a legend, there’s no other way to express it. Every year, he tops his own records, netting awards left and right and almost securing the spot of the number-one most-followed channel on Twitch. During his recent stream that saw him broadcast La Valeda del Año IV, he pulled in almost one million new followers, which is a record in itself. </p>



<p>Over eight hours, a peak viewer count of 3.85 million users was recorded, setting a new world record that was recognised almost instantly by Twitch:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Selling out one of the world’s biggest sports stadiums wasn’t enough for Ibai. At just 29 years of age, Ibai is one of the most impactful streamers the world has ever seen, and these events are becoming a par for the course for him and his team. Historically, Ibai has also had a hand in the esports industry, having represented G2 as a content creator and co-founded KOI Esports.</p>



<p>Insane work.</p>

<p>Matthew ‘FormaL’ Piper is one of the most iconic esports competitors the world has ever seen. In a career spanning more than 13 years, FormaL has switched back and forth between Halo and Call of Duty, becoming one of just two esports players in history to land a world championship title in two games.</p>



<p>In 2021, FormaL announced his retirement from Call of Duty, moving over to Halo once again. It would prove to be a fruitful move, as shortly after, he won the HCS World Championship while flying the OpTic banner. During a recent stream, the superstar competitor revealed plans to move back to Call of Duty with Black Ops 6.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-return-of-the-king">Return of the King</h2>



<p>FormaL’s Call of Duty career took him from Ghosts to Black Ops Cold War, and during his spree, he secured a world championship title and several chips, netting around $800,000 in prize money. he became a synonymous face of OpTic in the Call of Duty space, sticking with the brand longer than any other active player to date.</p>



<p>Since moving over to Halo esports, FormaL has won three Majors and a Champs title, securing another $347,000 in prizes. He’s often referred to as the greatest controller-based esports player of all time and has been nominated for awards in that respect. </p>



<p>In a recent stream, FormaL confirmed he intends to play Black Ops 6 – which is being released this October – at a professional level, signalling his return to Call of Duty:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>To what extent he’ll be ‘granted access’ back into the Call of Duty scene remains to be seen. Fans of OpTic Texas have requested that he doesn’t get immediate entry into the roster based on his status. He may break into the Challengers scene to prove he’s still capable enough to enter the Call of Duty League. Presently, it’s a throwaway comment that might not come to light, but it’s the closest confirmation we’ve had in years that FormaL wants to return to Call of Duty.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret the Halo Championship Series is struggling, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hcs-atlanta-major-starts-soon/">even with a Major on the horizon</a>. FormaL would have the capacity to make it to HCS Champs this year and then cut over into Black Ops 6 for the new season.</p>

            <p>There are a lot of video game awards and most of them are simply popularity contests, and therefore also stinky borefests. The one that isn't, in my eyes, is the yearly Independent Games Festival awards - the IGFs. 
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/IGF_CelebrationDays">IGF Celebration Days Steam sale</a> provides plenty of examples as to why, with discounts from now until July 20th on winners and finalists from throughout the IGF awards' history.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>At the top of the Steam sale page you'll find discounts on March's IGF 2024 award winners, including 10% off Rhythm Doctor, 70% off Mediterranea Inferno (pictured above), and 40% off Venba. Scroll down and you'll find discounts on 2024's finalists (Cocoon! Cobalt Core! A Highland Song!) and winners from previous years (80 Days! Spelunky! Fez! Darwinia! And many more).
</p>
<p>IGF awards are decided by, first, a large pool of journalists and developers who sort through a pile of hundreds of submitted games to advocate for a handful, and second, by a smaller group of hand-selected judges, also mostly game developers, who select the shortlist of nominees and ultimately the winners. That's a decent system which has frequently succeeded in elevating unknown games, such Outer Wilds, which won the Grand Prize in 2015 with an alpha build created by a team of students several years before its full commercial release. More generally the IGF have succeeded, through the award categories and the judges' discussions, in creating a culture that favours design and innovation over popularity.
</p>
<p>The result is the advancement of our medium but also, hey, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/IGF_CelebrationDays">big list of great games, now cheap</a>.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a> beta is now underway for folks who pre-ordered Sony's upcoming hero shooter or who are subscribed to PlayStation Plus. If that's you, you should be able to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2443720/Concord/">grab the PC version from Steam</a> and play from now until July 14th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For those that haven't paid in one capacity or the other, don't sweat it: a second beta open to everyone will launch later this week and run from July 18th until the 21st.
</p>
<p>To play Concord. you'll need to have a PlayStation account linked to your Steam account. Yes, this is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">same requirement that caused a huge backlash with Helldivers 2</a>, but here the requirement is at least present and communicated in advance, rather than introduced sometime post-launch.
</p>
<p>If you're struggling to keep your upcoming hero shooters straight, you're not alone. Concord is the 5v5 multiplayer first-person shooter about Guardians Of The Galaxy-like space mercs quipping, shooting and casting magic powers at one another. There's a green alien and a heavy robot and a character called Star Child. One of the characters has somes of jumpjet or hover abilities. There are hitscan weapons including machineguns, sniper rifles, and Revolver-like pistols, as well as ground pounds and area-of-effect fireballs.
</p>
<p>All of which is the work of Firewalk, a new first-party Sony studio. 
</p>
<p>Am I pumped to play Overwatch again? Not really, but then I felt the same way about Valorant, and I had a perfectly pleasant time playing that after its launch. Maybe I like things that are like the things that I like? Maybe that's why they make 'em like those things.
</p>
<p>I'll probably wait for the full release to find out, anyway. Concord is due to release for realsies on August 23rd. For those less patient, you can find the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2443720/view/4231776500672360825">beta system requirements over on Steam</a>.</p>

            <p>The Driver TV series you forgot was happening isn't happening. Announced back in 2021 and initially due to arrive alongside a gamer-focused streaming service called Binge in 2022, the live action series has been scrapped along with the production company behind it.
</p>
<p>Perhaps of greater significance is that the Driver series itself might not be dead, as a Ubisoft spokesperson said that they are "actively working on other exciting projects related to the franchise".

<p>The series' cancellation was spotted by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-yves-guillemot-driver-skull-and-bones">Game File</a>. It's hardly a surprise. Although it was <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/7smQNfXZ0UFKbZ7w6o8sDO/liveaction-driver-series-coming-to-binge">announced in 2021</a>, no writer, director or star was ever publicly attached to the proposed show.
</p>
<p>Binge, meanwhile, was a startup streaming service targeting gamers that never got off the ground. It was co-founded by someone who unironically has "disrupting tomorrow" as his role on LinkedIn, and the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bingedotcom/posts/">Binge account</a> was posting about Web3 and "Watch-To-Earn" as recently as three months ago.
</p>
<p>There hasn't been a video game in the series since Driver: San Francisco back in 2011. It's one of <em>those</em> seven-out-of-tens: you once again take control of racing driver-turned-cop, Tanner, only now he's in a coma and has the ability to magically possess drivers of different vehicles around an open world city. It's got light and frothy mission design, oodles of character delivered via NPC dialogue, and floaty-coma-man is a better solution to Driver's literal and figurative design dead-ends than having Tanner be able to walk.
</p>
<p>Does "actively working on other exciting projects" mean Ubisoft is making a Driver video game? No. (Does Ubisoft actively making a video game mean they'll ever release it? Also no.) They could be making a pair of trainers with "Driver" written on the side, for all I know. It would be better than nothing if they were, though - and probably better than whatever Binge.com would have produced.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/disney-hack-1tb/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Various reports across social media have claimed that Disney has been hacked, with 1.1TB of data being compromised.</p>



<p>According to the group ‘Nullbulge,’ the group has gained access to the company’s internal Slack, in which 1.1TB of data—including unreleased projects, concept arts, login details, and personal details—is said to have been compromised.</p>



<p>The group has not confirmed that the breach is legitimate, except for a screenshot showing various files. Disney has also yet to respond to comments on the alleged breach.</p>



<p>If true, the hack would be another company that has been compromised to this extent in the past couple of years. In late 2022, Rockstar Games suffered a similar breach via Slack in which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-leaks-online-with-90-gameplay-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">90 videos of GTA 6 were leaked online</a>. In late 2023, Insomniac Games also suffered a devastating breach, which included over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ransomware-group-leaks-over-1-3-million-files-in-insomniac-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1 million files</a>.</p>



<p>It’s currently unknown to what extent the data has been compromised, but if true, we could soon see a flurry of unannounced projects come to light. However, following Nullbulge’s claim, their website has been knocked offline, meaning no one can download the data.</p>



<p>We have reached out to Disney for a comment on the alleged hack.</p>



<p>UPDATE—While Disney has yet to comment on the alleged breach, the first leaks of the data obtained have begun to leak online. One such leak is of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/aliens-fireteam-elite-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aliens Fireteam Elite 2 details</a>.</p>

            <p>Dying Light 2 developer Techland has requested that the majority of staff – including employees who work abroad – come into the office full-time or commit to a "hybrid" model.</p>
<p>The studio says it needs people to come into the office "regularly to foster stronger connections".</p>
<p>According to Polish site <a href="https://www.cdaction.pl/newsy/techland-konczy-z-praca-zdalna-pracownicy-zmiana-wprowadzona-nagle-i-bez-konsultacji">CD-Action</a>, "regularly" equates to eight working days every two months. The outlet also alleges that line managers were given less than 24 hours notice to cascade the news to their direct reports.</p>

<p>Other CD-Action sources claim the studio's current offices are not large enough to accommodate much more than ten percent of its 500 headcount. It's thought around half of those developers had, up until this point, work remotely.</p>
<p>"While remote work remains an option, we're transitioning most roles to either an on-site or hybrid model," Techland told our sister site, <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/">GamesIndustry.biz</a>.</p>
<p>"Employees who live near our offices will be asked to work from the office three days a week. For those working remotely from abroad, we're asking them to come to the office regularly to foster stronger connections.</p>
<p>"We understand this is a big change and all employees can still request home office days on demand as needed. We've just started this process and it's our goal to make the transition as smooth as possible and to support everyone individually."</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-to-become-majority-shareholder-in-dying-light-studio-techland">Dying Light developer Techland announced a partnership with Tencent</a>, which has become a majority shareholder.</p>
<p>Techland's CEO Paweł Marchewka said this partnership would allow the team to "move full speed ahead with the execution of the vision for [its] games", calling Tencent an "ally who has already partnered with some of the world's finest video game companies and helped them reach new heights while respecting their ways of doing things".</p>
<p>Techland retains full ownership of its IPs and maintains its "creative freedom".</p>

<p>Developer Cloud Imperium says the festival – described as "a civic program in-lore aimed at strengthening community spirit" – is introducing an expanded "new player experience" that's available for new and returning players, "as well as a Guide System to connect veteran pilots with newcomers to aid them on their space-faring journey".</p>
