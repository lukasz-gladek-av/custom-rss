<p>In Marvel Rivals, you wage war across a rich depth of Marvel licenses from Thor to Black Panther. Many of the universe’s respective characters and native lands are represented in the hero shooter, so let’s run you through every confirmed map and game mode so far.</p>



<p>I’ve played many online multiplayer shooters, and it’s incredible how opinions can vary depending on the title’s maps and game modes. These are core fundamentals of a shooter’s identity, meaning if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a>‘ DNA is flawed in this regard, it could fail before it even gets started.</p>



<p>However, based on the Marvel Rivals alpha and beta tests, I’d suggest this is unlikely. So without further ado, here’s every map and game mode locked and loaded in for Marvel’s star-studded hero release.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-marvel-rivals-map">Every Marvel Rivals Map</h2>

<p>We currently know of nine maps in Marvel Rivals, and these battle arenas are distributed amongst the same few locations. Check out every single map confirmed so far:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven</li>



<li>Klyntar: Symbiotic Surface</li>



<li><a href="https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Tokyo_2099:_Shin-Shibuya"></a>Tokyo 2099: Shin-Shibuya</li>



<li><a href="https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Tokyo_2099:_Spider-Islands"></a>Tokyo 2099: Spider-Islands</li>



<li>Tokyo 2099: Warped Ninomaru</li>



<li>Wakanda: Birnin T’Challa</li>



<li>Wakanda: Hall of Djalia</li>



<li><a href="https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Yggsgard:_Royal_Palace"></a>Yggsgard: Royal Palace</li>



<li><a href="https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Yggsgard:_Yggdrasill_Path"></a>Yggsgard: Yggdrasill Path</li>
</ul>



<p>More maps might accompany the official launch of the multiplayer title, so stay tuned for even more content. Also, with Marvel Rivals taking up the live-service trend, a fruitful conveyor belt of maps is only the beginning. </p>



<p>With so many Marvel licenses to use, I’d love to see the Avengers Tower or the Quantum Realm set the scene for an epic battle!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-marvel-rivals-map-rumors">All Marvel Rivals Map Rumors</h2>



<p>In addition to confirmed locales, many more Marvel Rivals maps are purportedly on the way—courtesy of a leak.</p>



<p>According to journalist <a href="https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ross Miller on X</a>, another f<strong>ive maps are already in development (or finished)</strong> and likely coming to Marvel Rivals in a future content update. They <a href="https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller/status/1788079410530185237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">outed</a>, “Hydra Erebus Base, The Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda, Klyntar, Empire of Eternal Night, and Krakoa” as major locations.</p>



<p>Each of the five areas is expected to have maps within too. Take this all with a grain of salt, but it makes for interesting reading.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-marvel-rivals-game-mode">Every Marvel Rivals Game Mode</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals is gearing up for launch with four game modes: <strong>Conquest</strong>, <strong>Convergence</strong>, <strong>Convoy</strong>, and <strong>Domination</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-conquest">Conquest</h3>



<p>Conquest is a variation of Call of Duty’s Kill Confirmed in which players need to bank points for a kill by collecting the fallen enemy’s coin. The key difference here is the value of a coin increases the longer time goes on.</p>



<h3 id="h-convergence">Convergence</h3>



<p>We’re using Overwatch as our template here as you need to capture a control point first to trigger a payload, which the attacking team needs to guide to the end of the linear route. Conversely, the defending team has to prevent the payload from reaching each checkpoint by pushing it back and repelling opposition forces.</p>



<h3 id="h-convoy">Convoy</h3>



<p>Convoy is an honorable imitation of Overwatch’s classic Payload and Convoy modes. There are no capture points here, it’s a straight-up escort or defense mission (depending on your given side) of a moving objective along a fixed path.</p>



<h3 id="h-domination">Domination</h3>



<p>For Marvel Rivals’ Domination game mode, it’s a basic race to capture a control point and hold it until one team reaches the threshold. If one team achieves 100% completion, but at least one enemy player is present, it goes to overtime to determine if the game continues.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 is expanding yet again with 12 new subclasses, including drunk monks, teleporting beekeepers and shadow sorcerors]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-is-expanding-yet-again-with-12-new-subclasses-including-drunk-monks-teleporting-beekeepers-and-shadow-sorcerors<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Way back in June, treacherous, fickle Larian declared that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> patch 7 would be their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-update-will-be-larians-final-handover-to-players">final handover to players</a> of the well-good D&amp;D RPG, with the focus then shifting internally to Larian's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-have-two-new-games-in-the-works-fueled-by-the-very-same-fire-as-baldurs-gate-3">two currently untitled new game projects</a>. CEO Swen Vincke did, however, caveat that while the overall level of post-release support would be "diminished", there would be a few more updates. We interpreted that to mean bug fixes and the like. Certainly, I wasn't expecting brand new subclasses for every class in the game, which is what you'll get with the just-announced Baldur's Gate 3 patch 8, together with new crossplay functionality and a full-figured photo mode.</p>
<p>The subclasses in question are a fanciful bunch. Take Drunken Master for the Monk class, which lets you intoxicate enemies and then rapidly sober them up to inflict physical and psychic damage. As a Ranger Swarmkeeper, meanwhile, you can wield a "legion of bees" like a battering ram and then teleport to the swarm's location to stick the boot in. The Fighter's Arcane Archer subclass lets you temporarily banish people to another dimension, the Cleric's Dark Domain lets you blow up corpses, and the Rogue's Swashbuckler gets to flick sand in faces, jolt weapons from hands and generally speaking just wind adversaries up. Fire up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4461474037375172735?l=english">the Steam announcement post</a> for the full list.</p>
<p>As for the new photo mode, this gives you a bunch of lens settings such as FOV and focus level, together with scene settings such as the ability to toggle off either party members, NPCs and enemies. It also lets you choose facial expressions and pick from around 40 static and animated poses, each with variations. There are also post-processing effects such as contrast, saturation, highlights, brightness and vignetting, and a choice of frames and stickers.</p>
<p>The sweetener is full cross-play functionality with full cross-platform progression. No longer will that Xbox player you know have to play Baldur's Gate 3 solo. You'll be able to invite them into your game and, as the case may be, cover them in angry bees. </p>
<p>There's no release date for the patch just yet, but Larian are doing early public "stress-testing" in early January. You'll be able to register your interest beforehand.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's the platform that gets almost every game, with plenty coming out on PC years earlier than they reach consoles. And if you enjoy your games on PC, you know one of the best times to buy games is during Steam's sales. Many people (myself included) have been looking forward to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/specials/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Autumn Sale</a>, which runs from now until December 4th.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Strangely, the Steam Autumn sale is currently being outdone by a <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJVAMq?object_uuid=cbe08cf0-e475-4927-b639-81f84ca9c159&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black Friday sale going on at Fanatical</a>, <em>even though Fanatical is selling the exact same Steam keys! </em>If you want to buy some games (and who doesn't?) and save extra cash, check out my round-up of the best deals on digital PC game codes. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Metaphor: ReFantazio for $45.49</h2><div catalogid="5382220d-8cfe-45c0-ab23-958f55b562cf" id="212144"><div id="212144" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Metaphor: ReFantazio (PC)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Atlus RPG is one of my current obsessions. It's $45.49 on Fanatical or $52.49 on Steam. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-complete-list-of-nominees-goty">Metaphor: ReFantazio was also nominated for Game Of The Year at The Game Awards</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-review">review of Metaphor</a>, we said, "There’s a certain familiarity in Metaphor: ReFantazio, but Atlus takes the principles of its already excellent RPGs and refines them in a way that effortlessly ushers you through its brutal, and sometimes beautiful, new fantasy world. The Archetype system and all the new wrinkles it added to the turn-based battles build upon a strong foundation, and the social elements are streamlined to better deliver the most important aspects of the stories they tell. The sense of adventure you get from traveling across the kingdom and the powerful sense of purpose you have to do so drive its memorable journey, distinguishing itself from those that came before it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When I finally closed the book on Metaphor after 80 hours, I felt a unique warmth in its message, because it’s driven by the ideals of a just society smartly contextualized in a unique metanarrative. Metaphor: ReFantazio is poetic, and at times, idealistic, but it also understands its complexities and that change requires action, and that even far-fetched fantasy stories can serve as inspiration to make our world a better place."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree for $35.19</h2></div><div catalogid="93ff4e22-c7fb-466d-aa97-8a3e5492a5d0" id="212141"><div id="212141" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree (PC)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Steam Deck playable masterpiece is one of the finest pieces of DLC I've ever played (FromSoft has been known to do that). It's only $35.19 on Fanatical, and full price at $39.99 on Steam. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-complete-list-of-nominees-goty">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree was also nominated for Game Of The Year at The Game Awards.</a> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">10/10 review of Shadow of the Edrtree</a>, we said, "FromSoftware says Shadow of the Erdtree is the only expansion Elden Ring will get, so it’s fortunate that it’s hard to imagine a better DLC than this – as long as you’re not hoping for it to do anything radically outside the box. Everything I loved about the original has been condensed into an incredibly tight package – one that’s the size of many standalone games all on its own, and can only be considered “small” in comparison to the absolutely massive world of Elden Ring itself."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Erdtree’s absolutely jam-packed with secrets, valuable treasures, challenging boss battles, and horrific monstrosities to face off against, as well as cool new weapons, spells, Ashes of War, Spirit Ashes, talismans, and more to play around with and use to find even more novel ways to tackle its memorably brutal battles. Add on some very interesting lore revelations, not to mention the same spectacular visual design and stellar music that accompanies its larger-than-life bosses, and you’ve got what is certainly one of the best DLC expansions I’ve ever played."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Helldivers 2 for $27.99</h2></div><div catalogid="194b9695-169d-4e37-9fe9-61a3b74e5835" id="212142"><div id="212142" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>HELLDIVERS 2 (PC)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This chaotic multiplayer gem is playable on Steam Deck and only $27.99 on Fanatical, or $31.99 on Steam. (<em>If you watch the video review below, you'll also see me make a ridiculous decision at 7:10 while trying to get back to the ship</em>)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2 review</a>, we said, "Helldivers 2 is the rare modern multiplayer game that does almost everything right. It gives you a ton of freedom, feels fantastic to play, and has a smart progression system that doesn’t nickel and dime you or rely too much on a paid battle pass. It manages to keep its missions fresh by introducing a ton of enemies, modifiers, and objectives, and varying them in interesting ways."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are some matchmaking and performance issues that still need to be worked out, and you can only go so far by yourself or with random players – but if you’ve got a solid squad, it’s an incredible time, and certainly one of the most fun multiplayer shooters I’ve played in years. When I’m not Helldiving, I’m thinking about Helldiving, counting down the time until my next drop. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to pour myself a nice, hot cup of Liber-tea and get back at it. Those bugs and robots look like they could use some freedom, and Managed Democracy isn’t going to spread itself. For Super Earth!"</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero for $61.59</h2></div><div catalogid="5e3563a2-0806-4f7f-89ab-b3e8b7ae1d83" id="212143"><div id="212143" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero (PC)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Steam Deck playable return-to-form for arena fighters is just $61.59 on Fanatical, as opposed to $69.99 on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-review">review of Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</a>, we said, "Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero is a final flash from the past, sometimes to a fault, as demonstrated by its archaic menus and remedial training tools. Its Episode Battles have the kind of reaction-heavy difficulty that doesn’t really exist in most games these days, more than once crossing the line between challenging and frustrating."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But the feeling of traveling back to a simpler time when games didn’t have to be balanced or competitive to be fun is a good one, especially when that action stays so true to that of the show it’s recreating. Reliving a story that was foundational to my youth, looking and sounding as great as I remember it, with the opportunity to alter it in sometimes dramatic new ways is clever, and the addition of tools to attempt to create our own stories could elevate the experiment even further if a community can figure out how to make the most of them."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Silent Hill 2 Remake for $41.99</h2></div><div catalogid="d5e33a22-3373-4490-acf3-364348dc0e8a" id="212136"><div id="212136" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Silent 2 Remake (PC)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill 2 got a beloved remake this year, and it's already available for $41.99 on Fanatical, but still $55.99 on Steam. Silent Hill 2 was also nominated for several awards at The Game Awards, including Best Narrative, Best Action/Adventure game, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review">review of Silent 2</a>, we said, "Silent Hill 2 is a welcome modernisation of a survival horror masterpiece. It smoothly polishes down the rough edges of the original game’s combat while taking a piece of heavy grit sandpaper to scuff up every rust and mold-covered surface of its nightmarish environments, successfully making them appear far more abrasive and menacing to explore."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Previously primitive boss battles have been transformed into substantially more intense encounters, and its intimidating audio design kept me acutely aware that every fog-cloaked street I walked down could quickly hurry me towards my own dead end. It does feel a little padded out in parts, and I do wish that Bloober Team had streamlined some of its more convoluted puzzle sections to prevent the story’s momentum from sagging on occasion. Still, intermittent pacing problems aside, Silent Hill 2 is a great way to visit – or revisit – one of the most dread-inducing destinations in the history of survival horror."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">God Of War for $17.99</h2></div><div catalogid="3e0c6059-d396-4973-b8ce-c62b559716ed" id="212137"><div id="212137" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>God of War (PC)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Steam Deck-verified RPG made quite the splash when it was revealed. It's been a while, but you can get it for $17.99 on Fanatical and $19.99 on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/12/god-of-war-review">review of God of War</a>, we said "I expected great action from God of War, and it delivers that handily. But I didn’t expect it to be a thrilling journey in which every aspect of it complements the others to form what is nothing short of a masterpiece."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s a game in which Kratos, a previously one-note character, becomes a complex father, warrior, and monster, embattled both on the field and within his own heart about how to treat his son; one in which the world opens up and shifts, offering rewards in both gameplay and knowledge of its lore that I treasured with each accomplishment. The obvious care that went into crafting its world, characters, and gameplay delivers by far the most stirring and memorable game in the series.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ghost of Tsushima - Director's Cut for $41.99</h2></div><div catalogid="d047a1d6-f7e1-4bdd-a56b-bd78580f7306" id="212138"><div id="212138" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ghost of Tsushima - Director's Cut (PC)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Jin Sakai's journey to reclaim Tsushima comes with some extras in the Director's Cut version, which was originally a PS5 exclusive. Right now you can grab a PC Steam key on Fanatical for $41.99, even though it's $47.99 on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-review">Ghost of Tsushima review</a>, we said, "Ghost of Tsushima is an enormous and densely packed samurai adventure that often left me completely awestruck with both its visual spectacle and excellent combat. By steadily introducing new abilities instead of stat upgrades, its swordplay manages to stay challenging, rewarding, and fun throughout the entire 40 to 50 hours that it took me to beat the campaign."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A few aspects are surprisingly lacking in polish in comparison to other first-party Sony games, especially when it comes to enemy AI and the stealth part of its stealth/action split. Still this is an extraordinary open-world action-adventure game that solves several issues that have long gone unaddressed in the genre, while also just being an all around samurai slashin’ good time."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Persona 5 Royal for $20.99</h2></div><div catalogid="c354d2d3-5b3c-4ef1-8341-85b5f6172395" id="212140"><div id="212140" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Persona 5 Royal</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This game helped put Persona on the map— (even though Persona 3 has a superior cast and story.

From our review, Matt Purslow states "The remake is a modern reminder not just of an era where Konami was a master of survival horror, but also the significant power of Silent Hill 2’s unrelenting misery." So, are you ready to play one of the best horror games of all time?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Get Silent Hill 2 for $30 (<s>$69</s>)</h2><div catalogid="88324baa-8e4f-4304-baa2-376fabb551b2" id="211839"><div id="211839" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Silent Hill 2 (PS5 Remake)</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">More PlayStation Black Friday Deals We've Found</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On the video game front, we found <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-ps5-black-friday-deal"><u>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (which is fantastic) is at its lowest price ever.</u></a> Alternatively, if you prefer FromSoftware, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-deal-black-friday-2024"><u>Elden Ring is also on sale</u></a> which gives you an easy way to enjoy this year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-game-awards-nomination-sparks-renewed-debate-among-fans"><u>Game of the Year-nominated</u></a> Shadow Of the Erdtree DLC (which is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-deal-black-friday-2024"><u><em>also</em></u><u> discounted right now</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to convince a friend to grab a PlayStation 5 to play with you, or you're the greatest gift-giver of all time, you can spread the word or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-playstation-console-deals-black-friday-2024"><u>grab this deal on a PS5 now</u></a>.

In response to the questions, CFK and 21c.Ducks plan to introduce all the various aspects of <em>Chrono Sword</em> to the world.</p><p>In the action RPG genre, combat systems are a key component of gameplay. <em>Chrono Sword</em> maintains the action elements of the souls-like genre while providing new shades unique to <em>Chrono Sword</em>, all to provide a more immersive gameplay experience. Let’s look into the innovative combat systems featured in <em>Chrono Sword</em>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Chrono Sword</em> centers around the heavy enemy and player hits common to the Soulslike genre, but various attack commands make the action faster and more intense.</p><p><strong>1) Quick Evade</strong></p><p>Instead of a roll, a quick press of the evade button allows players to skirt out of the way of enemy attacks.</p><p>In contrast with rolling away, which can help with avoiding attacks, evade allows for a stable evade detection system that allows players to avoid enemy attacks while setting up for a counterattack.</p><p><strong>2) Attack Cancel</strong></p><p>During an attack, a well-timed press of the action cancel button allows players to cancel the current attack and continue into a quick successive attack or immediate block/evade. The timing and efficiency of attack canceling can vary depending on the weapon selected.</p><p><strong>3) Finishing Attacks</strong></p><p>If players drive through an enemy after an attack cancel, enemies will fall to their knees in a brief stun animation. If players then close in on the stunned enemy and press the interact button, they will perform a finishing attack for a great deal of damage.</p><p><strong>4) Skill Attacks</strong></p><p>If players press a direction button while charging a strong attack, they will perform a strong skill attack that changes the attack into a completely different movement. There are two command skill attacks for each weapon.</p><p><strong>5) Useable Items</strong></p><p>Players can use a variety of items in combat by pressing the Use Item button.</p><p><em>Chrono Sword</em> has an arsenal of short-range and long-range weapons. Firing arrows can add damage from a safe distance or keep an enemy in a stunned state, and whetstones can imbue a weapon with fire, frost, or lightning properties.</p><p><strong>■ About the Game</strong></p><p><em>Chrono Sword</em> is a pixel art Soulslike action RPG developed by Korean dev team 21c.Ducks that tells the story of the dark gothic fantasy world of Adelnor, where players must travel between the past and future to unlock its secrets.</p><p>Revealed first to the public in 2019, this Soulslike action RPG garnered a great deal of interest in Korea and abroad for its unique pixel graphics and gameplay. Selected as the first game in the collaboration campaign by North American crowdfunding site Kickstarter and the global game testing platform Game Round.Inc in 2020, it raised over seventy thousand dollars to successfully reach its funding goal.</p><p><em>Chrono Sword</em> is a new take on the Soulslike genre, departing from the full 3D <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,415 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPGs</a> on the market, choosing instead to fashion their Souls-like with pixel art and a quarter-view perspective. Since the announcement of this game, indie team 21c.Ducks has poured their hearts and souls into developing a strong storyline and advancing both the action and RPG elements of their Souls-like entry.</p><p><em>Chrono Sword</em> renders its vast, three-dimensional world in pixel graphics. Players then step into the role of ‘time traveler,’ venturing freely between the past, present, and future in maps that seamlessly transition without loading screens. Developer 21c.Ducks has featured <em>Chrono Sword</em> in game exhibitions at home and abroad, where it was noted and awarded for its gameplay. They then took this experience and used it to further improve both gameplay and level design.</p><p>In addition, it has built on the heavy hits known to fans of the Soulslike genre while implementing new systems to create quicker, fiercer action.</p><p><em>Chrono Sword</em> featured the latest demo version at the <a title="Companies > Happinet Corporation [39 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/happinet-corporation">Happinet</a> booth at the Tokyo Game Show 2024, where it succeeded in attracting the attention of many players. After being unable to show its new face for so long, this new version of <em>Chrono Sword</em> drew attention as it focused on the action and RPG elements of the game, setting it apart from the demo released during the Kickstarter campaign.</p><p>Building off of this interest, <em>Chrono Sword</em> participated in the Steam Next Fest starting on October 14, 2024, where it was seen by even more players from around the globe. It succeeded in attracting even more interest by releasing a version touting more content than the one featured at Tokyo Game Show 2024.</p><p>21c.Ducks began their development path in 2015 with mobile game <em>Timing Hero</em>, moving onto release <em>Super Pixel Racers</em> on PC in 2018, distinguishing themselves for their abilities in game development and raising awareness about their company. Then once they unveiled <em>Chrono Sword</em> in 2019, the game was nominated for the Grand Prix / Judge Selection / Excellence in Art awards at the Busan Indie Connect Festival (BIC) that very year. Then in 2022, it won a special award for excellence at the Burning Beaver festival.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Thanksgiving isn't traditionally the time for receiving gifts, but that's not stopping Digital Extremes from doing a giveaway of its own. The developer behind Warframe is offering its 2008 third-person shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-sector-review/1900-6188387/" data-ref-id="1900-6188387">Dark Sector</a> for free, but you only have until November 30 to claim it.</p><p>Digital Extremes shared the announcement on X, as well as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/29900/Dark_Sector" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dark Sector's page on Steam</a> where the game is temporarily yours for the taking.</p><p>Digital Extremes credits Dark Sector for inspiring Warframe, and the game was initially released on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. The story puts players in control of covert operative Hayden Tenno as he embarks on a mission behind enemy lines in the Eastern European nation of Lasria. He'll soon discover that there's a deadly secret that leaves him infected by a bio-weapon called the Technocyte Virus.</p><p>Ordinarily, the Technocyte virus turns its victims into mindless killing machines. Hayden avoided that fate--for now at least--and he's been left with superhuman abilities that may give him the edge if he wants to make it out of Lasria alive.</p><p>During the summer, Digital Extremes offered up a preview for Warframe's next expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warframe-1999-looks-like-the-party-of-a-lifetime/1100-6526024/" data-ref-id="1100-6526024">Warframe: 1999</a>. The story thrusts players on an alternate Earth, and it looks very intriguing so far. Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warframes-developer-partners-with-make-a-wish-to-feature-child-in-upcoming-expansion/1100-6525153/" data-ref-id="1100-6525153">Digital Extremes granted a child's Make-A-Wish</a> to be a voice actor in the upcoming expansion when it arrives later this year.</p><p>If you're looking for more recent games and big sales, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tons-of-popular-pc-games-are-discounted-for-black-friday/1100-6527990/" data-ref-id="1100-6527990">check out our Black Friday roundup</a>!</p>

Solving these problems first required a concrete understanding of what the core game is, and to obtain that, the team had to experiment.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Becoming an expert in the game you are designing">Becoming an expert in the game you are designing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Part of the process is becoming an expert in your game, right?" Brode says. "When we first started out, I didn't know the right number of cards per location, the right number of locations, the right number of turns for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the right number of energy to start with. We tried seven turns and five turns, and starting on turn two and nine cards per location and four cards per location, three cards per location and two cards per location, and infinite cards per location. We tried everything."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, Brode continues, these variables coalesce into the foundation of the product, and once that's all settled, you can go about the business of actually designing cards. But how much viable content can your new game actually support?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You need to actually make sure you can make a bunch of stuff," Brode says. "Like if your goal was 'Hey, let's make Tic Tac Toe a live service game,' and we're gonna add cards you can play before every turn of Tic Tac Toe … there's a couple designs that may be kind of interesting and not broken but not that many."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For this hypothetical, Brode would ideally design out a year's worth of content just to see if the idea had legs. "Even if you don't end up shipping any of those cards, you're like, 'Oh my God, I've used all the design space, Tic Tac Toe is too simplistic. I just can't come up with another 500 of these for the next 10 years.'"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Second Dinner is sitting at the Godot table">Second Dinner is sitting at the Godot table</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant also speaks with Brode about Second Dinner's embrace of Godot for another project that's already in development. The engine has grown leaps and bounds over the last few years, Brode says, thanks in-part to its open source nature and the responsive folk shepherding the project. And for his team specifically, Godot offers tremendous value in its ability to issue over-the-air updates for "literally anything."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Because we're writing the whole game in [GDScript] … this means if we wanted to do something like launch on a platform that is maybe notoriously difficult to get new content and new features shipped live to players quickly, well, we can just do that over the air without having to go through an approvals pipeline for [a] AAA platform," says Brode. "That could take a long time and we just don't have to do that. We can just quickly get stuff to players in a day or something. That's really mega, especially for a live service project."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Listen to the rest of our really mega conversation on your podcast platform of choice, and might we be so bold as to suggest adding </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gdconf.com/">GDC 2025</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to your March to-do list for more valuable insights from leading developers?</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.

            <p>Let's face it, nothing important happens in December. I'm scheduling 24 advent calendar posts this week and then spending the rest of the year eating boxes of Cadbury Mini Yule Logs Triple Chocolate. So it's no surprise that Devolver have announced their remaining slate of games aiming for release in 2024 are actually coming out in 2025.
</p>
<p>The games that slipped are <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate-story">Skate Story</a>, and Stick It To The Stickman. Devolver released the news with typical style, via the 15th annual Devolver Delayed awards, which you can watch below.

<p>I enjoyed the in memoriam section for games that released this year which can therefore no longer be delayed, all of which are currently available at a discount via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/DevolverDigital/sale/autumnsale2024">Devolver's autumn sale on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>Baby Steps is the pick of the Delayed Three that I'm most looking forward to. It's a literal walking simulator from Bennett Foddy and the makers of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ape-out">Ape Out</a> in which you pilot limbs individually to steer your pyjama-clad protagonist up a mountain, like a marriage between <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/qwop">QWOP</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/getting-over-it">Getting Over It</a>, and whichever third-person game with a mountain you care to choose from. Skyrim? Jusant? I bet God Of War's got a mud-soaked hill in it somewhere.
</p><p>Skate Story is Tony Hawk's Pro Skater if Tony Hawk was a demon made out of glass. Stick It To The Stickman is that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw4wzwYeZ0Y">Flash animation you watched 20 years ago</a> but with a physics simulation and made by the Broforce developers. I want to play both of these games, too.
</p>
<p>Check out the graphic design on these bad boys. The blurriness on the image of the mini roll isn't my camera, that's actually how it looks on the box.

It tasks you with running human civilization in the United Kingdom after a zombie apocalypse. Unlike its predecessors, After Inc. has an optimistic hue. The aesthetic is colorful and painterly, in contrast to the harsh UI of Plague Inc. or the cold satellite-map style of Rebel Inc., a previous follow-up about combating insurgencies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4406661-after-inc-screenshot-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4406661" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4406661-after-inc-screenshot-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4406661"></a><figcaption>A screenshot of After Inc. showing off the game's bright, lush aesthetic and friendly UI.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4406661-after-inc-screenshot-1.png"></figure><p>In an interview with newsletter <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/after-inc-plague-inc-ndemic-pandemic" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, game designer James Vaughn said, “I've tried to make a more happy and optimistic game this time." In each session, you play as the leader of a settlement. You combat zombies, search for resources, navigate communal disputes, and research new tech. Playing through a scenario lasts around 20 minutes and will unlock meta upgrades that affect future settlements.</p><p>After Inc. costs $2, the same price as Rebel Inc. and $1 more than Plague Inc. The store page claims this is a "special sale price" to mark the game's launch.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> didn't get off to the smoothest of starts, but eight years after its controversial launch, Hello Games' exploratory space sim has reached a significant milestone, finally gaining enough favourable player reviews on Steam to shift its overall rating to "Very Positive".
</p>
<p>
When No Man's Sky released back in August 2016, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-isnt-going-over-well-on-steam">player sentiment was such</a> that it quickly found itself damned with an "Overwhelming Negative" rating on Steam. It took two years and a number of significant updates for No Man's Sky to secure enough positive reviews that its average tipped over to "Mixed", and then a further three years after to that to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-five-years-no-mans-sky-has-finally-hit-mostly-positive-reviews-on-steam">reach an all-time user review average of "Mostly Positive"</a> in 2021.
</p>
<p>
As Hello Games' Tim Woodley explained at the time, "Each percentage point becomes exponentially harder to earn as you move up the ratings. Moving from 20 percent positive to 21 percent positive may only require a few hundred positive reviews whereas moving from 69 percent to 70 percent needed 10,000 positive reviews. This is why it's so rare for games to change their All-Time rating and why we'd assumed that we might never be able to."

<p>
Another three years - and a total of 35 free content updates - later, No Man's Sky has finally achieved the seemingly impossible, turning its initial "Overwhelmingly Negative" rating <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/">into "Very Positive"</a>. That means 80 percent of its 245,857 Steam reviews are positive - which is to says it's secured 196,686 blue thumbs up versus 49,171 red thumbs down. Addressing the milestone, studio boss Sean Murray <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1861859832187211963">wrote</a>, "Holy shit you guys - it happened. ALL REVIEWS: Very Positive. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You have no idea what this means to us."
</p><p>
No Man's Sky's next challenge, then, will be to nudge into the prestigious "Overwhelming Postive" category inhabited by the likes of Sekiro, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5">Persona 5</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, Hades, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a>, the Silent Hill 2 remake, and Half-Life: Alyx. That's a significantly tougher goal, however, requiring 95 percent of life-time reviews to be positive. In other words, assuming No Man's Sky doesn't receive a single negative review from this point forward, it'll need a total of 983,420 positive reviews - or 786,734 more than it has now. By which point the <em>actual</em> universe might be 16 minutes away from obliteration.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, the shift to "Very Positive" is still an incredible achievement, and testament to the incredible work Hello Games has put into its space sim over the last eight years. No Man's Sky's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-rolling-out-cross-save-support-from-today-as-ps5-pro-enhancements-arrive">most recent update</a> released earlier this month, introducing cross-save support, PlayStation 5 Pro enhancements, and the return of Mass Effect's Normandy. It's the sixth major update this year, following on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-the-cursed-is-a-spooky-expedition-for-halloween-set-in-a-collapsing-reality">October's spooky The Cursed</a> (which, among other things, introduced flying saucer ships for players), while other 2024 additions have included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-gets-reel-in-new-aquarius-fishing-update">fishing</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-orbital-update-overhauls-space-stations-today">refreshed space stations</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-borrows-some-of-light-no-fires-fancy-tech-for-a-planetary-overhaul-in-latest-update">massive world generation overhaul</a>.
</p>
<p>
Up next for Hello Games is its procedural planet adventure Light No Fire, which we've not had an update on since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">last year's reveal</a>. Perhaps we'll finally see more during December's The Game Awards, but regardless, it sounds like No Man's Sky journey is far from over.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slipways">Slipways</a> was the best grand strategy game I'd played in years, because it tossed out all the genre's micromanagement in favour of a strategy puzzle where all your exploiting, expanding, et ceteraing could be squeezed into an hour's play. That game began as a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pico-8">PICO-8</a> prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski before being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slipways-review">polished to a fine shine in its full release</a>.
</p>
<p>All of which is just lead-in to talking about Solitomb, a solitaire-based dungeon crawler in which you fight demons by building hands of playing cards. It's currently - heywaitaminute - a pay-what-you-want PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski where "all money earned goes towards making the bigger version possible." Like Slipways, it already seems like a frightfully clever piece of design.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You can play Solitomb in <a href="https://krajzeg.itch.io/solitomb">your browser for free right now</a>. 
</p>
<p>Hit the how-to-play button in-game to <a href="https://html-classic.itch.zone/html/12080108/tutorial/index.html">go to this webpage</a>, which is the basic tutorial. If you've played solitaire before, the very basics are familiar: there are stacks of cards spread at the top of the screen, with some facing upwards. After that just about everything else is different.
</p><p>The cards themselves represent either the different types of monster you can fight, or the attack, shield, and potions you can take into that fight. The number on each card represents its efficacy. You build stacks of up to five cards - any lower numbered card can be placed on top of another - and drag them into your hand to start the fight. The aim is to defeat a certain number of a certain kind of enemy or to clear a pathway forward in order to reach the next level of the dungeon.
</p>
<p>Which probably all sounds a little abstract, but makes sense almost as soon as you start playing. Want to defeat a beast of five strength? Pair it with a sword of five strength. Want to win the fight without taking damage? Add a shield of 4 strength and a potion of 1 or higher, and drag all four cards together into your hand. Now do this again and again to clear all the cards in front of you, making sure not to squader power on lesser battles, to run out of health, or to run out of attack cards altogether.
</p>
<p>There are umpteen other systems layered atop this basic combat math. The dungeon houses an impatient demon and if you make too many dragging and stacking moves before you trigger combat, you'll start to take damage. There are damage bonuses for combos, such as cards of the same suit, rank or consecutive ranks. You choose a character class before a run, with a passive buff and a special ability, and there's a between-level shop for purchasing new cards and upgrades. Later floors introduce new card types. Prototype or not, it already seems rich in strategic potential.
</p>
<p>Head over to <a href="https://krajzeg.itch.io/solitomb">the Solitomb page on Itch to give it a try</a>. Or if you never got around to trying Slipways, you can pick that for half price right now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1264280/Slipways/">over on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dark-sector-third-person-shooter-from-warframe-devs-free-to-own-on-steam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-double-devstream-confirmed-warframe-1999-soulframe-pre-alpha/">Digital Extremes</a> and Valve are currently giving away free copies of Dark Sector, the third-person title made by the Warframe devs. From today until November 30, PC games will be able to obtain this game for free by visiting the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/29900/Dark_Sector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam store page</a> for Dark Sector. This game is a third-person action shooter that was first released on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2008 and then was ported to Steam in 2009. If you've been wanting to try this game out but weren't sure whether you want to spend money on it, this is a great time to get hold of it and add it to your backlog.</p>
<p>Dark Sector is a game that does have mixed reviews, mainly based on the visual design of the game. This game has been compared to Resident Evil 4 and Gears of War by critics. Themes that were seen in Dark Sector were also seen in Warframe. For example, the name Tenno is seen very frequently throughout Warframe, as that is the name of the faction that is controlled by players.</p>
<p>In this game, you play Hayden Tenno (voiced by Michael Rosenbaum), a man who works at the CIA. In this game, you witness Hayden go through a transformation, as he has been infected with the Technocyte Virus on his right arm, which then begins to take over his entire body. As a result of the Technocyte Virus, you see his psyche begin to deteriorate. However, he begins to gain superhuman powers, including the ability to grow a bladed glaive on his arm. With this glaive, he can throw it at his enemies with precision. As you progress through the game, you see Hayden begin to transform further, and his powers evolve, making him a deadly force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>Dark Sector's main focus is a single-player campaign, but the game also features a multiplayer game mode. At the moment, it's uncertain whether the multiplayer game mode is still active, but due to the game being free on Steam for now, it's possible that the multiplayer game mode will still be active and available to play.</p>
<p>The Steam Autumn Sale is also on right now, which will provide many discounts for any games that may be on your wishlist.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Dark Sector?</p>

            <p>Announced last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exo-rally-championship">Exo Rally Championship</a> does what the name suggests: takes the rugged, weather-battered terrain of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exo-one">Exo One</a>'s interplanetary journey and replaces the ponderous plot and gravitational rise-and-fall spaceship movement with a six-wheel, space buggy rally competition. Or put another way, if Exo One was Christopher Nolan's Tiny Wings, then this is Colin McRae's Interstellar.
</p>
<p>Now there's a demo, and it's substantial with a tutorial, a 10 stage rally, and three "ever-changing Daily Stages with online Steam leaderboards."

<p>This is no rally game reskin, but takes full advantage of the setting. The landscapes you're speeding across are vast and unforgiving, crater-marked, littered with boulders, and battered by rain, lightning and meteors. It's only possible to make your way across them because your six-wheel-drive rover can catch considerable airtime on the low-gravity planets.
</p><p>Land too hard and you'll lose a wheel or other valuable part of your machine, however. That's where air jets come in, which let you shunt your buggy around in mid-air to correct your orientation or soften your touchdown. The tutorials take you through using them in different scenarios, and it's a lot to consider. Enough that it's simultaneously intimidating but exciting to see what dedicated players can wring from these physics.
</p>
<p>It's a stark contrast to what I wrote about in my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/exo-one-review-a-gorgeous-sci-fi-marble-run-that-lacks-pace-or-friction">Exo One review</a>, a game which I felt lacked friction after you'd got to grips with its comparatively simple controls. Exo Rally Championship seems to have friction in spades, and promises a rich simulation with the ability to tune your rover, the need to repair it, and with tire and fuel types to match to different planetary destinations in the full game.
</p>
<p>That full game is still "coming soon", but you can grab the demo now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2262020/Exo_Rally_Championship/">from Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We’ve witnessed a lot of turmoil surrounding the development of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, with delays and controversy marring the title before its release. Well, as it turns out, there may be a reason why the upcoming AC game is so controversial. It appears Assassin’s Creed Shadows is going to be the first game for a number of game developers at Ubisoft. While it’s common practice to bring in new talent regularly and keep the old-timers on their toes, it would seem much of the team behind Shadows is completely green behind the ears.</p>



<p>In an appearance at the External Development Summit 2024 (XDS24), Assassin’s Creed Executive Producer Marc-Alexis Côté said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One of the things that I’ve noticed since the pandemic is that we have a lot of juniors in our teams. Probably half the team that’s building Assassin’s Creed is building a game for the first time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the video below is set to begin approximately where Marc-Alexis Côté spoke about the game’s development, you can watch the full keynote from XDS24 here:</p>

                                        <p dir="ltr">Video games have traditionally been an expensive hobby, but thanks to the latest advances in cloud streaming, it's now easier--and more affordable--than ever to get into gaming. One of the best cloud gaming services is Amazon Luna, which lets users play some of the latest games in up to 4K quality directly on devices they already own--no expensive console or gaming PC required. If that sounds like something you're interested in, we've put together this comprehensive explainer for Amazon Luna so you can see how easy it is to sign up and get playing.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What is Amazon Luna?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4406070-lunadevices.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4406070" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4406070-lunadevices.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4406070"></a><figcaption>Amazon Luna</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4406070-lunadevices.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Amazon Luna is a cloud gaming service that allows users to stream games directly from the cloud to various devices without needing a gaming console. You can think of it like the video game version of Amazon's Prime Video service, where instead of downloading and running games directly on your hardware, they're stored and played remotely via Amazon's Web Services (AWS) servers.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a lot of benefits to cloud gaming compared to traditional console or PC gaming. For one, you can access your library of games from a long list of devices, including Windows PCs, Macs, Fire TV streaming devices, Fire tablets, Chromebooks, iPhones, iPads, Android devices, and select smart TVs. While you'll need a strong, stable internet connection for the best gameplay experience, cloud gaming can be much cheaper, too, since all you need is a Luna account, a controller, and one of the supported devices--many of which you probably already own. That means there's no need to buy an expensive gaming console or PC.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How Much Does Amazon Luna Cost?</h2><p dir="ltr">Amazon Luna requires a paid membership to access most of its games and features, but multiple subscription plans and optional add-ons are available to suit your preferences.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Luna+ membership</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">The primary plan is <strong>Luna+</strong>, which costs <strong>$10/month</strong> and gets you access to over 100 games that are playable at no extra charge, including a mix of AAA games like <strong>Devil May Cry 5</strong> and <strong>Middle-earth: Shadow of War</strong>, and indies like <strong>Overcooked</strong> and <strong>Guacamelee</strong>. Luna+ members can also sync their Ubisoft store and GOG accounts and play select games they already own from those storefronts over the cloud via Amazon Luna.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the game libraries, Luna+ members can also link their Twitch accounts and broadcast their gameplay live.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P989QTJ?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P989QTJ?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A <strong>seven-day Luna+ free trial</strong></a> is available if you want to try out the service.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Luna+ add-ons</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Luna+ members can augment their libraries with a couple of paid add-on channels.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">If you're a fan of <strong>Ubisoft games</strong>, you can play a large library of the publisher's games on Luna--including new releases and classic titles--by adding the <strong>Ubisoft+ channel</strong> to your membership for an additional $18/month.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>The Jackbox Games Channel</strong> is also available for an additional $5/month, granting you access to the popular series of <strong>Jackbox party games</strong>.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Amazon Prime</strong> subscribers ($15/month or $139/year) also get access to an additional rotating selection of games, including popular titles like <strong>Fortnite</strong>, <strong>Trackmania</strong>, and <strong>XDefiant</strong>, that you can play even without a Luna+ membership. Separate from Luna, Prime members also get a selection of free games via the Prime Gaming service, some of which are also playable on Luna.</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">What Equipment Do You Need?</h2><p dir="ltr">As mentioned above, Amazon Luna works on various devices, and you can also play via Chrome or Microsoft Edge web browsers on PC or Safari on Apple devices. You'll need at least one of the supported devices and/or web browsers to use Luna.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Amazon devices</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">Fire TV streamers and smart TVs running FireOS 5 and above, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/fire-tv-stick-lite-latest-alexa-voice-remote-lite/dp/B091G4YP57?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/fire-tv-stick-lite-latest-alexa-voice-remote-lite/dp/B091G4YP57?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick Lite</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-hd/dp/B0CQMRKRV5?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-hd/dp/B0CQMRKRV5?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick HD</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-4K-streaming-device/dp/B0CJM1GNFQ?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-4K-streaming-device/dp/B0CJM1GNFQ?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick 4K,</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max/dp/B0BP9SNVH9?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max/dp/B0BP9SNVH9?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/dp/B09BZZ3MM7?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/dp/B09BZZ3MM7?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Cube</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=fire+smart+tv&amp;crid=2YJV9MKHPNCK9&amp;sprefix=fire+smart%2Caps%2C383&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_10&amp;tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=fire+smart+tv&amp;crid=2YJV9MKHPNCK9&amp;sprefix=fire+smart%2Caps%2C383&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_10&amp;tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FireOS smart TVs</a></li><li dir="ltr">Fire Tablets like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/dp/B0B1VQ1ZQY?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/dp/B0B1VQ1ZQY?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire HD 11 Max</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BL5XPDR6?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BL5XPDR6?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire HD 10</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Tablet-Black-32GB/dp/B0CVDN4QS6?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Tablet-Black-32GB/dp/B0CVDN4QS6?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire HD 8</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-7-Tablet/dp/B096WJFX8M?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-7-Tablet/dp/B096WJFX8M?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire 7</a></li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Apple devices</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">iPhones running iOS 15 and above</li><li dir="ltr">iPads running iPadOS 15 and above</li><li dir="ltr">macOS running 10.13</li><li dir="ltr">Safari 15 and above</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Android devices</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">Android OS 9 and above</li><li dir="ltr">Chrome version 86 and above</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>PC</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">Windows 10 and above</li><li dir="ltr">Chrome version 83 and above</li><li dir="ltr">Microsoft Edge version 90 and above</li><li dir="ltr">Linux, Ubuntu, and Chromium OS are also supported.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Select LG and Samsung smart TVs</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">You can check the full <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=hp_left_v4_sib&amp;nodeId=GUFHUSX8X324T4XE&amp;tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=hp_left_v4_sib&amp;nodeId=GUFHUSX8X324T4XE&amp;tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">list of supported devices here</a>.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>A controller</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Along with one of the supported devices or web browsers, Luna also requires a Bluetooth game controller to play. Amazon offers its own Luna controller, which is essentially the same as most other modern gamepads, but features Luna-specific branding and buttons for navigating the Luna app UI. These functions are mapped to different buttons on other supported controllers. The Luna controller can also connect directly to Amazon's AWS servers, which Amazon says reduces input latency by up to 30 milliseconds compared to other controllers.</p><p dir="ltr">The following controllers all feature official Luna support:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Luna-Controller/dp/B07P989QTJ?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Luna-Controller/dp/B07P989QTJ?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Luna Controller</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088GJR4B9?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088GJR4B9?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Wireless Controller</a></li><li dir="ltr">PlayStation DualShock 4</li><li dir="ltr">Mouse and keyboard (only on supported games)</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GYNLANRYMK4WTXSS&amp;tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GYNLANRYMK4WTXSS&amp;tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon's support page</a> says other third-party controllers outside that list may work with Luna, though full support is not guaranteed, so it's best to stick with the official list.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Internet connection</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">As a cloud streaming service, Amazon Luna requires an internet connection--and the better your connection is, the better the gameplay experience. Unlike traditional consoles and gaming PCs, where graphical quality and gameplay speed depend on your hardware setup, cloud gaming performance depends on how strong and stable your internet connection is.</p><p dir="ltr">While you can play Luna games at a maximum 4K resolution, gameplay quality may vary if your connection wavers. Amazon's minimum network requirements are 10Mbps internet speeds for 1080p gaming and at least 35Mbps for 4K. You'll also want to use a hardwired Ethernet connection whenever possible. If you play over Wi-Fi, you will want to use 5Ghz routers (though 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi is also supported).
