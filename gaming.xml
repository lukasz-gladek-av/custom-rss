<p>Check out the first trailer</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Netflix's animated series, <strong>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</strong>, is returning to the streaming service next month, with season two kicking off on <strong>11th December</strong>. And look, we even have a trailer!</p>
<p>This second and final season, which once again stars Hayley Atwell in the titular role, sees Lara and co. race across the globe to get their hands on some ancient masks that pack some mysterious powers. There's an uber-rich "techno-visionary" trying to hunt the relics down too, so no prizes for guessing who the goodies and baddies are in this situation.</p>
<p>The all-new trailer (above) gives a taste of the animated action we can expect to find in December, with super-powered headwear, globe-trotting escapades and a fight with a shark — yes, really.</p>
<p>The first series was met with mixed reviews on release last year, but with a live-action adaptation in the works at Amazon and the 2013 game making a surprise appearance on Switch and Switch 2 today, perhaps there will be more interest this time? Somehow, we doubt it, but hey, it's a good time to be a Tomb Raider fan!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA have announced that there will not be an F1 game launching next year and instead, F1 25 will be getting paid DLC.&nbsp; “The decision to offer a premium content update for F1 25 is part of a strategic reset for the F1 Franchise,” they explain.</p>
<p>The 2026 DLC will “bring players closer to the sport’s major changes for 2026 that includes new cars, sporting regulations, teams, and drivers,”&nbsp; but no other details have been revealed. The next game in 2027 is going to refresh the franchise so it “looks, feels, and plays differently, delivering more gameplay choices.”</p>


<p>“F1 25 has been an incredible success, fueled by the passion of fans and the energy of the sport. With Formula 1’s momentum on and off the track, now is the perfect time for us to look ahead and build for the future<em>. </em>We’re fully committed to the EA SPORTS F1 franchise. Our multi-year plan extends this year’s excitement with the 2026 expansion and reimagines the F1 experience for 2027 to deliver even more for players at every level around the world,” adds Lee Mather, Senior Creative Director at Codemasters.</p>
<p>We rather enjoyed F1 25’s entry in the yearly sporting franchise, which brought its own fictional F1 story to the table with the third Braking Point tale. Dom saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/f1-25-review/">our review</a>, “F1 25 is a clear improvement over last year’s entry, with improved handling, the returning Braking Point story mode and more all coming together to create an excellent F1 racing experience.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/f1-25">F1 25</a> was enhanced with a DLC pack that was inspired by F1 The Movie, the&nbsp;content comes in the form of six Chapter Scenarios, which are available either as part of the Iconic Edition or to be purchased separately. These events take you to key moments from the movie, tackling dramatic weather, strategic moments and overcoming the odds at Silverstone, Monza, Zandvoort, Mexico City, Spa-Francorchamps, and Abu Dhabi. Completing these scenarios unlocks Sonny Hayes’ helmet for use in F1 World and Driver Career.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/farming-simulator-25-sales-4m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/farming-simulator-25-sales-cross-4m-as-year-2-pass-brings-yet-more-content.1357129/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Giants Software has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a major milestone since the game launched just over a year ago.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>has hit four million sales across all platforms, which puts it ahead of fairly major hits like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2-5m-worldwide" rel="nofollow">Konami's&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake</a>&nbsp;(although it's still trailing major breakout hit&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-5m-update" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>).</p>

<p>Giants isn't slowing down with content for&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25</em>, either; a second season pass has been released today, and it promises lots of new content throughout the rest of the year, including a brand new JCB tractor that's ready to claim right now if you own the pass.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/giants-software-farming-simulator-25-sales-4m.jpg?itok=tISs1FLc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/giants-software-farming-simulator-25-sales-4m.jpg?itok=R8qqkj9F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Oh, Giants Software. Never change.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the aforementioned vehicle,&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25</em>'s Year 2 Season Pass will also bring a major DLC pack somewhere between January and March, followed by another between April and June.</p>

<p>They'll be chased up by a major expansion that will launch between October and December this year, which will introduce a brand new map and more to the farming simulator. It sounds like there will be plenty of players waiting to greet that pack as well.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25</em>, it's...well...it's a farming simulator, and it's this year's iteration of Giants Software's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/farming-simulator-22-sales-surpass-3-million-units-globally" rel="nofollow">successful</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/farming-simulator-15-coming-consoles" rel="nofollow">long-running</a> series.</p>

<p>Released back in November last year, the game managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/farming-simulator-25-sales-2-million-one-week" rel="nofollow">rack up two million sales for itself</a> within its first week of launch, which means it's picked up another two million in the intervening year. That's not bad at all, especially for what remains an essentially niche title.</p>




<p>If you're interested in checking out&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25</em>, you can pick it up right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300320/Farming_Simulator_25/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/farming-simulator-25/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/farming-simulator-25/9NMCDQ6RCJKH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rebecca Heineman, one of the co-founders of&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate&nbsp;</em>publisher Interplay, has passed away aged just 62.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/interplay-co-founder-rebecca-heineman-dies-from-cancer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, Heineman's death was confirmed by close friend <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hmcd.bsky.social/post/3m5u7i37gns2u" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Heidi McDonald</a> and former colleague <a href="https://x.com/BrianFargo/status/1990561629080277499" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Brian Fargo</a> on social media yesterday. McDonald described her as a "trailblazing game industry bad-ass", while Fargo called Heineman "one of the most brilliant programmers around".</p>

<p>Previously, Heineman had set up a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-rebecca-ann-heineman-fight-aggressive-cancer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GoFundMe page</a> to help pay for treatment for her recently-diagnosed adenocarcinoma, but yesterday, she said further treatments would be "pointless" according to her doctors, urging donors to give so that her funeral can help her "make a worthy entrance for reuniting" with spouse Jennell Jaquays.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-interplay-rebecca-heineman-death.jpg?itok=lEs59mkZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-interplay-rebecca-heineman-death.jpg?itok=E6cCc5e6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rebecca Heineman co-founded&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>publisher Interplay.</figcaption></figure><p>Heineman was one of the first major video game championship winners, having bagged a prize for her performance during a&nbsp;<em>Space Invaders&nbsp;</em>tournament all the way back in 1980.</p>

<p>Following her victory during that tournament, she co-founded Interplay Productions, the studio that went on to publish iconic and influential games like survival horror classic&nbsp;<em>Alone in the Dark</em>, CRPGs&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate&nbsp;</em>and <em>Fallout</em>, and the European version of the original&nbsp;<em>Warcraft</em>.</p>

<p>As well as being a major industry figure, Heineman was also active as an LGBTQ+ campaigner. She won a Gayming Icon award from <a href="https://gaymingmag.com/awards/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gayming Magazine</a> this year, with the publication commending her "advocacy for LGBTQ+ inclusion, accessibility, and diversity in tech".</p>

<p>In her later years, Heineman was also active on streaming and video platforms, showing off some of the curios she had gathered over her decades working in the gaming industry. It's no stretch to say that without Heineman, many of the most well-respected games of today simply wouldn't exist.</p>

Maybe go play a classic Interplay title as a tribute to her and all of the work she's done in the industry over the years.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-rescued-early-access-soon</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hytale-rescued-by-original-co-founder-following-riot-shutdown.1357120/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hytale co-founder and original developer Simon Collins-Laflamme has purchased the rights for the game back from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riot-games-hytale-acqusition-adds-blocky-adventure-to-roster" rel="nofollow">original owner Riot Games</a>, following the shutdown of the project earlier this year.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> entitled “Hytale Is Saved!”, Collins-Laflamme says the project has been acquired from Riot Games in its entirety, and the new team is “fully independent and personally committed to funding Hytale for the next ten years”, a commitment he says he’s making alongside fellow director Philippe Touchette.</p>

<p>As well as reviving the project, Collins-Laflamme and Touchette have hired “over 30 former developers” who were working on Hytale prior to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-canceled-dev-shuts-down" rel="nofollow">its closure in June</a>, and the two say they will “continue to hire as the budget allows” and as the right candidates for the game are found.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hytale-rescued-original-developer-farmer_0.jpg?itok=NRmg4qmZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hytale-rescued-original-developer-farmer_0.jpg?itok=SV0dvd94 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>is making a return, so rejoice.</figcaption></figure><p>The new Early Access date for the revived version of Hytale will be revealed in the coming days, Collins-Laflamme says, as will the game’s pricing.</p>

<p>You should, according to the developers, expect Hytale to be in a pretty rough state when it launches, with “bugs, rough edges, unbalanced content, and frequent updates that break things” being par for the course.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is partly due to the abandonment of the so-called “Cross-Platform Engine”, which would have ensured Hytale’s compatibility with other platforms; instead of using that engine, the developers have returned to Hytale’s original “Legacy Engine”, which they say is “playable now” and which will allow them to “build a game rather than an engine”.</p>

<p>Despite being a big part of the original Hytale release, official minigames won’t be a part of this revived version of Hytale at Early Access launch, but a dedicated team will work on bringing them into the fold “once the core game is stable”.</p>




<p>In the coming days, you can expect to see new gameplay footage and screenshots for Hytale, as well as detailed patch notes for what the team has been working on recently.</p>

<p>In addition, you’ll get a roadmap post showing what’s coming to Hytale in the future, as well as the aforementioned pricing details, an Early Access release date, and “plenty of updates and communication”.</p>

<p>In case you’re unfamiliar with Hytale, it’s an ambitious RPG sandbox that pledges to offer “a procedurally generated world full of dungeons, secrets, and a variety of creatures” that you can “shape…block by block”. Whether that original vision changes with new ownership and a new direction remains to be seen.</p>

<p>If you’d like to keep up with Hytale’s progress, you can do so via the <a href="https://discord.gg/hytale" rel="nofollow">new Discord server</a>, and you can keep an eye on the <a href="https://hytale.com/" rel="nofollow">official website</a> as well.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/80-days">80 Days</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-highland-song">A Highland Song</a> developers Inkle once pitched a Doctor Who game to the BBC, narrative director and writer Jon Ingold has revealed in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jon.inkle.co/post/3m5sx6jiqps2i">a Bluesky post</a>. While the BBC never responded to their overtures, the pitch became the basis for Inkle's very excellent and bodacious astral archaeology sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heavens-vault">Heaven’s Vault</a>. I consider this a cool thing to know, and so do our friends at Eurogamer. They’ve just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-inkles-heavens-vault-started-life-as-a-doctor-who-game-before-it-was-exterminated">published an interview</a> with Ingold, which includes tantalising details of a forthcoming Heaven’s Vault reveal of some kind.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Inkle met with a number of potential collaborators in 2014, following the release of 80 Days. According to Ingold: “one of those was an approach from the BBC, who floated several different BBC properties for us to consider working on. As a lifetime Doctor Who fan, that was the one we jumped on." The team spent eight months working on a pitch for something Who-flavoured and working-titled The Daedalus Effect. It would have been set on an asteroid orbiting a black hole, and would have featured time dilation. 
</p>
<p>
"For the art style, we wanted 2D characters within a 3D scene for a comic-book look, so we built a TARDIS interior model, drew some character art, and built a prototype where you could move around the console room," Ingold told Eurogamer’s Victoria Phillips Kennedy. "We also built a playable 'fly through the vortex' game for the travel sequences, inspired by Super Hexagon. And the most significant thing we did was start rebuilding the ink engine, from the very scrappy first version that powered 80 Days and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sorcery">Sorcery!</a> series, to the more modern version that we eventually open-sourced."

Alas, the Who game was not to be: a decade later, Inkle are still waiting for a response to the Doctor Who pitch. This is possibly for the best, however. Heaven’s Vault is terrific, and Inkle are arguably in a stronger place for having embarked on their own original setting. "It opened Inkle up a lot - until then we'd be doing adaptations and IP-based work," Ingold noted. "Heaven's Vault was the first thing we did that was all ours - and people embraced it - and that experience is what made A Highland Song, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overboard">Overboard</a>, and all the rest possible."
</p><p>
Ingold isn’t sure they’d make a Who game today, fond as he is of that narrative jukebox, the Tardis. “I still love the character and the wild variety the concept would bring. But there's been a lot of Who games since 2014, and I feel like it'd be hard to capture the same excitement as we felt for the project when we first pitched it." 
</p>
<p>
Besides which, Ingold have their hands full with both a new videogame of some kind and a mysterious “thing”, possibly not a videogame, for the world of Heaven’s Vault, which has now expanded into the realm of novels and, potentially, stageplay. “We've written a pilot episode and outline for an audio drama version (though we haven't sold it to anyone), and we've got one other big thing cooking for the world which we haven't announced yet, but is hopefully going to be truly wonderful for new players and for fans of the original,” Ingold concluded.</p>
<p>You can read more on Eurogamer. Side note: I used to be an embarrassingly dedicated fan of Barbara Hambly’s Darwath books, and they have a wizard character called Ingold I would roughly classify as Sports Illustrated Gandalf. Science has yet to prove that he and Jon Ingold are not the same person.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-the-kotaku-review.1357111/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It was around the time that I was fighting a giant plant monster in a chemically induced hallucination themed around hate and guilt that I realized this year’s </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> is a strange one. But moments of strangeness, even a few memorable or inspired ones, can’t hide the fact that this latest installment is the digital equivalent of throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-user-reviews-steam-2000644734"><i><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</span></i></a><span>’s co-op campaign is a direct sequel to </span><i><span>Black Ops 2</span></i><span>, featuring many characters from and references to this fan-favorite entry. Yet in the end, all those nods to </span><i><span>BLOPS2</span></i><span> just serve as a reminder of how much better that campaign was than this collection of random ideas that you can play either solo or with up to three other buddies.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>And then…and then…and then….</b></h2> <p><span>If I were to describe the plot of </span><i><span>Black Ops 7 </span></i><span>to you out loud, I would sound like a 6-year-old kid who was asked to come up with a big action-packed story on the fly.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>“Okay, so some soldiers go to a secret island to fight a bad lady and her evil company, but it’s a trap, and they are drugged with a gas like from the Batman movies that makes you see scary stuff from your memories and past. Oh, and they are all connected via brain chips, so they all see the same things. And then they fight bad soldiers. Oh, and robots! And also zombies. And then a giant plant monster. And then a giant person. And they go to Tokyo. And then fight some spiders. And then they uh, oh, start a prison riot with undead inmates and uh go underwater to fight giant mechs using big missiles before winning and saving the day. The end!”&nbsp;</span></i></p>

 <p><span>It’s borderline nonsensical and only barely works as a story at all because of some great voice performances and some incredibly expensive-looking cutscenes. It’s a shame that the entire four- to five-hour campaign feels cobbled together in a short amount of time, but considering Treyarch, which co-developed this game, was also the lead developer on last year’s </span><i><span>Black Ops 6</span></i><span>, it’s not surprising, either.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>At least the guns still feel good, and I wasn’t bored because when you’re dealing with this level of batshit nonsense, it’s at least interesting to see what ludicrous scenario the game is gonna throw you into next. Shooting, sliding, jumping, and now wall-jumping (more on that later) are fun regardless of what I’m killing. Less fun and more annoying is that RPG elements have woven their way into the campaign, so you reach points where enemies take a lot of bullets to kill, and you have to wait for the game to decide to end your pain and give you a damage upgrade. Bleh. No good. Don’t like. Never bring this back, thank you.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Speaking of annoying things I never want to see return, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-slop-regulation-2000644735"><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i></a><span> introduces an always-online open world to explore between bigger missions. Even though I played solo, sometimes other players would speak during cutscenes when I was teleported back to this part of the campaign, which acts like an always-online pseudo-hub between some missions. And there’s little to do in these moments. It’s weird, adds nothing, and is <a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-7-campaign-coop-always-online-pause-co-op-xp-challenges-2000644358">likely the reason I can’t pause </a></span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-7-campaign-coop-always-online-pause-co-op-xp-challenges-2000644358"><i><span>BLOPS7</span></i></a><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-7-campaign-coop-always-online-pause-co-op-xp-challenges-2000644358"> while playing the campaign</a>, which is yet one more strange choice to add to the pile of odd decisions that make up this year’s</span><i><span> Call of Duty.</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Okay, whatever, what about multiplayer!?&nbsp;</b></h2> <p><span>I’m not stupid. I know that </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> is a multiplayer franchise. Most people are buying these games not for the single-player adventure, but for the months of deathmatch they’ll get to play with friends and randoms. And thankfully, this part of</span><i><span> Black Ops 7</span></i><span> is a lot better than the campaign. But if you played last year’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-beta-weekend-1851638800"><i><span>Black Ops 6</span></i></a><span>, you’ll likely feel a big sense of deja vu.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>BLOPS 7</span></i><span> multiplayer feels very, very similar to that of the last entry, down to menus, perks, and gunplay. Now, that’s not inherently horrible, and considering how successful </span><i><span>BLOPS 6</span></i><span> was, it makes sense to build upon that for the follow-up.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>However, I found a lot of the weapons in </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span> to feel very same-y and not distinct at all. I bounced around a few guns in the dozen hours I spent with multiplayer and never found one I particularly liked or hated. They all just mostly blended together, with the only distinction being “Oh, this one is burst fire” or “This is a sniper.” I remember the guns in </span><i><span>BLOPS6</span></i><span> being far more distinct and interesting, and swapping between them was a lot more exciting as a result, as were the firefights against other players.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Maps aren’t a strong element of </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span>, either. Some are genuinely very good, but those are mostly the maps ripped from past </span><i><span>Black Ops </span></i><span>games, like Hijacked (which also appears as a level in the game’s campaign). The new maps felt too big for the number of players found in most game modes, and none of them have stuck in my brain. Maybe in a few weeks, some of these new maps will join my list of best </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> maps ever made. But at the moment… ehhh.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>       <div>                                         <figure>                            </figure>                           <div>                      <p>             Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7           </p>                                       </div>       </div>               <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“War never changes…wait a minute, is that a giant plant monster?”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer</p>                 <p>Treyarch / various other Activision Studios</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Near-future military online FPS with zombie survival mode  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked</p>                 <p>Fantastic cutscenes, snappy and responsive gunplay, and wall-hopping.  </p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Bad campaign, bland guns and maps, and performance problems.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS5 (played), PS4, PC  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Finished the campaign in about five hours, played 13 hours of multiplayer, and a few hours of zombies.  </p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>           </div>  <p><span>Perhaps the biggest change found in </span><i><span>BLOPS7</span></i><span>’s multiplayer is the ability to wall hop. This builds on the fantastic omnimovement that debuted in </span><i><span>Black Ops 6, </span></i><span>which let players sprint in any direction and made </span><i><span>CoD</span></i><span> faster than ever.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Wall hops add a new tool to the movement kit, and I love it. Being able to bounce up a wall into a window or over a garage is so much fun. It can also be used to escape an enemy, ambush a group of unsuspecting players, or reach an out-of-the-way spot to do some camping. Shut up, it’s a legitimate strategy.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While my old-man thumbs and fingers sometimes fail to keep up with the youth and their fancy slides, I still mostly had a good time with </span><i><span>BLOPS7</span></i><span>’s multiplayer, even despite the maps being meh and no one gun calling to me. Wall bounces add just enough extra flavor to fights to shake things up, while not getting in the way of the hyper-responsive FPS action </span><i><span>CoD</span></i><span> has long been known for.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I do, however, want to flag that on PS5 Pro, I ran into a ton of random performance issues during multiplayer. This really soured my experience. Even a bad </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> typically runs well, so I was surprised to see so many dropped frames and slowdowns happen in </span><i><span>BLOPS7</span></i><span>. Hopefully, a future patch can improve the situation.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Zombies and the <em>Battlefield</em>-sized elephant in the room</b></h2> <p><span>I’m not a </span><i><span>CoD </span></i><span>Zombies expert, so I can’t speak to specifics about the mode in this year’s entry, but I can say that I enjoyed my time with it. In a lot of ways, Zombies in </span><i><span>BLOPS 7</span></i><span> feels like a return to the versions found in older </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> games, and I like that.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>You can play a classic rounds-based version of Zombies set in one map. I also appreciate that for the first time ever, when playing solo, you can leave a Zombies match and come back later and pick up where you left off. Fucking </span><i><span>wild </span></i><span>that Zombies has a pause option, basically, while the campaign doesn’t. Strange!</span></p>

 <p><span>I would try to explain the story of Zombies, but it is so obtuse and deep at this point, involving multiple dimensions and a dozen characters spread over multiple games and timelines, that I’m just not going to attempt it. There’s a new cowboy-like demon zombie who is really bad, and I think I’m supposed to kill him by completing the main quest found in the primary Zombies mode. To explain more would require a trip to the </span><i><span>CoD</span></i><span> Zombies wiki, and I’m not interested in falling down that wormhole.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000645203" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000645203"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000645203">©Activision</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In a vacuum, this year’s </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> is a weird, really big, and mostly bad misfire that I doubt hurts the franchise all that much in the long run. But if we look beyond </span><i><span>Black Ops 7 </span></i><span>and consider the larger context, this might be the worst version of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912"><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i></a><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912"> for Activision to have launched in 2025,</a> as it’s going up against the super popular, grounded, and back-to-basics </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I bounced between both games over the weekend, and I think that once again, moment-to-moment, </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> looks sharper and plays better than </span><i><span>Battlefield</span></i><span>. This has long been the case with these two FPS rivals. But when it comes to content and delivering what fans want, I think</span><i><span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379">Battlefield 6</a> </span></i><span>wins hands down.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Make no mistake, both games have flaws. But</span><i><span> BF6</span></i><span>’s problems can be solved with some patches and a few big maps. </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span> can’t be fixed because it isn’t broken, it’s just a weird and incoherent mess that feels more like a fan mod or big update for </span><i><span>BLOPS6</span></i><span> than a proper sequel. And it certainly doesn’t seem like the game </span><i><span>Call of Duty </span></i><span>needed in 2025, but rather just the one we got because Activision can’t let the franchise take a break. Ah well, there’s always next year…&nbsp;</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch%E2%80%99s-best-scene-is-as-funny-as-it-is-violent.1357108/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-review-adhoc-studios-all-8-episodes-finale-2000644106"><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> eight-episode run is over, and I stand firm in my belief that the best moment in AdHoc’s superhero workplace comedy comes in episode five, “Team Building.” As the title suggests, protagonist Robert Robertson III takes his staff of reformed villains out for a night at a bar. The problem is, they’re headed to a villain bar. Robert certainly doesn’t look the part, and the bar’s goon and lackey patrons are ready to start a fight when they see him there. What happens next is probably </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s best use of the old Telltale house style, and it’s got players popping off and covering their eyes in equal measure.</span></p>  <p><span>The fight begins with Robert getting a blow to the back of the head, then waking up with his team outside a fast-food joint. At first, you think Robert was knocked out cold and his team got him out of there, so now they’re all just crashing at the local, legally distinct Taco Bell. But then, the group starts to hand Robert his food, and suddenly, you have a QTE to stick your straw in your soda. All right, seems an odd moment to introduce a QTE given that the game uses those pretty sparingly, but—holy shit, I just stabbed a man in the face with a handful of darts!</span></p>

  <p><span>No, Mecha Man did not simply go down without a fight, and the Z-Team wasn’t about to let their boss get made a fool of at their favorite watering hole. So now we swap back and forth between the quiet calm of Z-Team’s late-night snack run and the comically violent excess of their earlier bar brawl. Folks, it’s absolute cinema. The whole fight is set to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6v3vKeg1Ws"><span>Thot Squad’s “Hoes Depressed,”</span></a><span> a catchy-as-hell cheerleader-style hip-hop bop performed by Prism, the Z-Team’s light-manipulating influencer. As the bass bumps through the bar, Robert and co. are making the Red Ring thugs regret even glancing in their direction.</span></p>

 <p><span>There are so many standout gags, I don’t even know where to begin. Prism using her light powers to swat away a man who dared to interrupt her performance, causing him to cover his face and scream that she “temporarily” blinded him, only for her to retort, “Fuck you mean, ‘temporarily’? Bitch, you blind foreva!” is a standout. I also love when the devilish Malevola opens a portal outside the bar, allowing Golem, the team’s giant mud monster who had been exiled outside the establishment, to come in like a bull in a china shop. Punch Up using his short stature to run around below most people’s line of sight and give everyone a fist to the nads is also pretty fun. Those individual character moments are great, but the most effective parts of the whole sequence are the QTE-driven transitions between chilling at the not-Taco Bell and Robert doing some of the most violent non-lethal things he can do to a low-level grunt.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Every time </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span> went back to the restaurant and the Z-Team started giving each other shit about the way the night went, it went on just long enough to lull me into a sense of familiar ease, having forgotten the carnage I had just watched unfold. Then, someone would hand Robert something inconspicuous, like a hot sauce packet, I’d tear the packet open—and immediately be thrown into a scene of Robert yanking the cybernetic implants out of someone’s skull. By the time I was actually biting into the food I’d ordered, I knew not to let my guard down and braced myself for the game to leap back and show me what Robert bit into back at the bar. In addition to being very exciting to play, those moments have been some of the most entertaining to watch people react to, because even after </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>has established this trick, it still manages to catch players off guard.</span></p>           <p><span>The whole ordeal does end up accomplishing what Robert set out to do, at least. The team becomes a lot closer, and, depending on your choices, will trust their boss more than ever. Sometimes, all you need to bridge the gap between heroes and villains is a good bar brawl.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Fleshy, floaty, fabulous. That’s</span><i><span> Morsels</span></i><span> in a nutshell. A top-down action roguelike in which you collect creatures and swap between their unique powers, it shares familiar DNA with games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/binding-of-isaac-is-gonna-take-over-my-life-again-1619872452"><i><span>The Binding of Isaac</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nuclear-throne-challenge-completed-beat-the-game-with-1573122068"><i><span>Nuclear Throne</span></i><span>,</span></a><span> but with a </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>-style twist that has you collecting little creatures and harnessing their powers to overcome an on-screen frenzy of gnarly hazards. I love it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It looks great. It sounds great. I’m having a great time with </span><i><span>Morsels</span></i><span>, even if most of the game still feels like a hard-to-intuit fever dream right now. You technically play as a mouse who is gifted these shape-shifting abilities to take on the appearance and upgrades of various titular morsels as you climb the levels of a colorful sewer to thwart the domination of the cats above. Some shoot lasers. Some fart gas. Others augment your dash. Each comes with its own bubblegum-wrapper flavor text.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I’ve only played three hours of </span><i><span>Morsels </span></i><span>so far. That is not nearly enough to work my brain around all of its unusual logic and hidden secrets, which like any great roguelike are embedded within the monotonous but rewarding fabric of trial and error. But it is enough to know that </span><i><span>Morsels</span></i><span> is not just a fun gimmick wrapped up in a slick aesthetic. I can’t definitively say it has the roguelike juice just yet. However, it is already one of the most intriguing games I’ve played this year.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-not-releasing-f1-26-new-game-coming-2027/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sports-not-releasing-f1-26-next-new-game-coming-in-2027.1357099/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>EA Sports has announcemed that it’s not going to release F1 26 next year. </p>



<p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://x.com/EASPORTSF1/status/1990813568325857352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it was revealed</a> that instead of releasing F1 2026 in 2026, EA Sports will release a paid expansion for F1 25. This expansion will represent <strong>“the 2026 FIA Formula One World Championship, including new cars, teams, and regulations.”</strong></p>







<p>The next game, then, is scheduled to release in 2027. EA says that the next game in franchise will be a “<strong>reimagined and more expansive EA Sports F1 game”</strong>. They said that the game will deliver a <strong>“deeply authentic and innovative Formula 1 experience.”</strong></p>



<p>Questions around the future of the F1 franchise at EA have been popping up ever since the launch of F1 25. That release was scheduled to be the last of the current contract, though there was an option to extend it for two years. </p>



<p>EA had initially <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-ea-sports-f1-series-continues-with-two-year-option-pick-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed to Insider Gaming</a> that the option was picked up to keep the franchise going. However, just hours later, the company retracted that confirmation saying, <strong>“Apologies for the inconvenience, but we’ve been informed that the information we provided earlier today is inaccurate and we don’t have any information at this time.”</strong></p>



<p>Since then, it had been silent from EA and Formula 1 on the state of the series and F1 26. Until now, that is.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to EA and Formula 1 for added context on the decision to not release a game next year. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>







<p>What do you think of EA Sports releasing a paid update for F1 25 instead of F1 26 and waiting until 2027 to release the next game?

<p>"Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition is the award-winning cinematic action-adventure that tells Lara Croft's emotional journey from an inexperienced young woman into a hardened survivor – with a stunningly lifelike world to explore," reads the official blurb, with the promise of "high-octane combat", the ability to customise weapons and gear, and of course some "grueling" environments which Lara will need to endure.</p><p>Along with the base game, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition also comes with all of the original DLC, as well as digital versions of the Dark Horse comic Tomb Raider: The Beginning, Brady Games' mini-art book Tomb Raider: The Art of Survival, and the 'Final Hours of Tomb Raider' developer video series. </p>
<p>It also includes online multiplayer for up to eight players.</p>

<p>Shadow Drop of the Tomb Raider</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Oooof, we love a good shadow drop – <em>love it</em>.</p>
<p>This is one of the coolest we've seen in quite some time, as Aspyr has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a> is now available – out of <em>nowhere</em> – on the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Originally released in 2013 by Crystal Dynamics as a full reboot of the legendary action-adventure series starring Lara Croft, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition gained critical acclaim for its more grounded approach to exploration, strong visuals, and brutal combat.</p>
<p>We're a little sceptical about the visuals on display here, though. Although this is the Definitive Edition, which was effectively a remastered version of Tomb Raider for the PS4, some key enhancements don't appear to be present here.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious one as far as we can see is the increased fidelity seen on Lara's hair. This was a big talking point back in the day, and if this was possible on PS4, why isn't it present here on the Switch 2? Our guess is the game has probably been optimised primarily for the original Switch and thus lost a few of those enhanced features.</p>
<p>We'll reserve judgement for now. We're very keen to get stuck into this, and we're hopeful this means <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/rise_of_the_tomb_raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/shadow_of_the_tomb_raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a> will also follow suit at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Fans can already experience a bunch of classic Lara Croft adventures with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomb_raider_i-iii_remastered">Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomb_raider_iv-vi_remastered">Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</a> on the Switch, with Aspyr adding newly enhanced visuals alongside the original PS1 aesthetics.</p>

			<p>EA has announced that it will not release F1 26 in the coming year; instead, EA Sports F1 25 will get a major expansion meant to cover the 2026 Formula 1 season, with the series returning to its regular mainline release in 2027 with EA Sports F1 27.</p>



<p>The news was <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/f1/f1-25/news/f1-franchise-announcement">announced in a blog post on the EA website</a>, in which EA claims the decision was made "<em>as part of a strategic reset for the F1 franchise</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Following on from F1 25’s commercial and critical success - with praise from players, media, content creators, and F1 drivers alike - the team is building on the experience through a paid expansion," </em>the post reads.<em> "The premium content update will bring players closer to the sport’s major changes for 2026 that includes new cars, sporting regulations, teams, and drivers</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>The decision to offer a premium content update for F1® 25 is part of a strategic reset for the F1® Franchise. In 2027, a new game will be released that looks, feels, and plays differently, delivering more gameplay choices.</em>"</p>

<p>Codemasters senior creative director, Lee Mather, added, <em></em><em>"We’re fully committed to the EA SPORTS F1 franchise. Our multi-year plan extends this year’s excitement with the 2026 expansion and reimagines the F1 experience for 2027 to deliver even more for players at every level around the world.</em>"</p>



<p>With Codemasters taking a year off in many ways to get ready for the next full release in 2027, it'll be interesting to see what the jump between F1 25 and F1 27 looks like. Also, regarding next year's big paid expansion for F1 25, meant to cover the 2026 F1 season, the price that expansion releases at will likely make or break the success of this experiment.</p>

Its upcoming Echo Aviation Controller is about the size of a console gamepad but squeezes standard features like joysticks and buttons to one side to make room for flight-specific controls like throttle levers and a dedicated trim wheel.</p><p>The Echo Aviation Controller is expected to be available in mid-December 2025 for $149.99 through the <a href="https://flyhoneycomb.com/">company’s online store</a>. It’s fully compatible with various PC-based flight simulators, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/785181/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-release-date"><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em></a>, and it connects to a computer with a USB-C cable or wirelessly using a dongle, <a href="https://fselite.net/content/honeycomb-aeronautical-has-completely-revamped-the-echo-aviation-controller-for-the-better/">according to Calum Martin at <em>FSElite</em></a>, who went hands on with the gamepad at a recent event.</p><p>On the left side of the main controller you’ll find a thumbstick, four action buttons, and a second conical joystick used to control a simulator’s camera. Meanwhile, the right side is where all the flight specific controls are located: four throttle levers accompanied by a trim wheel that can be adjusted to maintain a plane’s altitude without additional inputs.</p><p>On the bottom of the Echo Aviation Controller are dedicated controls for adjusting the aircraft’s flaps, raising or lowering the landing gear, and activating the parking brake so you don’t have to reach for your keyboard as frequently. There are also two sets of shoulder buttons on the top edge, and on the back you’ll find a pair of sliding paddles that move in opposition and function as rudders, controlling the side-to-side movement of your aircraft’s nose and aiding in steering while navigating an airport and runways.</p><p>In addition to a hard shell carrying case, the Echo Aviation Controller will come with a collection of interchangeable caps for the throttle levers and other controls so you can customize and easily differentiate each of them by their shape or color if you’ve remapped their functionality.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/823018/honeycomb-aeronautical-echo-aviation-controller-gamepad-pc-flight-simulator]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There's a bit more excitement than usual, even among veteran car-watchers like me, for next year's F1 season. You see, the series is bringing in some <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/fia-unveils-formula-1-regulations-for-2026-and-beyond-featuring-more-agile.75qJiYOHXgeJqsVQtDr2UB">new rules</a> governing what its cars will look like and how they'll perform, meaning there's more potential on paper for serious changes to the established pecking order. Given that, I'm a bit unsure how to feel about EA and Codemasters having announced they're not making an F1 26, instead skipping ahead to 2027 with a DLC to fill the gap.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Codemasters senior creative director Lee Mather <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/f1/f1-25/news/f1-franchise-announcement">wrote</a> that this this call's been made as part of "a strategic reset" of the studio's F1 games, and stresses they and EA are "fully committed" to making F1 games going forwards. That last bit's probably in light of rally sim fans seeing this announcement and initially thinking '<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-arent-making-any-more-rally-games-but-there-are-alternatives">oh no, not again</a>', especially since Codies have released a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/formula-1">yearly F1 game</a> since 2010.</p>
<p>Instead of a new game for the first year of these new 2026 regulations, F1 25'll instead be getting a 2026 season paid DLC, which Mather wrote "will bring players closer to the sport’s major changes for 2026 that includes new cars, sporting regulations, teams, and drivers." Then, in 2027, there'll be a new F1 game that'll "mark the start of a new and more expansive F1 experience".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>🚨 ANNOUNCEMENT 🚨</p><p>EA SPORTS will release a paid expansion for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/F125?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#F125</a> in 2026, with the current game serving as the foundation for the 2026 season.</p><p>Additionally, 2027 will see the release of a new, reimagined EA SPORTS F1 title, that looks, feels, and plays differently.</p><p>📕 Read… <a href="https://t.co/Rk8hOmT1Yw">pic.twitter.com/Rk8hOmT1Yw</a></p></div>— EA SPORTS F1 (@EASPORTSF1) <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSF1/status/1990813568325857352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>On one hand, I've been on the side of yearly iterations of sports games often being pointless for years. Unless there are big changes planned, skipping a year and just doing a roster update to the last entry often feels like the better option for all parties except maybe the accountants. F1's a bit of different bag than ball sports, but taking a year to just see what the new rule changes do to the real world racing could well result in being able to simulate them better without as much of a scramble to react to anything unanticipated right out of the gate could be a similarly good call.</p><p>On the other, it'd maybe have made more sense on paper for F1 25, the last year of the current regulations which have been in place since 2022 and a season which has seen many teams skimp on current car development to concentrate on the all-new challenge of 2026, to be the year without a new game. Take a year to really have the developers delve into the new rules, and see if they can nail a fresh sim package and series revamp in time with them. Naturally, that assumes this pause was planned well in advance and hasn't seen me take into account any factors beyond what sounds good from the outside.</p>
<p>We'll see how it works out. As of right now, next year will be the first year in a long time I'll not spend part of digging into a fresh Codemasters racer.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/portable-15-inch-gaming-monitor-cheaper-than-budget-controller-now-lets-you-play-switch-on-big-screen-2000645164</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/portable-15-inch-gaming-monitor-cheaper-than-budget-controller-now-lets-you-play-switch-on-big-screen.1357060/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo Switch users squint at the 7-inch handheld screen for hours on end and lose important visual details and straining their eyes in marathon gaming sessions. <strong>Portable monitors solve that by turning handheld consoles into proper gaming rigs</strong> wherever you go and acting as secondary displays for laptop productivity.</p>
<p>This<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5381/"> 15.6-inch monitor gets 1080p resolution in an ultra-thin frame, now sitting at $49 instead of the usual $59 price tag</a>. That pricing undercuts budget gaming controllers but offers functionality that fundamentally shifts how you work and play on the go. The <strong>monitor itself weighs just 1.43 pounds</strong> with a built-in kickstand and makes it truly portable rather than another heavy accessory collecting dust at home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5381/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD IPS Display with 178-Degree Viewing Angles</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch display supports 1920 x 1080 with IPS panel technology</strong> that keeps color and brightness accurate from extreme angles up to 178 degrees. You can position the monitor off to the side when giving presentations or working collaboratively, and colors won’t shift or contrast degrade for viewers at an angle. The designation of an IPS A-grade panel indicates even better panel selection with fewer dead pixels and more consistent backlighting than that found on less-costly panels.<strong> HDR support</strong> will extend the dynamic range in content that supports the feature, brightening highlights and deepening shadows to a more life-like image reproduction.</p>
<p><strong>Low blue light mode</strong> reduces eye strain during extended viewing by filtering out harmful blue wavelengths that contribute to fatigue and sleep disruption. That matters during marathon gaming sessions or situations at work when you’re staring at screens all day for eight-plus hours. The screen also comes with a matte anti-glare coating diffusing any reflections from overhead lights or windows and keeps the screen visible under bright conditions where glossy displays become mirrors. <strong>Response time sits around 5ms</strong> and keeps everything smooth for casual gaming and video playback.</p>



<p><strong>Dual USB-C ports</strong> provide both power and video signal over a single cable when connected to supported devices. Newer laptops using Thunderbolt 3.0, Thunderbolt 4.0, or USB 3.1 Type-C with DisplayPort Alt Mode transmit video over USB-C and removes the need for a separate power adapter or video cables. The second USB-C port acts as a dedicated power input for those devices that cannot supply enough power over their USB-C ports. Additionally,<strong> a Mini HDMI port</strong> is available for older laptops, desktops, and game consoles that depend on traditional video outputs.</p>
<p><strong>The Nintendo Switch connects through USB-C</strong> when the unit is docked or via Mini HDMI with an adapter, and it upgrades instantly from a 7-inch handheld screen to a proper 15.6-inch display. PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series consoles all connect via HDMI, making the portable monitor a dedicated gaming display for bedrooms or travel.</p>



<p>It has dual built-in speakers along the bottom edge and offers stereo sound that is much clearer and louder than laptop speakers. The audio quality remains adequate for video calling, casual gaming and streaming content, though serious gaming or music listening could benefit with headphones or external speakers. The volume controls sit on the side panel alongside power and menu buttons for adjusting brightness and contrast and selecting between inputs.</p>
<p>The monitor <strong>does not rely on external power adapters in the case of devices</strong> that supply sufficient USB-C power when connected. This ensures cable simplicity during travels. In the event of low-power devices, connecting the second USB-C to a power source becomes necessary-an addition of one more cable to your setup. Power consumption remains less than 10 watts during normal use, hence drawing little power from the connected laptops or power banks.</p>
<p>You pay less than most budget game controllers for a full 1080p display that expands your gaming and productivity capabilities at $49. Most competing 15.6-inch portable monitorsbetween $120 to $200 with similar specs which makes this sale drop the price to buy levels.</p>

              <p>The cost of gaming is too damn high. Seriously, these machines just keep going up in price and every year it feels like we’re getting closer to $90-$100 games.

Sony has outlined the specifics of the deals over on its official <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/18/playstations-black-friday-deals-2025/">PlayStation blog</a>. Console savings include:</p>

That or I’m gonna get creative with a soldering iron (which might end up being a wildly more expensive indulgence).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! The time is [Redacted] and welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily roundup of interesting news, shit you might care about, and [Redacted]. We hope you enjoy your visit and get to learn more about Valve’s newly revealed Steam Machines, <em>Roblox</em> face-scanning tech, [Redacted], and Shroud’s problems with the Game Awards. And remember, please don’t [Redacted] or you might [Redacted]. Have a great day!</p>  <p>Popular video game streamer and <a href="https://kotaku.com/spectre-divide-shroud-refunds-season-1-shutting-down-1851769661">content creator Shroud</a> is a big fan of this year’s excellent extraction shooter <em>Arc Raiders.</em> And he’s not, apparently, a fan of the Game Awards snubbing the game for its Game of the Year award.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-world-is-just-not-ready-for-ai-in-video-games-shroud-accuses-the-game-awards-of-being-rigged-following-arc-raiders-goty-snub">As reported by <em>IGN</em>,</a> in a recent Twitch stream, Shroud watched the Game Awards nominees being announced and, upon seeing that<em> Arc Raiders</em> wasn’t in the running for the big GOTY award, expressed disappointment, saying, “The world is just not ready for AI in video games, not yet. They’re just not ready. But, hey, at least they nominated it for something. I genuinely thought they wouldn’t nominate it for anything because they were scared to get backlash. But at least they nominated it for something, so that’s good.” He then stated: “Once again, another year, another rigged year. That’s crazy.” Even before the nominees were revealed, <a href="https://x.com/shroud/status/1990460220020240848">he was claiming the show might be rigged.&nbsp;</a></p>

 <p>It’s a bit odd to suggest the world isn’t ready for <em>Arc Raiders</em>, considering it’s one of the most-played games on Steam right now and has received heaps of critical praise. And there is zero evidence that the Game Awards this year or any previous year are rigged. The awards are voted on by a panel of members of the games media and influencers. <em>IGN </em>reports that later in the stream, &nbsp;Shroud expressed disappointment at the possibility of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> winning, asking “who the fuck is playing” the Switch 2 platformer.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Roblox</em> rolls out age verification via face scanning</strong></h2> <p>Prepare to have your face scanned before playing <em>Roblox</em>. The extremely popular online free-to-play game has started <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/roblox-begins-rolling-out-age-checks-using-facial-age-estimation-technology">rolling out a voluntary face-scanning system</a> that will be used to check a player’s age and limit the ability for kids and adults to communicate. For now, you won’t need to verify your age by scanning your face with the <em>Roblox</em> app to play experiences online, but certain chat features will be locked behind the new process. And next year, age verification via a face scan will be required globally for all players to access the game at all. The company promises that it will delete all images and videos “immediately after processing.”</p>

 <h2><strong><em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> balloons will be included in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000645171" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000645171"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000645171">©Macy’s / Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p>Netflix’s hit animated movie <em>KPop Demon Hunters </em>continues to take over the world. Two characters from the cartoon, Derpy Tiger and Sussie, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/harry-potter-goblet-of-fire-movie-20-anniversary-voldemort-better-book/?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;taid=691c910e43e91a00019ec3e1&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky">will be featured in the annual parade’s 99th installment next week as large, colorful balloons</a>. I’ve still not seen the movie yet, so I don’t have much to add beyond the fact that the balloons look cool and oh god it’s almost Thanksgiving and I have done zero Christmas shopping or planning.</p>

 <h2><strong>Close to a decade after launch, Epic finally adds gifting to its store</strong></h2> <p>Seven years after launch, the Epic Game Store has finally added the ability to gift games to other players on the platform, a feature Valve’s Steam store has supported for years now. <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/gifting-now-available-on-egs">According to a blog post</a> about the new feature, players can now buy and send games directly to people on their Epic friends lists. Gifted games can only be sent to friends and they must not own the game already. If they decline it, you get a full refund.</p>

 <h2><strong>Steam Machines are more powerful than 70 percent of PCs that use Steam</strong></h2> <p>Valve’s recently announced Steam Machine, a console-like PC device for your TV, is supposedly more powerful than the majority of computers using Steam in 2025. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-pcs/valve-says-the-steam-machine-is-better-than-what-70-percent-of-pc-gamers-have-at-home-a-convenient-reminder-that-not-all-gaming-pcs-are-monster-rigs/">That’s according to Valve, as spotted by <em>PC Gamer.</em></a> In a recent video from Tested, the channel talked to Valve engineers who explained that for most Steam users, the upcoming Steam Machine will be an upgrade.</p>

 <p>“Another thing that we actually looked at is the Steam Hardware Survey,” said Valve. “Basically, that just gives us a good benchmark of where people’s home devices are at in terms of performance. And the Steam Machine is equal or better than 70 percent of what people have at home.”</p> <p>A good reminder that most people playing PC games aren’t running powerful rigs with cutting-edge tech, but are instead rocking budget builds with older, less powerful parts. So if the Steam Machine is priced smartly, it could be a big hit for those gamers looking to upgrade.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">Please stop cancelling Yoko Taro’s games</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">And here are your Game Awards 2025 nominees</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/escape-from-tarkov-steam-1-0-unheard-edition-2000644941">Everybody is mad about <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> on Steam</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

                <p>The future for single-player games has been a question mark since the rise of multiplayer and live-service titles across the video game industry. But according to a newly released survey from Ampere Analysis, single-player games remain the preference for 56% of gamers.</p><p>Ampere has shared the results of its survey, which had responses from 34,000 players across 22 different markets around the world. The new findings note that interest in single-player games has increased 4% over the last four years, and that there's only a small percentage of women (58%) who favor those titles over men (56%) who share their preferences.</p><p>One of the key findings from this survey suggests that fan interest in single-player games increases with age. Only 49% of younger players between 16-24 preferred single-player, while 64% of gamers age 55-64 favored it. Among gamers 25-34, single-player games were preferred by 56%.</p><p>The report notes that the US has the highest share of gamers who prefer single-player titles with 65%. However, Chinese gamers reportedly have the least interest in single-player games, with only 47% of players saying that they prefer those titles.</p><p>"This data reaffirms that single-player games are absolutely still viable--and sought-after--in the live-service-dominated landscape," said Ampere's senior research manager Louise Wooldridge. "The market favors multiplayer games for their ongoing engagement and monetization, but cracking a finely balanced formula for single-player games can leverage this broad audience appeal. Although most gamers prefer this content to multiplayer experiences, the friendship circle still plays a significant role in game discovery and uptake."</p><p>In recent years, Naughty Dog <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">canceled a Last of Us multiplayer title</a> to focus on single-player games like the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" data-ref-id="5000-654981">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Baldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-ceo-weighs-in-on-the-single-player-games-are-dead-argument/1100-6530174/" data-ref-id="1100-6530174">forcefully pushed back</a> on the notion that single-player titles are dead.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/demonschool/">Demonschool</a> proudly displays its influences, and the resemblance to games like Persona is clear across multiple aspects. One of them is the school side of things--it's in the name, after all. While most of your time in Demonschool will be spent, well, fighting demons and figuring out how to stop the apocalypse, you still have to hit the books.</p><p>At the very end of each in-game week, you'll be tasked with answering a quiz back at the classroom. In a similar fashion to activities like karaoke, you'll have to pick an answer within a timer. These, of course, are graded at the end--answer everything correctly and you'll be rewarded with relationship points on occasion, as well as moons, the currency used to obtain abilities. (They don't seem to have an official name, so I'll just call them moons.)</p><p>There's a total of ten exams--the main story continues afterward, but there's a clear cut-off point at the end of week 1. Without further ado, you can find all Demonschool quiz answers below, listed by each corresponding week.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_10">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 10</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_9">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 9</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_8">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 8</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_7">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 7</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_6">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 6</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_5">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 5</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_4">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 4</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_3">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 3</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_2">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 2</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_1">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 1</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_10">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 10</h2><ul><li>What is my name? - Thomas Vincent</li><li>Do the island and school have the same name? - Yes, they do</li><li>So what in fact is the island's name? - Hemsk</li><li>How many members are needed to form a club? - Four</li><li>Who is the school's dean? - Asatiani</li><li>If you fail in school, where do you go? - Prison</li></ul><p>Your reward is six moons.</p><h2 id="Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_9">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 9</h2><ul><li>What happens when two demon hunters attack simultaneously? - A combo</li><li>Does every demon hunter have their own special attack? - Yes</li><li>When a demon hunter makes a slight adjustment left or right, what is that called? - Sidestep</li><li>What elements are all demons weak to? - Almighty</li></ul><p>Your reward is four moons.</p><h2 id="Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_8">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 8</h2><ul><li>Who runs the island? - Dean Asatiani</li><li>What's the name of the alley shopkeep? - Triops</li><li>Who saved the island from invaders 100 years ago?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Demonschool Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160661/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a> is a tactical RPG that follows a demon hunter named Faye and her collected companions as members of the Black Magic Club at a poorly-ranked university on a peculiar island by the same name.</p>
<p>The school element of Demonschool should be taken with a big grain of salt, as Faye and her group of weirdos find out for themselves after arriving on the island. They’re given an assignment each week that has little to do with education and everything to do with the mysteries of the university and the impending apocalypse. Characters can 'study' techniques to unlock equipable abilities for the squad, and there is a weekly quiz on the weekends. Outside of furthering the main plot, time is spent building relationships, pursuing side quests, and playing minigames at various locations around town.</p>
<p>Combat is suitably at the heart of gameplay and employs what developer Necrosoft Games describes as "new-style tactics", which draws inspiration from the first two <strong>Persona</strong> games. Each battle begins with choosing your party, where you select which character goes in each starting slot. There are four slots available, and Faye always needs to be in the first. If the fight is connected to a personal quest, sometimes other characters are also locked into a slot.</p>
<figure><a title="Demonschool Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160671/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>During the planning phase, you can expend action points to navigate each character around the grid-based map. Moving into an enemy constitutes an attack, and different characters apply their own abilities, sometimes pushing enemies into those behind them or pulling and stunning enemies as they pass through.</p>
<p>There are eight action points available for use each round. The first time a character completes an action, they use only one point, and for each subsequent action they use an additional point. For example, it costs two action points for Faye's second movement and three points for her third movement. The balance of point cost, character abilities, and positioning relative to enemies on the map makes for an engaging puzzle each time combat rolls around.</p>
<p>Throughout the planning phase, there’s plenty of room for trial and error. Moves can be rewound and characters can act in any order. Once the movements for the round are locked in, the action phase unfolds, showing all of the piecemeal movements and attacks in full concert with one another. It makes for a satisfying visual, with characters zipping through lines of enemies, activating combos, and sending fountains of blood into the air for each downed combatant. Any remaining enemies then make their moves and attacks before the start of the next round.</p>
<figure><a title="Demonschool Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160674/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Successfully completed fights are graded as an A, B, or C and confer a corresponding amount of opals (the in-game currency), trophies, and class credits. In order to get a top mark, you need to kill a certain number of demons within the specified number of rounds and get at least one character to the back end of the map to seal the portal. If a team member dies or if you don’t meet the round goal, the grade for the combat goes down. The range of successful outcomes is nice, since a perfectionist player can aim for As, but imperfectly executed bouts don’t stop you from proceeding forward in the game.</p>
<p>The sheer amount of combat in Demonschool does mean that fighting becomes a little tedious at times. Especially in the early game when you only have access to a few characters and abilities, getting through fight after fight against the same demons feels like a slog. Thankfully, the tactical complexity begins to build momentum after the first couple of in-game weeks when new enemy types grace the battlefield and new teammates join the club.</p>
<p>At the start of the game, Faye and Namako are the only two playable characters, followed shortly after by the first two additions to the Black Magic Club, Destin and Knute. A total of 15 characters can be recruited and utilised in combat by the end.</p>
<figure><a title="Demonschool Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160663/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You can also build Faye’s relationship with the other club members by choosing dialogue options they approve of, singing karaoke with them, cooking them meals, and pursuing their side quests. Relationships are a secondary focus of the game, and Faye herself is irreverent and action-fixated. Still, the cast is varied and interesting enough to entertain.</p>
<p>Demonschool’s plot doesn’t take itself too seriously despite its penchant for horrifying scenarios. Character dialogue leans heavily on jokes and '90s tech references, lending an air of levity to all the gore and death. The art style also seems referential to the era of its setting, but still manages to feel suitable for contemporary gaming. The majority of gameplay is from an isometric view, but the camera does occasionally pan to different angles for important scenes, showing off a mix of 2D and 3D art.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is chock-full of synthy beats that set the mood well. Sound effects punctuate everything from UI navigation to character interactions. There's even a snazzy jingle for when time passes and a new day begins.</p>
<figure><a title="Demonschool Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160665/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>From a technical perspective, I didn’t experience any lag or issues while playing on Switch. There was a short loading time before the start of each battle, which was generally unobtrusive.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Demonschool is a lot of fun and provides a challenging, yet accessible strategic landscape. The mild horror elements pair well with the relaxed and somewhat goofy tone of the story, and the art style is well-suited to the late '90s setting.</p>
<p>On the whole, Demonschool feels well-polished and thoughtfully constructed: a huge relief after the game’s multiple delays!</p></section>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/krafton-ceo-allegedly-asked-chatgpt-how-to-avoid-paying-subnautica-devs-bonus/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ceo-of-%E2%80%9Cai-first%E2%80%9D-company-krafton-allegedly-asked-chatgpt-if-there-was-a-way-to-avoid-paying-subnautica-devs-their-bonus.1357021/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Shortly after Krafton <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/subnautica-owner-krafton-outlines-plans-to-transform-into-an-ai-first-company">affirmed its commitment to becoming an "<em>AI-first</em>" company</a>, the latest pre-trial document in the legal dispute between the co-founders of Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds alleges that Krafton's chief executive officer, Changham Kim, looked to ChatGPT to see if there was a way out of paying developers at Unknown Worlds their <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">$250 million bonus</a> that started this whole debacle.</p>



<p>The saga between the co-founders of Unknown Worlds (Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill, and Max McGuire) and Krafton is one of 2025's longer and more surprising stories. It's doubtful that anyone could have predicted that we'd get the most legal drama from a case that has everything an onlooker could ask for; high financial stakes, the concept of a big company versus a small band of creators, and a fandom caught in the middle, unsure of which side to believe.</p>



<p>Krafton has made several claims about the co-founders, including that they abandoned their roles at Unknown Worlds, that they had stolen from Krafton and from Unknown Worlds, that they would have willingly sabotaged the reputation of the studio they founded just to receive a big payout.</p>



<p>The co-founders have hit Krafton with allegations of their own, like alleging that Krafton management was purposely sabotaging Unknown Worlds to delay Subnautica 2's early access launch in the hopes of Unknown Worlds missing its window to earn the $250 million bonus, and that CEO Changham Kim even admitted to the co-founders that it would be "<em>disastrous</em>" and <em>"hugely embarrassing</em>" for Krafton if it were to pay Unknown Worlds the massive bonus.</p>



<p>There's a full recap of events at the bottom of this article, with bullet points listing everything that has happened so far, with links to our coverage of it all if you want to catch up. For now, we'll stick with what's new, which deals in particular with that last allegation from the co-founders about Krafton CEO Changham Kim.</p>



<p>Though Krafton denies that Kim admitted it would be a financial disaster for Krafton should it have to pay the bonus, the pre-trial brief (<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/krafton-ceo-accused-of-forming-secret-taskforce-project-x-to-seize-control-of-unknown-worlds">publicly available via Game Developer</a>) alleges that Krafton took direct steps to avoid paying the bonus not just for financial reasons, but because Kim felt it would be "<em>a professional embarrassment</em>" and that he and Krafton would be seen as "<em>a pushover</em>" if it paid the bonus. </p>



<p>The attempt to avoid the bonus was allegedly called "<em>Project X,"</em> and the brief also alleges that firing the co-founders was part of Kim's attempts to avoid paying the bonus. Kim even went so far as to ask ChatGPT if there was a way out of paying the bonus, which tracks considering Krafton is trying to front itself as an AI and Generative AI-forward company.</p>



<p>"<em>Desperate to avoid such a professional embarrassment</em>," the pre-trial brief reads, "<em>Kim obsessed over finding a way to avoid Krafton's obligation to pay the earnout. [Maria] Park told Kim that 'it seems to be highly likely that the earn-out will still be paid if the sales goal is achieved regardless of the dismissal with cause.'"</em></p>



<p>"<em>Kim turned to artificial intelligence to help him brainstorm ways to avoid paying the earnout. ChatGPT likewise advised that it would be 'difficult to cancel the earn-out.' But Kim was undeterred</em>."</p>



<p>The brief goes on to list Krafton's milestone check-ins with Unknown Worlds as the first step in what Kim believed to be the solution to his alleged problem, delaying the launch of Subnautica 2. Krafton would allegedly use the check-ins as the foundation to start its campaign that the game should be delayed.</p>



<p>That was only the beginning of 'Project X,' though, as the brief further alleges that Krafton's executive class was essentially planning a coordinated campaign to avoid paying the earnout by any and all means available to them, including seizing control of Unknown Worlds' website and social media channels and embarking on a "<em>Take-Over Scenario</em>" backup plan if the co-founders did not agree to Krafton's attempts to alter the earnout deal.</p>



<p>The brief also goes after one of Krafton's main claims about the co-founders, which is that they were allegedly abandoning their posts. Krafton has tried to use Charlie Cleveland's involvement in filmmaking as proof that he wasn't doing his job, but the pre-trial brief includes Slack messages that allegedly prove Krafton was fully aware of Cleveland's filmmaking efforts and was even considering making them an official part of his role <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/subnautica-2-could-be-getting-a-tv-show-or-movie/">as the potential for a Subnautica film grew</a>.</p>



<p>Suffice to say, nothing in this pre-trial brief from the co-founders' legal team looks good for Krafton, though that's also what it's supposed to do. For Krafton's part, <a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-krafton-lawsuit-chatgpt-2000644792">in a statement shared with Kotaku</a>, the company denies the claims in the pre-trial brief and claims that its first commitment has always been to deliver "<em>the best possible game to Subnautica fans</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>At the heart of every decision Krafton makes are the fans who deserve the best possible experience. Krafton made leadership changes at Unknown Worlds when the now-former executives focused on other priorities rather than </em><em>Subnautica 2</em>," the statement reads<em>. "Despite Krafton offering to extend the former executives’ earnout period if they returned to their positions, the former executives refused to return to work, and improperly retained hundreds of thousands of Unknown Worlds and Krafton confidential documents both just before and after they were terminated." </em></p>



<p>"<em>Additionally, they failed to preserve certain files after their employment ended. Through this court process, Krafton remains focused on what matters: delivering the best possible game to </em><em>Subnautica</em>’s fans. Krafton will continue to present the evidence proving that the former executives did not comply with their duties as the legal proceedings move forward."</p>



<p>Needless to say, this will be an extremely interesting case to follow once it gets to trial. We'll keep you updated on it as it continues to evolve.</p>



<hr>



<p>If you need a recap on this whole saga, here's a timeline with everything save for today's news to catch you up:</p>



<ul>
<li>On July 2, it was reported that the founders of Unknown Worlds, Ted Gill, Max McGuire, and Charlie Cleveland, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/">were fired</a> and replaced by former Striking Distance Studios head Steve Papoutsis. No concrete explanation for their dismissal was offered at the time, with Krafton instead emphasizing its commitment to delivering a game that players deserved.</li>



<li>On July 3, a <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter">statement from the Unknown Worlds website</a> did its best to calm concerns from fans about the fact that the three original core creatives behind Subnautica were suddenly not at the studio.</li>



<li>The next day, on July 4, the situation began to grow even more confusing, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Cleveland claims</a> Subnautica 2 was "<em>ready for early access release</em>" and that his and his fellow co-founders' dismissals were "<em>quite a shock</em>."</li>



<li>Five days later, on July 9, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">report from Bloomberg</a> adds a shocking allegation to the mix: that Krafton was delaying Subnautica 2 to avoid paying Unknown Worlds a $250 million bonus the studio would have been owed if they hit particular sales goals, which they would have done with Subnautica 2's launch. The delay was <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/">confirmed</a> hours after the report went live, and Krafton held that the delay was due to Subnautica 2 not being ready, citing feedback from internal playtesting.</li>



<li>On July 10, Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/">went on the offensive</a>, blaming co-founders Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire, claiming they had "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles to pursue personal interests. Krafton also clarified that 90% of the aforementioned $250 million bonus would go directly to the co-founders, with the rest to be split among the employees. Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire held that they always intended to distribute the bonus to other employees.</li>



<li>Also on July 10, Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889109175/Fortis-Advisors-v-Krafton-via-Aftermath">filed a lawsuit</a> against Krafton.</li>



<li>On July 11, an<a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-leaked-document-shows-krafton-delay/"> internal document from a milestone review of Subnautica 2's progress leaked</a> on Reddit, seemingly showing further support to Krafton's claims that the game wasn't ready, citing a lack of content on top of previously mentioned internal playtest feedback.</li>



<li>Over the following weekend on July 13, Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">confirmed the documents to be real</a>.</li>



<li>A few days later, on July 17, when the co-founders' suit against Krafton became publicly available, we discovered allegations that Krafton had <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">been sabotaging</a> Subnautica 2 to ensure it would be delayed. There was even a claim that the CEO of Krafton met with the co-founders and admitted that having to pay out the $250 million bonus "<em>could be disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing for Krafton</em>." It also attacks every other claim Krafton had made up to this point, and that the feedback received on Subnautica 2 playtesting "<em>unequivocally proved</em>" the game was ready for an early access launch.</li>



<li>Jumping ahead to August 12, Krafton<a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-fires-back-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-subnautica-2/"> shoots back</a> at Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire's lawsuit, again arguing that the co-founders were absentee leaders who abandoned their roles, and continued to hold that the game wasn't ready for an early access launch.</li>



<li>Eight days later, Unknown Worlds <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-legal-battle-unknown-worlds-files-lawsuit-against-co-founders-krafton/">files its own separate lawsuit</a> against its co-founders, telling Wccftech in an email that this suit "<em>is a direct response to their misconduct, including the theft of confidential information and attempts to pursue personal financial gain to the detriment of the company's interest</em>s<em>."</em></li>



<li>On September 19, a report revealed that the court denied two of Krafton's motions, and Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-krafton-u-turn/">seemingly U-turned on one of its key arguments</a> regarding why the co-founders were fired in the first place.</li>



<li>On September 24, new motions from Krafton alleged that <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-accuses-unknown-worlds-founders-of-stealing-subnautica-blueprint/">the founders stole what Krafton called "<em>effectively, a blueprint</em>"</a> for Subnautica in an attempt to further its argument that the co-founders intended to release Subnautica 2 on their own.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’ve developed a sixth sense for old video game cartridges. I can spot them at flea markets and thrift stores, spy them hidden behind stacks in used book stores. It happened after I first bought <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">an Analogue Pocket</a>, when the hunt for new and interesting Game Boy games became as important as actually playing them. Now my attention has turned to the Nintendo 64. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/819903/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-console-ship-date-november-18">Analogue’s long-delayed take on the console</a> — dubbed the Analogue 3D — might just be the most premium way there is to play N64 games, making it ideal for collectors.</p><p>After playing with the Analogue 3D over the last week, I’ve found a new appreciation for Nintendo’s oft-neglected console. I’ve played through games for the first time and revisited old favorites, all with the benefit of modern conveniences like wireless controllers and 4K visuals.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODIyODk0"><p><span>$<!-- -->250</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Old games look great</li><li>Compatible with a huge number of games</li><li>Lots of customization options</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>No controller in the box</li><li>Early 3D games don’t always age very well</li></ul></div></div></div><p>Analogue first made waves in 2015 with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/26/8850397/analogue-nt-premium-nes-nintendo-console">the Analogue NT</a>, a modern re-creation of the NES. Since then, it has done the same for platforms like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/16/17967790/analogue-mega-sg-sega-genesis-mega-drive-price-release-date">Sega Genesis</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/7/16981722/analogue-super-nt-snes-nintendo-review">SNES</a>, all of which are designed to play old cartridges — which can cost anywhere from a few bucks to a few hundred, depending what you’re buying — on modern televisions. The consoles use field-programmable gate array, or FPGA, technology to function just as the original hardware did.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</strong><span><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The Analogue 3D takes this concept and applies it to the N64. There are easier and cheaper ways to play many of these games, such as with the Nintendo Switch Online subscription or through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24132984/delta-free-emulator-nintendo-gba-n64-iphone-app-store-us">emulators on the App Store</a>. But, much like how a high-end record player preserves the physical element of listening to music, a console like the Analogue 3D offers a different and more tactile experience. It’s one that I’ve found creates a deeper connection with what I’m playing.</p><p>The $249.99 console looks like a slightly streamlined N64 — it’s available in both black and white — complete with a cartridge slot on top and four controller ports on the front, along with “power” and “reset” buttons. On the back there’s an SD card slot, two USB-A ports, and an HDMI port, which allows you to play it on a modern TV, unlike the original N64 hardware. It comes with an HDMI cable, USB cable, power supply, and a 16GB SD card preinstalled with the console’s operating system. It doesn’t come with a controller, but it supports the original wired N64 gamepads if you have some lying around, and various wireless options. I tested it using <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/716292/8bitdo-64-wireless-controller-nintendo-analogue-3d">8bitdo’s $39.99 Bluetooth option</a>, which crams the three-prong N64 controller into something resembling an Xbox pad.</p><p>The console outputs at up to 4K, and is region-free, meaning you can play games originally released in any territory, and the company says that it has “100 percent compatibility” with every N64 game. I obviously wasn’t able to test that, but I did throw a few oddballs at it — like a Japan-only J.League soccer game that I snagged for $10 — and didn’t run into any issues. In fact, one of the best parts of the system’s barebones interface is that it recognizes cartridges you pop in, so you can build up a digital list of your library. You can then use this function to customize aspects like the visual output for each game. Analogue says other features are coming in a future update, including quick save states and screenshots.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>But it’s those visual settings that really show the power of the Analogue 3D. Over the years, the N64 has proven to be a difficult console to emulate; even Nintendo messes it up sometimes, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746897/nintendo-switch-online-n64-emulation-quality-bad">with games that have ugly textures or are missing effects like fog</a> with few customization options. The Analogue 3D goes in the opposite direction with five different output modes, and I’ve found myself swapping between them depending on the kind of game I’m playing.</p><p>For instance, one of the visual modes is called “clean,” and it’s exactly what it sounds like: the original game rendered in high resolution with bright colors and sharp edges. This became my go-to for bright and colorful games like <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, which really popped with life on my TV. But for other games, this more pure and clean output ruined the vibe. Titles like <em>Star Wars: Shadows</em> <em>of the Empire</em> and <em>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</em>, for instance, use a lot of muted colors and effects like fog to create a darker, moodier tone. That energy was lost with the “clean” option. But as soon as I swapped over to BVM mode — or Broadcast Video Monitor, which Analogue calls “reference-grade for N64” — all those elements flooded back in. There I was, in the bleak Ord Mantell Junkyard, hunting down Boba Fett just like I did three decades ago, trying to spy drones flying through the fog.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>There are other modes, which you can swap on the fly, including one that mimics the look of a CRT monitor, along with further customization options with names like “gamma transfer” and “beam convergence,” which I admit are a bit beyond me. I had no problem finding the best output for each particular game. You have a lot more control here than when playing the same games with Nintendo’s subscription, which offers one solitary CRT filter.</p><p>The one caveat I’ll make here has little to do with the Analogue 3D hardware and more to do with the platform it’s tied to. The company’s previous consoles all focused on 2D games, which typically age a lot better than early 3D titles. Even though I played many of these N64 games when they first came out, I still found myself struggling with some of the 3D platforming segments<em>, </em>and, boy, did I miss the lack of a free camera to help me look around these three-dimensional worlds. It was even harder for games that were completely new to me. Again, this isn’t the Analogue 3D’s fault, but it is something to consider if you’re looking to invest in a library of cartridges.</p><p>But, for me at least, this has also made those cartridge hunts all the more satisfying. Finding something cool and surprising, and then spending time learning how to play it, gives me a chance to engage with these games on a deeper level. Unlike when I’m choosing from dozens or more games on a digital platform, where I can quickly swap to something else if I’m bored, a device like the Analogue 3D and the cartridges it plays force a level of focus that I often feel is missing from my life, as so many things vie for my attention.</p><p>I doubt I’d have given <em>Jikkyo J. League: Perfect Striker</em> a second thought through Nintendo Switch Online. But now that I have the cartridge, it’s become a multiplayer favorite in this house.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/822849/analogue-3d-review-n64]]></content:encoded>

A grim and insanitary management game about absolutely abysmal cars? One for you, Brendy! Oh sod it, he's not here anymore. That's what we get for letting him learn how to drive - and letting him have a cell with a window. I don't know how to drive, and I have played neither <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jalopy">Jalopy</a> nor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-summer-car">My Summer Car</a>, but I do know how to be a dishonest piece of shit, so I am at least 25% of the way towards writing an informed appraisal of Totally Legit Wheeler Seller.

Created by Polish developers Sombrero Labs, it's about making old, broken, patently unsafe cars look like new-ish, sellable ones by means of myriad methods. You can, for example, cut cars in half and solder the least rusty bits together, or paint tyres to look fresher, or photoshop some sparkle into your carefully angled phone pictures, or use an electric screwdriver to wind back the miles-counting... thingy. The best part from my perspective is that prior knowledge of actual car functioning appears inessential, to the point of being frowned upon. After all, the more you know about cars, the more you will understand why you shouldn't let anybody drive <em>these</em> cars.
</p>
<p>
If you do drive, I imagine you might enjoy this because it kindles memories of cars you shouldn't have bought as a foolish youth. Cars with suspiciously placed floor mats, and a raccoon nesting under the hood which the seller persuaded you was merely an atypically rabid and flea-ridden intake manifold. He probably charged you an extra £50 for that raccoon. Read more about Totally Legit Wheeler Seller on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3875690/Totally_Legit_Wheeler_Seller/">Steam</a>.
