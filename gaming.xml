			<p>Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room have released a brand new <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-the-masquerade-of-seattle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developer diary</a> for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, where you can hear about Phyre's role as the Sheriff from Project Design Director, Level Designer, Environment Artist, and Game Designer. Each member breaks down the mechanics of the game and what role Phyre plays as a whole. Alongside the developer diary, The Chinese Room has released a Community Talks video, which talks about the work that the Environment Art team has done. You can find this video below, which goes into detail about the art of Seattle.</p>
<p><iframe title="TCR Community Talks 3: The Environment Art of our Seattle" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eDC2TzniBu8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The latest dev diary takes the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-content-expansion-plans-to-be-announced-in-2025/">total up to 26</a>, which dives into detail about the city, the inhabitants found residing there, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNzggacI-EU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the rules</a> that they have to follow. There are some main mechanics that are implemented by the Masquerade, which will be noticeable throughout your time in the game to keep you in check. To be able to continue through Bloodlines 2, you need to maintain the Masquerade. If you don't, you will die. However, to keep you in line with this fulfillment, there will be a Masquerade meter at the top of the screen, which will be color-coded so that you know how careful you have to be around Seattle.</p>
<p>Phyre's job as Sheriff means that they have to keep the peace, which includes snuffing out attempts to breach the Masquerade from the outside. This includes gangs causing trouble, assaults in the public eye, and more. To handle these situations, quick thinking is required, as well as the ability to be discreet and not draw attention to the ongoing situation.</p>
<p>It's a known fact that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 takes place in Seattle. To make it easier to navigate, the developers have split Seattle up into five districts: Uptown, Downtown, Chinatown, Financial, and Industrial. Each district offers something unique, including its own dangers that may not be found in other districts in the city.</p>
<p>There will be key locations that can be found in each district, from pawn shops and nightclubs in their respective districts. While some may be hoping for some pretty pictures taken in the Space Needle, Seattle has been designed to be darker and grungier than ever, a suitable spot for vampires to lurk in the shadows.</p>
<p>The next developer diary for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will be released on February 26, 2025. This diary will be diving into the cast of mortals, and the roles they play in the game.</p>

And to do so via annoying ads. I mean, what a horrible way to try and make money! Covering something valuable up with ads! Gross.

Diablo 3 had a major expansion with Reaper of Souls and a smaller DLC adding the Necromancer class. It is possible that Blizzard keeps the annual releases plan intact by releasing a smaller DLC in 2025, like a new class without a new region. For now, it looks like Diablo 4 fans will have a longer wait than expected for the next major expansion, with only seasonal updates expected in 2025.</p><p>Diablo 4's first major expansion, Vessel of Hatred, launched in October 2024, adding a new region and class to Diablo 4, along with new loot and end-game content to run. Season 7 is currently underway, adding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-of-witchcraft-will-give-players-diablo-3-inspired-powers/1100-6528778/">Diablo 3-inspired Witch Doctor powers</a> and seasonal content focused on the Tree of Whispers activity. If that's not enough Diablo-style action for you, we've got some recommendations for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-games-like-diablo/2900-4750/" data-ref-id="2900-4750">games like Diablo</a> to check out.</p><p>In other Blizzard news, new changes were announced for Overwatch 2, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-injects-more-moba-energy-into-overwatch-2-with-new-perks-system/1100-6529410/">new perk system</a>, meant to inject some new life into the hero shooter.</p>

			<p>Today, Sharkmob and Level Infinite have announced that the tactical open-world extraction shooter Exoborne will have an open playtest, which will be available for players to dive into until 17 February. Unfortunately, this playtest is only available via Steam on PC, but the sign-up process for those who have access to it is incredibly easy to sign up, as you just have to visit the Steam page for Exoborne and press the "Request Access" button. This playtest is available worldwide. If you want to see what you can expect from your time in Exoborne, make sure to check out the new trailer below, which has been released specifically to celebrate the news.</p>
<p><iframe title="Exoborne Playtest | Live Now" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GXp6CC66gVo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the trailer, Sharkmob has released an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tqnPjrA29k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 minute long video</a> that is a walkthrough of the gameplay, showcasing some of the main features that you can expect to experience in the game. This is the second title to be developed by Sharkmob, with the first being the short-lived Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt. Exoborne was first announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/exoborne-is-a-tactical-open-world-extraction-shooter-in-development-at-sharkmob/">two years ago</a>, and there have been minimal details about the game since.</p>
<p>This five-day global playtest will provide a lot of valuable feedback to the developers, as well as critiques and reports of any bugs that may be present during the playtest.</p>
<p>If this is your first time hearing about Exoborne, this title is set to be an open-world, tactical extraction shooter that takes place in a ravaged world that was torn apart by extreme forces of nature. As a result, you need to customize and adapt your exo-rig to be able to gain an advantage over other players and to be able to sustain yourself during devastating weather changes.</p>
<p>Compared to other battle royales, Exoborne offers the opportunity to navigate a world with unprecedented verticality, which provides plenty of new opportunities for exploration, hiding spots, and advantages to gain against your opponents.</p>
<p>As you progress through the game, your progress will continue to unlock new gear and equipment that will benefit you in your future sessions.</p>
<p>While a fair amount of battle royales don't have a story, Exoborne has an ever-evolving story, which will help set the scene for any future content updates and mysteries that are uncovered in the world of Exoborne.</p>
<p>At the moment, Exoborne doesn't have a set release date, and the game is being developed using Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Will you be diving into the playtest for this new battle royale?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-daggerheart-miniseries-announced-featuring-age-of-umbra-campaign-frame<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Critical Role has announced a new <em>Daggerheart</em> miniseries. The multimedia company behind the acclaimed actual play series has confirmed a new mini-campaign to showcase their upcoming original fantasy TTRPG. This new campaign will feature their grimdark campaign frame: The Age of Umbra.</p>

<h2>The Daggerheart Miniseries Announcement</h2>

<p>In a social media post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Critical Role's own Matt Mercer posted a video. In the video, he showed off the final version of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/daggerheart-darrington-press-hotly-anticipated-ttrpg-is-now-available-for-pre-order" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a> core rulebook. While showing off the book's pages, Mercer lingered on an entry for campaign frames. One of those campaign frames is the Age of Umbra, a grimdark fantasy setting.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-age-of-umbra-page-screenshot.jpg?itok=YbKs-jy8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-age-of-umbra-page-screenshot.jpg?itok=LDACuj5C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The video ends with Mercer confirming that Critical Role will be producing a new <em>Daggerheart</em> actual play miniseries set in the Age of Umbra. According to a report by <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/critical-role-to-run-grimdark-daggerheart-miniseries.711559/" rel="nofollow">EN World</a>, Mercer intentionally created the Age of Umbra to be similar to the Soulsborne series or the board game Kingdom Death: Monster. It is a dark, grim, and challenging world, a sharp contrast to the core game's lighter, more heroic tone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It is a landscape that has been without gods for over 100 years; they abandoned the people and the realm itself is kind of rotting and dying. The survivors that exist there have to hold on to what community there is to get by as the dark things in the shadows grow darker and larger as time passes."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The announcement of this <em>Daggerheart</em> miniseries is during an interesting transitionary period for Critical Role. The show just wrapped up its third campaign with an impressive <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-concludes-campaign-3-with-epic-8-hour-finale-new-godly-exu-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">8.5-hour finale</a>, and they have announced several smaller series like <em>EXU: Divergence</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This has led to speculation that <em>Critical Role</em> may move away from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> and pivot entirely to <em>Daggerheart</em> for future campaigns. But given that the studio remained committed to Campaign 3 while producing and publishing the gaslamp fantasy RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/candela-obscura-core-rulebook-review-comprehensive-guide-to-newfaire-and-horror" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Candela Obscura</em></a>, those worries appear unfounded.</p>

Her straight-forward kit has a lot of interesting quirks that enable them to mesh well together and excel in specific-use cases. Understanding how to make the most of her tools is key to keeping yourself and the rest of your team in the fight.</p><h2 id="h1038255"><a id=""></a>Healing is your priority, but don’t forget to dish out some damage too</h2><p>Luna Snow’s ease of use and fantastic healing are the primary reasons why she’s considered a top Strategist. While everyone loves a healer who can keep the team in top shape, that doesn’t mean Luna is a one-trick pony. Her low damage is offset by burst-fire hitscan shots that can potentially shred an opponent with a small health pool. I’m not advising that you play her like a DPS (damage-per-second) hero, but there is nothing wrong with dealing damage alongside your team when you have the ability to. Aside from potentially eliminating an enemy, it’s an ideal way to charge up your Ultimate.</p><h2 id="h1038256"><a id=""></a>Prioritize Idol Aura for flankers or emergency Burst Healing</h2><p>One of Luna’s most interesting abilities is Share The Stage. This marks an ally with Idol Aura, which grants them a portion of the healing that Luna is providing to others. My suggestion is to put this on any teammate who’ll be flanking the enemy since you won’t have line-of-sight. Spider-Man, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774">Venom</a></span>, and Psylocke should all be top of mind to give Idol Aura too. Don’t be embarrassed about needing to give it to an Iron Man either, depending on how erratic they’re flying around.</p><p>The other aspect that makes this ability amazing is that Luna will generate 35-percent bonus healing if her target is an ally she marked with Idol Aura. If one of your Vanguards is close to death, throw Idol Aura on them and then heal like normal. That bonus will make a major difference and have them in a safer range of health before you know it. Just remember to switch back to a flanker afterward! </p><h2 id="h1038257"><a id=""></a>Absolute Zero can halt momentum and even some Ultimates</h2><p>It wouldn’t feel right for an ice-based character to not have a freezing crowd-control ability. Fulfilling that role is Absolute Zero, which emits a large projectile that will freeze an enemy for 2.7 seconds. The effect will cancel out if the target is attacked after the initial 0.5 seconds of being frozen. While this likely exists as a buffer to allow them to be frozen for even a short amount of time, Luna’s primary attack is a three-round burst-fire that comes out in 0.5 seconds. Letting loose with a few shots after throwing out the Absolute Zero projectile is a smart way to maximize damage.</p><p>You’ll ideally want to use this against any flankers attacking you or to keep any annoyingly nimble characters still so you can score some headshots. Targeting an Ulting enemy is an excellent use for the ability, as it can interrupt or, in some cases, completely cancel an ultimate. Feel free to use this even more liberally if you’re the sole healer on the team, since it is one of two abilities that provides self-healing at a rate of 30 HP/s for three seconds. It’s certainly better than nothing.</p><h2 id="h1038258"><a id=""></a>Focus on healing with Ice Arts</h2><p>Two obvious drawbacks for Luna are that she requires great aim and can’t usually heal multiple characters at once. If you have crap aim like I do, this can be a pretty big barrier. Making up for that is the Ice Arts ability, which temporarily replaces her primary fire with long-range beam shots. Although the higher DMG and healing values are less effective due to the much lower firing rate, the beam has a sizable hitbox and can pierce teammates and enemies alike. It will also turn back into the normal primary fire with full ammo, so you can use this as a free reload of sorts.</p><p>The big takeaway here is not how great the ability is. While you can deal damage with these beams, it’s better to use them for healing. A notable downside to the Ice Arts ability is that landing any headshots won’t score you a critical hit. Being able to line up multiple enemies with a single shot can also be pretty situational. I strongly suggest using Ice Arts when your teammates are grouped up and in need of heals. That being said, just like Absolute Zero, this ability also provides self-healing. Don’t be afraid to use it if you’re in dire need of health.</p><h2 id="h1038259"><a id=""></a>Save your Ultimate for dicey situations</h2><figure id="" data-id="ed551ddafc5e850c9d78518d0cd33229" data-recommend-id="image://ed551ddafc5e850c9d78518d0cd33229" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Luna Snow poses with her hand in the air to signify the end of her ultimate." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luna Snow poses with her hand in the air to signify the end of her ultimate." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ed551ddafc5e850c9d78518d0cd33229" data-recommend-id="image://ed551ddafc5e850c9d78518d0cd33229" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Luna Snow poses with her hand in the air to signify the end of her ultimate." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Luna’s Ultimate is considered the most OP (overpowered) for good reason. For an unnecessarily long twelve seconds, she can swap between empowering allies around her with a 40% damage boost or healing them at a rate of 250 per second. That healing rate is enough to survive the harshest onslaughts and attacks outside a Scarlet Witch or Iron Man Ultimate. Save this move for when your team rushes to take over a point or situations where you’re struggling to defend against your opponents. It’s a ridiculous ability and I hate dealing with it when the opposing team uses it. However, I also love it when I get to use it, so I guess I’m part of the problem.</p><h2 id="h1038260"><a id=""></a>Make use of Iron Fist’s team-up attack if you have it</h2><p>Luna is one of the few characters who is a part of multiple <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-best-team-up-attacks-season-zero-1851733122&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-best-team-up-attacks-season-zero-1851733122">team-up abilities</a></span>. The one worth highlighting here is Frozen Chi, an ability she gains when teaming up with Iron Fist. Using it will discharge an icy ring that heals allies while also knocking back enemies and applying a slowing effect. It’s a fantastic addition to her kit that doubles as both another crowd control ability and area-of-effect healing.</p><p>Keep the above tips in mind and you’re sure to be the <em>Marvel Rivals</em> healer that everyone deserves. You might start to earn the coveted MVP and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-svp-mean-rank-competitive-play-1851722265&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-svp-mean-rank-competitive-play-1851722265">SVP titles</a></span> more often too.</p><hr><p><br><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is available as a free-to-play game for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Overwatch’s spotlight showcase on February 12 included <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-adds-ability-altering-perks-brings-back-loot-boxes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a massive amount of content planned for the next couple seasons</a>. Among that content is a huge new competitive mode, Stadium, that borrows from other popular titles, and provides a completely unique experience.</p>



<p>This is Stadium, and it’s coming to Overwatch 2 in Season 16.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-stadium-mode-in-overwatch">What is Stadium Mode in Overwatch?</h2>



<p><a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24177197/overwatch-2-spotlight-a-new-era-of-innovation-and-excitement/#:~:text=Stadium%3A%20The%20Ultimate%20Battleground" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stadium</a> is a best-of-seven-rounds competitive mode, where players use currency earned from previous rounds to buy new items and upgrades. The upgrades menu is strikingly similar to the one used in Deadlock, in that players have a finite amount of slots for traits and items. There are even starter builds that let players pick predetermined items and powers, but only for new players. Like in games such as VALORANT or Counter-Strike, players are limited to what they can afford in early rounds, but can save up for more powerful abilities later on.</p>



<p>Players will have the ability to buy, trade, and sell their abilities during any round. There abilities provide dozens of different effects, like extra projectiles, ability cooldown reductions, extra damage, extra charges, and slowing effects.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Each round of Stadium will consist of a game of one of three core modes: Control, Push, or Clash. While Stadium is a best-of-seven, a “mercy rule” will end the match if a team loses the first three rounds. There’s also a bounty system that rewards taking down dominating players.</p>



<p>Stadium will give the players the choice of playing either first-person or third-person on restructured maps. It will also feature its own ranked mode. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-can-i-play-stadium-in-overwatch">When Can I Play Stadium in Overwatch?</h2>



<p>Stadium mode will launch in April 2025, as part of the Season 16 update to Overwatch 2. When the mode launches in Season 16, there will be 14 core heroes available to play. More heroes, maps, and modes will be added over time, and Stadium will be subject to changes stemming from player feedback.</p>



<p>Is Stadium a mode you must try out when it launches later this year? Let us know down below and in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1197/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2's</a> first new hero of 2025 will be Freya, an explosive crossbow-wielding bounty hunter who can dash and fly around the battlefield.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard revealed Freya as part of its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf5dPQ7YeE8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overwatch 2 Spotlight livestream</a>, diving into more details about the damage-role hero. Freya is a former search-and-rescue operative but now works as a bounty hunter. Her basic crossbow attack will rapidly shoot bolts at enemies. However, her alternate fire sees her taking aim to deliver a high-speed explosive bolt for big damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442960-overwatch2freya.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442960" data-ratio="0.56214285714286" data-width="1400" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442960-overwatch2freya.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442960"></a><figcaption>Freya wields and explosive crossbow and a bola launcher that can pull enemies together.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442960-overwatch2freya.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Movement and positioning seems to be a big part of Freya's toolkit, with Blizzard stating she is a "challenging and rewarding" character that will take "precision and a steady aim to master." She has both a quick dash ability (that reloads her crossbow in the process) and a move called Updraft that will launch her into the sky. Her Bola Shot ability pulls enemies together, setting them up for a damaging combo from teammates or a well-placed explosive crossbow shot.</p><p dir="ltr">Freya will join Overwatch 2's roster as part of Season 16 later this year, but players will get the chance to try her out during Season 15 as part of a trial weekend.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442962-overwatch2aquaconceptart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442962" data-ratio="0.44625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442962-overwatch2aquaconceptart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442962"></a><figcaption>Aqua will join Overwatch 2 as part of Season 18.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442962-overwatch2aquaconceptart.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While Blizzard shared plenty of details about Freya, she wasn't the only new hero the developer revealed. Aqua, a staff-wielding, water-bending Chinese hero, will join Overwatch 2 as part of Season 18, Blizzard announced, bringing with him an "innovative playstyle." Blizzard at this stage has only shared concept art for Aqua, but said more details about his abilities would come closer to his release.</p><p dir="ltr">New heroes were just a part of all the announcements to come out of Blizzard's Overwatch 2 Spotlight stream. For starters, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-bringing-back-loot-boxes-very-soon-with-some-changes/1100-6529450/" data-ref-id="1100-6529450">loot boxes are returning to Overwatch 2</a> with Season 15. Blizzard additionally revealed the addition of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-injects-more-moba-energy-into-overwatch-2-with-new-perks-system/1100-6529410/" data-ref-id="1100-6529410">Perks as a new core gameplay system in Overwatch 2</a>, as well as a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-round-based-stadium-mode-looks-to-reinvent-blizzards-shooter-in-a-big-way/1100-6529416/" data-ref-id="1100-6529416">round-based, third-person mode called Stadium</a> that sees players buying items and upgrading their heroes over the course of a match.</p>

"Everything about it violated all our principles."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nonetheless, he noted his former company's acqusition strategy was to buy companies for their proprietary technology, IP, or "history of profitability."

                <p>One of the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch/" data-ref-id="5000-355766">Overwatch's</a> most best-known features, loot boxes, are coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a> as part of Season 15 on February 18--though you won't be able to buy them directly as was originally the case.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, loot boxes will return as part of Overwatch 2's seasonal free and premium battle passes, as well as rewards for weekly and event challenges. Blizzard is looking to bring more transparency to the system as well, giving players more information in regards to item-drop chances and rarity guarantees.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf5dPQ7YeE8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Cf5dPQ7YeE8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">An item of Rare or better quality has a chance to drop from every loot box. After opening five loot boxes, players will be guaranteed an Epic-quality item, and after 20 loot boxes, a guaranteed Legendary. Legendary loot boxes, one of which can be earned via the free battle pass (and two through the premium battle pass), have a 100% chance to reward a Legendary item.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard said it will release more details about the return of loot boxes next week, but it is already a bit of a full-circle moment for Overwatch. Whereas once loot boxes were maligned as a microtransaction thanks to their random rewards, Blizzard is now citing the community demand as the reason behind their return.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-ditches-loot-boxes-pvp-roadmap-promises-new-heroes-and-maps-regularly/1100-6504688/" data-ref-id="1100-6504688">Overwatch 2 ditched loot boxes when it transformed from Overwatch 1 in 2022</a> and went free-to-play. Since then, fans have complained about a lack of rewards in Overwatch 2 compared to its predecessor, with the only real way to earn cosmetics for free coming from the free version of the game's battle pass or the occasional event. In the original Overwatch, players regularly earned loot boxes just by leveling up their account through playing, which was done away with for the sequel.</p><p dir="ltr">The return of loot boxes is just one of the surprises Blizzard had in store as part of its recent Overwatch 2 Spotlight livestream. Also coming as part of Season 15 is the addition of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-injects-more-moba-energy-into-overwatch-2-with-new-perks-system/1100-6529410/" data-ref-id="1100-6529410">Perks, gameplay-augmenting choices for each Overwatch 2 hero</a> that players will get to choose over the course of a match. Blizzard additionally detailed a new third-person, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-round-based-stadium-mode-looks-to-reinvent-blizzards-shooter-in-a-big-way/1100-6529416/" data-ref-id="1100-6529416">round-based mode coming in Season 16 called Stadium that transforms Overwatch 2</a> into something closer to Valve's still unreleased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deadlock/" data-ref-id="5000-639448">Deadlock</a> or even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/counter-strike/" data-ref-id="5000-3000">Counter-Strike</a>.</p>

            <p>
Inkle - the studio behind Eurogamer favourites including Heaven's Vault, A Highland Story, and 80 Days - has unveiled its latest narrative-rich adventure: 1920s boarding school mystery Expelled!, which is coming to PC, Switch, and mobile on 12th March.
</p>
<p>
If Expelled rings a distant bell, that might be because <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highland-song-studio-inkle-teasing-1920s-mystery-at-miss-mulligatawneys-school-for-promising-girls">it was originally teased last June</a>, under the name Miss Mulligatawney's School for Promising Girls. At the time, details were scant - its Steam description merely contained a flyer for the titular academy promising, "The best education the 1920s have to offer!" - but now all has been revealed.
</p>
<p>
Expelled is being pushed as a follow-up to Inkle's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/get-away-with-murder-in-inkles-surprise-new-game-overboard">well-received 2021 ocean liner whodunnit Overboard!</a>, and is described as a "next-gen visual novel with a wicked twist". It sees players attempting to clear their name following the fenestration-based attempted murder of a boarding school prefect, all by mounting their own investigation - which might also involve a spot of blackmail and betrayal, depending what they're willing to do to avoid expulsion.

<p>
All this sees players - in the role of scholarship student Verity Amersham, voiced by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s Amelia Tyler - navigating the simulated story world of a 1920s boarding school (in which students and staff move around independently in real-time, remembering everything they see and responding appropriately) in order to eke out truths and exploit secrets. Players have just one day to solve the mystery and escape punishment through subterfuge and cunning - perhaps even choosing to frame someone else if it'll save their bacon.
</p>
<p>
Inkle says one playthrough of Expelled should last no more than 45 minutes, but each run features new leads and opportunities making it "massively replayable". And it's not just a question of avoiding expulsion; players can also work toward other targets, such as rising to the position of head girl, or solving further mysteries - such as uncovering your best friend's dark secret. And all this is accompanied by a jazz soundtrack featuring music from the likes of George Gershwin, Paul Whiteman, Louis Armstrong, and Bessie Smith.
</p>
<p>
Expelled!: An Overboard! Game launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2963890/Expelled/">Steam</a>, Switch, iOS, and Android on 12th March.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/610599/overwatch-2-season-15-16-update-stadium-new-character-freja-loot-boxes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Overwatch 2</em> is getting quite the shakeup in 2025 as it faces growing competition from other online shooters. It starts with the season 15 update that’s coming on February 18th that’ll tease a new hero and introduce an in-game Perks system for existing ones, plus the return of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278781/overwatch-2-season-14-6v6-test">6v6 competitive queues Blizzard tested late last year</a>. There’s also the return of loot boxes and then, in April, a <em>Counterstrike</em>-like mode, two new characters, and a revamped ranked queue that lets you ban heroes and vote on maps.</p><p>Reintroducing loot boxes may be a polarizing move, as games that implement them have received backlash over the years for their predatory nature. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/16/23171133/overwatch-2-loot-boxes-free-to-play">Blizzard removed them from <em>Overwatch</em> a few years ago</a> in favor of an in-game shop when it restructured its monetization model after going free-to-play. The company will responsibly publicize drop rates and is guaranteeing that you’ll receive an item of “Rare” rarity or better in each box, plus a guaranteed “Epic” after opening five and a “Legendary” after opening 20. We’re not sure whether you’ll still be able to purchase cosmetics directly from a rotating in-game shop, but you can earn loot boxes as part of weekly and event rewards, and you can get up to three guaranteed Legendary loot boxes in each seasonal battle pass.</p><p>Stadium is arguably the biggest change announced for <em>Overwatch 2</em> so far. The new gameplay mode is a best-of-seven romp between two teams of five that’s akin to <em>CounterStrike: Go</em> or <em>Valorant</em>. You’ll earn currency each round, with rotating maps and objectives alternating between Control, Clash, and Push.</p><p>The cash goes toward upgrades for your hero that are unique to the mode, whether you’re unlocking an ability or upgrading it with enhanced potency or transformative effects that buff your offense and team utility. You can even choose between first-person or third-person POVs. It’s getting its own ranked queue, too, and launches with 14 heroes to start, with more planned to be added in future updates alongside a steady rollout of new maps.</p><p>Season 16 will also introduce Freja, a high-mobility character who can dash horizontally and jump vertically while wielding a dual-mode crossbow that enables both rapid-fire shooting and precision sniping. You’ll be able to play her for a bit during a trial weekend in Season 15. Blizzard is also teasing a new character for Season 18 named Aqua, appropriately named for his water-based abilities.</p><p>As for the new Perks system, it promises to enhance all of the game’s heroes with two unique upgrades per match. Your first upgrade is a minor one that lets you choose one of two slight boosts, perhaps a slightly stronger passive or a reduced cooldown for a core ability. The second upgrade offers a more substantial play style shift designed to help turn the tides of battle — Torbjorn can choose between a stronger level three turret or the ability to mount it on a wall, for example.</p><p>These drastic changes are almost necessary for any service-based online arena shooter to stand out amidst growing competition, as evidenced by <em>Fortnite</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315134/fortnite-ballistic-counter-strike-first-person-shooter-fps">recently receiving a similar mode</a> as Epic Games continues experimenting. There are only so many players to go around, after all, especially with newcomer <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337409/marvel-rivals-fantastic-four-season-1-date-trailer">Marvel Rivals</a></em> making a loud and very noticeable Namor-sized splash of late.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Two major changes to Overwatch are coming in Season 15 of the long-running hero shooter from Blizzard: the debut of gameplay perks and the return of loot boxes. Billed as the “boldest gameplay evolution yet,” perks let players level up their hero abilities with new effects mid-match.</p>



<p>Check out the full details on all the <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24177197/overwatch-2-spotlight-a-new-era-of-innovation-and-excitement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new changes</a> coming to Overwatch in Season 15 below.</p>



<h2 id="h-overwatch-s-biggest-content-change-arguably-since-the-sequel">Overwatch’s Biggest Content Change Arguably Since the Sequel</h2>



<p>The new perk system allows player to upgrade their hero’s kit during a match by earning level experience. Players can earn level experience by getting kills, dealing damage, and healing. The perks are similar to Reality Augments in Fortnite: when a player unlocks the ability to get a perk, they can use their controls to select one of the two options. If a player switches heroes during a match, their hero level will reset, but they will earn experience faster. Players can equip three perks per match: two Minor perks, and one Major perk.</p>



<p>In addition to the new perks system, Season 15 will re-introduce loot boxes. Players will be able to earn loot boxes from weekly and event rewards, as well as one Legendary loot box from the free battle pass, and two more from the Premium pass. A Rare or better item will drop in every box, an Epic item is guaranteed within five consecutive boxes, and a Legendary it guaranteed within 20 consecutive boxes. If an item you already own is in the box, it will re-roll it with an item of the same rarity.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>These two changes are just a portion of the changes promised over the next 2-3 seasons. Other changes include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Competitive rank reset</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-classic-sees-6v6-matches-return-for-limited-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Permanent Overwatch Classic mode</a>, featuring the GOATS Meta (three tanks, three support)</li>



<li>New hero: Freja, a bounty hunter with a quick-firing crossbow, a quick dash, and an explosive Bola Shot</li>



<li>New cosmetics</li>



<li>Stadium mode: a completely overhauled competitive mode featuring a best-of-seven system, new abilities, first and third person mode, and its own ranked mode. Currently in development, launching in season 16</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>Season 15 officially launches on February 18.</p>

		<p>Inkle has just revealed Expelled!, a sequel to their reverse murder mystery <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/overboard">Overboard!</a>, coming to PC, Nintendo Switch and iOS on 12th March.</p>
<p><iframe title="Expelled! Official trailer - release date announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OzUjGieWQIY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Someone has pushed a school prefect out of a window on the top floor of a school, and all fingers at this 1920s boarding school are being pointed right your way. Starring Amelia Tyler (Baldur’s Gate 3) as Verity, you have to find a way to reveal the “truth”, no matter the cost, trying to get away with the deed. Truth be told, I’m jumping to conclusions, considering the plot of Overboard!, so there’s a chance that Verity really didn’t do it – it does look quite 1920s Mean Girls.</p>
<p>You’ll have to get through the school day, talking to other characters, sneaking around and revealing the secrets of student and teachers to use to your advantage. But you’ll have to do your best not to be caught, with a simulated world where other character move and act independently and remember everything they see and hear you do. You’ll have to act fast and be smart to make it through the day without getting expelled.</p>
<p>A play-through will last for around 30-45 minutes, whether you succeed or fail, making this eminently replayable as you make your way through the story.</p>

<p>It’s all in the same vein as Overboard!, a game in which a lady has decided to give her husband the old heave ho, knocking him over the side of a ship and to his demise. She needs to try and get away with it, pinning the blame on one of the five other passengers in order to get the life insurance money – suicide won’t cut it for that!</p>
<p>Overboard was one of the highlights of 2021, building on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/inkle">Inkle’s</a> storytelling pedigree with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/80-days">80 Days</a>, and Expelled! looks like it’s taking that core idea to the next level.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-adds-in-match-perks-the-biggest-gameplay-innovation-since-overwatch-launched-in-2016/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard Entertainment has announced several major changes coming to Overwatch 2 with Season 15, which is due to begin on Tuesday, February 18.</p>
<p>By far the most significant addition, described by the studio as the biggest gameplay innovation since the franchise launch, is in-match Perks. While in a match, players will now level up two times, gaining hero-specific bonuses that are meant to provide greater strategic depth.</p>
<p>With the first level up, the player will get to pick between two minor Perks. For example, with Torbjorn, they can either choose 'Craftsman' (Forge Hammer restores armor health to allies and the turret repair heal is improved by 25%) or 'Fully Loaded' (activating Overload completely refills the Rivet Gun's ammunition). Another example shared is Lucio's 'Bass Blowout', which increases the knockback of his Soundwave skill.</p>
<p>With the second level up, Overwatch 2 will offer a choice between two major Perks. In the case of Torbjorn, you'll be able to pick 'Anchor Bolts' (increasing the throw range of Deploy Turret by 50% and allowing it to be attached to walls and ceilings) or 'Level 3 Turret' (which will transform your turret into level 3 for five seconds when using Overload). With Reaper, the 'Dire Triggers' Perk gives him a Secondary Fire that does decent mid-range damage and is great for getting that last shot on an escaping foe.</p>
<p>Blizzard said that the Perks concept originated in early 2024, though most of the project came together in the last six months. It went through several stages of trial and error; for instance, Perks was initially just a leveling system featuring predetermined upgrades. However, that version of the system lacked player choice, which is what the team focused on adding for the final version.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Perks_Torbjorn_Major-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Blizzard also shared some of their favorite Perks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Winston's Chain Lightning lets him charge up Secondary Fire to zap multiple enemies near his target.</li>
<li>Hanzo's Scatter Arrows will make for some great multi-kill clips.</li>
<li>With Baptiste's Shoulder Turret, when using Amplification Matrix, the turret comes out to add extra Automated Healing.</li>
<li>Ramattra's Vengeful Vortex enables players to explode Ravenous Vortex in the air and send down any flying enemies.</li>
</ul>
<p>In case you were wondering, these Overwatch 2 in-match Perks will be available in both Competitive and Quick Play modes.</p>

<p>Season 15 will mark the beginning of this year's competitive season for the game, bringing with it a Ranked reset, new competitive Galactic Weapons designed to give players the power of the stars, competitive rank Weapon Charms, and new Player Portraits.</p>
<p>Players will be able to join the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-will-run-two-6v6-tests-in-season-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6v6</a> Competitive queue as well as Overwatch Classic: GOATS. Moreover, Loot Boxes are coming back, being available via weekly and event rewards, as well as earning 1 Legendary Loot Box in the Free Battle Pass and an additional 2 Legendary Loot Boxes in the Premium Battle Pass.</p>
<p>The Overwatch 2 team has already shared the official Loot Boxes drop rates in an attempt at transparency:</p>
<table id="table_1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td title="Character Accurarcy=99.95"><strong>Loot Boxes</strong></td>
<td title="Character Accurarcy=99.93"><strong>Legendary Loot Boxes</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td title="Character Accurarcy=99.67">Legendary - 5.10%</td>
<td title="Character Accurarcy=99.6">Legendary - 100%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td title="Character Accurarcy=99.69">Epic - 21.93%</td>
<td title="Character Accurarcy=99.54">Epic - 21.93%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td title="Character Accurarcy=99.79">Rare - 96.26%</td>
<td title="Character Accurarcy=99.81">Rare - 96.26%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td title="Character Accurarcy=99.83">Common - 97.97%</td>
<td title="Character Accurarcy=99.81">Common - 97.97%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Moreover, Blizzard said that a Rare or better item is guaranteed to drop in every single box, with an Epic item within five consecutive boxes and a Legendary item within twenty consecutive boxes.</p>

<p>That's not all Bizzard discussed today. The developers also outlined major additions coming later this year with Season 16, starting with the brand new Stadium game mode. Stadium is meant to be a wholly different way to experience Overwatch 2, starting with the camera, which, for the first time in the franchise, will default to a third-person view (although switchable at any moment to the familiar first-person view). Blizzard says that the new perspective slightly slows down the pace of action while also allowing players to better see the more iconic abilities of their hero.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Stadium_Dva_1p-and-3p-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Stadium is played 5v5 in a best-of-7 format (with role queue) where players will earn in-game currency each round to purchase and customize abilities. These are powerful upgrades that can alter your character's survivability and damage output and even completely overhaul their skills. Stadium features a redesigned and intuitive user interface and icons, allowing players to seamlessly view, buy and sell mods (which include Items, Hero Items, and Powers), as well as see the builds of your rival team's builds to maximize your strategy from round to round.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Stadium_Armory_Customization_3-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Stadium also features its own Ranked Mode with multiple divisions, ranks, and unique rewards.<br>
There will be at least 14 core heroes when Stadium launches in Season 16. Over time, Blizzard plans to introduce more heroes, maps, and modes.</p>
<p>Season 16 will bring even more to Overwatch 2, including a brand new Hero called Freya. She's a former search and rescue operative turned bounty hunter, equipped with an explosive crossbow and unique abilities. Her abilities include&nbsp;Take Aim, which can be used to line up the perfect shot and fire a high-speed explosive bolt; Quick Dash, a dodge that also reloads Freya's explosive bolt; and Bola Shot, which grabs enemies. Freya can also use wind updrafts to propel herself into the sky. While she's slated to join the roster in Season 16, players will be able to check her out during a free trial weekend later in Season 15.</p>

<p>Blizzard even teased another character, currently codenamed Aqua. This one is a Chinese hero featuring water-based abilities. He's currently slated to launch in Season 18. Season 16 will also see the arrival of Hero Bans in Competitive Mode. Later in 2025, Blizzard will add a new Map Voting system.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/aqua_concept-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Overall, it seems that the developers have been hard at work revamping Overwatch 2 in various ways. Whether this will be enough to reignite interest in the game remains to be seen.</p>
