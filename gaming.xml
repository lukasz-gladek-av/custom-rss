            <title><![CDATA[AdHoc Working With Nintendo After Dispatch Censorship Controversy]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/adhoc-working-with-nintendo-after-dispatch-censorship-controversy/</link>
            <guid>1422310</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/adhoc-studio/" id="2968">AdHoc </a>says they’re working closely with Nintendo to find a pathway forward after a censored version of Dispatch was released on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Dispatch is a superhero interactive fiction video game in which your choices determine how the story unfolds. The game was released in the latter half of 2025 on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. The game was instantly met with critical acclaim and fanfare.</p>



<p>Dispatch eventually made its way to Nintendo Switch 2, but instead of allowing some adult language and content to be censored, the decision was made for you, and the game is permanently censored on the Nintendo Switch.</p>







<h2 id="h-nintendo-s-response-and-adhoc-s-current-stance">Nintendo’s Response and AdHoc’s Current Stance</h2>



<p>AdHoc initially responded to the backlash by explaining that different platforms have different submission criteria. They also stated that they worked with Nintendo to ensure the content met release criteria and assured players that the core narrative of the gameplay experience remained unchanged.</p>



<p>Nintendo then released a statement confirming that while they inform Partners when a submitted game does not meet their platform’s guidelines, they do not make changes to partners’ content.</p>







<p>AdHoc most recently stated in a <a href="https://discord.com/invite/adhocstudio">Discord </a>message that, like most players, they assumed they could access uncensored mature content on Nintendo Switch because games like The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 are also available on the platform. </p>



<p>However, they’re continuing to work with Nintendo on a path forward. Still, they advise players to expect and update their addresses; at least some of the censored content will take weeks due to development time and the console submission process.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“People have a right to be pissed. Lots of lessons learned here. Thanks for sticking with us. More soon.”</p>
</blockquote>

            <p>The director and creator of Ashes of Creation, the MMORPG brought to life via the $3.2 million donated by almost 20,000 backers in 2017, has quit "in protest" against decisions his board was making that he could "not ethically agree with or carry out".</p>
<p>Following a slew of unhappy messages from numerous people posted online across Discord and LinkedIn (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/ashes-of-creation/layoffs-director-resigns">PCGN</a>), it appears that director Steven Sharif's resignation triggered further resignations across "much of the senior leadership team" of Intrepid Studios, after which the Board "proceed[ed] with a mass layoff".</p>

<p>Things seemed to be coming to a head towards the end of January, when, on the 27th, a notice was posted on the official <a href="https://ashesofcreation.com/news/a-director-s-letter-to-the-citizens-of-verra-336">website</a> promising to address several issues and informing players that the studio was moving its Development Update to 13th February. It was signed by "The Ashes of Creation team", and did not address the game's future.</p><p>"I can make a limited statement in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the company, regarding the situation," Sharif wrote on Discord a couple of days later. "Control of the company shifted away from me, and the Board began directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out. As a result, I chose to resign in protest rather than lend my name or authority to decisions I could not ethically support. Following my resignation, much of the senior leadership resigned. Following those departures, the Board made the decision to issue WARN Act notices and proceed with a mass layoff.</p>
<p>"I cannot responsibly speak to further details at this time due to ongoing legal and governance matters. What I can say is that the developers and staff acted in good faith and deserved better than the uncertainty that they are now facing. I am incredibly dismayed at the situation."</p>
<p>Then, overnight (31st January), director of communications Margaret Krohn confirmed on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/margaretkrohn_well-this-chapter-has-come-to-a-close-activity-7423531204198436864-XsUB/">LinkedIn</a> that their time at Intrepid Studios "has come to a close", writing: "As for how this all ended… I don't really have the words. It wasn't what I expected. But I'm holding onto the good because there was so much of it".</p>
<p>Players are now understandably concerned that the game they only purchased a couple of weeks ago - it released into early access on 11th December - could be in jeopardy, and the Steam page, and its subsequent reviews, is now filling up with concerns and complaints from players trying to get an answer on the game's fate. We've reached out to Intrepid Studios and will update should we get a response.</p><p>Asked by someone on LinkedIn if Ashes of Creation had indeed been cancelled, Krohn replied: "I don't work there anymore, so I can't answer that for you. Personally, I don't know how they would make it when the heart and soul of the product, the amazing dev team, was all laid off."</p>

</ul>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <p>Battlestate Games has confirmed its first major crossover event is on the way, and it's with Escape from Duckov.</p>
<p>It's currently unknown how the fan-favourite spin-off crossover will unfold in Tarkov, but the team behind Duckov has shared that from 10th February, it'll host a Tarkov-inspired map, a mount system, and "festival content". You'll also get to face off against "classic characters" from Escape from Tarkov, too.</p>

<p>Tarkov devs, on the other hand, have only shared this image, which features a crying duckie and the text: "Wanna have a party?" Which we do, of course.</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>Without anything else to go on it's hard to be definitive about what to expect, but given Duckov's collab kicks off in February, it's plausible that Tarkov's event will, too. We'll keep you posted.</p>
<p>You'll remember that Escape from Duckov - which debuted on Steam shortly before Tarkov's long-anticipated Steam release late last year - took us by storm as well as surprise, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/escape-from-duckov-waddles-into-the-extraction-shooter-space-with-over-200000-concurrent-players">clocking up a staggering 301,322 concurrent players at release</a>, making it one of the biggest games on Steam ever. Since then, numbers have tapered off somewhat, but it apparently still very much made an impression on Battlestate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/escape-from-tarkov-players-slam-steam-launch-it-is-not-a-game-it-is-a-cosmic-punishment">Escape from Tarkov is still sitting on a Mixed rating after November's eagerly-awaited Steam debut</a> resulted in stability and performance issues that prevented players from even logging in, let alone play.</p>

            <p>Gaming companies saw share prices plummet this week after Google rolled out Project Genie 3, an AI tool that lets users generate virtual worlds in 60-second bursts from text prompts.</p>
<p>Companies like Take-Two, CD Projekt, Unity, and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> saw between 8-20 percent wiped off the value of their companies as spooked investors seemingly went into the weekend thinking tech like this could replace the game development process.

This is the result of a market that does not understand how video games are made.</p><p>"To be clear, this is not a referendum on the quality of AI content," he added. "Markets are spooked because they believe tools like Project Genie will allow anyone to generate a video game. This is not actually possible." He then suggested traders take a look at his latest book, Blood, Sweat, and Pixels.</p>

</span></p><p>Shinobi602 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shinobi602.bsky.social/post/3mdnsxei4lk2w">added</a> a similar sentiment: "Video game stocks are suddenly crashing today with the launch of Google's Project Genie as investors think games will start magically getting made with AI."</p>
<p><a href="https://deepmind.google/models/genie/">Genie 3</a> is described as a general-purpose world model that can take text descriptions and generate "photorealistic environments that can be explored in real-time". The environments are interactive and controllable, and offer "world consistency and stability". This includes both real-life and fantastical scenarios rendered in realistic 3D or animated styles.</p>
<p>And it does look incredible. The examples given - which include the prompts used to generate them - are undoubtedly impressive, most of which respond to external third-party controls or inputs.</p>
<p>But the tech comes with several limitations, not least that its interactive elements are significantly restricted, and creations are only a minute long. It would be extraordinarily unwise to suggest that Genie <em>couldn't</em> challenge game engines like Unity and Unreal one day, but given the incredibly limited examples provided, it's unlikely to do so anytime soon.</p><p>AI, of course, continues to generate heated debate across the industry. In 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">a report by Unity claimed 62 percent of studios using its tools used AI</a> at some point during game development, most notably in animation. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-third-of-developers-impacted-by-layoffs-in-last-12-months-according-to-gdc-survey">GDC survey from that same year</a>, meanwhile, said that around a third of industry workers reported using AI tools already. That number is now likely to be higher, and a more recent Tokyo Games Show survey reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI</a> in development.</p>

            <guid>1422199</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="58446a9d9d94d"><a title="Super Nintendo - Keza MacDonald" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/58446a9d9d94d/super-nintendo-keza-macdonald.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>In the introduction to <strong>Super Nintendo: How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Fun</strong>, Keza MacDonald makes a simple promise: over the course of the next 12 chapters, you'll read something you didn't already know.</p>
<p>It's the kind of gauntlet-laying that would have any self-respecting Nintendo fan click their knuckles and close their <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page">Bulbapedia</a> tab in a 'challenge accepted' kind of way. And yet, 250 pages later, I can honestly say that it rang true.</p>
<p>'Super Nintendo', to bring it down from its proper title, is the story of the company that we all know and love; it's also the story of us, humans, and how we play. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/keza-macdonald">The Guardian</a>'s Video Games Editor and former Editor-in-Chief at <a href="https://kotaku.com/">Kotaku UK</a> compiles interviews with just about every Nintendo creative you can think of (and the ones you can't) to explain how some of the industry's most iconic series came to be, while also reflecting on why these series are important in wider culture.</p>
<p>It's comprehensive but never too dense, informative but approachable, and packed with an unwavering passion for Nintendo that I'd wager even the company's biggest detractors would find infectious. In short, if you want to learn about Nintendo, this is the book to do it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="0cb0be378867c"><a title="Super Nintendo - Keza MacDonald" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0cb0be378867c/super-nintendo-keza-macdonald.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Strictly speaking, this isn't a chronological walkthrough from A to B. It starts with the toy manufacturing of the 1960s and '70s and ends with the development of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/splatoon">Splatoon</a>, but each game-focused chapter in between serves as a jumping-off point to explain something larger about the company as a whole.</p>
<p>A chapter on <strong>Donkey Kong</strong> delves into the early design processes of a little-known artist called Shigeru Miyamoto. A <strong>Metroid</strong> section also serves to dissect gender representation in both Nintendo games and the wider industry. <strong>Animal Crossing</strong> acts as a prime case study demonstrating Nintendo's habit of sticking with an idea until its audience finds it.</p>
<p>Be it the story of smash-hit successes like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/wii_sports">Wii Sports</a>, or the company's more off-the-wall moments like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_labo_toy-con_01_variety_kit">LABO</a> (no, LABO wasn't just a fever dream), the book presents the House of Mario not as a company that's out of touch with competitors, but one that's always looking to what's next — even if 'next' is a cardboard piano.</p>
<p>The Nintendo fanboy in me always likes viewing the company in relation to the larger industry, and MacDonald does a nice job of balancing the micro details of game development with the bigger picture. There are plenty of places that you can look for deep dives into specific titles and their development, but Super Nintendo really shines in showcasing the personal touches.</p>
<figure data-uuid="801977e687d0a"><a title="Super Nintendo - Keza MacDonald" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/801977e687d0a/super-nintendo-keza-macdonald.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Take the chapter on <strong>Kirby</strong>, which is used as a way into discussing the much-missed Satoru Iwata. It's a poignant and heartfelt tribute shining the light as much on Iwata the man as Iwata the designer — the corporate president, computer programmer, <em>and</em> gamer, to paraphrase his iconic introductory quote. By compiling words from Miyamoto, Itoi and others close to him (mainly from Hobonichi's wonderful book, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/07/book_review_ask_iwata_words_of_wisdom_from_satoru_iwata_nintendos_legendary_ceo">Ask Iwata</a>), MacDonald balances Iwata's commercial and personal impacts. It's fitting that the chapter ends on Miyamoto's memories of their late-night meals and shared sweets rather than impressive sales figures for Wii and DS.</p>
<p>The book is built on one of the most comprehensive collections of interviews that I've seen in a long time, many from MacDonald herself. The veteran journalist throws out tidbits from her chats with Miyamoto, Aonuma, Tezuka, and others, pulling from other works when she didn't have a chance to sit down with the creative in question. Super Nintendo threads each perspective together into a cohesive whole, and it feels like you're getting a peek behind the wizard's curtain, catching a glimpse of all the old developers turning wheels and flipping switches while the end result looks like magic from the outside.</p>
<p>There are lots of little inner-working nuggets peppered throughout the book, and I don't want to spoil them here, but it's exciting to hear some of the company's longest-serving designers talk anecdotally about their perceptions of select products long before they launched. Shinya Takahashi has a list of production credits as long as your arm, so reading about his pre-launch worries about the Switch, about how he wasn't fully on board with the appeal of the design until the first time he moved a prototype from docked to handheld, is fascinating.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e274940fbeaf4"><a title="Super Nintendo - Keza MacDonald" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e274940fbeaf4/super-nintendo-keza-macdonald.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Well-worn tales of Miyamoto's Zelda inspiration stemming from his time exploring forests as a child are mixed with lesser-known details, like Koizumi confessing he designed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a>'s splashy focus on the back of his memories of summer holidays spent by the water. You'll find a lot of these anecdotes elsewhere, but I highly doubt that you've read them all.</p>
<p>By threading them into the story of the company, Super Nintendo proves to be a very satisfying summary of a company that is ever-changing and ever-growing. If this book puts one thing above all others across, it's that Nintendo's sense of fun, and our sense of play, will forever be its most appealing feature.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Hello everyone. We have a different kind of post for you today from our usual coverage of the gaming industry. You may or may not know that TheSixthAxis has been around for 18 years now, with too many people to name who have contributed to our continued existence. Though we do have a special thanks and mention to TheSixthAxis’ co-founders Alex and Michael, and long-time editor Peter, who defined our site back in the PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii era.</p>
<p>Throughout our 18 years, TheSixthAxis has maintained its independence, allowing us to cover the games and news we want, the way we want. We have full editorial control and our team of great writers, past and present, have always been allowed to write the articles they want to, with a little guidance here and there. TheSixthAxis has also been about community. While our forums no longer exist as more than a time capsule, they were a hub for people from all over the world to get to know each other and build friendships that grew. We continue to try and foster a community through our social media channels, and we are always interested in hearing from our readers.</p>
<p>With all of that in mind, and with the current landscape of the games media, we are now exploring how to become a partly reader-funded outlet so we can continue to invest in the site, and support our writers, allowing them to continue to pen the news, features, and reviews that you visit us for. To that end, we have launched a new page on Ko-fi where you can tip us.</p>




<p>It is completely up to you how much you want to tip us, whether you want to tip on a monthly basis, or if you want to tip us at all. There is no obligation or requirement. As much as we would love to be fully reader funded, we expect advertising to remain a necessary source of income, though we will always try to remain respectful with their implementation.</p>

<p>Traditional gaming websites like ours are fewer in number which means fewer opportunities for new writers to break into the industry, less coverage of smaller games as sites fight for views, and less content for you to enjoy overall. Your support will mean we can invest in our current writers, and new writers who want to get into games journalism. As much as we’d love to, none of us will be around to write for TheSixthAxis forever, so we want to be able to hand over the site to the next generation of writers when that time comes far in the future. We can invest in improving our website so your experience is smoother. It also means we can allocate resources to cover more games, from AAA to solo developers who right now may be making the next big thing, but too few of us know about it. There is a lot we want to do as a team, and we want to remain independent and to keep the lights on while pursuing balanced and thoughtful coverage of the games industry.</p>

Ah yes, another dose of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/eshop-selects">eShop Selects</a>!</p>
<p>The Switch 2 has kicked off the year in relatively calm fashion, but before the mad Spring rush hits us, let's look at some eShop gems that are worth checking out. Yes, there are games other than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizon</a> out there, we promise.</p>
<p>Here's how this works: same as ever, our writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop games from January 2026 from titles we've reviewed, and the three games with the highest scores will make the podium.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jqrkvn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>It's been a surprisingly busy January in terms of news and releases — Animal Crossing, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII</a>, two whole Directs on the <strong>Super</strong> <strong>Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> — but the eShop exclusives have been a little on the quieter side on the review front.</p>
<p>We do have a review-in-progress for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_hate_this_place">I Hate This Place</a>, but there have been plenty of other games we just haven't managed to get around to: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/they-are-billions">They are Billions</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/suika-game-planet">Suika Game Planet</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/citadelum">Citadelum</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/escape_from_ever_after">Escape from Ever After</a>... these are just a few, too!</p>
<p>Still, we have four games that made the cut this time around, all scoring 7/10 and above. That leaves one honourable mention, and then the top three:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cassette_boy">Cassette Boy</a> (NS1) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/cassette-boy">7/10</a></li>
</ul>
<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">3rd Place - GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>The Switch 2's more-powerful hardware has really opened the door for all types of sports and racing games to make the jump onto Nintendo's console, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition</a> has pulled up at the starting line to help get the driving going.</p>
<p>January has been a pretty impressive month for technical ports, and GRID Legends is among the very best. 60fps is the way to go here, but there are multiple different graphics settings you can play around with in both handheld and docked. That's still a rarity on Switch 2 right now, and we hope GRID sets the standard for other developers.</p>
<p>Put all of that together, along with top-notch racing mechanics, and you've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">an excellent 8/10 racer</a> on your hands. Just maybe pull out the GameCube controller for this one.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:196273 @ 1769980133 -->
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">2nd Place - MIO: Memories in Orbit (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Speaking of great-looking games on Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">MIO: Memories in Orbit</a> is already one of the most-stunning on the console, with a beautiful spaceship-like vessel adorned in pastels and scribbles and an eerie, ethereal atmosphere that helps carry you along the adventure.</p>
<p>The platforming in this Metroidvania can be tough-as-nails, but when you master the movement in this game, it's sublime. The combat doesn't always work for us, but everything else elevates MIO from being 'just another action platformer' into a beautiful one that will stick with us.</p>
<p>MIO is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">our second 8/10</a> in this top three, <em>just</em> beating out GRID in the votes game by one. Turns out a robot in space is faster than a car.</p>

<p>If you've been paying attention to gaming news and releases, then you probably saw this one coming — AdHoc's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Dispatch</a> was the runaway winner this month, and with good reason: it's fantastic, and a true return-to-form for the Telltale-style of gameplay.</p>
<p>Which makes sense, as former Telltale devs worked on this superhero comedy caper, that goes everywhere from rude jokes to explicit moments, but even has plenty of touching scenes and a little bit of romance. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-responds-to-dispatch-switch-censorship-with-official-statement">censorship drama</a> might be sucking the air out of things at the moment, but take it from us — regardless of where you play Dispatch, you'll have a great time.</p>
<p>As both the victor and the highest-scoring game of the bunch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">with a 9/10</a>, Dispatch takes the top spot on the podium. Congrats, Robert Robertson and everyone at the Superhero Dispatch Network!</p>

<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-january-2026]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[First Trailer Released for ‘COR3’, An Upcoming Sci-Fi Shooter From Tarkov’s Developer]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cor3-first-trailer-revealed-shooter-tarkov/</link>
            <guid>1422163</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>COR3CORP has released a first-look trailer for COR3, a mysterious sci-fi FPS that has <strong>some kind of tie </strong>to Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov. For more than a decade, Nikita Buyanov has been the head of the studio at Battlestate, spearheading the creation of Escape from Tarkov, arguably the most impactful extraction shooter ever made.</p>



<p>Despite being little more than a minute long, the first trailer for COR3 tells us plenty. It’s a first-person, sci-fi apocalypse title set on Mars. Or at least, that’s what we can glean from the minuscule look at the trailer, which you can see below.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-cor3-and-why-is-it-exciting">What is COR3 and Why is it Exciting?</h2>



<p>COR3 is the first project <strong>not associated with Escape from Tarkov </strong>that Nikita Buyanov has touted for many years. In the run-up to the trailer being dropped, weeks of teasers, cryptic posts, and puzzling websites surfaced across social media.</p>



<p>Interested users were presented <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-dev-new-game-revealed-february-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with an interactive website</a> that offered lore and a bit of backstory behind COR3, which is what we <strong>assume to be </strong>the game’s title. That’s still unclear.</p>



<p>The website presented a post-apocalyptic environment, putting players in the shoes of an investigator with a few pieces of rudimentary equipment at their disposal, probing systems to solve minor, gamified puzzles. It’s steeped in mystery, and even though the first trailer has been released, <strong>nobody knows what on Earth (or Mars) they’re looking at</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer for your perusal:</p>

<p>We’re calling it COR3 because that’s the only title we’ve been given thus far. But the name of the video is PRJRPNT_BLUEMARS_FO, which could be a nod to a potential title. Project Repent: Blue Mars?</p>



<p>It’s impossible to say at this point, as we have almost nothing to go on. It’s now time for internet sleuths to start probing the trailer for some sign of what comes next, as the site that was hosting the countdown to the trailer dropping now shows… Well, <strong>the trailer</strong>.</p>



<p>As the short video opens, we see a first-person perspective, quite reminiscent of Escape from Tarkov in how the character moves and interacts with their weapon, manufactured by ‘Kalash Corp’, and then the camera peels back from ‘Mariner City’ in a ruined state and scales back across Mars.</p>



<p>We go into the clouds, and then eventually into the cosmos, past a space elevator and beyond ruined ships, into the midst of cosmonauts adrift in the great beyond. It’s not ‘astronauts’ here, as the outfits the ill-fated space adventurers are wearing are unmistakably Russian in origin, emblazoned with a red star.</p>

<p>Previously, that aforementioned showrunner, Craig Mazin, had claimed that the team <em>was</em> working to a four-season plan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-confirms-four-season-plan-says-no-way-to-wrap-things-up-in-three">insisting there was "no way" the narrative could be wrapped up in three seasons</a>.</p>
<p>That wasn't even the first time the magic number four has been floated in regard to The Last of Us' TV adaptation, either. Mazin started the chatter all the way back in 2023, suggesting the show could "end up being three or five [seasons]. But four seems like a good number. Some seasons, because of the story we're telling, will need fewer episodes and some will need more."</p><p>Mazin discussed a four-season arc last May, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s Neil Druckmann stepped away from the TV adapation's third season last September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-will-retain-high-level-role-on-the-last-of-us-season-three-to-ensure-its-as-deeply-faithful-as-season-one">stating he'd accomplished his "crazy goal" of elevating video games</a>. Mazin has yet to publicly respond to Bloys' comment.</p>
<p>ICYMI, the upcoming third season of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-three-to-recast-manny">HBO's The Last of Us TV adaptation will feature a new actor playing WLF member Manny</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-timeline-explained</link>
            <guid>1422142</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The ninth entry in the mainline Resident Evil series is fast approaching, but if you’re thinking that it could be the ideal point to jump in for the first time, you’ll almost certainly be left wondering what the hell is going on as you play through its opening hours. Resident Evil Requiem builds atop a three-decade legacy of survival horror, so you’re going to have to do some homework before you get started.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help you out, we’ve put together a (very condensed) synopsis of the main Resident Evil story and everything you need to know leading into Resident Evil Requiem, presented in chronological order. As I’m sure you’ve already worked out,<strong> the following contains spoilers</strong> – lots and lots of spoilers – for the entire Resident Evil series prior to Requiem. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil Zero<br>July 23, 1998</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-0-1769098847328.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s July 23, 1998. The Bravo Team of Raccoon City Police’s elite S.T.A.R.S division is dispatched to investigate a number of murders in the Arklay region. The team believe evidence can be found in the area’s mountains, but their helicopter crashes before they can reach their landing zone. Survivor Rebecca Chambers makes her way towards a nearby spooky-looking mansion in an attempt to find the rest of Bravo Team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before she makes it to the house, Rebecca, along with her newly acquired convict companion Billy Coen, come across an abandoned training facility where they discover that its former director, Dr James Marcus, along with former partner, Oswell E. Spencer, were responsible for a new biological weapon dubbed the T-Virus: a deadly infection that turns humans into zombies and other monstrosities. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil<br>July 24, 1998</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-1769098864537.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The S.T.A.R.S. Alpha team is dispatched to find out what happened to the missing Bravo team. Their search leads Jill Valentine, Chris Redfield, Barry Burton, and team leader Albert Wesker to the aforementioned grand estate, the Spencer Mansion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gang splits up and discovers the horrible fates of the missing S.T.A.R.S. members, who have been decimated by the monstrous results of the T-virus. As he explores the mansion’s many rooms and hidden chambers, Chris finds Bravo team member Rebecca Chambers still alive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jill and Chris eventually discover that the Umbrella Corporation, a pharmaceutical company with shady business practices, is behind the illegal experiments that led to undead horrors (and the odd oversized animal) roaming the mansion’s halls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, once they reach a sinister laboratory hidden beneath the house, the duo discover that Wesker is not actually a loyal S.T.A.R.S. operative, but a traitor who works for Umbrella. Wesker infects himself with a strain of the T-virus as part of an elaborate plan that also involves releasing a new biological super weapon, the “Tyrant”, from containment. Unfortunately for him, the creature swiftly kills him. After managing to defeat the Tyrant, the remaining S.T.A.R.S. team members escape the lab (relatively) unscathed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our heroic survivors return to Raccoon City, only to learn that the corruption runs deep. They decide to go rogue, leaving the RPD to investigate the grand corporate conspiracy. Chris heads off to Europe solo, while Jill stays in the city to learn more about Umbrella.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil 3<br>September 28, 1998</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-3-1769098887240.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s September 1998, just a few months after the Spencer Mansion incident, and Raccoon City is overrun with zombies. Umbrella sees the outbreak as an opportunity to test its latest bioweapon, the experimental Nemesis; a hulking beast armed with a rocket launcher, tasked only with the destruction of all remaining S.T.A.R.S. members.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Jill desperately tries to escape the outbreak with the relentless Nemesis hot on her heels, rookie R.P.D. officer Leon S. Kennedy and Chris Redfield’s younger sister, Claire, both arrive in Raccoon City at the worst possible time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil 2<br>September 29, 1998</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-2-1769098902156.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After being separated following a car accident, Leon and Claire agree to meet up at the nearby police station. Unfortunately for both of them, the building is already infested by the undead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As she navigates the station’s dangerous hallways in search of information about her brother’s whereabouts, Claire runs into Sherry Birkin, a young girl pursued by a monstrous weirdo who not only turns out to be her Dad, but also Umbrella's leading scientist, William Birkin. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Turns out Billy B had planned to betray his corporate masters and sell his newly developed G-virus, but he was gunned down by Umbrella before he had the chance. As he bled out, William managed to infect himself with the G-Virus. His monstrous form massacred Umbrella’s troops and proceeded to dump both the G- and T-virus formulas into Raccoon City’s water supply, creating the enormous mess all our characters now have to deal with. Nice one, Willy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Leon runs into Ada Wong, an FBI agent seeking the G-Virus for her own investigation into Umbrella’s corruption. The two decide to form an alliance, for now…</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leon and Ada run into Birkin’s wife, Annette, who is not a big fan of the pair. They follow Annette deep underground to a secret Umbrella facility called NEST in hope of securing the G-virus sample.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pretty much simultaneously, Claire also arrives at NEST, in search of a vaccine for the now-infected Sherry. Leon manages to obtain the G-Virus sample but runs into the hideously deformed William, who mortally wounds his wife. As she struggles to hold on, Annette reveals to Leon that Ada is not what she seems: she’s actually a mercenary looking to sell the G-Virus to the highest bidder. Ada arrives on the scene and demands the G-Virus, but before Leon can hand it over, Annette manages to shoot her, sending both Ada and the virus sample falling into the lab’s seemingly bottomless chasm. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Claire finds a vaccine for Sherry. As Annette administers it to her daughter, Claire tangles with an out-of-control William. Sherry is cured, but Annette eventually dies of her injuries. The facility is set to self-destruct, and Claire, Sherry, and Leon board a train to escape.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With NEST destroyed, the crew finally manage to escape the nightmare and, on the outskirts of Racoon City, vow to continue their fight against Umbrella.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil Outbreak<br>September 23 - October 1, 1998</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While Jill, Leon, and Claire are dealing with their own issues amidst a zombie outbreak, eight other Raccoon City residents are also in a desperate fight for survival. Among them is a local journalist, Alyssa Ashcroft, who is trying to shine a spotlight on Umbrella’s evil ways. Remember her name, as it’ll come in handy when you start playing Resident Evil Requiem. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alyssa manages to escape Raccoon City before the government annihilates the entire area with an evidence-destroying thermobaric missile strike, carrying information that could expose Umbrella once and for all.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil 3 (continued)<br>October 1, 1998</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-3-cont-1769098919835.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in Racoon City, in the hours before the missile strike, Jill Valentine is infected with the T-Virus. Fortunately for her, Carlos Oliveria – an uncharacteristically friendly Umbrella mercenary – arrives on the scene to not only cure Jill, but also help her find the important vaccine that could save the city. Unfortunately, the government has a different “cure”; our heroes discover the plans to wipe out Raccoon City, which is publicly explained away as the only sure method to eradicate the zombie outbreak.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Carlos and Jill head to <em>another </em>underground lab, this time creatively called “NEST 2”. Unfortunately, the Nemesis is still alive and very much still in pursuit. Jill and Carlos manage to take out the abomination once and for all, and with the vaccine sample in hand, manage to escape the city before the missile hits. Unfortunately, Nicholai, Carlos’s former colleague/secret operative, is waiting for them and manages to destroy the vaccine vial. Jill and Carlos take down Nicholai, leaving him for dead, and escape just before government-approved thermobaric hellfire arrives to completely demolish Raccoon City for good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And as is tradition, our hero vows to take down Umbrella before the credits roll…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil: Code Veronica<br>December 27-28, 1998</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-code-veronica-1769100639172.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Three months after escaping from Racoon City, Claire Redfield, still in search of her brother, attempts to raid a European Umbrella facility. Things go south and she’s captured, taken to an island prison ruled over by Alfred Ashford, the governor of Rockfort Island.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As is mandatory for a Resident Evil game, an outbreak occurs, and amidst the chaos Claire is freed, allowing her to get to work looking for Chris and escaping the island. Unfortunately, Mr. Redfield is nowhere to be found, so after much trouble, Claire tries to escape in a plane. Ashford, who is revealed to have a split personality disorder and often believes himself to be his twin sister, Alexia, remotely takes control of the plane and crashes it into <em>another </em>Umbrella facility, this time in Antarctica. Knocked unconscious, Claire has a dream that turns out to be the plot of Resident Evil Survivor 2. Weird. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ashford, believing Claire to be a spy, pursues her in a quest for revenge. But after he’s fatally wounded, he frees the real version of his sister, Alexia, who has been cryogenically frozen this entire time, her body riddled with a new virus called T-Veronica.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, back on Rockford Island, none other than Chris Redfield shows up, looking for Claire. But rather than finding his sister, he runs into his old pal/mortal enemy, Albert Wesker, who’s alive, super strong, and on a mission to find the T-Veronica sample. Turns out he had actually planned to be killed by the Tyrant back in the Spencer Mansion, as that would ensure he could reach the full potential of some experimental virus he was infected with… or something. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pair make their way to Antarctica, where Chris hopes to be finally reunited with Claire, and Wesker hopes to secure the T-Veronica sample. A restored, very powerful Alexia becomes the final boss of Chris’ latest adventure, and everyone escapes the facility before – you guessed it – it self-destructs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wesker claims a virus-infected corpse to experiment on. Chris and Claire vow to take down Umbrella… are you seeing a pattern here?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil 4<br>Autumn, 2004</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-4-1769098936664.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Six years have passed, and the Umbrella Corporation is now long gone due to a government suspension and stock value crash. Is this the lamest way possible for a big bad to go out? It’s certainly up there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leon S. Kennedy, former rookie RPD officer, is now a government agent with full permission to roundhouse kick anyone who stands in his way. He’s sent on a mission to rural Spain, where the president's daughter, Ashley, is being held by kidnappers. As he explores the area, he discovers that not only are the kidnappers part of a cult called Los Illuminados, but they’re also all infected by a brand new mind-controlling parasite: Las Plagas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Leon hunts for Ashley, he unexpectedly bumps into someone he thought long dead, Ada Wong, who is very much alive and is once again on the hunt for virus samples.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After rescuing Ashley, Leon confronts the cult’s leader, Saddler, and, with the help of Ada, defeats him, bringing down the parasite and all the hordes it infected. Once again showing her true colours, Ada takes a sample of Las Plagas and escapes by helicopter, but not before – you guessed it – setting the base to self-destruct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leon and Ashley manage to dramatically escape on a jet ski, which they appear to ride all the way from Spain back to the US. I mean, they probably just went back to the mainland and took more traditional routes, but imagining they jet-ski’d across the Atlantic is funnier, so let’s just say they did that.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil: Revelations<br>2005</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-revelations-1769098954618.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Shortly after the events of Resident Evil 4, our original protagonists, Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine, become involved in a new investigation into biological organic weapons. They discover a new strain of the T-Virus called T-Abyss, developed by evil organisation Il Veltro, which plans to use its new weapon to infect a fifth of the world’s oceans. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot of evil plots and betrayals unfold, involving names and organisations that mostly don’t feature in the wider series except for one: the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance, or BSAA. Chris and Jill are founding members, and this new organisation’s motives become the driving force for these characters going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, Chris and Jill survive the events of Revelations, taking us directly into the next chapter of Resident Evil. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil 5 - Lost in Nightmares DLC<br>August, 2006</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Two years after Resident Evil 4, our original big bad, Wesker, is still on the loose. Chris and Jill, now operating under the banner of the BSAA, follow a thread that should lead them to Umbrella’s founder, Oswald E. Spencer. Instead, they run into Albert Wesker, who has killed Spencer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wesker, seemingly even more powerful than before and now dodging bullets for fun, is more than a match for Chris and Jill. To save a wounded Chris, Jill sacrifices herself, sending both her and Wesker to their deaths. Chris, understandably, is a bit sad.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil 5<br>March 4-6, 2009</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-5-1769098971612.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Almost three years after Jill’s death, Chris is tasked with apprehending terrorist Ricardo Irving, who is selling bio-organic weapons in Africa. Along with his new partner, Sheva, Chris discovers that the locals are infected by a modified Las Plagas parasite. The duo set out to solve the crisis, but Chris has another thing on his mind: the BSAA believes Jill could still be alive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After defeating a mutated Irving, Chris and Sheva learn that Tricell, the company that funds the BSAA, has taken over Umbrella’s seedy work in conjunction with – shock, horror – <em>Albert Wesker, </em>who is very much still alive and has been conducting human experiments. Unfortunately, one of his victims is Jill, who is <em>also</em> still alive and now under Wesker’s control.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chris and Sheva manage to subdue Jill and remove Wesker’s mind-control device before it’s too late. Wesker tries to flee on a plane, which crash-lands in a volcano. After some boulder punching, Chris and Sheva finally kill Wesker once and for all, and all is well in the world… for now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil: Revelations 2<br>January, 2011</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-revelations-2-1769098994900.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Claire Redfield is now a member of TerraSave, an anti-bioterrorism taskforce, and once again finds herself trapped in an island prison, this time with her new partner, Moria Burton, daughter of Barry Burton. Remember him from the Spencer Mansion incident? He’s the “Jill Sandwich” guy…</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jill and Moira are directed around the prison’s labyrinth-like halls by someone known only as the Overseer, all while being stalked by mysterious monsters. After the entire playbook of typical Resident Evil hijinks involving other survivors, shady corporations, and betrayal unfold, it’s revealed that the Overseer is a woman named Alex Wesker. Although she shares the surname, she’s not actually a relative of the series’ infamous villain, but rather a child who was kidnapped for her “talents” and inducted into “The Wesker Project”, a sinister plot developed by Umbrella founder Oswell E. Spencer to try and develop a race of superior beings. Alex has been doing her own experiments on the prison island, creating a fresh batch of monstrosities. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, Claire and Moria corner Alex, and with nowhere left to run, Alex commits suicide. But not before, <em>of course</em>, setting the base to self-destruct. Claire manages to escape, but unfortunately, Moira is trapped under the rubble. Enter big daddy Barry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Six months pass before Barry reaches the island, who has been desperately chasing Moria’s SOS signal. But before finding his daughter, he comes face-to-face with Alex, who’s now heavily mutated into her disgusting final form, complete with orange glowing weak points. Fortunately, both a still-alive Moria and a returning Claire armed with a rocket launcher arrive to swing the odds in Barry’s favour.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the epilogue, Claire receives a message about Chris and his jaunt to China, where he’s off to handle another bioterror threat…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil 6<br>December 2012 - June 2013</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-6-1769099013516.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up is Resident Evil 6, which features <em>three </em>interwoven campaigns, and it all gets really, really messy. So strap yourself in….</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2012, a new virus is developed by a company dubbed Neo-Umbrella, led by someone who appears to be Ada Wong. Mercenary Jake Muller is immune to the virus, on account of being the child of Albert Wesker (who has… let’s say “unique” DNA after all those experiments), and so is believed to be the key to creating a vaccine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2013, the American president decides enough is enough with all these bioterrorism incidents, and that it’s time to reveal what really happened in Raccoon City. However, before he can spill the beans, there’s another viral attack. The president, now a zombie, must be taken down by his loyal agent, Leon Kennedy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ada Wong arrives on the scene to tell Leon that National Security Advisor Derek Simmons is affiliated with Neo-Umbrella, and is behind the terror attack that zombified the president. Leon heads to China in pursuit of Simmons. Chris Redfield, now wracked by post-traumatic stress and a thirst for revenge after his team was slaughtered by Ada, also heads to China. As does Jake, because, you know, plot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s no secret that Resident Evil 6 is the most convoluted game in the series, so let’s just get through this quickly:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Chris finds out Jake’s true identity, and despite an awkward moment where Chris tells Jake he killed his dad, they mostly work it out. </li><li>Simmons dies. </li><li>Chris’s buddy, Piers, is wounded, then grows a new arm thanks to the C-Virus, and saves Chris. </li><li>Jake kills his boss, who’s not worth talking about.</li><li>We discover that there are two Adas, with one being an imposter called Carla.</li><li>Finally, all the good guys win and go their separate ways. </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Basically, a lot is going on, and it’s not very good. Maybe just ignore this bit – I highly doubt anything that happens here will have any implications for the future of Resident Evil. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil 7 Biohazard<br>July 19-20, 2017</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-7-1769099036705.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2017, Ethan Winters is looking for his missing wife, Mia. His search eventually leads him deep into Louisiana, where he finds her imprisoned by the Bakers, a very odd and very disgusting family.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ethan is captured by the family’s patriarch, Jack Baker, and forced to join a vomit-inducing dinner with Jack’s wife, Marguerite, son Lucas, and a mysterious elderly woman. It turns out the entire family is infected by something called “mold”, a sort of parasitic, fungal virus that has the added benefit of increasing your resilience, but the downside of making you just a bit gross.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Side note: you can find a newspaper clipping written by Alyssa Ashcroft in the Baker’s house. Remember her from Resident Evil Outbreak? Turns out she’s still a journalist, now investigating the disappearances in Louisiana.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After escaping and managing to kill hideous forms of both Jack and Marguerite, Ethan reunites with his wife and develops a serum to help shake off her apparent mold infection. The couple attempt to flee on a boat, but the vessel is capsized by a mysterious creature that turns out to be a “girl” named Eveline. This child is actually a bio-weapon that Mia, who’s actually a secret agent, was tasked with escorting. Eveline is responsible for the Baker family’s mind-altering infection because she was desperate to create her own family. You know, like all bioweapons are. Classic stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ethan injects Eveline with a toxin, which causes her to revert to her true form: the mysterious old woman from the Baker’s disgusting dinner. It turns out she’s been rapidly aging. Of course, a senior is hardly an ideal final boss, so Eveline mutates into a giant blob like all classic Resident Evil big bads do, and after a climatic confrontation with Ethan (who gets a little help from a recently arrived military squad), she’s finally destroyed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a final twist, the leader of the military squad is revealed to be none other than Chris Redfield, who emerges from a helicopter branded with the <em>Umbrella </em>logo. Man, things have really changed around here.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil 7 - Not a Hero DLC<br>July 20, 2017</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-7-not-a-hero-1769099051621.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Chris and his team pursue Lucas Baker, who had avoided Eveline’s mind control thanks to a serum provided to him by a new shadowy organisation called The Connections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They were the ones behind Eveline’s creation, and Lucas had been gathering data on her for them. Naturally, he planned to betray his masters, because Lucas is a Resident Evil villain, and that’s apparently part of the contract.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After working his way through a series of traps, Chris manages to kill a mutated Lucas. He then returns to base to take an urgent phone call…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil Village<br>February 8-10, 2021</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-village-1769099066512.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Over three years later, Ethan and Mia have settled in Eastern Europe, but their new-found family bliss is violently interrupted by Chris Redfield, who shockingly and mercilessly guns down Mia and kidnaps Ethan and his child, Rose.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ethan wakes to find himself in a rural village that has been besieged by a horde of marauding lycans. On a desperate quest to find Rose, Ethan works his way through the abandoned village and into a nearby castle inhabited by vampires, most notably an enormous goth mommy called Lady Dimiterscu. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lady D, along with a wider group of oddities including a fish man and a cowboy Magneto, all belong to cult that worships Mother Miranda; a god-like, mold-infected matriarch who, in a quest to resurrect her dead daughter, Eva, became consumed by the infection and spread it to her four elevated lords and houses. Ethan discovers a crest for these four lords that looks eerily similar to Umbrella’s logo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ethan’s journey to rescue Rose and take down Miranda’s lords eventually leads him back to Chris Redfield, who explains that the Mia he gunned down wasn’t actually Mia at all, but rather a shape-shifting Mother Miranda. Miranda believes Ethan and Mia’s daughter, Rose, is the successor of bioweapon, Eveline, based on the fact that both her parents were infected by the mold. After Miranda finally confronts Ethan in her true form, she explains that the mold will help rebirth Rose as her own daughter. Without hesitation, Miranda rips out Ethan’s heart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chris and his squad launch a full assault against Mother Miranda, battling through her waves of monsters and destroying a large mold barrier that protects her. Once inside, Chris and the team discover a large mold root called the Megamycete; the source of the mold that plagued both the village and the Baker family. Turns out the Megamycete not only infects its victims, but it also absorbs their DNA and memories. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chris plants a bomb, but before destroying the mold once and for all, he passes through Miranda’s lab for one last lore dump. He discovers the entirety of her plan to find a suitable vessel for her daughter’s consciousness to be reborn into. Miranda was also responsible for the creation of Eveline, working with The Connections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not the most shocking revelation, though: Chris discovers that Oswell E. Spencer, founder of Umbrella, was actually a student of Miranda's and began his work on the progenitor virus based on her teachings. To honour this, he designed Umbrella’s logo after Miranda’s four lords’ symbol. So not only is Miranda responsible for everything in Resident Evil 7 and Village, but she’s the inspiration that started this <em>entire </em>30-year, virus-riddled affair!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After Chris exits the exposition-packed hallway, he encounters the true version of Mia, who’s very much alive and reveals that Ethan isn’t quite dead, either. It turns out that Miranda didn’t kill Ethan after all – Jack Baker did, way back at the start of Resident Evil 7. Ethan was infected by the Mold, which had kept him moving and “alive” this entire time, and explained how he could regularly reattach body parts with just a bit of healing juice. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite his mold infection, Ethan is falling apart, only able to muster just enough energy for one last stand against Mother Miranda. Upon defeating the big bad once and for all, he hands his daughter over to Chris and agrees to stay behind with the detonation device that will activate the bomb planted on the Megamycete, destroying the village, the mold, and himself once and for all. Ethan triggers the explosion as Chris, Mia, and Rose escape.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil Requiem<br>October 2026</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/residentthumb-1765504800570.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The upcomming adventures of Leon Kennedy and Grace Ashcroft take place in 2026.

After jacking in, Rose enters a new realm filled with the memories of the Megamycete’s victims. She takes a jaunt through a version of the village her father was once trapped in, guided by the spirit “Michael”, who is actually Ethan’s remaining consciousness. As she explores, Rose is taunted by the trapped consciousness of Mother Miranda, who is desperate to escape this realm of memories. With the help of Ethan and her newfound abilities, Rose manages to defeat Mother Miranda and share one last moment with her father before she returns to the real world. In the aftermath, she visits Ethan’s grave while shadowed by a mysterious agent who calls her Eveline. After threatening him, Rose reveals she has abilities that even Chris doesn’t know about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there we go. That’s the entire plot of Resident Evil – well, all the stuff that actually matters. Yes, we skipped over some bits here or there, but there’s a lot to cover in the wacky world of Resident Evil, and that should be everything you need to know before diving into Resident Evil Requiem. Now, excuse me while I set my base to self-destruct and vow to get my revenge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Dale Driver is an Associate Director of Video Programming at IGN.

		<p>The hardcore survival simulator Road To Vostok will launch into early access on April 7th, developer Antti has announced. To mark the announcement a new trailer has been released showing off new parts of Road To Vostok, including environments and dynamic events. The game will also launch with a discount of 25%, with the price set as €14,99, but that will rise to €19.99 two weeks after Road To Vostok’s launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Early Access Trailer | Road to Vostok" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTFgTRsz43Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Road To Vostok is a single player experience set in a post apocalyptic border area between Finland and Russia, and the are is called Area 05. In this region, players need to learn to survive, loot items, deal with other survivors, and plan every step before heading to Vostok. Preparation is heavily encouraged because once the first steps are taken into Vostok there is no going back, as it is a permadeath zone. While there are story elements around the world, Road To Vostok is a primarily sandbox experience so players can experience their own stories. The game will also support mods so there may also be new stories to experience created by the community.</p>
<p>When Road To Vostok eventually gets its full release it will feature 10 Area 05 maps, 10 Vostok maps, 10 Crossing Points, 10 Shelters, three trader types including generalists, gunsmiths, and doctor, three enemy types including bandits, guards, and the military, special NPCs like driver, grandma, shaman, fisherman, and scientists, over 300 weapons, and over 30 weapons. Road To Vostok will be launched on PC first, but console versions are being considered. In terms of multiplayer, no PvP content is being considered but Road To Vostok may eventually get co-op depending on the success on the single player release.</p>

<figure data-uuid="cc13a4900cb14"><a title="Red Alarm - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cc13a4900cb14/red-alarm-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Howdy, Virtual Boy fans! Welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-super-mario-advance-3-yoshis-island">Last time</a>, we matched up a pair of covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/super_mario_advance_3_yoshis_island">Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island</a>, and it was a pretty close-run contest. The classic SMW2 art came out on top in the end, though, with North America taking 59% of the vote, leaving the pretty Japanese variant with 41%.</p>
<p>This week, to mark the announcement of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-announces-launch-line-up-for-switch-online-virtual-boy">Virtual Boy's Nintendo Switch Online launch line-up</a>, we're taking a look at one of the titles that you'll be able to play from 17th February: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/red_alarm">Red Alarm</a>. This <strong>Star Fox</strong>-style space shooter joins the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/teleroboxer">Teleroboxer</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/virtual_boy_wario_land">Virtual Boy Wario Land</a> on the service right from the jump, so it seems only right that we all become acquainted with its box art ahead of time.</p>
<p>Being a Virtual Boy title, there's obviously no European cover to look at this week, but the North American and Japanese designs make for a neat head-to-head. So, let's get into it.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:3793,196709 @ 1769979884 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="9b139dcf8dc29"><a title="Red Alarm - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9b139dcf8dc29/red-alarm-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14253-red-alarm">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The North American box art is just about as bright and colourful as they come. It's packed full of action with ships, explosions, a trench run backdrop vaguely reminiscent of the Death Star, and one of those green-outline maps that you only ever find in spy thrillers. Sure, it couldn't look less like the actual game, but it does a good job of selling the experience</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="a58c1fe1dc9df"><a title="Red Alarm - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a58c1fe1dc9df/red-alarm-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14253-red-alarm">T&amp;E Soft / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ooooh, the Japanese design goes full <strong>Top Gun</strong>. This is less about action and more about looking cool (something that's not so simple with a Virtual Boy headset strapped to your noggin). Be it the muted colour palette of blacks and reds — a more realistic image of the vibrancy you'll see in game — or the badass ship reflection in the central pilot's visor, this cover oozes cool.</p>

            <guid>1422085</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Fantasy MMORPG <strong>Ashes of Creation</strong>, developed by <strong>Intrepid Studios</strong>, has suddenly imploded: with several key members already resigned and mass layoffs incoming, <strong>the game's future seems dead</strong>. A few hours ago, people started noticing that many employees had changed their LinkedIn status to 'open for work', including Director of Communications and Marketing <strong>Margaret Krohn</strong>, who only hinted at the circumstances <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7423531204198436864/?originTrackingId=7VqOggD80HGyVa1KG3AfeQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a LinkedIn blog post</a>:</p>



<p><em>As for how this all ended… I don’t really have the words. It wasn’t what I expected. But I’m holding onto the good because there was so much of it.</em></p>



<p>More information came to light when finally founder, CEO, and Creative Director <strong>Steven Sharif</strong> shared the following message in the official Ashes of Creation Discord channel:</p>



<p><em>I can make a limited statement in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the company, regarding the situation. Control of the company shifted away from me, and the Board began directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out. As a result, I chose to resign in protest rather than lend my name or authority to decisions I could not ethically support. Following my resignation, much of the senior leadership team resigned. Following those departures, the Board made the decision to issue WARN Act notices and proceed with a mass layoff.</em></p>



<p><em>I cannot responsibly speak to further details at this time due to ongoing legal and governance matters. What I can say is that the developers and staff acted in good faith and deserved better than the uncertainty they are now facing. I am incredibly dismayed by the situation.</em></p>



<p>Sharif says in his statement that <strong>the Board made decisions that he did not feel comfortable carrying out</strong>. However, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/1qsm3r2/the_board_composed_of_me_and_my_husband/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to public records from the State of California</a>, <strong>the Board includes only him (as CEO and Secretary) and his husband, John Moore</strong>, who is listed as Chief Financial Officer.</p>



<p>Originally announced in 2016, Ashes of Creation <a href="https://wccftech.com/ashes-of-creation-funding-massive-mmorpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was funded on Kickstarter the following year</a>, <strong>earning over $3.2 million in pledges</strong>. Intrepid Studios then continued selling pre-release access to the game for a long time, and <strong>it did not take long for some users to warn that it could be a scam</strong>, especially because of the founder's past in the shady world of <strong>Multi-Level Marketing (MLM)</strong>. However, the development team posted regular updates, and the game did seem to be progressing, albeit very slowly. In late 2021, the studio <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ashes-of-creation-mmorpg-is-the-latest-game-to-upgrade-to-ue5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">switched from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Eventually, last month, Intrepid made the decision to <strong>launch the MMORPG on Steam Early Access</strong> while it was still technically in Alpha. It was a controversial decision, especially because Sharif maintained that the game just needed more feedback from a wider player base, while funding was supposedly not an issue, as Sharif would contribute his own money, as he had from the start.</p>



<p>However, due to the game's blatantly incomplete state, reception to Ashes of Creation <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a> was 'Mixed'. User reviews, both recent and total, sit at 51% right now. According to SteamDB, the MMO only reached a concurrent player peak of <strong>31.8K</strong> at launch and has dwindled ever since. Overall, sales estimates range between <strong>220K</strong> and <strong>320K</strong> units. This means the game earned between <strong>$11</strong> and <strong>$16</strong> <strong>million</strong> on Steam, although with Valve's 30% cut, the money that actually went to Intrepid ranges between <strong>$7.7</strong> and <strong>$11.2 million</strong>.</p>



<p>There's one last tidbit that dismayed backers have pointed out: in the original Kickstarter campaign, Intrepid <strong>had promised to refund all backers in full if the game did not launch</strong>. But it did launch, and people are wondering whether that wasn't simply a way to 'fulfill' that promise (which, however, was not legally binding).</p>



<p>Whatever the case, it's yet another blow <a href="https://wccftech.com/is-the-mmo-genre-dead-for-western-aaa-developers-we-asked-three-industry-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to a genre that was already flailing</a> after several high-profile closures, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon's New World</a> and its in-development <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new The Lord of the Rings MMO</a>.

<p>IEM Krakow yielded a long-awaited clash between BC.Game’s Oleksandr ‘s1mple’ Kostyliev and Vitality’s Mathieu ‘ZywOo’ Herbaut this weekend. It was the first time in almost three years that the pair had met on the competitive stage, and it ended with s1mple’s squad being forced unceremoniously into the lower bracket at IEM Krakow.</p>



<p>It was almost a predictable outcome, and it comes after s1mple declared ZywOo as being the closest Counter-Strike pro player to his own ‘prime’ status, back in the day.</p>







<h2 id="h-into-the-lower-run-for-bc-game">Into The Lower Run for BC.Game</h2>



<p>BC.Game opened the series against Vitality with the upper hand, but quickly faltered, with Vitality shutting the door on the team in rapid fashion. The ZywOo-led squad dropped just <strong>one round </strong>before closing out the map in the second half, going on to eliminate BCG from the upper bracket with a decisive 13-5 finish.</p>



<p>Both ZywOo and s1mple held their own, with the former edging out the latter in the numbers, but it’s a team game at the end of the day, and Vitality was the better unit on stage.</p>



<p>Before IEM Krakow, the two superstar competitors hadn’t met since Gamers8 in 2023, hosted in Saudi Arabia. The event has long since been rebranded as the Esports World Cup, but it was the last time that the two gamers shared a stage on opposing sides of the table.</p>



<p>Despite the loss, BC.Game’s journey in Krakow is far from over. They’re now in the lower bracket of their group, and while they have to focus squarely on survival, they have a chance to produce a huge upset over FaZe Clan tomorrow, February 2nd. The squad, featuring the talents of broky, karrigan, frozen, jcobb, and Twistzz, was also pushed into the lower run, but by a dominant 3DMAX side.</p>

<p>VALORANT’s next Night Market event lands on February 5th and runs to March 2nd, allowing players to secure sweet skins for a discount. The trouble is, you won’t know what skins are in<strong> your </strong>Night Market until the event kicks off, as players are offered <strong>six randomized skins</strong>, rather than the option to choose a specific selection.</p>



<p>Below, we’ve outlined the full spread of VALORANT skins coming to the Night Market this February. Take a look and see if there’s anything you’re hoping to unlock.</p>







<h2 id="h-full-list-of-valorant-night-market-skins">Full List of VALORANT Night Market Skins</h2>



<p>VALORANT’s Night Market is a sought-after and anticipated event that surfaces a few times a year. It offers some deep discounts on the game’s best skins and allows players to secure skins that might have long since disappeared from the active store rotation.</p>



<p>Typically, the Night Market <strong>only </strong>features skins from a select few tiers of the ecosystem, locking out Exclusive and Ultra skins, which are much more valuable and boast higher price tags that Riot Games just doesn’t want to discount!</p>



<p>If you’re waiting for the full list of Night Market skins for February’s run, you don’t have to look any further than <strong>right here:</strong></p>
