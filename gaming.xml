<p>As part of the partnership, Nintendo has pledged to provide "a large quantity" of Nintendo Switch Online memberships and game download codes at no cost. How nice!</p>
<p>ISEA President Danielle Johnson said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are so excited to partner with Nintendo as we continue to grow and expand competitive gaming opportunities for students across the country. Games are a fun, communal experience. We want to make gaming accessible to as many students as possible regardless of their previous gaming experience.</p>
<p>School-based gaming programs connect students that may have not been involved in social competitive activities before, and every student deserves a place to belong at school. These programs not only raise student attendance and achievement but also help students build healthy relationships that can last a lifetime.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/20-of-the-world%E2%80%99s-gamers-drive-%E2%80%9Cnearly-half-of-global-gaming-spend-%E2%80%9D-says-newzoo-with-those-players-annually-spending-325m-on-average.1268046/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new report from global data firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a>, created in collaboration with Tebex, a monetization platform that videogame studios use for in-game spending, has a few major revelations based on data collected in the past six months on the modern gaming landscape about the spending habits of gamers. </p>



<p>The report, titled, <em><a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/trend-reports/newzoo-tebex-unlocking-games-revenue-player-behavior-and-payment-trends">Unlocking Games Revenue: Player Behavior and Payment Trends in the West</a></em>, shares that according to Newzoo's findings, North American and European gamers spend an annual average of $325 million on videogames per year. All that spending comes from only 20% of the global videogaming population, or as Newzoo puts it, "<em>A small share of players, a large share of spend</em>."</p>



<p>Newzoo also predicts that the global videogame market will balloon to $188.9 billion, with 46% of that spending coming from North America and Europe.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo and Tebex</figcaption></figure>



<p>For clarification, as you can see in the graph below, Newzoo defines a player in this case as "<em>All people who play (digital) games on a PC, console, mobile device, or cloud gaming service in the past six months</em>." Another interesting tidbit that's not in the least bit surprising if you're even remotely aware of how most people play videogames nowadays, is that there are way more mobile gamers than PC and console gamers. According to Newzoo, there are 930 million PC gamers, 653 million console gamers, and 2,945 million mobile gamers. Or, to say it another way, almost 3 billion mobile gamers.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo and Tebex</figcaption></figure>



<p>But for all that spending, is there any growth to it? In North America, from 2023 and looking into the future to 2027, Newzoo predicts a 1.1% annual growth. In Europe, it expects a 3.1% annual growth in that same time frame.  That's "<em>slower growth in mature markets</em>," according to Newzoo, who also says that to respond to the slow growth in such high spending markets, "<em>studios must look beyond new payer acquisition - evolving monetization strategies will be key to driving value and engagement</em>."</p>



<p>And that's one of the key takeaways from the report, according to Newzoo and Tebex. That studios need to look towards "<em>deeper monetization</em>" for the future of the industry. </p>



<p>"<em>With modest payer growth in North America and Europe, studios must shift focus from acquiring new payers to maximizing value from existing ones. Aligning monetization with how and why players choose to spend is essential to driving engagement and revenue</em>," Newzoo and Tebex write as the first key takeaway at the bottom of the report.</p>



<p>When Fortnite first launched in 2017, it was one of many videogames players could choose to spend their time with on their preferred platform, with the distinction of a platform in videogames generally meaning a specific piece of hardware. Fast-forward to 2025, and Epic couldn't care less whether you play Fortnite on your phone, your console, or PC, because Fortnite is the platform now.</p>



<p>Individual games are extracting more out of individual players than ever before, but how games go about doing that is what matters, as Newzoo and Tebex point out. Not every game can be successful trying to sell hundreds of thousands of microtransactions, nor can they all be successful premium releases. And with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-why-gta-vi-likely-wont-be-priced-100-according-to-an-analyst/">uproar around rising prices</a>, increasing the buy-in for every game isn't the answer either.</p>



<p>"<em>Today's players want to know what they're paying for - and why</em>," writes Liam Wiltshire, head of payments and compliance at Tebex. "<em>How you monetize matters more than ever. Evolving monetization strategies are key to driving deeper engagement and long-term value</em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>An incident at a Burbank Chuck E. Cheese on August 7 is a useful PSA for what not to do at the kids arcade chain. An adult woman snuck into the Snow Day game meant for very small children and got her arm stuck in one of the holes. I guess she didn’t want the game to end. How many firefighters does it take to get a an arm out of the Snow Day game <a href="https://kotaku.com/chuck-e-cheese-subscription-fun-pass-tickets-price-1851620006">at Chuck E. Cheese</a>? At least six, it seems.</p> <p>It was around 3:30 p.m. last Thursday when the unidentified woman became trapped inside the large plastic arcade game, <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/woman-stuck-in-chuck-e-cheese-game-burbank/3761451/">NBC Los Angeles reported</a>. The Snow Day game revolves around putting plastic balls into a central hole. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53xiyTvBrWc">A suction tube then pulls them up</a> and spits them back out the top of the machine. The higher the score, the more tickets you get for prizes. At no point do you need to stick your hand inside the hole, let alone your whole arm.</p> <p>You might be thinking, wow, that sounds like a really boring game. And you’d be right! It was created to fill “an under-served age gap in our industry,” i.e. to be something even a two-year-old could have fun doing.</p>   <p>The local fire department was called and apparently dispatched at least six people to the Chuck E. Cheese to witness the third-degree shame first-hand. Video from the scene showed one person seemingly trying to take the machine apart while several others stood around and contemplated the “place where a kid can be a kid.”</p> <p>“We prioritize children’s safety above all and have verified that the game poses no risk to our young guests,” a Chuck E. Cheese spokesperson said following the incident. The design prevents children’s arms from reaching the area in question. There was no injury to the young adult or any children, and the family continued to enjoy an evening of fun with the family.”</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-matchmaking-doesnt-prioritise-skill/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-matchmaking-doesn%E2%80%99t-prioritise-skill.1268037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 developers have stated that matchmaking considers skill as a factor, but doesn’t prioritise it. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 open beta is the only thing players have been talking about recently, after we got to see a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-biggest-ever-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spectacular show</a> over the past weekend. As we gear up for the new map and modes for BF6 Open Beta weekend 2, new details about the game’s matchmaking system have been revealed. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-prioritises-ping-over-sbmm">Battlefield 6 Prioritises Ping Over SBMM</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-lead-says-skill-is-a-factor-in-matchmaking-but-far-down-the-list-so-please-lower-your-pitchforks-and-torches/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, the lead producer for Battlefield, David Sirland, was recently <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1954901993245581459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">asked</a> whether any form of SBMM kicks in during Battlefield 6 server match-ups. Sirland clarified, stating that BF6’s open beta matchmaking prioritised all elements they expect for launch, and they remain the same as in the previous title. The biggest priority for Battlefield 6’s matchmaking is “ping and time to game”. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Clarification: Open beta used all matchmaking priorities we expect for launch. And they are the same as they have been in previous titles. We prioritize Ping, and time to game ahead of most things. 1/2</p>— David Sirland (@tiggr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1954901993245581459?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Sirland explains that skill is a factor in Battlefield 6’s matchmaking; however, it is “far down the list”. The lead producer added that the game’s large mode requires “a spread of skill to work well”. The sandbox needs players to have different types of skillsets to “function well”, which is “also why the matchmaker teambalances to make the teams even as part of that process.” </p>



<p>Ahead of the open beta, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-sbmm-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Battlefield 6’s skill-based matchmaking will rely on four core aspects: Ping, Player’s Location, Server Availability and Some Skill Factor. Moreover, it was said that the matchmaking factors “will vary based on each game mode and player counts”.</p>



<p>On the topic of Battlefield 6, the viral VTuber ‘RileyCS’ has&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-rileycs-cheating-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been banned on Twitch</a>&nbsp;following allegations of cheating. Additionally, BF6 developers are looking into “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-devs-are-looking-into-unexpectedly-fast-time-to-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unexpectedly fast” time to death</a>. What are your thoughts on Battlefield 6 developers not prioritising skill for matchmaking?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In an all-new trailer promoting the imminent launch of Helldivers 2 on Xbox Series platforms, Arrowhead has slipped in a teaser for a potential Halo 3: ODST crossover. It’s only a few seconds worth of content, but it has proven enough to get chins wagging in the comment section under the video.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 will be released on Xbox on August 26, more than a year and a half after it first dropped on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bring-the-boom">Bring the Boom!</h2>



<p>The newest Helldivers 2 trailer has been released, two weeks before the game launches on Xbox platforms worldwide.</p>



<p>Here’s the minute-and-a-half showcase of what’s coming (as if you don’t already know!):</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Bring the Boom | Out August 26" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qc8n_dxYcvE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>If you’re an eagle-eyed gamer, you’ll have spotted the nod to Halo 3: ODST at the end of the video. The sequence containing the drop pod backed by an orchestral score is pulled straight from the 2009 Xbox 360 title, and it has fans <strong>excited</strong>.</p>



<p>The trailer was also one of the first times we’ve seen this surface, which is mind-bending:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fans are expecting some kind of launch day crossover between Halo and Helldivers 2, and honestly, there couldn’t be a more perfect thing to hope for. One user wrote on YouTube, ‘Don’t give me hope like that. If there’s an ODST-themed crossover, I’ll cry tears of joy.’</p>



<p>In recent Helldivers-related news, it was revealed that Arrowhead Studios wants to make <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-developers-want-to-make-game-more-challenging/">the game more challenging</a>. It was also confirmed that the developer and publisher have no plans to bring the game to any subscription services <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-have-no-plans-of-putting-it-on-game-pass/">like Game Pass</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A game that bears a striking resemblance to Pocketpair’s popular survival crafting title, Palworld, has been spotted on the Nintendo Store. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Pocketpair is already fighting a patent infringement lawsuit from Nintendo and The Pokémon Company, with Nintendo alleging that Palworld has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-argues-invalidity-and-non-infringement-against-nintendos-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infringed on 3 of their patents</a>. Interestingly, now a game that feels like a lookalike of Palworld is available for purchase on the Nintendo Store. </p>



<h2 id="h-palland-and-palworld-look-eerily-similar">Palland and Palworld Look Eerily Similar</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/with-the-palworld-lawsuit-rumbling-on-in-the-background-the-nintendo-switch-welcomes-palland-a-survival-game-that-looks-a-whole-lot-like-pocketpairs-creature-collector/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, a new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/palland-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOooQaIk-Baos18U8SW8wkjXAqdMfQRjonByqq4OCiP4XMJEGR9eI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">listing</a> for Palland has appeared on the Nintendo Store, and from the outset, players will notice many similarities to Palworld (if Pal-land wasn’t a big giveaway already). The key art and gameplay screenshots feature a similar red-haired woman we have seen in Palworld’s screenshots, with different types of creatures. However, the art style of the two games is slightly different.  </p>



<p>Coming to the description, here’s where players will see more similarities between Palland and Palworld. The description states that Palland features a world with captivating survival, building, and exploration, where players choose “how to gather resources, expand your shelter, and deal with wild creatures that can be both threats and valuable sources of power.”</p>

<p>Palland has been priced at $9.99 ($3.99 on discount till August 14) and is available as a digital game for the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. BoggySoft has published the game, and it was released on July 31, 2025. </p>

                <p>The first weekend of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>'s open beta was received positively by fans and put up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-eclipses-call-of-duty-player-record-on-steam/1100-6533822/" data-ref-id="1100-6533822">huge numbers on Steam</a>, but how many people in total tried it out? According to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/electronic-arts-ea-stock-know-163043783.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">research firm Oppenheimer</a>, the beta reached more than 5 million people during the August 7-11 window that included the early-access period and the open beta for everyone.</p><p>Oppenheimer said the beta had "superior polish, excellent netcode, and an authentic Battlefield experience." Many players might agree with this, as the sentiment around the beta was largely positive--though of course the beta <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-bugs-crashes-and-all-other-known-issues-for-the-open-beta/1100-6533779/" data-ref-id="1100-6533779">was not without its issues</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-certainly-have-some-strong-opinions-after-the-first-open-beta/1100-6533851/" data-ref-id="1100-6533851">complaints.</a> In particular, some people <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-how-to-turn-on-secure-boot-on-pc/1100-6533761/" data-ref-id="1100-6533761">complained about the Secure Boot requirement on PC.</a></p>

<p>EA has not confirmed a player figure for the Battlefield 6 beta thus far, but the company did say in a social media post that this was the <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1954179027834474694" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"biggest open beta" in Battlefield's history.</a> GameSpot has contacted EA in an attempt to get more details.</p><p>The Battlefield 6 open beta eclipsed 500,000 peak concurrent users on Steam, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-eclipses-call-of-duty-player-record-on-steam/1100-6533822/" data-ref-id="1100-6533822">surging past Call of Duty's own record.</a> Despite the beta being offline, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 3,000 people are currently in the game on Steam.</a></p><p>The Battlefield 6 open beta enters its second weekend beginning August 14 and running through August 17.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> had quite the 2024 on PlayStation 5 and PC, and it's set to bring its bullet heaven, bug-killing mayhem to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-airdrops-on-xbox-series-xs-in-august">Xbox later this month on August 26</a>. Ahead of the game's launch on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox has released a new "Bring the Boom" trailer highlighting the fun (and explosions) of Helldivers 2, and at the end of it, there seems to be a tease for a Halo 3: ODST collaboration or crossover.&nbsp;</p><p>At roughly 1 minute and 11 seconds in, after the meat and potatoes of the trailer have finished, the video fades away to one of Helldiver 2's cities, moody and atmospheric with rain and few lights on the horizon. Then, the smooth jazz of a saxophone as a Helldiver pod drops into the city. Check it out for yourself below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qc8n_dxYcvE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qc8n_dxYcvE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see, it's pretty clear what Xbox is trying to do here: that's a Halo 3: ODST tease. Sure, Helldivers <em>do </em>drop into cities, but in the game, it's typically not as moody or as ambient as what's pictured here – what <em>is </em>as moody or as ambient as what's here is the atmosphere of Halo 3: ODST. And then the saxophone seals the deal. As for what it means or when we can expect to learn more, that remains unclear. But given Helldivers 2 has crossed over with PlayStation's Killzone series before, it wouldn't be surprising for the game to feature cosmetics or something from one of Xbox's most beloved games.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting to learn more, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/helldivers-2/bullet-heaven"><em>Game Informer's </em>Helldivers 2 review</a>, and then read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/halo_3_odst/b/xbox360/archive/2009/09/28/review.aspx"><em>Game Informer's </em>Halo 3: ODST review</a>. After that, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/05/11/every-mainline-halo-game-ranked"><em>Game Informer's </em>ranking of every mainline Halo game</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What would you want out of a Helldivers 2 x Halo 3: ODST crossover?

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-update-1021-patch-notes</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-update-1-021-brings-new-endgame-content-and-more-tomorrow.1268001/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom is releasing a new&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>update tomorrow (or today, depending on where you are!), and the studio has released the patch notes ahead of the update's launch, showing what kind of endgame content you can expect.</p>

<p>Back in late July, Capcom revealed that it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-endgame-august" rel="nofollow">bumping up</a> some of the monster-hunting RPG's endgame content to mid-August, seemingly in response to criticisms from players regarding the game's lack of same. According to the patch notes, that's exactly what you can expect, too.</p>

<p>The patch will run anywhere from 2GB to 6GB depending on which version of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>you have, and it'll land tomorrow at 2:30am UTC (that's around 7:30pm Pacific or about 10:30 Eastern tonight).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-update-1.021-patch-notes-monsters.jpg?itok=hJqIknFK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-update-1.021-patch-notes-monsters.jpg?itok=OpvtVARi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is getting a new update tomorrow with some more endgame content for you.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, you're getting tempered versions of nine of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' creatures when you reach HR 100. They'll take the form of nine-star quests, and you'll also find "regular and tempered versions of Rey Dau and Nu Udra" appearing in the Wounded Hollow if you reach that rank.</p>

<p>Monsters at HR 100 or higher have had their appearance rate adjusted, and standard monsters have had their appearance rate raised slightly. Not only that, but you'll find a new Glowing Stone appraisal item that will grant you "a talisman with random skill attributes" when appraised.</p>

<p>A number of other changes are coming as part of this update too, and if you want to see what those are, you can check out the <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.021.00.00.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full patch notes right here</a>. It's worth doing so, as there are a number of improvements that could make your experience just a little bit better.</p>




<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series. Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">in February</a>, the game was initially a phenomenal success for Capcom, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">selling 10 million copies</a> within the space of around a month and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">breaking records for its developer</a> into the bargain.</p>

<p>Since then, however, sales have <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/capcom-admits-monster-hunter-wilds-sales-are-soft-as-pc-issues-persist-but-really-theyve-plummeted-barely-beating-2021s-monster-hunter-rise-and-losing-to-8-other-old-games-including-devil-may-cry-5/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">slowed</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recent reviews</a> on Steam have dipped to Mostly Negative, with players decrying a lack of performance updates and simplified gameplay (although reviews seem fairly heavily weighted towards the former).</p>

<p>If you'd like to see the state of the game for yourself, you can check it out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and if you need another opinion, you can check out our&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier" rel="nofollow">review right here</a>.</p>

            <p>Please, for the love of all that can be side-swiped to oncoming traffic, make a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/burnout-paradise">Burnout</a> game. This has been one of the five thoughts that fill my head on a daily basis for years at this point, and thanks to a website that's letting people draw pixel art all over Google Maps, I've been given yet another outlet via which to let it out.</p>
<p>That site is <a href="https://wplace.live/">wplace</a>, and it'll look familiar if you've been partial to the now defunct Reddit thread <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/place/">r/place</a> at any point. Basically, anyone can hop into its map and colour in pixels to doodle over the top of any place on Earth, creating vast canvases of cool art and scrawled messages to whomever might be watching.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So, naturally, I've joined in. First, I had to find a place to write. Enter Paradise City, a <a href="https://www.p-city.com/">swanky resort</a> just next to the airport in Incheon, South Korea. I had to fit my work in next to someone who seems ken to go and see My Chemical Romance in 2026, which is fitting, because we're united by our lust for things that were good in the 2000s. There are also some pretty creepy looking gingerbread people nearby, but I'm sure my unhinged wonky writing will put them off from messing with my demand: 'NEw Burnout PlS!'.</p>

<p>I wasn't done there, though. A resort felt a bit too hopeful for the situation this series has ended up in. So, I found the stretch of Oregon river named Shitten Creek, and have neatly written another 'New BurnouT! PlS' up it, for all to see. There's no other art in this remote bit of the beaver state as of writing, so if you head southwest of Eugene you get a lovely clear look at my struggle to spell out each word while sticking to the wplace's 64-pixels-at-a-time limit.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You do get more than that paltry sum, but you've got to wait for a cooldown timer to replenish your stock before you can start drawing again. Will my efforts directly result in current rights holders Electronic Arts seeing and going 'oh bollocks, we'd better finally greenlight a sequel to Paradise or sell up to someone who will'. Look anything's better than just a single cryptic tease from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/burnout-paradise-remastered-review">Paradise Remastered</a> co-devs Stellar Entertainment <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/need-for-speed-unbound-dev-offers-a-very-strange-teaser-and-fans-think-its-for-a-burnout-game/">last year</a> that the unnamed arcade racer they've got in the works might, possibly, be Burnouty.</p><p>Anyway, I'm far from the only one who's scrawled something game-related across wplace's Earth. There are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age</a> fans <a href="https://x.com/Scar3crowss/status/1954560684559065413">in Scotland</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>ers everywhere (including near Team Cherry's HQ in Adelaide), and I'm glad to report someone's written "It just works" in Bethesda's hometown of Rockville, Maryland.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Naturally, I also looked at my local area and was glad to find someone had penned the logo of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-43588365">defunct local shop chain Grainger Games</a>, with a number of nearby messages saying they still miss it.</p>
<p>I might come back and write a bunch of other dormant racing series that I'd love to see revived and brought straight to PC in some other places. Los Angeles might be gridlocked with graffiti, but I'll stay up til the small hours finding room for Midnight Club.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Later this month, <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers</em> 2</a>—previously a PS5- and PC-only PlayStation-published sci-fi shooter—arrives on Xbox with crossplay support. And a new trailer teases the possibility that some Orbital Drop Shock Troopers from <em>Halo 3: ODST</em> might appear as backup.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573">Back in July</a>, Arrowhead and PlayStation Studios announced that their super-successful live-service shooter <em>Helldivers 2</em> would arrive on Xbox on August 26. The co-op shooter leaping to the PS5’s main rival is yet more evidence that the console wars are over. Plus, it means a bunch of Xbox-only players get a chance to enjoy one of the best co-op games released in years. Now, just about two weeks before <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-port-ps5-sony-playstation-decision-ceo-discord-2000616377"><em>Helldivers 2</em> crashes onto Xbox Series X/S consoles,</a> Xbox and Sony have teamed up (which is a little weird to say) to tease some <em>Halo</em> content coming to <em>Helldivers 2.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>On August 12, a new trailer for <em>Helldivers 2</em> on Xbox dropped and it shows off a bunch gameplay, featuring the kinds of loud explosions and mayhem you’d expect. But at the very end of all that is a quiet, jazzy tease that seems to heavily imply<em> Halo 3: ODST</em> soldiers are inbound. I’ve set up the trailer below to start right at the teaser:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Helldivers 2 - Bring the Boom | Out August 26" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qc8n_dxYcvE?start=70&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Ohhh, how I’ve missed the rain-soaked streets of <em>Halo 3: ODST a</em>nd its chill jazz music soundtrack. What a game. And a perfect fit for <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Both Helldivers and ODST soldiers land onto battlefields via drop pods to fight intergalactic threats. <em>Helldivers 2</em> has been very careful with its IP crossovers, but <em>ODST</em> makes sense and visually won’t feel too out of place. The real question is how fans will get their hands on some ODST armor, and also, will it feature some smooth jazz music? We’ll likely find out more before <em>Helldivers 2</em> launches on Xbox Series X/S on August 26.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Finish the fight?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> looks set for an unlikely Halo crossover after a new trailer teased the arrival of the ODST.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead's hugely successful PC and PlayStation 5 third-person shooter launches on Xbox Series X and S on August 26 as the first Sony-published game on Microsoft’s console. The trailer, below, ends with what looks like the arrival of an ODST on a rain-drenched battlefield, alongside the iconic music from the game. It's all very ODST!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Bungie-developed Halo 3: ODST came out exclusively on Xbox 360 in 2009. You play as an Orbital Drop Shock Trooper, or ODST, during and after the events of Halo 2. So, this is <em>not</em> the chance to play as what would be an over-powered Master Chief in Helldivers 2, rather a pretty powerful standard soldier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The next obvious question is whether this ODST crossover will come alongside other Halo items, such as its iconic assault rifle and perhaps even the Warthog. Helldivers 2 seems particularly suited to a Halo crossover of this kind, so it will be interesting to see just how far it goes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-published-helldivers-2-gets-shock-release-date-on-xbox-series-x-and-s">announced Helldivers 2’s Xbox release date last month</a> (bizarrely, it comes out the same day as Microsoft releases Gears of War: Reloaded on PlayStation 5). In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-xbox-release-date-pre-order/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Xbox Wire</u></a>, Helldivers 2 Game Director Mikael Eriksson commented on what this launch means to the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We know gamers have been asking for this for some time and we are so excited to bring more Helldivers into our game," he said. "We have so much more in store for the future months and years – and the more players we have the more stories we can tell! The fight for Super Earth has only just begun.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Crossplay across all platforms is confirmed, which means PC, PlayStation, and Xbox players will be able to play together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2 launched on PC and PS5 in February 2024 and was a rare live service smash hit for Sony. It is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time, shifting an incredible 12 million copies in 12 weeks. While player numbers on Steam, which Valve makes public, remain healthy a year-and-a-half on from the record-breaking launch, the Xbox release will no-doubt boost the player pool even further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The timing of Halo in Helldivers 2 coincides with Halo also being featured in Fortnite, during a bug-infested season that some Arrowhead developers have said is basically <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-says-fortnites-new-alien-bug-season-is-very-we-have-helldivers-at-home">a Helldivers-themed Fortnite</a>. "Hmmm... it's giving 'we have Helldivers at home,'" community manager Katherine Baskin wrote on the game's Discord, before adding: "I'm not worried."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Halo, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-teases-more-halo-news-this-october">Microsoft has teased more on what's to come in October</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mario-40th-anniversary-placeholder-twitter-account/">The Gamer</a>, X account <a href="https://x.com/supermario40th">@supermario40th</a> has been causing a bit of a kerfuffle, with some suspecting that it might be legit, thus indicating that Nintendo will indeed celebrate the plumber's anniversary with a number of key announcements. At the moment, it's completely blank bar the handle, the 'aaaaaaaaa' name, and a single follow for <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo">Nintendo's Japanese account</a>.</p>
<p>So why is this even worth mentioning? Well, Nintendo's done it before, that's why. Its <a href="https://x.com/supermario35th">@supermario35th</a> account, which is still live at the time of writing, went through a very similar journey back in 2020 (it even had the same 'aaaaaaaaaaa' name, albeit with a couple more 'a's), and we covered it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/07/fans_have_discovered_a_private_mario_35th_anniversary_twitter_account">right here on Nintendo Life</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the potential issue we have is that the 40th anniversary account was seemingly created back in 2020. So what's going on? Well, either Nintendo itself created the account early to ensure nobody else nabbed it, or someone <em>did</em> nab it and is simply keeping it safe in the event Nintendo knocks on their door.</p>
<figure><a title="40th Account" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/12cbfc94872eb/40th-account.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://x.com/supermario40th">X</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_UcjEq2Dgk">35th anniversary Direct presentation</a> for Super Mario on 3rd September 2020. It seems unlikely that the company will stick to the <em>exact</em> same schedule for the 40th, but it might well be worth keeping an eye out for a potential announcement in the coming weeks.</p>

              <p>Brendan “PlayerUnknown” Greene changed the entire course of gaming in 2017 with the release of&nbsp;<em>PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds</em>, now known nonsensically as <em>PUBG Battlegrounds</em>. (<em>Plunkbat&nbsp;</em>forever.) Without it–for good or ill–we may not have <em>Fortnite</em>, one of the most successful games ever.&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em> isn’t doing too badly itself, with more than half a million people playing at least once every day. Now, Greene is hoping to revitalize the survival genre with <a href="https://kotaku.com/pubg-2-prologue-brendan-greene-playerunknown-metaverse-1851765648"><em>Prologue</em></a>, developed over the last four years and today revealing a surprise free open beta.</p> <p>Reminiscent of games from the survival sim heyday, <em>Prologue&nbsp;</em>drops its players in a woodland cabin and challenges them to find their way to a weather station, randomly placed on the sprawling 8-by-8km map. Along the way, you’ll be bombarded by weather extremes and hungry wildlife, while needing to keep yourself fed, watered and warm. Which, while certainly a familiar premise if you played <em>The Long Dark</em> or&nbsp;<em>The Forest</em>, is aiming for a different emphasis.&nbsp;<em>Prologue</em> appears to be aiming for the extremes of isolation, a sense of agoraphobic loneliness in its procedurally generated maps.</p> <p>Plus, of course, this comes with the pedigree. Greene may have moved on from&nbsp;<em>PUGB</em>, hence the title now only containing his nickname’s initials, but PlayerUnknown Productions comes with a lot of expectation. And then a lot of confusing rhetoric about “metaverses” and the like. But if you want to find out exactly what the game’s about, well, you can right now! For free!</p> <p>Available on both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/prologue-go-wayback-72ee27">Epic</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Prologue: Go Wayback!&nbsp;</em>playtest lets you download and play the game ahead of its Early Access launch intended for later this year. To get it on Steam, head to the store page (the “go wayback” title, which hopefully isn’t permanent, at least makes it possible to search for) and then click on the “Request Access” button beneath the demo link. You’ll instantly get in, and will find the game available to install at the top of your Steam library. I’m downloading it as I type.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 players will be able to access two new game modes and a new map during the upcoming open beta weekend. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s open beta was the biggest beta test yet for the franchise, bringing in over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500,000 concurrent players</a> on Steam alone. However, it did come with some minor issues that developers are figuring out, including “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-devs-are-looking-into-unexpectedly-fast-time-to-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unexpectedly fast</a>” time to death. Developers will try to iron out any problems they can before the next BF6 Open Beta weekend arrives, featuring a new map and modes.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-open-beta-weekend-2-will-add-empire-state-with-rush-and-squad-deathmatch-modes">Battlefield 6 Open Beta Weekend 2 Will Add Empire State with Rush and Squad Deathmatch Modes</h2>

The developer first thanked players for testing out the title and providing feedback. In the upcoming weekend, players get to do it all over again, but on a brand new map, Empire State and two new game modes, Rush and Squad Deathmatch. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Seeing the reception of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Battlefield6</a> Open Beta this weekend was truly overwhelming. <br>Thx to everyone playing and feedbacking!<br>See you all next weekend when we do it all over again, this time including Rush and Squad Deathmatch on Empire State (as well as the previous maps) <a href="https://t.co/uuzt1yvaEP">pic.twitter.com/uuzt1yvaEP</a></p>— Daniel Cambrand (@TearGasJazzDICE) <a href="https://twitter.com/TearGasJazzDICE/status/1954875363768856973?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The upcoming Battlefield 6 beta weekend will also have maps and modes from the previous weekend, including Siege of Cairo, Liberation Peak and Iberian Offensive. Modes of the prior weekend included Conquest, Closed Weapon Conquest, Breakthrough, Domination and King of the Hill. BF6 Open Beta Weekend 2 will also include Closed Weapon Conquest and Breakthrough. </p>



<p>In other news, the viral VTuber ‘RileyCS’ has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-rileycs-cheating-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been banned on Twitch</a> following allegations of cheating. Additionally, BF6’s anti-cheat engine is asking players to&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-anti-cheat-faces-issues-with-valorant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uninstall Valorant</a>.

                <p>The Pokemon Company and McDonald's have teamed up before, but not without <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mcdonalds-pokemon-happy-meal-promotion-begins-is-immediately-ruined-by-adults/1100-6487354/" data-ref-id="1100-6487354">attracting undo attention from would-be scalpers</a>. Earlier this month, McDonald's Japan was forced to end its latest Pokemon Happy Meal promotion a few days early because the supply of cards quickly ran out amid chaotic crowds clamoring for the cards that came with them.</p><p>According to <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/pokemon-tcg-mcdonalds-japan-campaign-draws-disgust-and-flak-for-food-waste-and-chaos/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Soup</a>, scalpers drove most of the demand for Pokemon cards and many of them abandoned their Happy Meals uneaten at the restaurants or on the streets outside. In some cases, the crowds inside the McDonald's restaurants were so unruly that the police had to be called.</p><p>The most-prized item from this giveaway was a McDonald's-exclusive Pikachu card featuring Pokemon's iconic creature ready to scarf a Happy Meal of his own. Aside from the scalpers who came away with the cards, the only real winners of this PR debacle were the pigeons who devoured the discarded meals.</p><p>McDonald's Japan did set a limit of five Happy Meals per customer, but that limit was either ignored or circumvented by scalpers. Overzealous collectors and scalpers aren't unique to Japan. American Rick and Morty fans may recall <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rick-and-morty-co-creator-responds-as-mcdonalds-ap/1100-6453883/" data-ref-id="1100-6453883">the Szechuan Sauce mania</a> that occurred in 2017 when McDonald's briefly brought it back.</p><p>However, Pokemon fans appear to be in a league of their own. Reports have emerged that the Japanese mob has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-cards-are-reportedly-being-used-to-launder-money-by-the-japanese-mob/1100-6528520/" data-ref-id="1100-6528520">using some Pokemon </a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-cards-are-reportedly-being-used-to-launder-money-by-the-japanese-mob/1100-6528520/" data-ref-id="1100-6528520">cards to launder money</a>. Last May, a UK man was arrested in possession of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/man-arrested-after-being-found-with-a-stolen-pokemon-card-haul-worth-over-300000/1100-6531563/" data-ref-id="1100-6531563">over $300k worth of stolen Pokemon cards</a>.</p><p>The resurgence of Pokemon fandom shows no signs of abating, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokepark-kanto-will-let-you-experience-real-world-of-pokemon-in-2026/1100-6533333/" data-ref-id="1100-6533333">there's even a PokePark Kanto attraction </a>slated to open next year in Japan.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Control&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>studio Remedy has released its financial statement for the first half of the 2025 fiscal year, and the company has admitted it's not happy with the launch sales of its latest game&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a>, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala says that despite a 43% increase in revenue over last year's first half, as well as "an initial accrual from subscription service agreements with Sony and Microsoft",&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>"underperformed" on Steam, which Virtala describes as "the primary consumer sales channel on PC" for the game.</p>

<p>According to Virtala,&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>'s underperformance is due to its "initial onboarding experience and mission structure", which, when taken together, "resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews". These led to what Virtala calls a "rocky launch" for the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc-firebreak-launch-sales-remedy-financials-shooting.jpg?itok=165J9pCp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc-firebreak-launch-sales-remedy-financials-shooting.jpg?itok=aqHnfjNJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>FBC: Firebreak</em>'s initial sales haven't impressed developer and publisher Remedy.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite these initial wobbles, however, Virtala says he believes that&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>is "a solid game to build on", and that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-whats-next" rel="nofollow">major update coming in September</a>&nbsp;will serve as "the next key step" for the multiplayer shooter. Given that the game is currently <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sitting at just 16 players</a> on Steam, with a 22-player 24-hour peak, let's hope Remedy can turn things around.</p>

<p>With regards to the studio's other upcoming games, Virtala says progress is brisk.&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, which Remedy says will move in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-action-rpg" rel="nofollow">a more action RPG-wards direction</a>, is "on track towards meeting its next milestones", Virtala says, with development currently focused on various core gameplay systems and world design elements.</p>

<p>As for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/max-payne-remakes-control-spinoff-remedy" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes</a>, they're still "in full production", and Remedy's collaboration with&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>IP holder Rockstar "remains close and productive", which is always nice to hear. Let's hope we get more info about those soon.</p>

<p>Remedy also says that sales for the original&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>crossed the five million mark during this year's second quarter, following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-control-franchise-rights" rel="nofollow">transferral of the franchise rights</a> from original owner 505 Games last year.</p>

              <p>Remedy, the creators of&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake</em> and&nbsp;<em>Control</em>, have had a good six months. The company’s revenue has risen by 63 percent, which is just the sort of good news you want to be able to tell your parents, and at the same time the company completed buying all the rights to&nbsp;<em>Control</em> from publishers 505 Games, as part of its plans to become fully independent of external publishers. Lovely to be them. However, despite all this good news, it seems Remedy’s latest game, three-player co-op shooter <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, is still struggling. But Remedy isn’t giving up on it.</p> <p>Back in July, while acknowledging the launch hadn’t gone as well as hoped, Remedy’s Thomas Punha <a href="https://kotaku.com/remedy-control-fbc-firebreak-lowplayer-count-update-1-3-1851785449">tried to downplay the significance of the very low player counts on Steam</a>. “Steam is a very important part of the business of&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>,” he told&nbsp;<em>GameSpot.</em>&nbsp;“The Steam [active player count] is a very easy statistic to dig up, but it isn’t everything.”</p> <p>However, it seems like it’s still an awful lot. In the <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5">company’s latest financial report</a>, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala concedes that PC was where <em>Firebreak</em> had been intended to best succeed, but it has instead fared vastly better on console thanks to subscription deals. “On Steam, which was planned as the primary consumer sales channel on PC, the launch underperformed,” says Virtala. “The game’s initial onboarding experience and mission structure resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews. As players spent more time in the game and we released updates improving the game, sentiment in reviews turned more positive.”</p>

 <p>Well, that’s kinda true. The game remains on “Mixed” reviews on Steam, although it’s trending slightly more positively. Currently 68 percent of the 1,685 reviews are positive, although even this stat belies just how few people are playing. It’s all very well to say players are having a better time, but how many? To this day, the game has an all-time peak simultaneous player-count of 1,992, and that was two months ago. In the last 24 hours, the game peaked at 24 people. It’s a colossal flop.</p> <p>The higher (although not stated) numbers on console are likely because the game was included day-one on both Game Pass and PS Plus, meaning anyone with a sub can take a risk-free look, even, if they–like most humans–will struggle to coordinate three people to play at the same time. Still, you make money by putting your games on these services, as Virtala points out:</p> <blockquote><p>“Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>. Thus far,&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>’s commercial performance has largely been driven by the Xbox and PlayStation subscription service agreements. A considerable portion of the revenues from these agreements will still be recognized throughout the contract period.”</p></blockquote> <p>Despite all this, Remedy is valiantly sticking with <em>Firebreak</em>, even though I think anyone would give them a pass at this point. There’s still a “Major Update” coming in September, which the company plans to support with a marketing campaign in an effort to turn its fortunes around. Virtala adds, “We are committed to continuing to work on <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, engaging with the community, and expanding the game.”</p> <p>In better news, the report states that&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em> is meeting its milestones, and the <em>Max Payne 1 &amp; 2&nbsp;</em>remake “continues its progress and remains in full production.” Meanwhile, the original&nbsp;<em>Control</em> has now sold over 5 million copies, which is stunning. And the company is well on its way to becoming self-sustaining as a self-publishing studio freed from publisher pressure and fees.</p>

<p>You can’t deny FBC: Firebreak is ambitious, even if it is a game no one was necessarily clamoring for. The latter part of this is now evident, as Remedy has given deeper insight into FBC: Firebreak’s underwhelming launch and plans for the IP.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-fbc-firebreak-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a> was Remedy’s first new release since the Game of the Year-contending <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-over-2-million-copies-and-is-finally-profitable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>. Firebreak is set in Control’s (another Remedy IP) world and is a team-based FPS. This is quite a bold shift from the company’s other games. We’ve seen from gameplay and matches that the game has potential, but its launch has failed to land.</p>



<h2 id="h-fbc-firebreak-receiving-major-update-in-september">FBC: Firebreak Receiving Major Update in September</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Firebreak hasn’t caught yet. Credit to Remedy</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s quite damning to hear that the FBC: Firebreak “launch underperformed.” This is the official word from Remedy’s Jan-Jun 2025 financial <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>.</p>



<p>“On Steam, which was planned as the primary consumer sales channel on PC, the launch underperformed. The game’s initial onboarding experience and mission structure resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews.”</p>



<p>The company was happy that “The launch succeeded technically, reaching over 1 million players in its first 10 days,” but goes on to say: “Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of&nbsp;FBC: Firebreak.”</p>



<p>The majority of the shooter’s revenue has come from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreak-xbox-game-pass-playstation-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus</a>-subscribing users. Firebreak was free on both services at launch.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, despite the adversity, Remedy believes FBC: Firebreak is a “solid game” the team can build on: “Looking ahead, a larger ‘Major Update’ late September will be the next key step for&nbsp;FBC: Firebreak.
