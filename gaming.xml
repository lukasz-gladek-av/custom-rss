<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> got some of the spotlight in the latest broadcast, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/new-kirby-amiibo-will-apparently-be-nintendos-most-expensive-amiibo-ever">and apart from those new amiibo</a>, it's also been revealed there will be <em>another</em> 'Direct' taking place in the future.</p>
<p>This "2nd presentation" will once again be hosted by the game's director Masahiro Sakurai. We don't know what specifically will be revealed in this next show just yet or when exactly it will be aired but it's "on the way". During this week's Nintendo Direct, it was mentioned how "more Kirby Air Riders amiibo updates" would be shared in the future.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Sakurai also acknowledged this announcement via social media (here's a rough translation via DeepL):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was introduced to [a] Direct within [a] Direct... I'll do it! It's not something I can make right away, but please be patient"</p>

<p>When we find out more about this upcoming Direct, we'll be sure to let you know. In the meantime, you can check out the previous Kirby Air Riders broadcast, which revealed the playable roster of racers, courses, items and power ups, multiplayer aspects and much more.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, there'll be a few (paid) gates you'll need to pass through before you can even access this particular library. Not only will you need to have an active Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription (aka the premium-priced tier), but you'll also be "required" to fork out for an accessory.</p>
<p>Apart from this information during the broadcast, Nintendo has also made note of the requirement on its official website:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ostzqr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Virtual Boy for Nintendo Switch 2/Nintendo Switch and Virtual Boy (Cardboard Model) for Nintendo Switch 2/Nintendo Switch are required to play the Virtual Boy – Nintendo Classics collection of games. Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership required to access Virtual Boy – Nintendo Classics collection of games."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned above, there are two headset options to choose from. If you don't want to pay <strong>$99.99 / £66.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent) for the replica, there is the cheaper cardboard model, which will set you back <strong>$24.99 / £16.99</strong>. Nintendo's website also notes how users will need to have a paid Switch Online membership to purchase these accessories.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there's been a mixed reaction online to this, with some Nintendo diehards welcoming the Virtual Boy's return with open arms, while others are venting frustration about the price, the requirements to access it, and how there's still no option or proper workaround to officially experience these games without a headset.</p>
<p>Once again, this library will launch on 17th February 2026, with both accessories due out on the same date. You can see the games on the way to this particular digital library in our previous story:</p>

<p>Apart from the cost of the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> pack, one other talking point following the latest Direct is the pricing of the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> amiibo.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/kirby-air-riders-amiibo-price/">highlighted by Nintendo Everything</a>, these new figures will reportedly be Nintendo's "most expensive amiibo ever". To reiterate, it means fans will apparently have to fork out more than they've ever previously had to for first-party amiibo. One difference compared to your regular amiibo is the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/mario-galaxy-amiibo-are-on-the-way-plus-two-new-kirby-ones-with-swappable-bases">swappable base</a>.</p>
<p>A single Kirby Air Riders figure will set you back $50 USD, or if you want to pick up both the Kirby and Waddle Dee figures, you'll be looking at a total cost of $100! Retailer listings with these same prices attached have already gone live in the US, and we'll be on the lookout for prices in other regions as they pop up.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Nintendo also noted during the Direct how it would have "more Kirby Air Riders amiibo updates" to share in the future.</p>
<p>The same broadcast this week confirmed new amiibo for the Super Mario Galaxy bundle as well as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a>. Fortunately, the amiibo for these games are slightly <em>less</em> expensive. Samus and her new bike is priced at $40, while standalone versions of Samus and Slyux are $30 each. As for the Galaxy amiibo (Mario &amp; Rosalina), they'll be $40 each.</p>

<p>In case you missed it during the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> announcement, Rosalina's Storybook will be getting a physical release.</p>
<p>This product is based on the same storybook featured in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> and will be available via the My Nintendo Store website. The US store has now confirmed it will be priced at $24.99 (or your regional equivalent) and arrives later this year on 25th November 2025.</p>
<p>Nintendo has teamed up with Dark Horse Books to release this "beautiful hardcover volume". It's worth noting that the new pages featured in the upcoming releases <em>won't</em> be included in the physical print. Here's the official fine print about this from the latest Direct broadcast:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rosalina's Storybook does not include newly added pages from the Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 games."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here's the official description, along with another look:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our story begins a very, very long time ago with a young girl who spotted a rusted spaceship holding a small star child, Luma.</p>
<p>This is the tale of that young girl and that star child going on a great journey together, searching for one thing and finding something else altogether. This is the tale of Rosalina and the Lumas and the secret of their special bond.</p>
<p>Featuring the actual art and story from Super Mario Galaxy, this book will be treasured by fans whether they’ve spent many hours with the game or are brand new to the world of Rosalina and the Lumas. Arriving November 25, 2025, Dark Horse Books and Nintendo present Rosalina’s Storybook —now displayed in a beautiful hardcover volume.</p>

<p>Yes, just months after the game's initial release on the Switch 2, DK's latest outing has now been bolstered with some smashing new content, and it's available right now. As part of the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush</a>, Nintendo has also bumped the base game up to Version 2.0.0.</p>
<p>We've got the full patch notes here, which go into a little more detail about the changes. This is the second update for the title, which also makes "several other changes" to improve the overall gameplay experience. Here's the rundown:</p>
<h2>Latest update: Ver. 2.0.0 (Released September 12, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the paid DLC DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush.
<ul>
<li>If you have not cleared the main game yet, you can go to DK Island by talking to Squawks at the Racing Layer.</li>
<li>If you have cleared the main game, you can go to DK Island by striking the Warp Gong after hearing about the “Bananza Rehearsal” from the Elder.</li>
<li>After reaching DK Island, you can play Emerald Rush by talking to Void Kong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The number of Banandium Chips that can be stored has been increased from 9,999 to 99,999.</li>
<li>Several other changes have been made and issues addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>As mentioned, even if you haven't cleared the "main game" just yet, you can still go to this island by interacting with Squawks on the Racing Layer. Of course, it's paid content, so you'll need to fork out $19.99 / £16.99 (or your regional equivalent) before you can access it.</p>
<p>And if you are still unsure about this game, there's now a Switch 2 demo you can download from the Nintendo eShop.</p>

                <p>By the end of this weekend, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a> is probably going to be one of the biggest launches of 2025. It hasn't gone off without a hitch, however. The game has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-is-getting-clobbered-on-steam-with-negative-reviews/1100-6534683/" data-ref-id="1100-6534683">hit hard by negative reviews on Steam over its PC optimization</a>. Now, Borderlands 4 has been accused of including spyware by some vocal fans online. Those rumors have been so pervasive that Borderlands 4 publisher Take-Two Interactive has already shared a statement denying them.</p><p>The issue at hand involves the kernel-level anti-cheat in Borderlands 4, which some have accused of being modified to collect data about players. Borderlands 4's updated terms of service was also presented as evidence that the game was being used to spy on players, hence the response from Take-Two.</p><p>"Take-Two does not use spyware in its games," wrote a company spokesperson on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1285190/discussions/1/596285654384685820/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>. "Take-Two's Privacy Policy applies to all labels, studios, games, and services across all media and platform types such as console, PC, mobile app, and website. The Privacy Policy identifies the data activities that may be collected, but this does not mean that every example is collected in each game or service."</p><p>The company acknowledges that it does collect information about users "to deliver its services to players," including personalization and compatibility options. Take-Two's position is that it discloses this info in the terms of service to be transparent with fans.</p><p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/gearbox-responds-to-worries-about-borderlands-4s-terms-of-service-take-two-does-not-use-spyware-in-its-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> PC Gamer</a> noted that the latest furor over spyware stemmed from "a misleading YouTube video prompting fans to play a game of telephone about the changes to the EULA over Reddit and forum threads, and a bout of short-lived Steam review bombing that hasn't accomplished much of anything."</p><p>Similar concerns about older games from the company <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gearbox-says-take-two-does-not-use-spyware-in-its-games-as-borderlands-review-bombing-continues?_gl=1*1gflm7s*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTc5NjUxMTE1OC4xNzU3NzI0ODE5*_ga_736S6FVMCL*czE3NTc3MjQ4MTgkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTc3MjQ4MTgkajYwJGwwJGgw*_ga_BBZCZLHBF6*czE3NTc3MjQ4MzQkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTc3MjQ4MzQkajYwJGwwJGgw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">surfaced earlier this summer</a>, which essentially received the same response from Take-Two as the latest allegations. The company also asserted that its updated terms allow it to go after "abusive mods" that don't respect the intellectual property of the company, while allowing single-player non-commercial mods to be distributed freely among fans.</p><p>Gearbox has shared <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/nvidia-optimization/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">links for optimizing NVIDIA card graphics settings</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1285190/discussions/2/596285654384682506/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a PC troubleshooting guide</a> for anyone having trouble running the game.

            <title><![CDATA[NHL 26 Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/nhl-26-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nhl-26-review.1297008/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It might not have the audience of football, baseball, or soccer, but to its proud fans there’s something truly special about hockey. It’s the cold air of the arena, the weight of the puck against your stick, and the feel as your skate glides across the surface of the ice. To their credit, the developers at EA Vancouver seem to get all of that, and it’s led them to create an enjoyable NHL simulation that has earned a dedicated audience. That dedication, however, has increasingly been tested in recent years as the series has failed to truly move forward in any meaningful way. EA Sports NHL 26 continues this dynamic with a game that nails most of the elements that make hockey special, but it never feels like the kind of significant jump over what’s come before that might make buying yet another version exciting rather than obligatory. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played a hockey game from EA at any point over the last few years, you have a good idea of what to expect from NHL 26. The lynchpin of the series is Franchise mode, which allows you to take the team of your choosing on a season-long quest to hoist the Stanley Cup. It’s basically the default mode, showcasing what the series is best known for and it still does that all pretty well. Individual games are fast, the controls are intuitive, and EA Vancouver has spent years refining a formula that mostly works. Granted, there are very few other hockey games available right now, and those that do exist don’t have the official NHL players or teams; that lack of competition might be what leads the developers to play things so safe and leave so much unchanged year to year. To be fair, it’s hard to fault them too much for not fixing what isn’t broken. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, this situation has created an unfortunate trend for the series that’s made each year’s version feel like baby steps, and NHL 26 continues to focus more on smaller tweaks than on substantial changes. As a result, it’s easy to miss adjustments made beyond mirroring the big roster changes we’ve seen over the offseason, such as Mitch Marner being on the Golden Knights after leaving the Leafs, and Matt Dumba appearing on the Penguins following his Dallas departure. As of this writing, EA Vancouver seems to have done a pretty good job making sure everything is up to date, including representing the Utah Mammoth with their new name, uniforms, and arena (following a season under the temporary “Utah Hockey Club” label). Lastly, PWHL has been updated to add the women’s league’s two new teams from the 2025-2026 season, though that mode feels completely unchanged beyond that. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s easy to miss adjustments made beyond mirroring the big roster changes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Franchise mode seems to be the most popular single-player mode in EA’s yearly NHL games, I really enjoy the customization options and the general approach to the sport found in the narrowed focus of Be a Pro. As someone that grew up playing hockey, there’s something that feels really authentic about focusing on controlling an individual player. There’s a greater need to consider line changes, playing in position, and setting up CPU-controlled characters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I was pleased to find that some of the bigger changes this year can be found here, but I’ve found that they aren’t all positive. Some of the biggest improvements come from cutting out what hasn’t worked: NHL 26 has finally dropped the often-mocked and frequently repeated “pricey pond hockey” opening scene that appeared across multiple games. You’ll no longer see the same repeated cinematic sequence with an agent talking about how you’re so passionate about hockey that you’re playing pond pick-up with a bunch of kids. Instead, you’re dropped right into the player maker. And mercifully, EA has also scaled back on the frequent coach meetings from past Be a Pro modes, but the catch is that the replacement might be even more monotonous: press conferences. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>NHL 26 has finally dropped the often-mocked and frequently repeated “pricey pond hockey” opening.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea of taking part in press conferences is actually kind of neat, and the initial questions help to shape your on-ice personality. The hockey press will ask questions like your approach to free agency, and choosing one option will improve your likeability with teammates, while the other helps your brand. However, the execution gets dull fast once you’ve taken part in several in a row. That might be a little too real: I’ve attended real-life NHL press conferences, and the questions from sports journalists really can be as groan-inducing as they are here sometimes. How do I feel  about not winning the division? How do you think?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">NHL 26 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, the impact from press conference responses on player stats often feels unfair. At one press conference, I was asked about modeling my career around a specific player, with multiple options to choose from. I apparently picked the wrong one, and it immediately led to a decrease in my brand stat. Even worse, NHL 26 doesn’t always make it clear what answers will have a negative impact on your brand or the feelings of management, so a seemingly innocuous response can have an unforeseeable consequence. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A smart change, though, has made NHL’s most intimidating mode more approachable for me. Putting together a team built out of NHL greats in Hockey Ultimate Team (HUT) takes a lot of time and effort. It can also take some real currency, though you are awarded with daily freebies that can help shape a decent team without paying extra. I still don’t necessarily want to take my team up against the passionate players who dominate online with a combination of skill and large wallets, though; sometimes you want to play without the pressure of competing with real people. So it’s a welcome change that for NHL 26, EA has replaced last year’s HUT Squad Battles with a new offline Cup Chase mode that offers a chance to build up a team and try them out in a full single-player campaign with multiple difficulty levels. I was grateful to have the chance to jump into games using my custom team without having to worry about getting schooled by people fiercely protecting their online rankings. And anybody that wants to do so can take that team online just as they normally would in HUT. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I was grateful to have the chance to jump into games using my custom team without having to worry about getting schooled by people fiercely protecting their online rankings.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Online or off, though, NHL is feeling increasingly behind the annual sports game pack graphically. That’s despite the fact that last year, NHL 25 marked the first game in the series to abandon PS4 and Xbox One and shift focus to current platforms. But NHL 26 still doesn’t feel like it’s really pushing PS5 and Xbox Series X|S to the fullest. The ice itself pops on the screen nicely, and there are lots of impressive details, including wear to the surface as a game progresses, but just about everywhere else is a letdown. The character models are rough, with players, coaches, and fans often looking pretty ugly relative to what we’ve seen in other recent sports games. There are also some weird choices and oversights that are holdovers from past games, like team logos getting cut off on specific screens. Crowd reactions also feel stuck in the past, with awkward celebrations that would be right at home on PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, I found the audio much more enjoyable. The menus have some great new songs this year, including tracks from groups like Wet Leg and The Hives. I never would have thought of “Catch These Fists” as a hockey song, but it fits undeniably well. In the games themselves, EA Vancouver continues to replicate the authentic sounds of each rink, with team-specific cheers and organ sounds. The commentary is also pretty faithful to the current NHL viewing experience; it feels like watching a nationally televised game, offering the same chatty play-by-play that you’d expect to hear on TNT. That said, I was grateful for the option to toggle it off when it got repetitive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Possibly the worst audio in NHL 26 belongs to Macklin Celebrini, though. The San Jose Sharks forward can be heard offering career advice in Be a Pro mode, and it’s clear not all hockey players are cut out for acting.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">NHL 26 is a competent entry in the series from EA Vancouver, even if it doesn’t do enough to stand out either from past years or other sports games. It still plays well enough, and after all these years there’s still something exciting about banking a goal in, or setting up the perfect pass. I rarely found myself unhappy with the actual gameplay, no matter how familiar it felt. On top of these things that worked well before, there are some small improvements that are welcome, like enjoying our collections of Ultimate Team players offline. At the same time, this series has stagnated visually, with relatively ugly players and crowds contrasted against beautiful hockey rinks. NHL 26 has left me feeling like I’ve just watched a 6-5 overtime win in April when my team has already been eliminated from playoff contention: there’s enjoyment to be had, but I can’t help but hope they get off to a better start next year.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/nhl-26-review]]></content:encoded>

However, LocalThunk is still only one man and he's revealed that his previously promised Balatro 1.1 update will not be arriving this year.</p><p>LocalThunk explained the reasons for the delay in <a href="https://localthunk.com/blog/im-slow" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a lengthy message on his official site</a>, but it ultimately boils down to the name of his post: "I'm Slow." He apologized to players for the delay before expressing his desire to avoid repeating the crunch mode of 12-hour days he put in when Balatro was approaching launch and stated that he prefers to treat the work as a hobby rather than a job.</p><p>"I still love drawing my silly jokers," wrote LocalThunk. "I carry around a notebook that is now teeming with ideas to implement or test in the game, and thankfully I still consider this my hobby, but the prospect of rushing the work and going back into crunch mode to get it out this year just felt terrible. I am working slowly, but I like it that way. I love getting sucked into rabbit holes and I don't like trying to force things creatively."</p><p>LocalThunk noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatro-creator-only-just-recently-100-completed-his-own-game/1100-6532649/" data-ref-id="1100-6532649">he only recently reached 100% of the achievements</a> in his own game, which made him excited about the prospect of doing it again after the 1.1 update is complete.

It's available in PS5, Switch 2, Switch, and Xbox Series X versions.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is a ground-up remake of the original PS1 version of Dragon Quest VII that launched in 2000. This is actually the second remake of the sprawling console JRPG; it was also remade for the Nintendo 3DS in 2016. However, Reimagined looks to be an even bigger overhaul of the game, featuring a gorgeous new artstyle reminiscent of sculpted figurines that resembles the FMV cutscenes of the PS1 version. It also maintains the top-down viewpoint of the PS1 version. Based on what we've seen so far, the new visual style looks to be a great fit for the late Akira Toryiama's classic character and monster designs.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the announcement trailer and the game's official website, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined will also make notable changes to the story and gameplay. While the exact changes to the story have not been detailed, Square Enix says the narrative has been "reworked to be pacier and more accessible to players," which isn't surprising, considering the PS1 and 3DS versions are notoriously large games that can easily take over 100 hours just to complete the main storyline.</p><p dir="ltr">On the gameplay side, Reimagined maintains the turn-based battles of the original game, with the option to increase battle speed or turn on auto-battling. Like the 3DS version, Reimagined will let players see monster encounters on the field, and you'll automatically defeat low-level enemies without having to enter combat. The game will also feature a reworked class system that lets party members select two classes at once, as well as tweaks and updates to each of the various vocations.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined isn't the only upcoming Dragon Quest remake. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F2NZ8LKV,B0F2P6LNLM,B0F2NX9G77&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake</a> also launches on PS5, Xbox, Switch 2, Switch, and PC on October 30. Preorders are available for $60 on al platforms. The game will feature enhanced versions of the first two Dragon Quest games from the 1980s with all-new graphics, gameplay updates, and even new content. The new HD-2D version follows up a similar <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D71SHR5B,B0D71JQXR4,B0D71HX7PY&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HD-2D remake for Dragon Quest 3</a> that launched last year on all consoles, and recently got a Switch 2 Edition upgrade that increases performance on Nintendo's new handheld. Eventually, we'll hopefully hear more about the long-awaited Dragon Quest 12, but these remakes of classic entries in the series will keep fans busy until then.</p><h2 dir="ltr">More Dragon Quest remake deals</h2><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-console-bundle-pokemon-legends-z-a-preorder/1100-6533331/">Nintendo Switch 2 Pokemon Console Bundle Is Finally Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-game-amiibo-preorder-buying-guide-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530754/">Metroid Prime 4 And Samus Amiibo Preorders Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-joyful-dualsense-limited-edition-ps5-controller-2025-preorder-guide/1100-6534678/">Astro Bot Joyful DualSense Limited Edition Controller Preorders Are Live</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcade1up-classic-special-edition-arcade-machines-cheapest-standing-cabinet-2025/1100-6534472/">Check Out Arcade1Up's Budget-Friendly Mortal Kombat And Pac-Man Arcade Cabinets At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-6-film-steelbook-library-4k-blu-ray-collection-in-stock-at-walmart-september-9/1100-6530389/">James Bond 6-Film Steelbook Library 4K Blu-Ray Collection In Stock At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/walmart-bricktember-exclusive-lego-bundle-deals-september-2025/1100-6534392/">Walmart Has Exclusive Lego Bundles This Month: Spider-Man, Star Wars, Disney, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-tactical-edition-free-dlc-collectors-edition-restock-buying-guide/1100-6524133/">Metal Gear Solid Delta Collector's Edition Restocked At Amazon (September 2)</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-controller-nintendo-switch-2-recommendation/1100-6533157/">8BitDo Pro 3 Controller For Switch 2 Gets First Price Cut, But It Won't Be Available For Long</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/following-%E2%80%98recent-events-%E2%80%99-mods-lock-helldivers-subreddit-while-helldivers-2-stays-open.1296987/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Due to what they call “recent events,” the moderators of the r/Helldivers subreddit have temporarily closed the community. Meanwhile, the moderators of r/Helldivers2 have decided to keep theirs open.</p><p>At around 11:30 eastern, the moderators of r/Helldivers, which has 1.2 million members, locked the community, meaning that moderator approval is required for all new posts and all new comments on posts. They pinned a message to the subreddit explaining the decision.</p><p>“Due to recent events and the high amount of posts about the topic, we will be locking the subreddit temporarily. We're aware of what happened, our modteam doesn't condone it,”<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nf6g7e/rhelldivers_is_locked_temporarily_requests_to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the post reads.</a> “In any case, posts and discussions about it are against this sub's rules regarding real-world political discussions.”</p><p>Although they don’t specifically reference the killing of Charlie Kirk, that is the only recent event that would require condemnation from the moderation team of r/Helldivers. The alleged killer engraved one of his shell casings with the phrase “Hey fascist! Catch!” and then arrows pointing up, right, and three arrows pointing down. Those arrows are the inputs needed to<a href="https://aftermath.site/tyler-robinson-journalism-wsj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> call in the 500kg Eagle bomb in the game <em>Helldivers 2</em></a>.</p><p>There haven’t been any new posts in the r/Helldivers subreddit since 11:15 am ET. Aftermath has reached out to the moderators of r/Helldivers for comment, but they did not reply in time for publication.</p><p>By contrast, the comparatively smaller r/Helldivers2 community—boasting only 318,000 members—have not only kept the community open, but the mods have used <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/helldivers2/comments/1nf5sxh/damn_not_for_nothing_but_its_gonna_be_weird_to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a community member’s post</a> about the potential weirdness of having a <em>Helldivers 2</em> tattoo as a “megathread” for discussion on the killing of Charlie Kirk. Megathreads are used by Reddit moderators to keep conversations contained to one post, rather than let their communities be overrun with dozens of posts on the topic. People are allowed to discuss the shooting of Charlie Kirk and its connection to <em>Helldivers</em> <em>2</em>, but in the designated megathread only.</p><p>“Locking it down isn't managed democracy. People can have THIS outlet. It's contained here.&nbsp; You have a place to go and discuss that fine. 5000 places with 2 comments, nope,” wrote one moderator. “Being able to have the conversation is important. It happened for a reason. Unprecedented times etc.”</p><p>Responding to another user asking if today was a weird day to be a r/Helldivers2 moderator, they said it wasn’t anything they couldn’t handle.</p><p>“Community is necessary because of events like this. If we as people spent more time learning about each other and overcoming our differences instead of bickering we might actually achieve equity and not just equality,” the moderator wrote. “As Helldivers it's our responsibility to keep those we love and are sworn to protect safe from outside evils. Sometimes those evils exist within our own society. This is just another dive in a long long history of dives.”</p><p>Aftermath also reached out to the moderators of r/Helldivers2 for comment, but they did not respond in time for publication.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-charlie-kirk-death-streamers"><h3>Why Republicans Needed Charlie Kirk</h3></a><p>"The purpose of Charlie Kirk [was] to conceal from the Republican base what their policies actually are"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lego-death-star-9000-pieces"><h3>Deahas thed Star</h3></a><p>Dorth Stor?

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-3-looks-set-to-level-up-from-nioh-1-and-2-ign-first</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nioh-3-looks-set-to-level-up-from-nioh-1-and-2-%E2%80%93-ign-first.1296957/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/12/ign-first-nioh3-3-exclusivehandson-banner-1757639293167.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With just two games, the Nioh series has already cemented its place among the best of the soulslike genre, thanks to its uniquely fast-paced action, deeply customizable builds and playstyles, thrilling boss battles, and a certain fluidity to its combat that feels like Team Ninja’s own signature touch. Based on my five hours of hands-on time with a new preview build, the upcoming third installment is shaping up to continue that trend of excellence, staying true to the core of what has always made the series so successful, but shaking up just enough to challenge veteran players to rethink how they approach its many difficult combat encounters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like Nioh 2, Nioh 3 is shaping up to be an iterative sequel that doesn’t change much about the core systems that were established in Nioh 1; instead adding brand new layers on top of that core to reinvigorate the combat system and force players to engage with it differently. Nioh 2 did this by adding in burst counters and yokai shifts, and Nioh 3 does this primarily by giving the player two styles that they can shift between on the fly: Samurai and Ninja style. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When I first played Nioh 3, back when it was offered up as a limited time demo, I was a little unsure of how I felt about this split. Samurai style, after all, is basically just the way you’d normally play Nioh, minus the ability to use Onmyo Magic; while Ninja Style just felt like a much faster and DPS oriented stance that comes with the substantial drawbacks of no longer being able to use Ki Pulses to regain your stamina, and no longer having the three sword stances to switch between, which are both two staples of Nioh’s gameplay. Not to mention that having two different styles means nearly twice as much inventory management, since they both have their own completely separate sets of gear, and if there’s one game series that already has more than enough inventory and loot management, it’s Nioh. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>During my playtime, something clicked with me with regards to Samurai and Ninja style.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While loot remains an issue, during my playtime, something clicked with me with regards to Samurai and Ninja style. Not only did I gain an understanding of what each style was good for and when I should swap to one versus continuing with the other, but more importantly, I got a grasp of the sheer amount of options that having two hot swappable styles each with their own equipment loadouts and skill trees brings to the table. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While in Samurai style, you of course have access to the three stances – high, medium, and low – and all of the skills that come from each of those stances. You also are able to to use Ki Pulses to restore spent stamina without having to wait for it to recharge, making it great for sustained offense where you’re able to kind of just plant your feet down and stand and fight against a tough enemy. There’s also a new Arts Proficiency Gauge that fills up as you deal damage and successfully guard, but decreases whenever you get hit. Once it’s full, you’re able to use a powered-up version of your heavy attack, which adds a nice little reward for playing well with a careful balance of offense and defense. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninja style on the other hand lets you go absolutely wild. Your dashes go crazy far and are super fast compared to the dodges in Samurai style; instead of stances, you’re able to equip up to three ninja tools; you’re able to very quickly dash to an enemy’s backside to deal extra damage; and most of the weapons take advantage of the fact that Nioh 3 adds a jump button, allowing you to even punctuate your ground combos with a jump cancel, letting you tag on even more damage with air combos. On top of all of this, for both styles, you also have your guardian spirit transformations, guardian spirit skills, Soul Core skills, it’s just a lot of tools to take with you into every battle. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, all of these added options in Ninja Style come at the aforementioned cost of not being able to use Ki Pulses to restore stamina, so I did find myself having to rein in my lust for aggression – it is still a stamina-driven soulslike after all – but I felt a level of creative freedom in combat expression that I typically feel in a good character action game, and I eagerly anticipate getting my hands on the full game and seeing what a high-level character can do once the skill trees start getting maxed out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Soul Cores also return in Nioh 3, but they’re a bit different this time around. They still appear as random drops from enemies and will let you use that enemy’s signature attack, just to give you yet another option when it comes to how you choose to dispatch your foes. However you have two choices of how to equip them. When you rest at a shrine, you can put them in your Onmyo Box in either the Yin or the Yang position. The Yin position is what I just talked about, you’ll gain some stat increases and the ability of the monster to use in combat. But if you place a core in the Yang position, you’ll instead be able to get spells and items added to your inventory that will refresh every time you rest at a shrine. One of the Soul Cores had a fairly underwhelming skill, but when I equipped it in a Yang slot, it gave me invisibility scrolls that I could use to sneak past tough enemies. It’s a wonderful change to an already excellent system, and I can’t wait to mess around more with it in the full version. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other big new tentpole feature for Nioh 3 is the addition of non-linear open field-type levels, complete with sidequests, a variety of points of interest with unique challenges and rewards, and wide open environments rife with opportunities for exploration. This is in contrast to Nioh’s typical linear levels with the occasional optional branches off the beaten path that ultimately loop back around. I got to experience one of these in my hands-on time – the frozen region of Kamigamo – and while Nioh 3 doesn’t seem to do anything surprising with its more open level design that hasn’t been done before, the shift was a refreshing change of pace. Right away, the first thing I did was a combat challenge called a Crucible Spike. This was a sealed-off combat arena with multiple waves of enemies that I had to defeat in order to proceed. Clearing the Crucible Spike improved my Spirit Force, which is a new resource that governs your usage of Spirit Skills, and also gained a new spirit skill for one of my guardian spirits. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Every time you complete one of these points of interest, your exploration level will increase, and each time it increases, you’ll get an extra bonus.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s really what makes me excited about these open field levels, because these Crucible Spikes, along with other types of points of interests, are strewn all over the map, the challenges are fun, and the rewards are great – which is all the incentive I need to seek them out. Every time you complete one of these points of interest, your exploration level will increase, and each time it increases, you’ll get an extra bonus, from more icons being revealed on your map to give you some direction on where to explore, you may get an added stat bonus while you’re in that specific area, or you may get skill points to spend on your Samurai or Ninja skill trees. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All in all, Nioh 3 is shaping up to be exactly the same kind of iterative step above its predecessor that Nioh 2 ended up being. The style switching between Samurai and Ninja is an excellent addition that adds new layers of depth to an already stacked combat system, and the new open fields offer up even more incentive to explore than ever before, with fun challenges, mini bosses, and secret treasures to discover in every corner. It all ran incredibly smoothly as well, making me forget for a moment that this game is still a ways off, with a planned release in early 2026. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-3-looks-set-to-level-up-from-nioh-1-and-2-ign-first]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/modder-injects-ai-dialogue-into-2002%E2%80%99s-animal-crossing-using-memory-hack.1296954/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>But discovering the addresses was only half the problem. When you talk to a villager in <em>Animal Crossing</em>, the game normally displays dialogue instantly. Calling an AI model over the Internet takes several seconds. Willison examined the code and found Fonseca's solution: a watch_dialogue() function that polls memory 10 times per second. When it detects a conversation starting, it immediately writes placeholder text: three dots with hidden pause commands between them, followed by a "Press A to continue" prompt.</p>
<p>"So the user gets a 'press A to continue' button and hopefully the LLM has finished by the time they press that button," Willison <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45195311">noted</a> in a Hacker News comment. While players watch dots appear and reach for the A button, the mod races to get a response from the AI model and translate it into the game's dialog format.</p>
<h2>Learning the game’s secret language</h2>
<p>Simply writing text to memory froze the game. <em>Animal Crossing</em> uses an encoded format with control codes that manage everything from text color to character emotions. A special prefix byte (0x7F) signals commands rather than characters. Without the proper end-of-conversation control code, the game waits forever.</p>
<p>"Think of it like HTML," Fonseca explains. "Your browser doesn't just display words; it interprets tags ... to make text bold." The decompilation community had documented these codes, allowing Fonseca to build encoder and decoder tools that translate between a human-readable format and the GameCube's expected byte sequences.</p>

<p>Initially, he tried using a single AI model to handle both creative writing and technical formatting. "The results were a mess," he notes. "The AI was trying to be a creative writer and a technical programmer simultaneously and was bad at both."</p>
<p>The solution: split the work between two models. A Writer AI creates dialogue using character sheets scraped from the <em>Animal Crossing</em> fan wiki. A Director AI then adds technical elements, including pauses, color changes, character expressions, and sound effects.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/vuciv/animal-crossing-llm-mod">code is available on GitHub</a>, though Fonseca warns it contains known bugs and has only been tested on macOS. The mod requires Python 3.8+, API keys for either Google Gemini or OpenAI, and Dolphin emulator. Have fun sticking it to the man—or the raccoon, as the case may be.</p>

In a briefing today, Utah governor Spencer Cox read aloud:</p><blockquote><p>Inscriptions on a fired casing read “notices bulges ‘O w O’ what’s this?” Inscriptions on the three unfired casings read “Hey fascist! Catch! Up arrow symbol, right arrow symbol, and three down arrow symbols.” A second unfired casing read “oh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao ciao ciao.” And a third unfired casing read “if you read this you are gay lmao.”</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><div><figure><p><iframe title="LIVE: Man arrested in connection with Charlie Kirk shooting" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CiS5wXfXiKs?start=278&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The first message, as noted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/politics/777313/charlie-kirks-alleged-killer-scratched-bullets-with-a-helldivers-combo-and-a-furry-sex-meme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a>, is a reference to<a href="https://x.com/knowyourmeme/status/1966509774452773219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a joke about furry roleplay</a>; the last is a joke that pretty much speaks for itself; and the third is a well-known anti-fascist song that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/us/tyler-robinson-bella-ciao-bullet.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a> claims was popularized by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juIcenNQWLs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix series</a> “Money Heist” and&nbsp; <em>Far Cry 6,</em> while The Verge notes that it has appeared in <em>Hearts of Iron IV</em> and a <em>Helldivers 2</em> mod. That <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/helldivers-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Helldivers</em></a><em> </em>connection is salient because of the second casing, with the arrows: while three downward-slanting arrows is a long-standing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Arrows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-fascist symbol</a>, the up, right, and three downs combination is the code to drop <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s <a href="https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki/Eagle_500kg_Bomb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eagle 500kg bomb</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This would, of course, <a href="https://aftermath.site/united-healthcare-luigi-mangione" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not be the first time</a> video games have come up in <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">connection</a> with real-world violence. It wouldn’t even be the first time this week; on Wednesday, RFK <a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/rfk-mass-shootings-video-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that “there could be connections with video games, with social media” and gun violence. Often in these situations, authorities and the public look to what video games a shooter played; it’s less common for a shooter to actively reference a specific video game, as the 2019 Christchurch shooter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/world/asia/new-zealand-shooting-brenton-tarrant.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seemingly facetiously</a> did with <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Spyro the Dragon</em> in a manifesto. <em>Helldivers 2</em> is a wildly popular game, though it’s more a deep cut for the mainstream than <em>Fortnite </em>is, and it’s made even less legible to those unfamiliar in light of its own <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/helldivers-2-anti-fascist-answer-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complex</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24093674/helldivers-2-discord-meta-role-play-fandom-joel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">politics</a>.</p><p>We’ll surely learn more about Robinson in the coming days, but what we have so far is an incoherent jumble of online references that don’t tell us much beyond the fact that he is a young person who knows about at least one video game and the internet; the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/who-tyler-robinson-charlie-kirk-suspect-814fd21f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a> reports he spent a lot of time online, though <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/charlie-kirk-shooting-suspect-identified-as-22-year-old-utah-man-tyler-robinson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a> notes that “Beyond [a] Discord account identified by [Governor] Cox, Robinson appears to have had virtually no online footprint that could be immediately identified in public or private databases.” The messages on the casings, taken together, largely read as weird, gruesomely-placed shitposts. Without knowing more about his motives, it’s hard to tell how seriously to take the seeming anti-fascist slant, or to draw any conclusions about why furries and <em>Helldivers 2</em> are part of it all. This obscuring of whatever sincerity might undergird Robinson’s actions is, too, a hallmark of online culture.</p><p>In the online circles I travel in, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ositanwanevu.com/post/3lynnrbq5fk27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/swin24.bsky.social/post/3lynlyhsir225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">journalists</a> have pointed out how this moment highlights the need for reporters and desks dedicated to video games and online culture. It’s a call that hits particularly close to home for me, who, along with Nathan, staffed The Washington Post’s gaming desk until it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/washington-post-launcher-layoffs-giant-bomb-games-media-1850025471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down</a> in 2023. In the time before and since, we’ve seen multiple gaming outlets <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-has-been-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-layoffs-sale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold</a>, or <a href="https://kotaku.com/fanbyte-website-layoffs-tencent-staff-g4tv-future-1849540893" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gutted</a>, with many that remain being forced to <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-gamurs-group-games-journalism-escapist-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">churn out</a> high volume, SEO-friendly copy for numbers-focused <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-labor-lawsuit-hassan-youssef-digital-media-sweat-shop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">owners</a> instead of the journalism and cultural analysis that were once, at least for a brief moment, common. The remaining journalists best suited to meet this moment, to help readers flooded with divisive rhetoric and misinformation, are facing an uphill battle to do that work.&nbsp;</p><p>A healthy media ecosystem, one actually interested in helping readers, would see mainstream outlets staffed with writers knowledgeable in online culture. It would see plenty of specialized publications with the resources and owner willingness to do more than write to SEO. But that would also be an ecosystem that didn’t produce the Wall Street Journal’s absurd leap to “transgender ideology,” a phrase that is its own kind of right-wing meme, though one that’s spread far beyond the internet into the mouths of powerful people like the drafters of <a href="https://www.aclu.org/trump-on-lgbtq-rights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project 2025</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/trump-executive-order-ban-trans-women-sports-rcna190767" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">President Trump</a>.

It’s hard to read the WSJ’s speed to parrot such talking points as anything other than helping spread that message, though one would hope unintentionally. But just as unfamiliar writers can leap to blame video games or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/18/technology/video-games-extremism.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord</a>, they can leap to blame trans people too.&nbsp;</p><p>I can’t say if there are fewer trans reporters than games reporters out there (some, like me, are both), but there certainly aren’t a lot of either anymore, especially at the outlets with the most reach. <a href="https://www.404media.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Independent</a> <a href="https://www.assignedmedia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outlets</a> and the <a href="https://www.wired.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remaining</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mainstream</a> ones do great work, but they can only do so much, especially when facing off against powerful figures and their fanbases. And both of these lacks highlight the gap between so many of our news outlets and the real world that our readers live in and need to know about, especially in complex situations like today's.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-charlie-kirk-death-streamers"><h3>Why Republicans Needed Charlie Kirk</h3></a><p>"The purpose of Charlie Kirk [was] to conceal from the Republican base what their policies actually are"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lego-death-star-9000-pieces"><h3>Deahas thed Star</h3></a><p>Dorth Stor?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Charlie Kirk made a lot of people mad, and then he <a href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-political-violence-new-york-times-eulogy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">died</a>. The first part almost certainly contributed to the second. But it’s unlikely that right-wing content creators and political commentators will be backing away from this ledge anytime soon. After all, the broader, ragebait-driven Republican apparatus relies on them. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we discuss the purpose Charlie Kirk served.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by two popular political streamers, <a href="https://x.com/Mike_from_PA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MikeFromPA</a> and <a href="https://x.com/DenimsTV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Denims</a>, to discuss how the far-right social media landscape created and ultimately destroyed Charlie Kirk. How do content creation ecosystems on the right and left differ, and why does the political right uplift – and fund – extreme voices like Kirk while the political left <a href="https://aftermath.site/cuomos-latest-strategy-to-resuscitate-his-flatlining-campaign-go-after-zohran-mamdani-for-associating-with-a-twitch-streamer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">distances itself from outspokenly leftist figures like Hasan Piker,</a> despite their success?&nbsp;</p><p>Why is mainstream media <a href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-political-violence-new-york-times-eulogy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying to convince us that we should feel bad</a> that someone who spent their life regularly advocating for violence against marginalized groups met a violent end? And how, generally, can we combat a right-wing online apparatus rooted in bad faith, that will condemn violence out of one side of its mouth and then cry for vengeance from the other? Finally, the most important (listener-submitted) question: Should the United States break up?</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can become influential enough to prevent Nathan from <a href="https://aftermath.site/bluesky-charlie-kirk-dead-rest-in-piss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">getting banned on Bluesky</a> again.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Denims: </strong>To be clear, there is a large majority of Republicans and people who vote red that are full-blown racists, and there’s no saving those people. If you’re voting for Trump, and you’re like “Yes, I want my white ethnostate,” we’re not saving you. You know what you want, and it’s not good for you either, but whatever. But I think that there are also – More Perfect Union, the work that they do, they show a lot of that stuff – people who voted for Trump that are like “Why is my life worse now? What did I do wrong?”&nbsp;</p><p>Or even look at after the CEO of United Healthcare was killed. Ben Shapiro tried, Steven Crowded tried, God-knows-who-else tried to be like “Left wing violence is out of control,” and their comments sections were just filled with right wingers going “No, healthcare is a joke in this country. I’m not for violence, but I’m not gonna cry for the CEO of a healthcare company.” And this is from right wingers, people who voted for Trump.</p><p>The idea that we can’t reach anyone is silly. If you can debate one of the people who has the biggest pull for a political influencer online, you can convince some of these people that the methods the Republicans are using are not gonna make their lives better.</p><p><strong>MikeFromPA: </strong>Something that I say a lot is that the purpose of Charlie Kirk [was] to conceal from the Republican base what their policies actually are – and to distract them with culture war slop. If you look at positions on single-payer healthcare, you’ll see, like, 30 percent support, 25 percent, 35 percent support among Republicans for it. And it’s like, wait, you support a minimum wage increase, you support Medicare For All, you support raising taxes on the rich. Why the fuck are you a Republican?&nbsp;</p><p>It’s an understanding that politics is not about people looking at a list of policies and then picking them and going “I took a test online, and it says I should support Bernie Sanders. I’m voting for him!” It is a vibe. It is a social, political, cultural milieu. It is your material interests, whether you have any class consciousness. Are you organized in a union? And even then, people who are unions will vote against their union recommendation because of, like, guns or something.&nbsp;</p><p>That is the main project of these right wing debaters and entertainers: to create an uncertainty and a cloud around the Republican party where you fill in the blanks about what you think the Republican party is. They have a few cultural touchstones that they will use, and they’re all, like, abortion, guns, and trans issues. It’s not based on your life or your material interests.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Anything that will improve your life, especially.</p><p><strong>MikeFromPA:</strong> Exactly. And maybe it’ll cut your taxes, because that sounds real to people. We all pay taxes, so if somebody says “I’m gonna cut your taxes,” that feels real to you. But “I’m gonna cut this program in the government,” you may not even know that’s actually something you rely on. That takes a certain extremely high level of political knowledge to get.

This exclusive card is virtually identical to the $120 SanDisk model, but it's sold for only $78 exclusively at Walmart.</p><p>Age of Calamity is the third game in Koei Tecmo's Dynasty Warriors and Zelda crossover series. Like the previous two entries, Age of Imprisonment is a hack-and-slash action game that can be played solo or cooperatively with another player. It features a large cast of playable characters, led by Princess Zelda. This means that the two most recent Legend of Zelda games have actually starred Zelda. Last year, the heroine was the lead protagonist in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Echoes-Wisdom-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0D8SDKKVW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, the first mainline entry led by any character beyond Link.</p><p>Just as Age of Calamity served as a prequel to Breath of the Wild, Age of Imprisonment takes place before the events depicted in Tears of the Kingdom. The story revolves around Demon King Ganondorf's previous attempt to take control of Hyrule. This invasion is referenced in Tears of the Kingdom, and now fans will get to see how it all went down. Other playable characters beyond Zelda include King Rauru, Mineru, and other Sages. Most importantly, you can play as a Korok.</p><p>Age of Imprisonment supports GameShare on Switch 2, so you can play with a friend over local wireless with only one copy of the game. All Zelda Amiibo figures are compatible with the new game. Scanning Amiibo figures will drop crafting materials and other items.</p><p>If you haven't played Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, it's worth noting that anyone with a save file on their console will get the High Guard's Claymore weapon in Age of Imprisonment. You'll also get the High Guard's Sword if you have a Tears of the Kingdom save file.</p><h2>Hyrule Warriors and Zelda Games for Switch 1/2</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4567171-zeldahyrulewarriorsgames.png" data-ref-id="1300-4567171" data-ratio="0.51181818181818" data-width="1100" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4567171-zeldahyrulewarriorsgames.png" data-ref-id="1300-4567171"></a><figcaption>Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition / Tears of the Kingdom Switch 2 Edition / Age of Calamity</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4567171-zeldahyrulewarriorsgames.png"></figure><p>If you want to catch up or revisit the previous Hyrule Warriors games ahead of Age of Imprisonment's release, Woot has physical editions of Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition and Age of Calamity for $50 each.

Preorders actually opened at the same time. Many fans had an Amazon preorder for nearly <em>eight </em>years before the retailer finally canceled all existing orders earlier this year. Prime 4 was originally being developed by Bandai Namco, but the project was scrapped and restarted in 2019 by Retro Studios. The Nintendo subsidiary developed the previous three Prime games, and Beyond is led by the original producer Kensuke Tanabe. Gameplay footage shown so far has looked very promising.</p><p dir="ltr">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond takes place after the events of Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, though how far after remains unclear. What we do know is that it will see Samus explore an all-new planet, Viewros, populated by a new musical alien race called____ who have called on Samus to save the planet from an unknown threa. To aid in her adventure, the ____ imbue Samus with all-new psychic powers that will allow her to interface with the strange ruins and artifacts on Viewros and defend herself against the deadly creatures that live there.</p><p dir="ltr">As confirmed in an earlier gameplay trailer, Samus' enigmatic rival, Sylux, will also appear and likely play a pivotable role in the storyline. Gameplay footage shown so far has looked very promising, and fans don't have to wait much longer to explore the planet of Viewros through Samus' iconic visor.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">If you're looking to play earlier Metroid Prime games before the Beyond arrives, unfortunately, the long-rumored Metroid Prime Trilogy for Switch never materialized. But you can at least play the gorgeous 2023 remaster of the original GameCube hit. Metroid Prime Remastered is a brilliant modernization of the 2002 classic. You can snag the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Test-3-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B09YZNRQ7S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">physical edition for Nintendo Switch for $40</a> at Amazon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kobold Press' most recent crowdfunding campaign is shaping up to be a bona fide success. Their recent <em>Northlands</em> Kickstarter is set to bring some Viking-themed adventure full of gods and giants to the most recent edition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>

<h2>The <em>Northlands</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>According to the campaign page, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/deepmagic/northlands-norse-adventures-for-dandd-2024-and-tov/description" rel="nofollow"><em>Northlands</em></a> Kickstarter provides adventures to the latest edition of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> full of looting, runes, and horrific monsters themed around the Saga of Ragnarok. The project is for two books. The <em>Northlands Worldbook</em> is packed with new monsters, magic items, and player options. The <em>Northlands Sagas</em> book contains 11 prewritten adventures.</p>

One is designed for Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024. The other is designed for Kobold Press' own 5e-inspired heroic fantasy TTRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/tales-of-valiant-players-guide-2-graces-kickstarter-today" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Tales of the Valiant</em></a>.

The PlayStation version has even longer completion times. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game is a traditional single-player JRPG that has your unnamed character and a team of adventurers sailing around, traversing islands, and completing quests to help people out on each one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the art, Square Enix wrote in its announcement, “The character designs, originally crafted by world-renowned manga artist Akira Toriyama, have been reimagined into a charming 3D art style using dolls actually created in the real world.” That’s wild. The graphics look great, though, almost toy-like in that Link’s Awakening remake sort of way.</p><p id="more-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More preorder guides">Other Preorder Guides</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Feel free to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-september-2025-live-updates-everything-announced">everything else announced during today's Nintendo Direct</a>, including a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-galaxy-2-for-nintendo-switch-where-to-buy">new Super Mario Galaxy bundle</a> for Nintendo Switch. </p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">007 First Light Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Battlefield 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-where-to-buy">Borderlands 4 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-clair-obscur-expedition-33-mirror-edition-ps5-xbox-amazon-exclusive">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Mirror Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Ghost of Yotei Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-preorders">Kirby Air Riders Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch">Pokemon Legends Z-A Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-story-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-galaxy-2-for-nintendo-switch-where-to-buy">Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-switch-ps5-pc">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

<p>It's been a busy day thanks to Nintendo's huge hour-long Direct, but the Japanese broadcast still managed to have a surprise in store for us — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mega_man_star_force_legacy_collection">Mega Man Star Force: Legacy Collection</a>.</p>
<p>Coming to Switch in 2026, Capcom announced the collection via the Japanese showcase, but also dropped an English trailer, confirming we'd be seeing the remastered set in the West in 2026. The game will also be at this year's Tokyo Game Show.<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mega_man_star_force"><br></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mega_man_star_force">Mega Man Star Force</a> is a subseries of RPGs that launched on the DS between 2007 and 2009, to coincide with the Blue Bomber's 20th anniversary.</p>
<p>And, in this collection, all three games are included — Mega Man Star Force, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mega_man_star_force_2">Mega Man Star Force 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mega_man_star_force_3">Mega Man Star Force 3</a>, along with their respective additional versions. So, let's break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mega Man Star Force Leo</li>
<li>Mega Man Star Force Dragon</li>
<li>Mega Man Star Force Pegasus</li>
<li>Mega Man Star Force 2 ZerkerxNinja</li>
<li>Mega Man Star Force 2 ZerkerxSamurai</li>
<li>Mega Man Star Force 3 Black Ace</li>
<li>Mega Man Star Force 3 Red Joker</li>
</ul>
<p>These games continue to evolve the gameplay from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mega_man_battle_network_legacy_collection">Mega Man Battle Network</a>, though back in the day, many critics thought the newer titles didn't go far enough.</p>
<p>You can check out more details on the <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/megaman/starforce/en-us/">collection's official website</a>, but colour us surprised by the announcement!</p>

			<p>With <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-charting-a-new-course/">Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader</a>, renowned cRPG developer Owlcat Games proved it has everything needed to tackle a sprawling adventure set in the vast universe created by Games Workshop, beyond having the chops to adapt tabletop RPGs into engaging cRPGs, as already shown in previous games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-depth-beyond-all-measure/">Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</a>, especially. Not content with having upped their game with their title set in the Warhammer 40K universe, Owlcast Games is ready to the return to the Imperium with another adaptation of a tabletop RPG,<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/warhammer-40k-dark-heresy/"> Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</a>, which promises to be the best game to date from the developer.</p>



<p>During last month's <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom-2025/">Gamescom</a>, I had the chance to attend a hands-off session set at around 15 hours into the game which did an excellent job showcasing how Owlcat Games is building on the foundation laid by Rogue Trader to offer a much better experience. The choice of protagonist and setting within the Warhammer 40K universe - an Inquisitor traveling in the Calixis Sector to investigate a series of events and uncover the mysteries behind the Tyrant Star, which has the power to destroy planets - is a marked difference from Rogue Trader, allowing for some interesting narrative possibilities. Being part of the secret police force and intelligence service of the Imperium makes each Inquisitor not only feared but also essentially untouchable by anyone, as what an Inquisitor says is the truth, no matter what anyone else thinks. With this premise in mind, Owlcat Games created an adventure where there's no right or wrong, but only consequences to one's actions, which can be dealt with in many different ways.</p>



<p>This setup and how it influences Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy was clearly evident in the Gamescom demo, which featured an investigation into a series of mysterious disappearances set on Scintilla. The game features a lot of environmental storytelling, which works extremely well with the investigation features that require the Inquisitor to find clues to complete investigations. After discovery, these clues are added to an Investigation Journal where companions provide additional insight, which is a very nice touch to make them feel more involved into the story even if they play no major role in certain quests. Once insights have been gathered by checking the enovrionment and talking with NPCs, it is possible to recreate the chain of events and make the Inquisitor pass judgment on the case. As mentioned above, the word of an Inquisitor is absolute, so there are no wrong answers and no ways to fail investigations, only different consequences that must be dealt with, in typical Owlcat fashion.</p>

<p>Together with the investigation mechanics, exploration and combat will play a significant role in the Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy experience. Things have improved considerably in both cases since Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader: maps are now bigger, more detailed than ever before, and with imrpoved verticality that makes them feel even bigger. On the surface, however, combat doesn't seem to have changed a lot, but the devil is in the details, as a lot of tweaks have been made to the turn-based system seen in Rogue Trader that will make fighting enemies in Dark Heresy much more enjoyable. The cover system, for example, has been overhauled with the removal of half-covers and the ability to target covers to reduce the enemy's defensive options. A new targeting system has also been implemented to allow players to target different body parts to debuff the enemy and disable certain abilities of theirs, adding more strategic depth alongside the Concentration mechanics, which allow the player to prevent any enemy from using a powerful attack by using certain type of attacks, such as grenades, before the attack goes off as indicated in the Initiative Bar. Based on the momentum system from Rogue Trader, the Morale system is another central addition that will impact combat considerably, as low morale causes enemies to make stupid decisions beneficial to the player. Another excellent quality of life improvement is how a battle can be ended once it is determined that the enemy has no chance of winning. Players can still decide to continue, but the rewards will be the same if the battle is ended earlier, so taking advantage of this system sounds like the way to go to enhance the game's pace.</p>



<p>At a glance, Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy may not look that different from Rogue Trader, but the new main character and setting, visual improvements, investigation mechanics, and combat improvements are set to make it a much better game that will retain that unique flavor Owlcat Games infuses in its cRPG. Despite having a really basic knowledge of the Warhammer 40K universe, I really enjoyed with I saw of the game during Gamescom, and I can't wait to experience more of this morally gray adventure when it launches on a yet to be confirmed release date.</p>

Ahead of the game's debut later this month, Keepsake Games has set the price for Jump Space and laid out the update calendar well into 2026.</p><p>On Bluesky, Keepsake announced that Jump Space's early access release will be available for $20 on Xbox Series X|S and PC on September 19. Chapter 1: The Resistance Coalition will begin at the start of early access, with Chapter 2: Atira Strikes Back launching by early 2026. In a series of short updates in that time frame, Keepsake plans to introduce text chat, hangar vendors, a ship shield revamp, melee weapons, an expanded story, new missions, photo mode, and other additions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4567165-jumpspaceroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4567165" data-ratio="4.0733333333333" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4567165-jumpspaceroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4567165"></a><figcaption>The roadmap for Jump Space's updates.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4567165-jumpspaceroadmap.jpg"></figure><p>In Q1 2026, Chapter 3: Secrets of the Telmari will bring support for a first-person mode, more sectors, a scanner revamp, voice chat, new enemies, and a ground boss into the game. There are plans for Chapter 4: Heart of Corruption before the game exits early access. However, there are no dates or concrete details about when that might occur.</p><p>Until fairly recently, this game was known as Jump Ship before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jump-ship-forced-to-change-name-to-jump-space-due-to-trademark-issues/1100-6533707/" data-ref-id="1100-6533707">the name was changed over trademark issues</a>. Jump Space is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-co-op-games-steam/2900-6905/" data-ref-id="2900-6905">co-op game</a> that brings together up to four players as the crew of a ship that can control and repair their shared vessel. The gameplay resembles Left 4 Dead and Sea of Thieves, with some additional sci-touches touches like planetary exploration and space walks. It's a dangerous galaxy out there, and players will run into trouble when enemies appear during on-foot encounters or during space combat when the crew is still on their ship. However, the game is strictly PvE, rather than PvP.</p><p>Keepsake Games has previously mentioned that Jump Space will feature several "handcrafted missions with random elements" to keep the game fresh. More than 1 million players have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757300/Jump_Space/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlisted Jump Space on Steam</a>. For now, the game will only be available on Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
