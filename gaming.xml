            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/anniversary-resident-evil-deadly-silence-is-20-years-old-today-were-you-a-fan</link>
            <guid>1410232</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="177f6fc9f24ac"><a title="RE: DS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/177f6fc9f24ac/re-ds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a> has a special place in my heart, and not just because it's a stone-cold classic of gaming, a bona fide icon of the horror genre, and all that sort of guff.</p>
<p>No, I also have very fond memories of riding the bus home with the original PlayStation release of this particular game clutched tightly to my 16-year-old chest. I'd waited and waited, scanned every magazine and collected every nugget of information available over a very long gestation period. I couldn't wait any longer to get started at the Spencer Mansion. It was genuinely, possibly the most excited I've ever been about a game in the run-up to launch.</p>
<p>Who could have known, amidst the excitement of that bus journey, that just 10 years later, just one teeny tiny decade down the line, this sort of incredible horror experience (which at the time had us all shouting "It looks like a f*****g movie!") would be available to play, and with extras to boot, on a dinky portable system? Not me, that's for sure. But that's what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/resident_evil_deadly_silence">Resident Evil: Deadly Silence</a> brought to the table, exactly 20 years ago today in Japan. Happy Birthday, you deadly silent scamp, you!</p>

<p>Even more surprising — and it's awful to do this to something on its birthday, but it is what it is — I really didn't enjoy Deadly Silence very much for a whole bunch of reasons. Yep, I just did that whole big, nice, positive preamble in order to dump even harder on a game. On its birthday.</p>
<p>By the time 2006 rolled around, and as timeless as it is, Resi felt decidedly old-school in its design and gameplay, and in presenting the OG PSX game as a base for the most part here, it really did take a lot of love for Resi to press on through a port that felt stodgy and rather bad to play, and that's before you even get to the smaller screen that sucked a lot of the tension out of proceedings.</p>
<p>Of course, it's easy to snipe from here, from the safety of a hill positioned some 20 years in the future, but even at the time, I distinctly remember this one feeling a bit naff, a bit pointless given we already had nice revamped versions of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil">OG Resi</a>, and very tired on the gameplay front considering we'd all just recently(ish) recovered from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>.</p>

<p>Also, you must remember, at this point, we hadn't quite arrived at the critical retro/nostalgia inflection point for tank-control Resident Evil. It was too soon. It was just an 'old' game in 2006, and there were far better games to be playing, never mind better ports of this very same experience.</p>
<p>Alright. Enough putting the touchscreen knife in. Let's be nice. What Deadly Silence <em>did</em> add to the mix in order to strengthen its appeal was some slightly enhanced character graphics, a 180-degree quick turn, <em>and</em> a "Rebirth" mode, which utilised the console's touchscreen to jab at enemies with a knife in first person. So that's good!</p>

<p>Except the Rebirth mode wasn't good. Not good at all, in fact. Besides aimlessly jabbing at Zs, it also let you do some other trivial stuff like turning valves, which all felt a bit pointless and unresponsive overall, and so not really worth the effort.</p>
<p>However! Look. It was a portable version of a classic, and if you only had a DS, well, it was a solid enough way to experience a genre-definer if you really felt the need! Just eat your cake.</p>

            <p>
Valve have made changes to Steam’s community awards system to discourage people from posting daft and angry posts in order to farm Steam points. You will, in fact, no longer be able to receive Steam points from other users when they give you awards. Adding insult to injury, there's a new set of awards that are explicitly designed to spread goodwill. Filth!<!--more-->
</p>
<p>
For context, Steam community awards are those emoji stickers people slap on reviews to indicate a rich spectrum of human emotions - all the way from spitting contempt to absolutely brainless enthusiasm. With community awards hitherto being a source of Steam points (used to buy stuff like profile pictures and backgrounds) there has long been a culture of posting garbage to attract a few dozen clownface emojis. 
</p>
<p>
No longer! Now, all you’ll get in return for provoking the hatred of the commons is a picture of a flaming chilli pepper. This being one of 12 new community awards Valve have created, which replace the existing designs. They are not only worthless as a means of monetising cringe - they are intended to “keep the vibes positive”. Yeah, good luck with that.
</p>
<p>
“Just as before, you can purchase these awards using your Steam Points (earned by buying games), and use them in Steam Community to show your appreciation for things like user reviews, forum posts, guides, screenshots, artwork, Workshop mods, or even directly on your buddy's Steam profile,” notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/507340830949770620?l=english">the Steam blog</a> in question (thanks, Aerothorn).
</p><p>
“When we originally created Steam Community Awards, the idea was for them to not only look cool but to also grant a small number of Steam Points to the recipient, meaning they could be used as a tip of sorts for people who create and share amazing content with the Steam Community,” it goes on. “However, we found that this encouraged and rewarded a narrow set of attention-grabbing content and didn't allow the focus to be as much on a broader pool of thoughtful, well-considered creative content. 
</p>
<p>
“Because of this, we're refocusing the system: The Second Edition of Steam Community Awards won't transfer points. Instead, the goals of the system will be solely about conveying the appreciation of the viewer to the content creator, and as a signal to others that someone appreciated the piece of content.”
</p>
<p>
The new awards all cost 500 Steam points apiece, and are a mix of flavourless and awfully saccharine. Seriously, if anybody ever reacts to anything I’ve posted with a picture of a bouncing life preserver, take me outside and gun me down like a rabid dog. Still, we can rest assured that Steam users will twist their meaning. Give it a few weeks, and that bouncing life preserver will probably <em>actually</em> be the Steam user equivalent of gunning somebody down like a rabid dog.
</p>
<p>
We can also rest assured that Valve will bring back the OG community award designs at some point, once the dog of nostalgia is sufficiently rabid and ready for the gunning. I will quit with this analogy now.
</p>
<p>If we had a community award system for RPS comments, what designs should we include? Other than a rock, a piece of paper and a shotgun, of course.</p>

<p>Ball x Pit’s first major update, The Regal Update, has officially been announced, and it’s set to launch on January 26, 2026. Better yet, the update will be completely free for all players to claim.</p>







<p>This marks the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ball-x-pit-devs-announce-3-free-content-updates-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first of three major updates</a> promised for the game, with the remaining two currently scheduled to arrive in April and July. But before those roll around, The Regal Update is bringing plenty of new content to dive into.</p>

<p>A trailer shared on the official Ball x Pit <a href="https://x.com/BALLxPIT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account revealed the headline additions: two brand-new playable characters joining the roster.</p>



<ul>
<li>The Carouser, a character whose returning balls orbit around him</li>



<li>The Falconer, who is flanked by her two trusted falcons that throw balls</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s not all, though. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ball-x-pit-january-2026-regal-update-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Regal Update</a> will also introduce eight new balls, alongside several new passives to expand build variety. To top things off, the developers teased a mysterious “nice surprise” that they’re refusing to reveal ahead of launch. If their confidence is anything to go by, you’ll want to jump in on January 26 to see it for yourself. </p>







<p>Here’s the full trailer, which showcases the two new heroes in action.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Rockstar Is Reportedly Letting a Terminally Ill Fan Play Grand Theft Auto VI Early]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/rockstar-is-reportedly-letting-a-terminally-ill-fan-play-grand-theft-auto-vi-early/</link>
            <guid>1410214</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Spotted by <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/rockstar-early-access-fan-gta-6/">Tech4Gamers</a>, a terminally ill <strong>Grand Theft Auto</strong> fan seems to have been given the chance to play <strong>Grand Theft Auto VI</strong> ahead of its release. It's the second time in the span of two years that <strong>Take-Two Interactive</strong> is giving a dying fan a chance to play an unreleased title before they are no longer able to. </p>



<p>The last time this happened, the game in question was <strong>Borderlands 4</strong>, with longtime fan <strong>Caleb McAlpine</strong> posting his story to Reddit, on a wing and a prayer, hoping that his plea to try and play Borderlands 4 before he passed would make it to Gearbox. It did, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gearbox-flew-terminally-ill-fan-to-its-studio-to-play-borderlands-4-early-i-am-praying-he-makes-to-when-we-are-done">Gearbox flew Caleb and a friend of his to their home studio on first-class plane tickets</a> to tour the studio and play Borderlands 4 a year ahead of release.</p>



<p>This time, the story doesn't begin with a post on Reddit, but in now-deleted posts on LinkedIn from a UI integrator at Ubisoft Toronto, <strong>Anthony Armstrong</strong>. Armstrong made a call out to any potential connections he had at Rockstar and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-toronto-game-developers-protest-at-rockstar-toronto-in-solidarity-with-fired-workers/">Rockstar Toronto</a></strong> to ask if there was any chance a member of his family who had approximately 6 months to a year left to live could play the highly anticipated game ahead of its release.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Terminally-Ill-GTA-Fan-Plays-GTA-VI-Early-1.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Tech4Gamers</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to the post, which you can see above, this story has a happy ending with Armstrong seemingly speaking to the right people, with a report from <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/gta-6-terminally-ill-fan-play-early/">TheGamer</a> adding that Armstrong was contacted by Take-Two boss, <strong>Strauss Zelnick</strong>, as part of the process to set up a private play session for their relative. </p>



<p>It's perhaps the happiest story to come out of Rockstar recently, as news around the studio has mostly circled around topics like <a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-judge-denies-fired-rockstar-employees-interim-pay-iwgb/">allegations of <strong>union-busting</strong> from the IWGB and the current ongoing legal battle between Rockstar and the IWGB union</a>, or <a href="https://wccftech.com/although-not-content-complete-yet-fall-2026-is-a-more-real-release-window-than-fall-2025-for-grand-theft-auto-vi/">the state of GTA VI's development, and whether it'll actually still arrive in 2026</a>. On top of Rockstar trying to put out metaphorical fires, it also had a real one to deal with today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-north-fire-explosion-grand-theft-auto-vi/">after an explosion caused by a malfunctioning heating boiler started a fire at the Rockstar North offices in Edinburgh</a>.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll eventually get a follow-up to this story as we did with Caleb McAlpine's. Wccftech has attempted to reach out to Mr. Armstrong for such a follow-up and will update this story if/when we hear back.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Bungie’s multiplayer extraction shooter Marathon has a new trailer revealing the game’s long-awaited release date. You can mark March 5 on your calendar as the date when you’ll begin your trip to planet Tau Ceti IV.</p><p>First <a href="https://gameinformer.com/playstation-showcase/2023/05/24/bungie-is-revitalizing-its-old-shooter-series-marathon">announced</a> in May 2023, Marathon was originally set to launch last September, but it was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/17/marathon-delayed-indefinitely-from-september-release">delayed</a> to address concerns stemming from an initially rocky player reception to the game’s Alpha test. The game was also at the center of a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/16/bungie-confirms-unauthorized-use-of-art-after-artist-claims-her-work-is-present">plagiarism controversy</a> surrounding its art direction, which has since been resolved. The extraction shooter sees players controlling bio-cybernetic characters called Runners, who must scavenge resources on the hostile Tau Ceti IV. Survival means combating rival player-controlled Runners as well as in-game security forces. You can see the game in action in its latest trailer below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UbNhSVj6WZM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UbNhSVj6WZM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Additionally, Marathon’s extensive voice cast has been revealed, and it includes the talents of Samantha Béart (Baldur’s Gate 3), Jennifer English (Clair Obscur: Expedition 33), Ben Starr (Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Final Fantasy XVI), and Neil Newbon (Baldur’s Gate 3).

With Marathon's 5th March release date <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-release-date-reportedly-leaks-via-xbox-store-pre-order-trailer">now official</a>, developer Bungie has started sharing other bits of info about its PvPvE extraction shooter, including a lengthy cast list that - with names including Jennifer English and Benn Starr - reads like a bit of a who's who of video game acting talent.
</p>
<p>
Bungie has so far confirmed 30 actors making an appearance in Marathon's English voice cast "at launch", but it hasn't yet revealed the roles they'll be playing. Alongside Jennifer English, fresh off her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">award-winning turn as Maelle</a> in last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, Marathon also features fellow Expedition 33 actors Benn Starr and Tracy Wiles. Wiles, who played the Paintress, also portrayed Jaheira in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, and is joined by fellow BG3 veterans Neil Newbon (Astarion) and Samantha Béart (Karlach).

<p>
Marathon also stars Roger Clark (Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption), Dave Fennoy (Lee Everett in The Walking Dead), Elias Toufexis (Adam Jensen in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex-human-revolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex-mankind-divided">Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</a>), and Erin Yvette - who last year lent her voice to Samus Aran in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> and Dispatch's Blonde Blazer. Other confirmed talent includes Scott Whyte (Crash Bandicoot) and Jason Spisak (Silco in League of Legends TV adaptation Arcane). You'll find the complete announced English cast list below, with Bungie also noting Marathon will include fully localised dialogue for all its supported languages.

Marathon has, of course, had a turbulent road to release, finding itself embroiled in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">leadership changes</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-responds-to-marathon-reboot-directors-200m-wrongful-dismissal-lawsuit-alleges-disturbing-communications-with-female-employees">legal challenges</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">plagiarism scandal</a>, and more since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-returns-to-its-roots-with-a-pvp-twist-on-classic-fps-series-marathon">unveiling back in 2023</a>. The shooter was initially due to launch on 23rd September last year, but Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-delayed-indefinitely-in-response-to-passionate-fan-feedback">delayed its arrival</a> following a less-than-positive response to its big reveal and an equally divisive alpha playtest. Today, however, it confirmed Marathon will finally launch for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and Steam on 5th March, arriving in standard, deluxe, and collector's edition forms.

The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646977/bungie-marathon-release-date-september-alpha-test-details">slick-looking shooter</a> from the makers of <em>Halo </em>and <em>Destiny</em> was originally set to release in September, but will now <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon-releases-march-5-2026-new-trailer-and-more">launch on March 5th</a>. Bungie will launch <em>Marathon </em>on Xbox Series S / X, PS5, and PC, priced at $39.99.</p><p>Bungie initially <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688479/bungie-marathon-delay-sony">delayed <em>Marathon</em> in June</a> last year following plenty of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688479/bungie-marathon-delay-sony">alpha test feedback</a>. The studio recently held playtests that included new features like proximity chat and an option to solo queue into games.</p><p><em>Marathon </em>is set in a sci-fi universe in 2850, where players take on the role of a Runner to scavenge what’s left behind. As a Runner, you fight in a crew of up to three players across a variety of zones and points of interest. <em>Marathon</em> is a PvPvE environment, so players will be fighting creatures on planets as well as other players. If you die during a run, you’ll drop your gear. But if you survive, your loot moves with you to future runs so you get more powerful gear and level up.</p><p>Bungie’s delay to Marathon means it is now launching months after <em>ARC Raiders</em>, an extraction shooter from the makers of <em>The Finals</em> that has consistently been in the top five most-played games on Steam since its launch in late October. Bungie had originally planned to launch <em>Marathon </em>ahead of <em>ARC Raiders</em>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/864146/bungie-marathon-release-date-march-5th-price]]></content:encoded>

Landing somewhere between tower defence, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, and Tamagotchi, it has you holding up a genetically engineered hamster-like creature up to a window and blasting waves of attackers with the mounted weapons systems hidden in his fur. Then, setting him down and giving him a good long scritch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Keeping Mochi-O (also the name of your adopted battle rodent) happy, through the liberal application of petting and treats, serves two purposes. One, it keeps the beast sweet with your particular band of humans, his genocidal instincts being revealed through a mind-reading iPad. And two, it pre-emptively upgrades Mochi-O for the subsequent mission, sustained scratches yielding XP and currency boosts. Which is more than my cat ever gives to me.</p>
<p>The shooty bits operate on similar "Sure, why not" logic. Downed foes drop delicious seeds that Mochi-O can hoover up to unlock and improve his armaments, which escalate from one or two stick-out rifles to homing missile launcher, flung saw blades, and an orbital laser, the mechanics of which are not discussed beyond noting that the hamster can fire an orbital laser. And that’s just the demo – who knows what other war crimes the full game has tucked away in the floof.</p>

</figure>
<p>More so than a classic shoot 'em up, the pick-and-mix upgrade system and general focus on waveclear call to mind a modern Survivorslike. Which is risky, as firing from a distance doesn’t allow quite as many of those squeaky-bum, narrow escape moments that the latter genre trades in, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-early-access-review">often to thrilling effect</a>. And yet, Mochi-O does seem to have a good grasp on the simpler dopamine extraction techniques of a quality autoshooter. Heavy waves and upgraded arsenals combine for some amusingly exaggerated destruction scenes, and the casino ding-ding-ding of devouring a seed pile is as satisfying as any SFX I’ve heard in all nineteen days of 2026 so far.</p>
<p>Crucially, it also hard-commits to its silliness, offering its daft pet combat with a confidence that’s only attainable by enjoying a deep sense of peace with itself. I respect that, in people, and in kawaii gerbil missile defence simulators.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-is-my-favorite-limited-edition-ps5-dualsense-controller-yet-2000660992</link>
            <guid>1410175</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Buried in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-trailer-leak-bungie-2000660975"><em>Marathon</em> launch info dump today</a>, which Bungie rushed out early after it was accidentally leaked over on Xbox, is the news that sci-fi shooter will arrive alongside the latest limited edition PlayStation 5 DualSense controller. And unlike many of the recent ones we’ve gotten, this one actually looks really good.</p> <p>The <em>Marathon</em>-inspired limited edition DualSense controller is $85 and goes up for pre-order on January 29 10:00 a.m. local time at direct.playstation.com. There’s also an accompanying Pulse Elite wireless headset that will go on sale at the same time, though for a much heftier price tag. That accessory will be $170. I’ve never loved the look of the Pulse headset and, frankly, the<em> Marathon</em> aesthetic isn’t changing that.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000660998" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660998"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660998">Sony</figcaption></figure> <p>What I love most about the <em>Marathon</em> DualSense, other than the generally subtle design and clean look, is how neatly the typography and icons mesh with the underlying sensibility of the controller. In other words, its a very natural fit unlike some other recent limited edition DualSenses. The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/08/20250508-ds/"><em>Death Stranding 2</em> one</a> wasn’t bad but felt pretty bland and I didn’t dig the giant bronze block over the touch pad. The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/10/first-look-ps5-ghost-of-yotei-limited-edition-console-designs/"><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> one</a>, meanwhile, looked like someone threw up gold dust on it.</p>

 <p>Bonus points to the <em>Marathon</em> controller for keeping the only branded text, the name of the game, hidden in neon on the underside of the controller. Is this controller even better looking than the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/296678467989"><em>Concord</em> one</a>? I think so. Will it be as rare as that one? Probably! Hopefully, it’s not because<em> Marathon</em> ends up flopping as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>From January 29, prospective fans of Marathon, Bungie’s all-new extraction shooter, can pre-order the limited edition DualSense and Pulse Elite wireless headset. The exclusive range is being manufactured to welcome Marathon to the market, and the announcement comes at the same time as the game’s release date was confirmed.</p>



<p>The full game will be released on March 5, but for now, you can stoke your excitement by <strong>preparing </strong>to preorder the limited edition controller and headset.</p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-s-marketing-march-starts-now">Marathon’s Marketing March Starts Now</h2>



<p>Bungie dropped a new trailer earlier today, revealing the full release date for Marathon, the upcoming extraction title. It came hours after the full trailer was leaked online, uncovering the game’s launch date before Bungie could drop the announcement.</p>



<p>What wasn’t revealed ahead of time was the new DualSense controller and Pulse Elite wireless headset, produced in honor of the new game.</p>



<p>It has been a rocky road for Marathon and Bungie over the last year or so, but by all accounts, things are starting to straighten up ahead of the game’s ultimate release.</p>



<p>Here’s a look at the new controller:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>And a nice glimpse at the new Pulse Elite wireless headset:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While you can pre-order the peripherals from January 29, you won’t get your hands on them until the game launches in March. Also, you can <strong>only </strong>pre-order the Pulse Elite wireless headset from PlayStation Direct.</p>



<p>Here are your pricing points:</p>



<p><strong>DualSense –</strong> $84.99</p>



<p><strong>Pulse Elite</strong> <strong>– </strong>$169.99</p>



<p>Marathon could turn around all expectations and smash into the extraction space with a mighty roar in just a few weeks. People are approaching the game with bated breath, but recent playtests have suggested that it’s potentially shaping up to be something enjoyable, at the very least.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Heartopia on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Or Switch? All Console Platforms, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/heartopia-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-switch-all-platforms/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Heartopia will likely end 2026 as one of the most lovingly titled games, and the life-sim title established itself early on as a game to keep an eye on. Its popularity boomed very quickly, and if you PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo owners want in on the action, there are answers for you all.</p>



<p>You’d think you can only have so many <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-forget-gta-6-2026-is-all-about-the-life-sim-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life-sim</a> games like Heartopia. Yet, the game from developer XD is proving once again that humanity can’t get enough of building houses and completing menial tasks that would be more productive if done in the real world—but we’re all gamers here, it would be hypocritical to suggest you go touch grass.</p>



<p>If you have a Heartopia-shaped box on your mind, its console status should be of interest.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-heartopia-on-playstation-5">Can You Play Heartopia On PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Pretty bubbles in the air. Credit to XD</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s an arrow through the heart for PS5 users as Heartopia isn’t available to play on PlayStation consoles at launch.</strong></p>



<p>Heartopia’s launch day player numbers on PC were fantastic, as were the ones after it! Before it came to Steam, Heartopia actually launched on the Google Play Store and the App Store. It garnered a reputation very first, making its Steam release a popular one. Tens of thousands of people got straight to work on creating homes and virtual lives.</p>



<p>For now, PlayStation 5 owners must miss out and play the waiting game. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-heartopia-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Heartopia On Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>Heartopia is bypassing Xbox consoles, leaving Xbox Series X|S users to have their hearts skip a beat.</strong></p>



<p>Everyone is striking out with Heartopia. The life-sim title doesn’t have any love in its heart for Microsoft and Xbox owners right now. It follows the same sorrowful fate as PlayStation players, but let’s hope there’s a future where this can change.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-heartopia-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2">Can You Play Heartopia On Nintendo Switch or Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 owners can also get in the same loveless boat, as Heartopia isn’t on a Nintendo console either.</strong></p>



<p>Per the Heartopia Discord Server, one of its main moderators (sweetkayla_xo) <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1128257488375005215/1420319877507579988/1458417800250134569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“No – Heartopia isn’t launching on consoles yet.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s unclear how much official information they have on the game. If they do know the inner-workings of the game’s development and reach, then this is a surefire sign that Heartopia is coming to consoles; we just don’t know when.</p>



<p>Are you playing Heartopia on mobile or PC? Do you have anything to say about the poor console players who are missing out? You can share your thoughts via the official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Stellar Blade 2 Location Tease Points To Post-Apocalyptic China]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-location-post-apocalyptic-china/</link>
            <guid>1410166</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Shift Up recently posted an image on social media revealing a ‘location scout’ for their ‘next title’, which is almost certainly Stellar Blade 2. The follow-up to the 2024 post-apocalyptic sultry slasher was confirmed a while back, and by now, it should be full steam ahead for Shift Up in terms of piecing it together.</p>



<p>The apocalyptic landscape shared by the team on social media is a snippet taken from Chongqing, China. This is a gargantuan, dense cityscape with a population of <span>over 32 million people, but in Stellar Blade 2, it appears&nbsp;<strong>as</strong></span><strong> a ghost city</strong>. </p>







<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-2-promises-to-turn-heads">Stellar Blade 2 Promises to Turn Heads</h2>



<p>Stellar Blade dropped on PlayStation 5 in 2024, emerging as a game that intrigued players because, while it was marketed almost as a ‘gooner game’, it turned out to have some immensely satisfying combat mechanics and a decent story.</p>



<p>The game’s lead, Eve, wastes no time in showing as much flesh as possible, and that’s why the game perhaps didn’t get as serious a stamp of approval as it should have from some critics.</p>



<p>Regardless, it was a commercial success that was compounded by a hugely successful launch on PC a year later, and recently, the team at Shift Up revealed that <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sequel-in-development-now/">another game in the series</a> is coming</strong>.</p>



<p>The recent post <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/2012973553562321375">on social media</a> shows a crumbling, abandoned landscape, which eagle-eyed fans immediately identified as being a rendition of Chongqing, China. This was confirmed by Shift Up shortly after, giving fans the impression that, whenever Stellar Blade 2 arrives, it might take inspiration from or be directly set in and around the Chinese city.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s no big secret that Chinese fans were hugely approving of the game. It was estimated that 58% of PC-related sales of Stellar Blade were <strong>from </strong>China.</p>







<p>We know nothing about Stellar Blade 2, outside of these tiny tidbits from Shift Up. The nature of the game is yet to be revealed, but it might not be too long before <strong>it is</strong>. Fans expect something to be uncovered <strong>in the coming months</strong>.</p>

<h2>You can do better than that</h2>
<p>That’s a moderately useful option for cloud-curious Xbox players that might not be willing to take the plunge on a monthly subscription, we suppose. But it also feels like Microsoft could come up with some more imaginative ways to use Cloud Gaming to reach occasional players in new ways.</p>
<p>What’s stopping Microsoft from offer streaming players a 30-minute timed demo stream of <em>any</em> available Xbox Cloud Gaming title—perhaps in exchange for watching a short ad, or perhaps simply as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/01/xbox-live-arcade-portolio-planner-sounds-off-about-demos/">an Xbox Live Arcade-style sales juicing tactic</a>? Or why not offer discounted access to a streaming-only Game Pass subscription for players willing to watch occasional ads, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/netflix-rolls-out-its-basic-with-ads-plan-in-the-us-and-beyond/">like Netflix</a>? Microsoft could even let players spend a couple of bucks to rent a digital copy of the title for a few days, much as services like iTunes do for newer films.</p>
<p>Those are just a few ideas off the top of our heads. And they all feel potentially more impactful than using ads as a way to let Xbox players stream copies of games they already purchased.</p>
<p>Back in 2019, we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/despite-revolutionary-promises-stadias-biz-model-is-pure-establishment/">noted</a> how Stadia’s strictly buy-before-you-play streaming business model limited the appeal of what ended up as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/google-stadia-officially-shuts-down-january-2023-will-refund-game-purchases/">a doomed cloud-gaming experiment</a>. Microsoft should take some lessons from Google’s failure and experiment with new ways to use streaming to reach players that might not have access to the latest high-end hardware for their gaming experiences.</p>

			<p>Although life continues to be grim for fans of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Elder Scrolls</em></strong> series, as the wait for the sixth entry in the series gets more difficult to bear with each passing day, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2025</strong> brought a smile to more than a few of them with the release of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion Remastered</em></strong>, a remake of the fourth entry in the series by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bethesda</strong> powered by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Unreal Engine 5</strong> which leaves the original gameplay almost intact.</p>



<p>Right from the outset, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/"><strong>the game's shadowdrop appeared successful</strong></a>, which wasn't surprising given how popular the game remained following its 2006 release. However, nostalgia is not as powerful as some may think for engagement, as many players got their fix in about 10 hours before dropping the game.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/how-2025s-xbox-published-games-sold"><strong>a new report</strong></a> shared a couple of days <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">ago,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Alinea Analytics' Rhys Elliot</strong>&nbsp;looked at how well&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Xbox-published</strong>&nbsp;games performed</span> on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 5</strong>, starting with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion Remastered</em></strong>. The remake sold <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">1.1 million copies</strong> on the system, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"proving the pull of Bethesda’s legacy catalogue on PlayStation hardware,"</em> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Elliot</strong> wrote in the Substack post. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Over 80% of Oblivion’s PS5 copies were sold during its first month on the market, but some discounts to $33 over the past couple of months have led to small sales spikes,"</em> the analyst added.</p>



<p>While sales were solid, player engagement wasn't impressive at all for a massive RPG, as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"around half of Oblivion Remastered players on PS5 played for less than 15 hours, showing that most people got their nostalgia fix before meaningfully progressing."</em> Considering how easy it is to lose oneself in Cyrondiil before making any real progress in the main story, this highlights that a remake needs more than improved visuals to keep players engaged past the point where they get their nostalgia fix.</p>



<p>However, there could be a few more reasons why those who purchased <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion Remastered</em></strong> on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 5</strong> did not play for long, besides the lack of new content. For starters, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-is-an-impressive-remaster-with-dire-performance-problems-says-digital-foundry/">the game still runs poorly across all formats</a></strong>, and the performance hiccups make it challenging to enjoy the new visuals. In addition, the game does not support <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-8k-texture-packs/">mods</a></strong> on consoles, preventing it from achieving the same enduring popularity as its sequel, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Skyrim</em></strong>.</p>



<p>With <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion Remastered</em></strong> selling reasonably well, regardless of how long players have lost themselves in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Cyrodiil</strong>, it will be interesting to see how <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Starfield</em></strong> will fare on the system. While the latest <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RPG</strong> by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bethesda</strong> is far from being as popular as previous games from the studio, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Alinea Analytics' Rhys Elliot</strong> believes it will outperform the remake developed by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Virtuos</strong>. Hopefully, <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-might-get-cyberpunk-2077-2-0-style-update-ps5-switch-2-launch-2026/"><strong>the rumored 2.0 update</strong></a> will also provide reasons for jaded players like me to return to the game, whose opinion on it<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/"><strong> soured a lot in the months after its release.</strong></a></p>

<p>That's March 5th, 2026, as <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/marathon-release-date-leaked-via-xbox-community-page-march-5th-deluxe-edition-available.1409665/">leaked</a> a bit ahead of time via some Xboxer slightly shakily filming their telly. Thankfully, you can now watch the fresh trailer above in the quality intended.</p>
<p>It bwaaaas and shoots its way through some action, while a narrator called Gantry waxes lyrical about Tau Ceti being buried. The only way it can maybe be saved, it turns out, is via you running around and getting shot a lot, which is a happy coincidence. I'll be honest, I'm not quite sure how to feel about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> at this juncture, at least until I've given it a go.</p><p>I have long admired the game's commitment to the colour lime green, as if it's a twelve year old who thinks being sponsored by Monster Energy is akin to being knighted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-arthur">King Arthur</a>. Then again, Bungie betray this a bit by momentarily turning everything red towards the end of the trailer, as a tall robotic silhouette. However, this mysterious threat - who I assume to be the baddie - does have a glowing emerald circle in their chest, suggesting the heart of Marathon still flows with that love of lime green.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you fancy, you can queue up to pre-order the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPwr3JClpuQ">collector's edition</a>, which comes with a vacuum-packed caterpillar thing among other tat. The base version, meanwhile, will set you back £34.99 / $39.99 / €39.99, while the deluxe edition that boasts extra in-game stuff but no physical goodies costs £44.99 / $59.99 / €59.99. All the details on what each version includes can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3065800/view/114412015531853135">here</a>, where Bungie have also mentioned that details for an open preview weekend will be coming soon.</p>
<p>That post also runs down the cast of English voice actors, which includes Deus Exman Elias Toufexis, Arthur Morgman Roger Clark, and at least four <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> threeple - Samantha Béart, Jennifer English, Neil Newbon, and Tracy Wiles. Final Fantasy 16's Ben Starr is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TSfKBTKmTKI">also in it</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Modder Blasts ‘Corpo Logic’ Over Cyberpunk 2077 VR Takedown]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-baldurs-gate-3-takedown-2000660987</link>
            <guid>1410133</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The modder behind a paywalled </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-the-kotaku-review-1845946628"><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i></a><span> VR mod has accused CD Projekt RED of following “in Take-Two Interactive Software’s steps,” after its legal team issued their project with a DMCA takedown notice. Clearly undeterred, the same modder has even gone ahead and released a VR mod for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a><span>. It uses the same paywalled method of distribution that got them into trouble with <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</span></p> <p><span>Luke Ross (not his real name, according to </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23190201/luke-ross-vr-real-mod-gta-v-elden-ring-horizon-red-dead"><i><span>The Verge</span></i></a><span>) is a somewhat infamous figure within the VR modding community. His “R.E.A.L. VR” project is a singular mod that supports dozens of high-profile video games, including </span><i><span>Elden Ring</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Hogwarts Legacy</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Marvel’s Spider-Man</span></i><span>.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The catch is that the R.E.A.L. VR mod requires a $10 monthly subscription to download directly through Luke Ross’ Patreon. While you could easily download everything you need with a one-off payment, you’d need to renew your subscription if one of the games is updated. If you’re curious as to how much Luke Ross is making off of said subscription, </span><i><span>The Verge</span></i><span> estimated that he was earning roughly $20,000 per month back in 2022.</span></p>

  <p><span>Requiring payment for a mod is obviously against most publishers’ terms of service, which is why Ross’ R.E.A.L. VR project has previously been subject to a <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-v-take-two-mafia-modder-mods-luke-ross-vr-dmca-1849149715">DMCA takedown by Take-Two Interactive</a> for its </span><i><span>Red Dead Redemption II </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto V</span></i><span> support.</span></p>

 <p><span>Based on a lengthy rant in the “About” section of his Patreon page in which he admonishes Take-Two for their “hostile behavior toward modders and gamers alike,” the VR modder doesn’t make much of a distinction between himself and those who release their mods for free.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/another-one-dust-148437771"><span>A new post</span></a><span> on his Patreon now projects that same ire at CD Projekt Red.&nbsp; It blasts the Polish RPG-maker for its “iron-clad corpo logic” over the fact that “</span><span>every little action that a company takes is in the name of money, but everything that modders do must be absolutely for free.” </span><span>“As usual they stretch the concept of ‘derivative work’ until it’s paper-thin, as though a system that allows visualizing 40+ games in fully immersive 3D VR was somehow built making use of their intellectual property,” Ross writes.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This post went up on January 17. Since then, R.E.A.L. VR has been updated to include support for </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>. Hasbro, Wizards of the Coast’s parent company, has been quite liberal with its use of DMCA takedowns in the past, so I wouldn’t expect R.E.A.L. VR’s </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span> support to stick around for long.</span></p>

 <h2>Turning <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> VR into a modding live service</h2> <p><span>If I were to play devil’s advocate for a second, I do think there’s something to Luke Ross’ rants. R.E.A.L. VR is obviously not on the same level as your average mod, and likely requires a lot of upkeep. It’s hard to see a way in which he could continue to support it without some sort of monetary incentive.</span></p>

 <p><span>On the other hand, there’s a very straightforward loophole here that Ross is doubtlessly aware of and that hundreds of other modders take advantage of: donations. Instead of charging a one-off payment or a subscription for a mod, others release all of their mods for free and allow appreciative users to donate to them instead. There’s less danger with this method since donating is completely optional. </span></p> <p><span>Plenty of mod users don’t like mod paywalls either. A popular mod adding DLSS upscaling support to Starfield back at launch sparked its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-dlss3-fsr2-pc-mod-nvidia-amd-intel-piracy-1850804328"><span>own controversy</span></a><span> when it was put behind a similar monthly subscription paywall. It seems the community is wise to Ross’ strategy, however, with many commenters over on the virtual reality subreddit taking CDPR’s side.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>“This is not the first mod the Modder had taken down because he tried to make a Live Service out of it,” wrote user </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1qfd6z2/comment/o03xc9q/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>Frraksurred</span></a><span>. “He knew he was outside the ToS and just chose to get away with it as long as he could. Now he’s trying to play the victim.” Others agreed. </span><span>“Good,” wrote user </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1qfd6z2/comment/o04zlti/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>PelluxNetwork</span></a><span>. “Paywalled mods are disgusting. Take donations, no worries there, but pay-walling your copyright infringement should be an obvious no.” </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>World of Warcraft’s former lead producer has confirmed that they are jumping ship to work on Riot’s upcoming MMO. </p>



<p>Not much is known about the upcoming Riot League of Legends MMO, other than the fact that it is set in the Runeterra universe. League of Legends itself is reportedly scheduled to receive a major overhaul by 2027, which will seemingly be dubbed as ‘League Next’. However, today we aren’t talking about that title. </p>







<h2 id="h-riot-mmo-brings-in-world-of-warcraft-s-raymond-bartos">Riot MMO Brings in World of Warcraft’s Raymond Bartos </h2>



<p>The World of Warcraft’s lead producer, Raymond Bartos, announced his departure from Blizzard last month, after working for 3 years at the company. During that time, Bartos helped push content like Plunderstorm, multiple Remixes, Gear update, Dungeon Followers, Dastardly Duos and more. However, now he is ready to kick-start a new chapter in his game development journey. </p>



<p>Bartos took to <a href="https://x.com/RaymondBartos/status/2011629347803734299" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) to reveal that he will be moving to Riot Games to work on their upcoming MMO and taking on the role of Senior Game Producer. After working on one of the biggest MMORPGs on the planet, his expertise will be crucial to developing this project. The values of Riot Games were influential in securing Bartos, with the former WoW lead producer revealing that “kindness, respect, and care aren’t just words” at Riot, and it is something the “team truly lives by”. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I’m incredibly excited to be joining <a href="https://twitter.com/riotgames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@riotgames</a> on the MMO team!!!</p><p>From my very first conversation with Riot, I immediately gravitated toward their values—and I was genuinely impressed by how clearly those values showed up throughout the interview process. It made it obvious… <a href="https://t.co/Sap1O7CQeo">pic.twitter.com/Sap1O7CQeo</a></p></div>— GoodGuyRay 💙 (@RaymondBartos) <a href="https://twitter.com/RaymondBartos/status/2011629347803734299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Regarding Riot’s MMO, the last major update was <a href="https://x.com/MarcMerrill/status/1770479141600874553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">back in 2024</a>, when the company’s co-founder spoke about future plans. At the time, they had decided to reset the direction of the project. Resetting also meant that they would be “going dark” for “several years,” and that seems to be the case. The company doesn’t want to create an MMO that players have played before with a Runeterra coat of paint. Instead, they want to do something “that truly feels like a significant evolution of the genre.” </p>







<p>In other news, Riot Games has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-congratulates-hytale-six-months-after-canceling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">congratulated Hytale’s early access launch</a>, six months after cancelling the game.

                <p>After years out of the Hollywood spotlight, The Mummy and The Whale actor Brendan Fraser has made a huge comeback. The actor has new film roles lined up, but right now, his most pressing concern is avoiding getting steamrolled by the notorious Lynel mini-bosses in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p><p>In an interview, Fraser was asked whether he was playing any video games, and he explained that he was "still stuck" on the critically acclaimed 2017 Zelda game. "I want to know how to get better weapons without getting my ass kicked by all the Lynels," <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ign/video/7596135484670184717" rel="nofollow ">Fraser said to IGN</a>, while also lamenting that there simply aren't enough bomb-flowers in the game. While his interviewer suggested he consult online guides, Fraser responded that he was looking to beat the game the old-fashioned way, without relying on walkthroughs.</p>

                <p>Bungie's long in development extraction shooter, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/" data-ref-id="5000-589442">Marathon</a>, will launch on March 5, a new gameplay trailer has revealed ahead of preorders opening. It will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC and cost $40.</p><p>The trailer introduces players again to Tau Ceti IV, a colony that you, playing as runners, will infiltrate to dispatch armed forces and extract with valuable gear. You'll make use of a variety of Runner Shells that give you different abilities and perks, defining your role in a party or giving you a choice over how to build if you're planning to play solo. The art style remains as striking as ever, with Bungie's signature gunplay being showcased in the action below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbNhSVj6WZM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UbNhSVj6WZM?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Marathon was initially scheduled to launch on September 23, 2025 before being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-delayed-with-no-new-date-announced/1100-6532505/" data-ref-id="1100-6532505">indefinitely delayed</a> following a series of public tests that drew criticisms over the game's mechanics. Bungie noted key areas that it planned to improve with more development time, namely the game's survival elements, its lore and world building, and better social experiences for solo and duos players.</p><p>Sony, who will publish Marathon, assured fans that the game would release before the end of March 2026, with Bungie also confirming that a public beta will take place later in February ahead of launch. Development of Marathon has been rife with controversy, with Bungie eventually settling matters with an artist that accused it of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-stolen-art-issue-has-been-resolved/1100-6536649/" data-ref-id="1100-6536649">stealing assets for the shooter </a>without permission.</p><p>Since its delay, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> has taken the extraction shooter genre by storm, amassing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-on-an-upward-arc-surpassing-helldivers-2-all-time-peak-concurrent-players-on-steam/1100-6536086/" data-ref-id="1100-6536086">hundreds of thousands of concurrent players</a> and sustaining that in the months since release.</p>

<p>As well as the disappointing alpha feedback, Bungie also found itself at the center of controversy in May, when it was revealed that the game contained <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5bd258c2-70a9-4816-a5f2-9f981d275fcc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">artwork that had been stolen</a> from an online artist without proper credit.</p><p>All of that followed on from news in August 2024 that <em>Marathon</em>'s former director Chris Barrett had been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-director-fired-report-bungie" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7ef2a90f-6d8c-4535-a8a5-2e5217b15752" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">fired over misconduct allegations</a>, which led him to sue Sony over his dismissal. Sony promptly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-evidence" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d697b644-87cf-46b1-9530-25c17167ff69" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">responded to the lawsuit</a>, providing evidence of what it called a "pattern of misconduct" on Barrett's part.</p><p>This is all to say that <em>Marathon </em>has had a lengthy and difficult development cycle, and with <em>Destiny 2 </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-q2-2025-26-destiny-2-bungie" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b988b438-f974-4d01-854a-83f6fa549891" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">proving a disappointment to Bungie and Sony</a> in recent years, the two will likely be hoping this one is more of an unqualified success.</p><p>You can check out the new pre-order trailer for <em>Marathon</em>, which also introduces a brand new character you'll be meeting a lot in the game, right here.</p>
<p>Assuming that there are no further delays, you'll be able to check out <em>Marathon </em>on March 5th on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marathon/9pb32dkqkzdq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
