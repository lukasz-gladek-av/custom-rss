            <p>As <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2</a> developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> marks the close of 2024 with patch 1.1, the studio confirmed it is also working on a next-gen patch for the console version of Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy.</p>
<p>Although only able to commit to a fairly broad "next year", the team said, "we know you've asked us to update the PC versions of the original Stalker games, and we also plan to do that".</p>
<p>"Keep an eye on our social media so you don't miss the exact dates," the studio teased.</p>

<p>In an end-of-year message, GSC said: "Yesterday, a major patch 1.1 for Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl was released. All the time between the release and the Christmas holidays has been dedicated to improving your experience with our game. We hope that many of you will find the time to start, continue, or finish Stalker 2 during the holidays."</p> <div>

<p>GSC said that it will continue to update Stalker 2 in the upcoming year, and will "be ready to share the content roadmap for the game at the beginning of 2025".</p>
<p>"The next-gen patch for the console versions of Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy will be released next year," GSC added. "We know you've asked us to update the PC versions of the original Stalker games, and we also plan to do that.</p>
<p>"The amount of support you've shown us since the game's launch still amazes us. Your support is truly a miracle of the Zone. We will see you next year!"</p>
<p>At its launch in November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Stalker 2</a> was criticised for its performance issues. However, in an interview with Eurogamer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delaying-stalker-2-again-not-an-option-studio-says-team-worked-until-it-was-broken-by-marathon-development">GSC Game World's CEO Ievgen Grygorovych said delaying the game was not an option</a>.</p>
<p>"You're so tired that you would just die if you say let's run an additional marathon," Grygorovych said at the time. "We didn't have a chance to say let's do it more. We just had a chance of 'let's do until this moment - the release date - as much as we can'."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-receives-first-major-patch-including-a-life-fixes">GSC Game World released the first major patch</a> for Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, which addressed over 1800 issues.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/witcher-4%E2%80%99s-romance-options-will-be-much-more-%E2%80%98meaningful%E2%80%99.1067439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-4-romance-options-meaningful/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Witcher series has never held back regarding romance options, but they’re usually short-lived and offer more of a break from the action than anything else. In 2015’s The Witcher 3, players were typically fed into an Option A vs. Option B model for their romantic choices, with a few sub-selection flings thrown in for good measure.</p>



<p>It has been promised that in The Witcher 4, CDPR will eliminate ‘romance for the sake of making a romance’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-true-love">True Love</h2>



<p>CD Projekt Red revealed The Witcher 4 during The Game Awards earlier this month. The team dropped a stunning six-minute trailer revealing Ciri as the game’s protagonist, not Geralt of Rivia. Those familiar with the story will recognise why this was always the only option for The Witcher games.</p>



<p>In The Witcher 3, the player can romance a few characters, with the most major choice laying in their ultimate decision between Yennefer and Triss. Even Ciri, who is a supporting character in The Wild Hunt, has a brief brush with romance.</p>



<p>The concept of incorporating a bit of romance into The Witcher 4 as a box tick isn’t going to be the case.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-on-ciri-gwent-and-in-game-romance/1100-6528580/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent interview</a>, CDPR’s Sebastian Kalemba, the game’s director, explained how they’re leaning more into the concept of forming relationships in The Witcher 4.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a part of the way we make games. It is a part of human nature. It’s a very normal thing. Without that I think we wouldn’t be able to tell the very full story.</p>



<p>We want to pay a lot of attention to it and make it super compelling and very meaningful. So it’s not just to make a romance for the sake of making a romance. That’s not the CDPR way.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In CDPR’s most recent game, Cyberpunk 2077, forming a relationship with the options available is something that happens over many hours of play and several missions. It’s woven into the game’s choice patterns, and even small details, such as how characters speak in messages once in love with the protagonist, weigh into it.</p>



<p>We recently learned that The Witcher 4 will have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4s-map-size-and-quests-are-more-or-less-the-same-as-previous-title/">‘around the same-sized map’</a> as The Witcher 3.</p>

<p>When we introduced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/ars-technicas-best-video-games-of-2023/">last year's annual list of the best games</a> in this space, we focused on how COVID delays led to a 2023 packed with excellent big-name blockbusters and intriguing indies that seemed to come out of nowhere. The resulting flood of great titles made it difficult to winnow the year's best down to our traditional list of 20 titles.</p>
<p>In 2024 we had something close to the opposite problem. While there were definitely a few standout titles that were easy to include on this year's list (<em>Balatro</em>, <em>UFO 50</em>, and <em>Astro Bot</em> likely chief among them), rounding out the list to a full 20 proved more challenging than it has in perhaps any other year during my tenure at Ars Technica (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/01/im-a-man-of-wealth-and-taste/">way back in 2012!</a>). The games that ended up on this year's list are all strong recommendations, for sure. But many of them might have had more trouble making a Top 20 list in a packed year like 2023.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait to see if the release calendar seesaws back to a quality-packed one in 2025, but the forecast for big games like <em>Civilization 7</em>, <em>Avowed</em>, <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, and many, many more has us thinking that it might. In the meantime, here are our picks for the 20 best games that came out in 2024, in alphabetical order.</p>
<h2><em>Animal Well</em></h2>
<p><strong>Billy Basso; Windows, PS5, Xbox X/S, Switch</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>The Metroidvania genre has started to feel a little played out of late. Go down this corridor, collect that item, go back to the wall that can only be destroyed by said item, explore a new corridor for the next item, etc. Repeat until you've seen the entire map or get too bored to continue.</p>
<p><em>Animal Well</em> eschews this paint-by-numbers design and brings back the sense of mystery inherent to the best games in the genre. This is done in part by some masterful pixel-art graphics, which incorporate some wild 2D lighting effects and detailed, painterly sprite world. The animations—from subtle movements of the lowliest flower to terrifying, screen-filling actions from the game's titular giant animals—are handled with equal aplomb.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But <em>Animal Well</em> really shines in its often inscrutable map and item design. Many key items in the game have multiple uses that aren't fully explained in the game itself, requiring a good deal of guessing, checking, and observation to figure out how to exploit fully. Uncovering the arcane secrets of the game's multiple environmental blocks is often far from obvious and rewards players who like to experiment and explore.</p>
<p>Those arcane secrets can sometimes seem too obtuse for their own good—don't be surprised if you have to consult an outside walkthrough or work with someone to bust past some of the most inscrutable barriers put in your way. If you soldier through, though, you'll have been on one of the most memorable journeys of its type.</p>
<p><em>-Kyle Orland</em></p>
<h2><em>Astro Bot</em></h2>
<p><strong>Team Asobi; PS5</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p><em>Astro Bot</em> is an unlikely success story. The team that made it, Studio Asobi, was for years dedicated to making small-scale projects that were essentially glorified tech demos for Sony's latest hardware. First there was <em>The Playroom</em>, which was just a collection of small experiences made to show off the features of the PlayStation 4's camera peripheral. Then there was <em>Astro Bot Rescue Mission</em>, which acted as a showcase for the first PlayStation VR headset.</p>
<p>But momentum really picked up with <em>Astro's Playroom</em>, the bite-size 2020 3D platformer that was bundled with every PlayStation 5—again to show off the hardware features. When I played it, my main thought was, "I really wish this team would make a full-blown game."</p>
<p>That's exactly what <em>Astro Bot</em> is: a 15-hourlong 3D platformer with AAA production values, with no goal other than just being an excellent game. Like its predecessors, it fully leverages all the hardware features of the PlayStation 5, and it's loaded with Easter eggs and fan service for players who've been playing PlayStation consoles for three decades.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Like many 3D platformers, it's a collect-a-thon. In this case, you're gathering more than 300 little robot friends. All of them are modeled after characters from other games that defined the PlayStation platform, from <em>Resident Evil</em> to <em>Ico</em> to <em>The Last of Us</em>, from the obscure to the well-known.</p>
<p>Between those Easter eggs, the tightly designed gameplay, and the upbeat music, there's an ever-present air of joy and celebration in <em>Astro Bot</em>—especially for players who get the references. But even if you've never played any of the games it draws on, it's an excellent 3D platformer—perhaps the best released on any platform in the seven years since 2017's <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 will arguably be best remembered for beefy open-world games, serious narrative titles, and multiplayer shooters. Amid all that, I don't think anybody expected one of the best games ever released for the console to be a platformer that in some ways would feel more at home on the PlayStation 2—but that's what happened, and I'm grateful for the time I spent with it.</p>
<p>The only negative thing I have to say about it is that because of how it leverages the specific features of the DualSense controller, it's hard to imagine it'll ever be playable for anyone who doesn't own that device.</p>
<p>Is it worth buying a PS5 just to play <em>Astro Bot</em>? Probably not—as beefy as it is compared to <em>Astro's Playroom</em>, there's not enough here to justify that. But if you have one and you haven't played it yet, get on it, because you're missing out.</p>

<h2><em>Balatro</em></h2>
<p><strong>LocalThunk; Windows, PS4/5, Xbox One/Series, Switch, MacOS, iOS, Android</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>At first glance, video poker probably seems a bit too random to serve as the basis of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/why-there-are-861-roguelike-deckbuilders-on-steam-all-of-a-sudden/">yet another rogue-like deck-builder</a> experience. As anyone who's been to Atlantic City can tell you, video poker's hold-and-draw hand-building involves only the barest hint of strategy and is designed so the house always wins.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The genius of <em>Balatro</em>, then, is in the layers of strategy it adds to this simple, easy-to-grasp poker hand base. The wide variety of score or hand-modifying jokers that you purchase in between hands can be arranged in literally millions of combinations, each of which can change the way a particular run goes in ways both large and small. Even the most powerful jokers can become nearly useless if you run into the wrong debuffing Boss Blind, forcing you to modify your strategy mid-run to keep the high-scoring poker hands coming.</p>
<p>Then you add in a complex in-game economy, powerful deck-altering arcana cards, dozens of Deck and Stake difficulty options, and a Challenge Mode whose hardest options have continued to thwart me even after well over 100 hours of play. The result is a game that's instantly compelling and as addictive as a heater at a casino, only without the potential to lose your mortgage payment to a series of bad bets.</p>

<h2><em>The Crimson Diamond</em></h2>
<p><strong>Julia Minamata; Windows, Mac</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>Would you like to spend some time in a rural vacation town in Ontario, Canada, doing mineralogy fieldwork in the off-season? A better question, then: Would you like to go there in 16-color EGA, wandering through a classic adventure game, text parser and all?</p>
<p><i>The Crimson Diamond</i> is one of the most intriguing gaming trips I took this year. It’s an achievement in creative constraints, a cozy mystery, and an ear-catching soundtrack. It was made by a solo Canadian developer, inside <a href="https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/">Adventure Game Studio</a>, with some real work put into upgrading the text parser and (optional) mouse experience with reasonable quality-of-life concessions. The charming but mysterious plot gently pulls you along from one wonderfully realized 1980s-era IBM backdrop to the next. It feels like playing a game you forgot to unbox, except this one actually plays without a dozen compatibility tricks.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>We are awash in game remasters and light remakes that toy with our memories of old systems and forgotten genres (and having a lot more time to play games). <i>The Crimson Diamond</i> does something much more interesting, finding just the right new story and distinct style to port backward to a bygone era. It’s worth the clicks for any fan of pointing, clicking, and investigating.</p>

<p>You can tell downloadable content has come a long way when we deign to put a piece of DLC on our best-games-of-the-year list in 2024.</p>
<p>Released two years after the megaton zeitgeist hit that was the original <em>Elden Ring</em>, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> bucks just as many modern gaming conventions as its base game did. Yes, it's DLC because it's digitally distributed add-on content, but while most AAA games get DLC that adds about 5–10 hours of stuff to do, <em>Shadow of the </em><em>Erdtree</em>'s scope actually fell somewhere between a full sequel and the expansions you'd buy in separate retail boxes for PC games in the 1990s and 2000s. It adds a large new landmass to explore, with multiple additional "legacy dungeons" and tentpole bosses, plus new mechanics and weapons aplenty.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game's designers cleverly mapped a whole new system on top of the base game's player levels and equipment, ensuring that you could still get the same satisfying sense of power progression, regardless of how deeply you'd gotten into the <em>Elden Ring</em> base game previously. <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>attracted some criticism for its sharp difficulty—even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/is-elden-ring-really-that-hard-well-it-depends-what-you-mean-by-hard/">more so than the base game</a>—but the same satisfying progression from hopelessness to triumph through perseverance as we enjoyed in 2022 is in play here.</p>
<p>As such, everything that was great about <em>Elden Ring</em> is also great about <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. You could cynically call it more of the same, but when what we're getting more of is so delicious, it's hard to complain—especially given that this expansion includes some of the most compelling and original bosses in From Software history.</p>

<p>It didn't convert anyone who didn't dig the original, but fortunately that still left it with an audience of millions of people who were excited for a new challenge. Its impressive polish and scope land it on this list.</p>

<p>The first <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/04/frostpunk-review-ice-burg/"><i>Frostpunk</i></a> asked if you could make the terrible decisions necessary for survival in a never-ending blizzard. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/frostpunk-2-goes-wider-and-more-political-but-keeps-the-gritty-stressful-joy/"><i>Frostpunk 2</i></a> asks you to manage something different, but no less dire: helping these people who managed to hold on keep their nascent civilization together. You can go deep with the fascists, the mystics, the hard-nosed realists, or the science nerds or try to play them all off one another to keep the furnace going.</p>
<p>It’s stressful, and it’s not at all easy, and the developers may have done <i>too</i> good a job of recreating the insane demands and interplay of human factions. The interface and navigation, sore spots on launch, have received a lot of attention, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/next-year-looks-huge-for-frostpunk-2-with-a-free-major-content-update-and-two-paid-dlcs">the roadmap for the game into 2025</a> looks intriguing. I’d probably recommend starting with the first game before diving into this, but <i>Frostpunk 2</i> is an accomplished, confident game in its own right. Human failings amidst an unfeeling snowpocalypse make for some engaging scenes.</p>

<p>The isometric demon-killing of the old-school <em>Diablo</em> games has endured over the decades, especially among those who remember playing in their youth. But the whole concept has been in need of a bit of an update now that we're in the age of <em>Vampire Survivors</em> and its "Bullet Heaven" auto-shooter ilk.</p>
<p>Enter <em>Halls of Torment</em>, a game that is probably as close as it comes to aping old-school <em>Diablo</em>'s visual style without being legally actionable. Here, though, all the lore and story and exploration of the <em>Diablo</em> games has been replaced by a <em>lot</em> more enemies, all streaming toward your protagonist at the rate of up to 50,000 per hour. Much like <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, the name of the game here is dodging through those small holes in those swarms of enemies while your character automatically fills the screen with devastating attacks (that slowly level up as you play).</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>The wide variety of different playable classes—each with their own distinct strengths, weaknesses, and unique attack patterns—help each run feel distinct, even after you've smashed through the game's limited set of six environments. But there's plenty of cathartic replay value here for anyone who just wants to cause as much on-screen carnage as possible in a very short period of time.</p>

<p>Every so often, a multiplayer game releases to almost universal praise, and for a few months, seemingly everyone is talking about it. This year, that game was <em>Helldivers 2</em>. The game converted the 2015 original’s top-down shoot-em-up gameplay into third-person shooter action, and the switch-up was enough to bring in tons of players. Taking more than a few cues from <em>Starship Troopers</em>, the game asks you to "spread democracy" throughout the galaxy by mowing down hordes of alien bugs or robots during short-ish missions on various planets. Work together with your team, and the rest of the player base, to slowly liberate the galaxy.</p>
<p>I played <em>Helldivers 2</em> mostly as a “hang out game,” something to do with my hands and eyes as I chatted with friends. You can play the game “seriously,” I guess, but that would be missing the point for me. My favorite part of <em>Helldivers 2</em> is just blowing stuff up—bugs, buildings, and, yes, even teammates. Friendly fire is a core part of the experience, and whether by accident or on purpose, you will inevitably end up turning your munitions on your friends. My bad!</p>
<p>Some controversial balance patches put the game into a bit of an identity crisis for a while, but things seem to be back on track. I’ll admit the game didn’t have the staying power for me that it seemed to for others, but it was undeniably a highlight of the year.</p>

<p>A new game based on the Indiana Jones license has a lot to live up to, both in terms of the films and TV shows that inspired it and the well-remembered games that preceded it. <em>The Great Circle</em> manages to live up to those expectations, crafting the most enjoyable Indy adventure in years.</p>
<p>The best part of the game is contained in the main storyline, captured mainly in exquisitely madcap cut scenes featuring plenty of the pun-filled, devil-may-care quipiness that Indy is known for. Voice actor Troy Baker does a great job channeling Harrison Ford (by way of Jeff Goldblum) as Indy, while antagonist Emmerich Voss provides all the scenery-chewing Nazi shenanigans you could want from the ridiculous, magical-realist storyline.</p>
<p>The stealth-action gameplay is a little more pedestrian but still manages to distinguish itself with suitably crunchy melee combat and the enjoyable improvisation of attacking Nazis with everyday items, from wrenches to plungers. And while the puzzles and side-quests can feel a bit basic at times, there are enough hidden trinkets in out-of-the-way corners to encourage completionists to explore every inch of the game's intricately detailed open-world environments.</p>
<p>It's just the kind of light-hearted, escapist, exploratory fun we need in these troubled times. Welcome back, Indy! We missed you!</p>

<h2><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></h2>
<p><strong>Nintendo; Switch</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>After decades and decades of Zelda games where you don't actually play as Zelda, there was a lot of pressure on a game where you finally get to control the princess herself as the protagonist (those CD-i monstrosities from the '90s are best forgotten). Fortunately, Zelda's turn in full control of her own series captures the franchise's old-school, light-hearted adventuring fun with a few modern twists.</p>
<p>The main draw here is the titular "echo" abilities, which let Zelda copy enemies and objects that can be summoned in multiple copies with a special wand. This eventually opens up to allow for a number of inventive ways to solve some intricate puzzles in what feels like a heavily simplified version of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>'s more complex crafting tools.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>My favorite bit in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, though, might be summoning copies of defeated enemies to fight new enemies in a kind of battle royale. As much as I love Link's sword-swinging antics (which are partially captured here), just watching these magical minions do my combat for me is more than half of the fun in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>.</p>
<p>Even without those twists, though, <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> provides all the old-school 2D Zelda dungeon exploring you could hope for, and the lighthearted storyline to match. Here's hoping this isn't the last time we'll see Zelda taking a starring role in her own legends.</p>

<h2><em>Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story</em></h2>
<p><strong>Digital Eclipse; Windows, PS4/5, Xbox One/Series, Switch</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>I went into this latest Digital Eclipse playable museum as someone who had only a passing familiarity with Jeff Minter. I knew him mainly as a revered game development elder with a penchant for psychedelic graphics and an association with <em>Tempest 2000</em>. Then I spent hours devouring <em>The Jeff Minter Story</em> on my Steam Deck during a long flight, soaking in the full history of a truly unique character in the annals of gaming history.</p>
<p>The emulated games on this collection are actually pretty hit or miss, from a modern game design perspective. But the collection of interviews and supporting material on offer here are top-notch, putting each game into the context of the time and of Minter's personal journey through an industry that was still in its infancy. I especially liked the scanned versions of Minter's newsletter, sent to his early fans, which included plenty of diatribes and petty dramas about his game design peers and the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>There are few other figures in the early history of games that would merit this kind of singular focus—even early games were too often the collaborative product of larger companies with a more corporate focus (as seen in Digital Eclipse's previous <em>Atari 50</em>. But I reveled in this opportunity to get to know Minter better for his unique and quixotic role in early gaming history.</p>

<h2><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em></h2>

<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>You'd be forgiven for finding <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> at least a little pretentious. Everything from the black-and-white presentation—laced with only the occasional flash of red for emphasis —to the <em>Twin Peaks</em>-style absurdist writing to the grand pronouncements on the Importance and Beauty of Art make for a game that feels like it's trying a little too hard, at points.</p>
<p>Push past that surface, though, and you'll find one of the most intricately designed interactive puzzle boxes ever committed to bits and bytes. <em>Lorelei</em> goes well beyond the simple tile-pushing and lock-picking tasks that are laughably called "puzzles" in most other adventure games. The mind-teasers here require real out-of-the-box thinking, careful observation of the smallest environmental details, and multi-step deciphering of arcane codes.</p>
<p>This is a game that's not afraid to cut you off from massive chunks of its content if you're not able to get past a single near-inscrutable locked door puzzle—don't feel bad if you need to consult a walkthrough at some point to move on. It's also a game that practically requires a pen and paper notes to keep track of all the moving pieces—your notebook will look like the scribblings of a madman by the time you're done.</p>
<p>And you may actually feel a little mad as you try to unravel the meaning of the game's multiple labyrinthine layers and self-aware, time-bending, magical-realist storyline. When it all comes together at the end, you may just find yourself surprisingly moved not just by the intricate design, but by that oft-pretentious plot as well.</p>

<p>Good tactics games are all about how the game plays in your mind. How many ways can you overcome this obstacle, maximize this turn, and synergize your squad’s abilities? So it’s a very nice bonus when such a well-made pile of engaging decisions also happens to look absolutely wonderful and capture the incredibly detailed sense of motion of a legendary run-and-gun franchise.</p>

It delivers the look and feel of a franchise that isn’t easy to get right, and it translates those games’ feeling of continuous motion into turn-based tactics. The more you move, shoot, and team up each turn, the better you’ll do. You can do a level or two on a subway ride, crank out a rogue-ish run on a lunch break, and keep getting rewarded with new characters, unlocks, and skill tree branches.</p>
<p>If you’re always contemplating a replay of <i>Final Fantasy Tactics</i>, but might like a new challenge, consider giving this unlikely combination of goofy arcade revival and deep strategy a go.</p>

<h2><em>Parking Garage Rally Circuit</em></h2>
<p><strong>Walaber Entertainment; Windows</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>The rise of popular, ultra-detailed racing sims like <em>Gran Turismo</em> and <em>Forza Motorsport</em> has coincided with a general decline in the drift-heavy, arcadey side of the genre. Titles like <em>Ridge Racer</em> <em>Sega Rally</em> or even <em>Crazy Taxi</em> now belong more in the industry's nostalgic memories than its present top-sellers.</p>
<p><em>Parking Garage Rally Circuit</em> is doing its best to bring the arcade racer genre back single-handedly. The game's perfectly tuned drifting controls make every turn a joyful sliding experience, complete with chainable post-drift boosts for those who want to tune that perfect speedy line. It captures that great feeling of being just on the edge of losing control, while still holding onto the edge of that perfect drift.</p>
<p>It all takes place, as the name implies, winding up, down, over, and through some well-designed parking garages. Each track's short laps (which take a minute or less) ensure you can practically memorize the best paths after just a little bit of play. But the stopped cars and large traffic dividers provide for some hilarious physics-based crashes when your racing line does go wrong.</p>
<p>The game earns extra nostalgia points for a variety of visual effects and graphics options that accurately mimic Dreamcast-era consoles and/or emulation-era PC hardware. But the game's extensive online leaderboards and ghost-racers help it feel like a decidedly modern take on a classic genre.</p>

<h2><em>Pepper Grinder</em></h2>
<p><strong>Ahr Ech; Windows, MacOS, Linux, PS4/5, Xbox One/Series, Switch</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>It's amazing how far a platform game can get on nothing more than a novel control scheme. <em>Pepper Grinder</em> is a case in point here, based around a tiny, blue-haired protagonist who uses an oversized drill to tunnel through soft ground like some kind of human-machine-snake hybrid.</p>
<p>Navigating through the dirt in large, undulating curves is fun enough, but the game really shines when Pepper bursts out through the top layer of dirt in large, arcing jumps. Chaining these together, from dirt clump to dirt clump, is the most instantly compelling new 2D navigation scheme we've seen in years and creates some beautiful, almost balletic curves through the levels once you've mastered it.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with <em>Pepper Grinder</em> is that the game is over practically before it really gets going. And while some compelling time-attack and item-collection challenges help to extend the experience a bit, we really hope some new DLC or a proper sequel is coming soon to give us a new excuse to wind our way through the dirt.</p>

<h2><em>The Rise of the Golden Idol</em></h2>
<p><strong>Color Gray Games; Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, PS4/5, Xbox One/Series, Switch</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>In 2022, <em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em> proved that details like a controllable protagonist or elaborate cut scenes are unnecessary for a good murder mystery-solving puzzle adventure. All you need is a series of lightly animated vignettes, a way to uncover the smallest hidden details in those vignettes, and a fill-in-the-blanks interface to let you piece together the disparate clues.</p>
<p>As a follow-up, <em>Rise</em> moves the 18th-century setting of the original into the 20th century, bringing the mysterious, powerful idol to the attention of both academic scientists and mass media executives who seek to exploit its mind-altering powers. From your semi-omniscient perspective, you have to figure out not just the names and motivations of those pulled into the idol's orbit, but the somewhat inscrutable powers of the idol itself.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p><em>Rise</em> adds a few interesting new twists, like the ability to scrub through occasional video animations for visual clues and the ability to track certain scenes throughout multiple times of day. At its core, though, this is an extension of the best-in-class, pure deductive reasoning gameplay we saw in the original game, with a slightly more modern twist. This is yet another 2024 favorite that requires strong attention to detail and logical inference from very small hints.</p>
<p>It all comes together in a satisfying conclusion that leaves the door wide open for a sequel that we can't wait for.</p>

<h2><em>Satisfactory</em></h2>
<p><strong>Coffee Stain Studios; Windows</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>Danish publisher Coffee Stain makes gaming success seem so simple. Put a game with a goofy feel, a corporate dystopia, and complex systems into early access. Iterate, cultivate feedback and a sense of ownership with the community. Take your time, refine, and then release the game, without any revenue-grabbing transactions or add-ons, beyond fun cosmetics. They did it with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/deep-rock-galactic-celebrates-5-years-by-letting-players-dig-like-its-2018/"><i>Deep Rock Galactic</i></a>, and they’ve done it again with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/satisfactory-hits-1-0-removing-your-last-excuse-to-avoid-falling-in-deep/"><i>Satisfactory</i></a>. By the time the game hit 1.0, the only thing left to add was “Premium plumbing.”</p>
<p>It’s remarkably fun to live on the bad-guy side of <i>The Lorax,</i> exploiting a planet’s natural resources to create a giant factory system producing widgets for corporate wellbeing. The first-person perspective might seem odd for game with such complex systems, but it heightens your sense of accomplishment. You didn’t just choose to put a conveyor belt between that ore extractor and that fabricator; you personally staked out that deposit, and your ran the track yourself.</p>
<p>The systems are incredibly deep, but it can be quite relaxing to wander around your planet-sized industrial park, thinking up ways that things might run better, faster, with no interruptions. It’s the kind of second job you’re happy to buy into, giving you a deep sense of accomplishment for learning the ins and outs of this system, even as it gently mocks you for engaging with it. <i>Satisfactory</i> has itself worked for years to refine the most efficient gameplay for its bravest fans, and now it’s ready to employ the rest of us.</p>

<h2><em>Sixty Four</em></h2>
<p><strong>Oleg Danilov; Windows, Mac</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>I try not to think about, or write about, games in the manner of “dollars to enjoyment ratio.” Games often get cheaper over time, everybody enjoys them differently, and they’re art, too, as well as commerce. But, folks, come on: $6 for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/sixty-four-is-an-idle-clicker-a-factory-sim-and-a-dark-extractive-journey/"><i>Sixty Four</i></a>? If you play it for one hour and just smile a few times at its oddities and tiny cubes, that was less than a big-city latte or beer.</p>
<p>But you will almost certainly play <i>Sixty Four</i> for more than one hour, and maybe many more hours than that if you enjoy games with systems, building, and resources. You build and place machines to extract resources, use those resources to fund new and better machines, rearrange your machines, and eventually create beautiful workflows that are largely automated. Why do you do this? It’s a fun, dark mystery.</p>
<p>The game looks wonderful in its <i>SimCity 2000</i>/<i>3000</i>-esque style. It can be mentally taxing, but you can’t really lose; you can even leave the game window open in the background while you convince your boss or remote work software that you’re otherwise productive. It’s a fever dream I’d recommend to most anybody, unless they dread a repeat of the many lost days to games like <i>Factorio</i>, <i>Satisfactory</i>, or even <i>Universal Paperclips</i>. Just wishlist it, in that case; what could go wrong?</p>

<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/tactical-breach-wizards-weaves-engaging-tactics-with-lively-dialogue/"><i>Tactical Breach Wizards</i></a> adds future-seeing, time-bending, hex-placing wizards, for one thing. It refines the heck out of grid combat, for another, adding window-tossing and door-sealing into the mix, and giving enemies a much wider array of attacks than area-of-effect variations. Finally, it wraps this all up in an inventive sci-fi narrative, one with an engaging plot, characters that reveal themselves one quip at a time, and an overall sense of wonderment at a charming, bizarre world of militarized magic.</p>

<p>In other words, you could put some joy into your turn-based combat, while still offering intricate challenges and clever levels.</p>
<p>Tom Francis’ unique sense of humor, seen previously in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/09/gunpoint-hands-on-an-intelligent-spy-thriller-with-breakable-glass/"><i>Gunpoint</i></a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/ars-technicas-best-video-games-of-2017/2/"><i>Heat Signature</i></a>, is given space here to shine, and it’s a wonderful wrapper for all the missions and upgrade decisions. It’s pretty ridiculous to be a wizard, wielding a laser-scoped rifle that fires crystal energy, plotting how to hit three guards at once with your next blast. <i>Tactical Breach Wizards</i> knows this, jokes about it, and then celebrates with you when you pull it off. It’s both a hoot, and a very good shoot.</p>

<h2><em>UFO 50</em></h2>
<p><strong>Mossmouth; Windows</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>In recent years, modern games have started evoking the blocky polygons and smeary textures of early 3D games to appeal to nostalgic 20- and 30-somethings. <em>UFO 50</em> has its nostalgic foot placed firmly in an earlier generation of '80s and '90s console gaming, with a bit of early '00s Flash game design thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>Flipping your way through the extremely wide variety of games on offer here is like an eminently enjoyable trip through random titles in an emulator's (legally obtained) classic ROMs folder—just set in an alternate universe. There are plenty of shmups and platform games befitting the ostensible gaming era being recreated—but you also get full-fledged strategy, puzzle, arcade, racing, adventure, and RPG titles, on top of a few so unique that I can't find any real historical genre analog for. These well-designed titles evoke the classics—everything from <em>Bad Dudes</em> and <em>Bubble Bobble</em> to <em>Super Dodge Ball</em> and <em>Smash TV</em>—without ever feeling like a simple rehash of games you remember from your youth.</p>
<p>While there's the usual spread of quality you'd expect from such a wide-ranging collection, even the worst-made title in <em>UFO 50</em> shows a level of care and attention to detail that will delight anyone with even a passing interest in game design and/or history. Not every game in <em>UFO 50</em> will be one of your all-time favorites, but I'd be willing to wager that any gamer of a certain age will find quite a few that will eat away plenty of pleasant, nostalgic hours.</p>

		<p>“Yeah, but is it fun?” That’s the question that so often burns into any discussion of a new and upcoming game. You can absolutely have tense and gruelling experiences, explore traumatic narratives, and do so with cutting edge graphics, but so many games put pure enjoyment, fun and satisfying feel first and foremost.</p>
<p>So… which games felt the best and most fun for us in 2024?</p>

<p>One of the reasons why <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> is picking up so many awards this year is that pretty much anyone can play it. If you are old enough to use a controller you can enjoy it, and the mechanics are so simple that anyone can understand them.</p>
<p>Each world brings something new with Astro Bot joined by a companion that enhances his skills in some fashion, floating like a balloon or turning into an indestructible spikey ball. It’s then simple logic – and real world logic at that – which allows you to progress. You need to get higher? Turn into the balloon and float up, simple. There’s no faffing about with special powers or complex button pushing, a single button press and you are on your way. As you progress through the world the use of the power up becomes more integral and you learn how to use it more subtly, culminating in a boss battle that requires you use all the knowledge you have gained over the past few levels.</p>

<p>Astro Bot is also insanely addictive, where finishing the game is just the first step. You then still have the challenge modes and the delightful task of rescuing all the Astro Bots from the many PlayStation games and watching them interact,</p>
<p>Let’s not pretend Astro Bot invented platforming, Nintendo have that honour with Donkey Kong, but Team Asobi have delivered another perfect example of the genre.</p>
<p><em>–&nbsp;Tuffcub</em></p>
<h2>Balatro – Runner-up</h2>
<p>If you’re expecting Balatro to play like a familiar game of Texas hold ’em, then you’ve got another thing coming. Thankfully, that thing is a gorgeously put together roguelite deckbuilder that riffs on poker, rummy, solitaire and so much more. Each stage (blind) that you take on has a score target, where you play hands that dish out chips per card value and multiply that score based on the hand, Joker card modifiers and more.</p>
<p>It’s a satisfying puzzle to unpick, the scores you chase constantly growing, the multipliers increasing, and the oddball modifiers from boss blinds, conditional Jokers and more.</p>
<p>– Stefan L</p>
<h2>3D Don’t Die, Mr. Robot – Runner-up</h2>
<p>If there was one thing I was not expecting this year, it was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/3d-dont-die-mr-robot-review/">3D Don’t Die, Mr Robot</a> being one of the best-playing new games of 2024. A sequel to Don’t Die, Mr Robot, this game is just pure arcade vibes. There’s no story to worry about, no worrying about your character build or gear stats. It is just you, a robot, lots of enemies, and exploding fruit as you chase high scores. 3D Don’t Die, Mr Robot challenges your reactions while wrapped up in an approachable package, with levels that get steadily tougher until you realise a few hours have passed by as you try to chase a level’s platinum trophy.</p>

		<p>Bandai Namco has released a new special trailer for BLEACH Rebirth of Souls, with the sole focus of this trailer being the character Shinji Hirako. It is around two minutes long, with Shinji saying some iconic lines which are voiced by Aleks Le. The trailer also shows the character Hiyori, though going by the gameplay it seems Hiyori will be a move summon for Shinji, rather than a standalone character. However, that could change.</p>
<p><iframe title="BLEACH Rebirth of Souls — Shinji Hirako Special Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fAY1-pUCX2w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Shinji is a captain and one of the Visored, which could mean more of the Visored are going to be added to the roster too. Like the other characters on the roster, Shinji will be able to launch powerful attacks to shift momentum if he is close to being defeated. It is something that will be a core element of BLEACH Rebirth of Souls gameplay.</p>
<p>Three versions of BLEACH Rebirth of Souls are now available to pre-order too. The standard edition is just the game, and will cost £54.99. The Digital Deluxe edition includes the base game, season pass including seven days of early access, and soul crystal set 2, which is used to upgrade player abilities. This edition will cost £79.99. The Digital Ultimate edition includes the base game, season pass including seven days of early access, soul crystal 2 and 3, Thousand-Year Blood War Costume Set and Rebirth of Souls Costume Set. This edition will cost £94.99. Those who pre-order also get the Toshiro and Yoruichi Thousand-Year Blood War costume sets.</p>

<p>BLEACH Rebirth of Souls has been given a release date of March 21st, with the confirmed platforms being PC, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/square-enix-event-rumored-to-take-place-in-february-could-show-kh4-and-more-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been a long while since Square Enix discussed Kingdom Hearts IV. The fourth mainline installment in the action RPG franchise developed in collaboration with Disney was <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-quadratum-ue5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on the series' 20th anniversary, which happened in April 2022. Since then, though, we haven't heard a peep from official sources.</p>
<p>Some in the vast Kingdom Hearts community are understandably getting antsy, especially with the no-show at The Game Awards 2024 earlier this month. However, KH focused YouTuber TheGamersJoint has recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=xUZXN0YVq8o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a rumor about a potential Square Enix event taking place in just two months. Here's the relevant tidbit from his video:</p>
<p><em>Recently, I have actually heard a little tidbit of information. Take this with a grain of salt, but this has come from a source of mine. I'll keep them anonymous, but I have heard the reason why Square Enix were absent from Summer Games Fest along with The Game Awards is because they are planning to start doing their own showcases, with one happening in February.</em></p>
<p><em>At some point, Square Enix are going to need to step forward to say, hey, this is our roadmap for 2025. Looking at an event of their own in February does actually make a lot of sense. Now, of course, I'm not going to put all of my eggs in one basket. I'll believe it when I see it. But we should, if it is going to happen, get an official announcement maybe sometime in early February.</em></p>
<p><em>It's been a long time, though, since Square Enix have done their own presentation. Back in the day, these used to be known as Square Enix Presents, so maybe, possibly, they're bringing back Square Enix Presents.</em></p>
<p>He's definitely right on that count - the last Square Enix Presents was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t30FL8a9KWs&amp;pp=ygUUc3F1YXJlIGVuaXggcHJlc2VudHM%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hosted</a> on June 13, 2021, as part of E3 2021. As for the rest, the YouTuber himself tells his followers to keep their expectations in check. However, it has been a long time indeed since we heard anything new about Kingdom Hearts IV, and it's not the only upcoming title from the Japanese publisher that's been missing in action for a long time. That's certainly also the case for Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate, which was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-development-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in early January 2020. We later learned that DQXII is <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-is-powered-by-unreal-engine-5-story-is-already-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">powered by Unreal Engine 5</a><span> and is&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate-is-being-co-developed-by-orca-dev-is-recruiting-unreal-engine-5-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-developed by Orca</a>, which also helped create</span> the previous entry in the JRPG franchise. However, both news stories are from 2021. The game is certainly overdue for an update from Square Enix.</p>
<p>Returning to Kingdom Hearts IV, we do know a few tidbits of info from the original announcement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Like Dragon Quest XII, it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-quadratum-ue5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">powered by Unreal Engine 5</a>, delivering greatly improved visuals</li>
<li>However, this will limit the amount of playable worlds, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-improved-visuals-will-limit-the-number-of-disney-worlds-tetsuya-nomura-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Square Enix Director Tetsuya Nomura</a></li>
<li>The Keyblade can now transform into a grappling hook to help with traversal</li>
<li>There will be a new 'scrap and build' gameplay mechanics</li>
<li>The daily life of protagonist Sora will be explored in greater detail than before</li>
</ul>
<p>A rumor from a few months ago also <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-nintendo-switch-2-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that the final game will look different from the reveal trailer and that some sort of online functionality will be included. A potential port for the Nintendo Switch 2 was also part of that rumor.</p>
<p>Whether through the rumored February event or at the regular events later in the year, Square Enix are bound to share more about Kingdom Hearts IV and Dragon Quest XII throughout 2025. Stay tuned on Wccftech to get all the latest news and rumors on both titles.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">This year, I decided I'd finally play 2022's Case of the Golden Idol, a mystery game that thrusts you onto the scene of a murder moments after it's happened. You pan through several screens, absorb every detail you possibly can, gather clues in the form of nouns and verbs, and make logic-based deductions by filling in the missing details in passages that tell the story of what occurred there. There are systems in place to guide you in the right direction, and the game begins quite simply, but by its end, I was being pushed to my absolute limit. The first few cases took all of about 10-25 minutes, but the final one in the game seemed to stretch across the span of an entire night. My head was positively bursting with possible motives and culprits, and kudos to Case of the Golden Idol for allowing me the room to be wrong about these cases until I eventually divined the right permutation of terms and cracked the case. It was one of the most frustrating ends of a game ever, and I was enamored of the whole experience.</p><p dir="ltr">I bring up Case of the Golden Idol and this frustration because, overwhelmingly, many of 2024's best games provided me with that very same feeling. These stellar titles, like Animal Well, Rise of the Golden Idol, and Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, are composed of what seems like countless of the most nefarious and confounding puzzles I've come across, some of which still vex and evade me to this day. And yet, despite that recurring headache--brought on by slamming my head into a proverbial wall over and over again--I wouldn't trade the experiences I had with them for anything.</p><p dir="ltr">I was wrong a lot in Rise of the Golden Idol, 2024's sequel to the aforementioned Case. I frequently confused names and aliases, and as the levels grew in scale (and the scenarios grew in complexity), I missed a lot of smaller details in the immaculately rendered environs that had been planted to provide insight and direction. I misunderstood the events of the game on numerous occasions, and was more surprised than usual at the revelations that were revealed by a level's end. Rise of the Golden Idol was thoroughly frustrating, and yet it's clearly one of the best games I've played all year because when I pushed it, it pushed back.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4418886-0007316561-ss_7c.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418886" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4418886-0007316561-ss_7c.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418886"></a><figcaption>The Rise of the Golden Idol</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4418886-0007316561-ss_7c.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>Rise of the Golden Idol's increasingly challenging cases urged me to think harder about the conclusions I was coming to. In my favorite of these cases, a man in an apartment complex is washing what appears to be a bloody stain from his shirt, leading me to believe that he was the epicenter of an inciting event that recently affected this community. Having taken the bait, I operated under the guise that I was correct until the game brutally rejected my conclusion and challenged me to make actual deductions rather than be shepherded to a point via obvious breadcrumb trails. It trusted me to figure things out.</span></p><p dir="ltr">A handful of my favorite games this year similarly refused to provide me with easy and obvious answers. I'm not entirely sure Animal Well has anything even remotely resembling a proper resolution. I mean, there's an ending to work towards, but the game also withholds so many more secrets that I may never see, and that's a thrilling and distinct relationship to have to a game when 100% completion guides are available online within days of a game's release. Animal Well is a mystery I suspect I will never get the satisfaction of fully solving. Instead, I get to fumble around in its dark caves for what seems like an eternity, prodding at its curiosities and objects of interest.</p><p dir="ltr">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes is perhaps the most enigmatic of the bunch. Every door's contents is locked behind another puzzle. Televisions are hooked up to video game consoles that contain hidden directions and clues within their low-poly video games. Every line of dialogue is an esoteric headtrip. Walls are lined with posters that obscure patterns that are keys to boxes. Written notes contain ciphers, and there are otherworldly portals that take you to elaborately constructed mazes. Lorelei and the Laser Eyes is such a defiant game; it absolutely refuses to level with the player, opting instead to frequently demand that they rise to its level, a feat it is confident the player can achieve, in order to unlock its secrets.</p><p dir="ltr">I appreciate the room that these titles and others have given me this year because it feels increasingly rare. Games these days are often criticized for featuring too many tutorials or guideposts, and due to these trends, they can often feel reluctant to let go of the player's hand. Just this year, there have been countless conversations around yellow paint in level design, which is used to funnel players towards objectives and can be a blessing or a curse depending on who you ask. There's no right way to think about this design philosophy, but I do sincerely believe that the industry has erred on the side of hand holding a little too strongly, and it has flattened the experience of playing, or at least, the feelings that play can elicit. Of course, it's worth considering what mold of game I'm talking about when I suggest such a radical shift. Open-world games have a different responsibility to their players than puzzle games do, which could stand in the way of these developers bucking the trends I'm outlining. Still, the hope is that by speaking to the merits of the exemplary design in puzzle and mystery games, that more games of different genres might feel emboldened to pursue similar philosophies. I think it could work to brilliant effect, and in truth, it already has.</p><p dir="ltr">I always come back to The Legend of Zelda and its famously "hidden" bomb walls. The NES couldn't really afford the space for a different texture on these walls, making them appear like any other surface. However, they were in fact hidden across the game's world, incentivizing players to go out and discover them by any means necessary. Eventually, players discovered that by placing bombs at very select segments of walls, they could find hidden rooms and treasures. There's not a doubt in my mind that this was infuriating as all hell, but I also love that the game challenged players to be thoughtful, and in return it rewarded them with wonders beyond what they thought possible.</p><p dir="ltr">I don't believe that enough games--or at least a lot of the titles that take up the general mindshare and which often dominate the conversations we have about the medium-- are really challenging players all that much. That's what makes this trio of games, which all broke into the mainstream, feel like a breath of fresh air. As many titles shunt me from set piece to set piece, allowing very little in the way of exploration of experimentation, I've begun feeling like an observer more than a driving force in the games I play. The same can't be said about Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, Animal Well, or Rise of the Golden Idol, games which made me feel like the best and most capable version of myself. Each of these games is distinct from the other. They occupy different genres and employ different styles, but they're united in their utter belief in the player. My hope is that games that follow, regardless of their genre, size, or developer, can take some cues from these remarkable titles and make strides to cultivate a sense of wonder and discovery again.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ballerina-team-not-setting-out-to-do-a-female-john-wick<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When From the World of John Wick: Ballerina hits theaters in June, it will mark the first film entry in the ever-expanding franchise not led by Keanu Reeves’s titular assassin. Instead Reeves passes the baton (or should we say Glock) to Ana de Armas and her character Eve Macarro, who the team insists is complex and nuanced in her own right and not just a female John Wick clone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">De Armas leads a cast of newcomers featuring Norman Reedus and Gabriel Byrne along with returning faces Reeves, Ian McShane, Anjelica Houston, and the late Lance Reddick.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the heels of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ccxp-2024-everything-announced"><u>a wild panel at CCXP</u></a> last week in São Paulo, Brazil, much of the cast along with director Len Wiseman sat down with IGN to talk about building on the franchise’s mythology, if de Armas could take Reeves in a fight, and how they made a John Wick movie without John Wick himself as the lead.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">From the World of John Wick: Ballerina</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> At the CCXP panel, the fans were really excited to see you all. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ian McShane (Winston Scott): </strong> Delicious. It was delicious.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> With all that energy, what do you think is going to surprise and excite them about Ballerina?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ana de Armas (Even Macarro):</strong> It’s (a) new take on this world. It is changing perspectives and a new point of view in the world that we already know and love. But this time (it’s) through Eve's experience. We’ll see the connection and the timeline, how it intertwines with John Wick.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Len Wiseman (Director):</strong> One of the things that was very important early on was that I was not setting out to do a female John Wick, that John Wick is John Wick. This is an entirely different character, kick-ass (in) her own right. (She’s) a new character within the world, not somebody that's replicating what John Wick does. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> John Wick shows up in some form in Ballerina… </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Norman Reedus (Daniel Pine):</strong> He shows up in human form. In human form. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I was not setting out to do a female John Wick. This is a completely different character. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wiseman: </strong>Eve is looking to become an assassin. (She) starts up with the Ruska Roma, train(s), and becomes an assassin. John Wick is really essentially trying to get out of the world. So that became the building ground of what really set it apart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>McShane:</strong> It’s new but natural. I mean, don't forget, we've met the character before as a girl, but now we meet her as a grown-up. So my character has been keeping tabs on her throughout all these years. So when she appears, (he tries to) dissuade her from a mission in a certain sense as he always does John. Winston's ever, ever enigmatic. And also it's a natural thing. It's nice to turn around instead of looking at Keanu, I look at this gorgeous…</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>De Armas</strong>: Keanu's gorgeous,</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>McShane:</strong> Oh, he's gorgeous too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>De Armas:</strong> Keanu is gorgeous too. We love him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Norman, was there something specific that made you want to join this franchise?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Reedus:</strong> Well, I'm a big fan already. I've worked with Len before. I am friends with Keanu. I'm a big fan of Ana's as well, and the whole franchise. I mean, it's a cool world to be a part of, so it was kind of a no-brainer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Ana, you're no stranger to fight scenes. Can you compare what you've done in Ballerina with what you did with Paloma In No Time To Die? Was there a change in how you approached the action scenes?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>De Armas:</strong> It’s a completely different character. I mean, I loved Paloma. I really wish I had more time in the movie and…</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>McShane: </strong>No, it was perfect. Everybody wanted her to come back again and she never did. But now you come back as a fully fledged “Paloma Two!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>De Armas: </strong>(With) Eve, her motivation behind it all, it's pain. In this case also, I had the time to sink my teeth into the fights and really had time to get better at it. Not just three weeks training. I was training for four or five months. So it was really intense and the stakes (of) the fights and the level of detail and everything. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are very intricate, complicated fights with very imaginative stuff that I have around me to figure out how to defend myself in this male-dominated world. So it's less humor, but also (in) the John Wick universe (there’s) this kind of humor or irony in these scenes. And some things are so crazy that you have to laugh at it because it's bananas. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Every time you check into a hotel, you're on an airplane, John Wick is playing.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>As the series has progressed, the mythology has gotten bigger and more complex. When you're making this movie, how do you balance that with the action scenes the John Wick films have become known for?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wiseman: </strong>One of the things that is very special about the franchise is the mythology and the worldbuilding. There’d be a lot of conversations (with Chad Stahelski, director of the four John Wick movies, and Keanu) about that. We’d say “what if we developed this section that's new to the world?” And so it is a balance. It's fun. I love worldbuilding. So it's challenging, but it's a lot of fun as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>McShane:</strong> The mythology behind it has always been steeped into some kind of movie reality. That's why people love them. Lights go down (for) two hours, you go somewhere else, then the lights go up and you should feel you've been somewhere (else), a little deeper each time. Fans get so obsessed by and now social media, they want to know an answer to everything that happens in a movie. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>De Armas: </strong>When we met John Wick, he's already who he is, and we didn't see him becoming that person. We didn't see him in the Ruska Roma. And how was that training and preparation? And we do see that through Eve. What does it mean to be protected by them or be an outsider? What are the consequences? If you break the rules, who can help you? Who can you trust? So for me, it was interesting to explore a little bit more of the origins of becoming an assassin. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>McShane: </strong>I know (writers) Chad (Stahelski) and Michael (Finch) and Shay (Batten), each time kill off every character apart from Keanu. There are many versions until they decide how it should be going forward. The one thing I'll miss if we do another one is my dear friend Lance Reddick, of course. God bless you brother. But this will be a fitting testament to his character. And he was a great human being. He was a lovely man. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Norman, you've been involved in projects before that have had really hardcore dedicated fan bases. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Reedus: </strong>I think the first time I experienced a rabid fan base was Boondock Saints. That movie, for not coming to theaters, was the most rented Blockbuster DVD ever above Titanic. And we filmed that for like $7 million. It became that successful because of the fan base. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">(With) The Walking Dead, that fan base is crazy. Death Stranding even has a crazy fan base. Of course, (John Wick) has a crazy fan base. Every time you check into a hotel, you're on an airplane, John Wick is playing. I'm sure this will be the same. So bring on the crazy. It's great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>When you're preparing for a role like this in Ballerina, do you approach it differently than your involvement in something like Death Stranding?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Reedus:</strong> That's apples and oranges. (Ballerina) is very physical and very mathematically put together as far as action scenes go. There's a lot of people that help put those types of things together and make them safe and make them spectacular. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">(The) people on a Death Stranding game are behind a computer and the walls are blue and I have a skintight, Lycra body suit on with a camera and balls all over me. And Hideo is going "pick up that baby doll and cry." And I'm like, “why?” And he's like, “look, a whale goes over.” They're totally different. There's nothing to hold onto in a Death Stranding game.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Keanu is God. He's the Baba Yaga.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Ana has trained so much for this, as Keanu did for all of his movies. Could you pick between Ana and Keanu if they faced off against each other? Who would win?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wiseman: </strong>John Wick. John Wick is the Baba Yaga. He has been Eve's character. She's on the rise. She starts to train, so we'll check it in a couple years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Reedus: </strong>There’s John Wick, then there's Keanu. If those crossed, maybe she would win because John would be "I can't. You can have it." You know what I mean?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Ana, with all of the training you've done, do you think you could take Keanu if it came to it in a fight?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>De Armas:</strong> No, he's God. Keanu is God. He's the Baba Yaga.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This piece was combined from two separate interviews and has been edited for clarity.  </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>There’s now a pair of Warhammer 40,000 games that have been given the PS5 Pro treatment, with the recent launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/darktide-ps5-review-warhammer-40k/">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide on PS5</a> having support built in at launch, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/space-marine-2-obelisk-update-adds-free-new-operations-map-ps5-pro-support/">a patch for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> adding new graphics profiles to make the most of the mid-gen console. They’re both great games if Warhammer, hordes and co-op are your jam, but one definitely has a leg up over the other than to the vagaries of PSSR upscaling on PS5 Pro.</p>
<p>Let’s start with Darktide, making its way to PS5 after a period of console exclusivity on Xbox Series X|S, and having recovered from a rocky initial launch on PC in 2022. The grimdark sequel/successor to the Vermintide series does a great job of capturing the Warhammer 40,000 universe’s grimy blend of gothic architecture, sci-fi and malevolent Chaos gods, sending you and your expendable buddies into the Hive world of Tertium to fight Chaos-addled hordes in Left 4 Dead-style co-op.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40K Darktide on PS5 – The problem with PS5 Pro PSSR" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H2UXcuByAO4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>One of the main cuts for the game on console was to cleave out the very costly ray tracing effects from the PC version, and that’s true across the board on PS5 – there’s no ray tracing on PS5 Pro, even – but it’s still a very striking looking game, thanks to the emphasis on its lighting and strong use of colours amidst the darkness to set the tone.</p>
<p>The game on base PS5 looks and feels very similar to the Xbox Series X version, with both fidelity and performance modes. I would suggest that the PS5 has a slight edge in performance, as I felt fewer frame rate hiccups, though all graphical modes have a fair bit of aliasing and there is also&nbsp;a fairly significant amount of detail pop in really quite close to the camera at times.</p>


<p>PS5 Pro comes with just a single mode and no performance options. The aim here is the mid-gen console’s publicised goal of having quality mode visuals and performance mode frame rates. It does a decent job of this, but the leaning on PSSR is Darktide’s undoing here, as the upscaling algorithm introduces more shimmering on edges even when stood still – in fairness this can also happen in the base PS5’s visual modes, though to a lesser degree. The bigger symptom is that there’s just a lot of noise introduced, almost like a film grain filter but at a deeper level, and which is completely unintentional.</p>
<div id="attachment_455587"><p id="caption-attachment-455587">Look to the rafters in the hub between missions, and all of the lit edges shimmer even when stationary.</p></div>
<p>We have to hope that this can be improved in future updates, whether Fat Shark need to do some backend work to better adapt to PSSR or Sony improves the PSSR algorithms.&nbsp;The quickest fix might be to simply let players choose between having PSSR and using the game’s native TAA. If we’re legitimately getting the quality mode resolution or close to it at performance mode’s 60fps, that would be more than good enough!</p>
<p>Space Marine 2 is a whole other kettle of fish, and still offers up both a 30fps quality mode and a 60fps performance mode on PS5 Pro – again assisted by PSSR… but in a good way.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Space Marine 2 PS5 Pro patch is basically perfect (even with PSSR)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JOh7mWOtVbk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Looking strictly at the resolutions, and this PS5 Pro update solves one of the main weaknesses on base PS5, which was rather blurry and soft in its performance mode. Performance mode jumps from a 720p to 1080p base resolution range before FSR2 upscaling to a 1080p to 1440p range with PSSR upscaling.</p>
<p>And in this case, PSSR works absolutely perfectly. Space Marine 2’s implementation looks absolutely pristine with no hint of shimmer or noise – perhaps aided by the solid implementation of FSR 2 previously.</p>

<p>Performance is also improved by the slightly higher CPU clock speed on PS5 Pro, so that performance dips aren’t anywhere near as bad and should be able to stick better within the VRR range that PS5 consoles offer.</p>
<p>PS5 Pro performance mode isn’t a like-for-like in PS5 quality mode fidelity, though. Ground detail seems to be one notch below base PS5 quality mode, and the shadow map cascade and level of detail is also closer to base PS5’s performance mode. So there are tradeoffs being made.</p>

<p>But not for PS5 Pro’s quality mode. This has, per Saber, got a very wide resolution range, from a native 4K all the way down to 1080p, with PSSR there pick up any of the slack, and you can see the jump in shadow quality, better textures and more detail in general very clearly. It looks great, and I also like the very wide resolution target window. This “future proofs” the game so that future consoles with backward compatibility could very easily push the practical window up to 4K almost across the board, and the only thing that would make this better is having a frame rate limit toggle added as well.</p>
<p>All in all, Space Marine 2’s PS5 Pro patch is a success. The console’s improved CPU helps with the frame rate, the GPU powers both resolution and visual detail increases for both graphics options, and PSSR seems to work pretty well in this instance.</p>
<hr>
<p>PSSR is still quite the mystery right now, with some games clearly able to benefit from it very easily, and others plagued with visual issues from its use. It seems that some developers are too quick to jump onto the PSSR bandwagon as a drop-in replacement for TAA, FSR 2 and other anti-aliasing and upscaling techniques, without being able to give a full QA pass to ensure that it’s working at its best. Hopefully it can be improved by Sony to work more universally, but failing that, developers should be more wary in using it and include an optional toggle if they can’t guarantee good performance.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/2024-was-a-slow-year-for-our-fastest-genre<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Around this time last year I criticised The Game Awards for continually <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-best-sports-racing-category-is-an-insult-to-both-genres"><u>forcing racing games to share a common category with sports games</u></a>, to compete for recognition at what’s described (by The Game Awards) as “gaming’s biggest night.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Up until this year it was an award no traditional sports game had ever actually won. The category had been totally dominated by racing games, with the exception of 2015 (Rocket League, which still has cars in it) and 2020 (Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2, which is still… on wheels). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year FC 25 got the gong. Just a single racing game made the shortlist: F1 24. A great racing game, no doubt, but one that’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-24-review"><u>hard to argue was an immediately essential upgrade</u></a> for those who already owned F1 23, or F1 22, or so on. What else could’ve made it? Monster Jam Showdown? Good fun (which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-jam-showdown-review"><u>shouldn’t be surprising</u></a> given the developer’s recent form with the Hot Wheels Unleashed series) but I wouldn’t fancy its chances at The Game Awards. Le Mans Ultimate? Well, that’s still ostensibly in Steam Early Access, even though they’re… already selling in-game DLC before the game’s officially “finished.” Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review"><u>No chance.</u></a> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sad reality is there simply weren’t enough racing games released in 2024, full stop. For the first time I can remember in my nearly 14 years at IGN, we didn’t even hand out an award for the year’s best racer. There just weren’t enough of them to even pad out a list of finalists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sad stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, for clarity, I <em>have </em>had a number of fresh reasons to slide behind a steering wheel this year, but the bulk of these opportunities have arrived as updates to existing racing games I already own. Most months of 2024 have seen an injection of new cars and content for Gran Turismo 7. As is usually the case with GT, not <em>all </em>those cars have had a solid racing pedigree, but I won’t pretend I’m not at least mildly interested in seeing how fast an eight-year-old Toyota Hiace can lap the Nordschleife.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A 2024 expansion to EA Sports WRC added several new cars and two new countries: Latvia and Poland. The new countries feature some excellent stages, and it makes a lot more sense for Codemasters to improve WRC this way than immediately put it on a yearly, F1-style cadence (if only the asking price for the DLC wasn’t as uncomfortably close to the cost of an entirely new game anyway).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I won’t pretend I’m not at least mildly interested in seeing how fast an eight-year-old Toyota Hiace can lap the Nordschleife</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">On the flip side, The Crew Motorfest literally became 50% larger for free, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-crew-motorfest-official-season-5-launch-trailer">all players getting access to the entire island of Maui</a>, added to Motorfest in November. Maui is not a bespoke area; it’s been seamlessly injected into the game’s existing world (and developer Ivory Tower has even added a fantasy connecting bridge, meaning you have a choice to either fly, boat, or drive to Maui from O’ahu without any loading screens. It admittedly hasn’t turned me into a Motorfest regular, but there <em>are </em>some satisfying stretches of road and some nice areas on Maui – which is obviously a lot quieter than the more densely-populated O’ahu.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown has grown in a similar fashion with its Ibiza expansion (although don’t expect a bridge from Hong Kong to the Mediterranean). Solar Crown’s Ibiza map is a fairly small section of the island that may come as a nostalgic bonus for those players who recall blasting around the Spanish party paradise in 2011’s Test Drive Unlimited 2, but it’s hard to say whether it’ll turn around Solar Crown’s slow start. The map, after all, wasn’t Solar Crown’s main problem.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mount Panorama has finally found its way back into Forza Motorsport in its most-recent update, but I have to admit I’m extremely disappointed with all the fake sponsors used throughout the track. It just makes it appear totally inauthentic compared to Bathurst in Assetto Corsa Competizione, Gran Turismo 7, and even Forza Motorsport 7 – all of which feature real sponsors. It feels like a bizarre step backwards for the series, but hopefully it can be redressed. The update arrived along with a bunch of antipodean automobiles that have largely been seen in the series before, but nonetheless appeal to me as a dedicated Australian meathead. There’s only one new car, but it <em>is </em>a great one: a 1991 HSV Commodore VN Group A SV.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24303052/modretro-chromatic-review-game-boy-color-handheld-palmer-luckey<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>If Lockheed Martin made a Game Boy, would you buy one?</p><p>In the 1990s, I was among the kids who thought military aircraft were devastatingly cool. By then, Tom Cruise and <em>Top Gun</em> had long established the F-14 Tomcat and a pair of aviator shades as <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2022/08/11/top-gun-boosted-recruiting-and-brought-tailhook-scandal-so-what-happens-after-blockbuster-sequel.html">a fantasy for young men</a>; I personally preferred the Lockheed F-117A, the high-tech angular “Stealth Fighter” that could invisibly sneak past enemy radar, and was partial to the legendary Lockheed SR-71 that flew so fast it could outrun missiles.</p><p>At the time, I probably would have snapped up a jet-black Lockheed Game Boy without a second thought. But I’m old enough now to realize that cool aerodynamics are just the tip of a deadlier geopolitical iceberg. Lockheed makes <em>weapons</em>, and I don’t have a say in who gets to buy them or who they’re used against. I don’t have a say in whether that tech should exist at all.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Link (cable) to the past.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>I’ve been thinking about Lockheed Martin as I review a much simpler gadget: the ModRetro Chromatic. The Chromatic is a high-end remake of Nintendo’s Game Boy, and it might be the best version of a Game Boy ever made. But it’s connected to a company much like Lockheed:&nbsp;Anduril, the defense contractor that makes weaponized drones, networked surveillance systems, and other military tech.</p><p>Both Anduril and ModRetro are founded by Palmer Luckey,&nbsp;the creator of the Oculus Rift VR headset.<strong> </strong>Luckey is now an <a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/feature/american-vulcan-palmer-luckey-anduril">almost unbelievable character</a>, a devout anime and video game lover who reportedly stores his vast collection of games in a decommissioned US nuclear missile silo — one of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/la-influential/story/2024-06-30/palmer-luckey-anduril#:~:text=And%20then%20there%20are%20the%20nuclear%20missile%20silos.">several silos he says he owns</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>Luckey, playing a Chromatic and surrounded by anime figurines, from </em><a href="https://twitter.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1797662883914154212"><em>his marketing video</em></a><em>. </em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: ModRetro</cite></p></div><p>He plays with a lavish collection of military hardware including helicopters and a Mark V Special Operations Craft used by Navy SEALs. He once <a href="https://time.com/3987059/in-the-latest-issue-41/">made the cover of <em>Time Magazine</em></a> as a floating barefoot “visionary” with an Oculus headset atop his head, though these days he’s more likely to make headlines <a href="https://gizmodo.com/im-a-propagandist-palmer-luckey-on-the-future-of-warfare-2000506276">propagandizing for</a> his version of the defense industry. He was the face of VR before Facebook kicked him out. (Luckey was an early <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15366500/palmer-luckey-trump-donations-chrono-trigger-oculus">Trump booster</a><strong> </strong>and took flak for funding a single Hillary Clinton-trolling billboard; Mark Zuckerberg denied he was fired for his political views at the time; some Meta execs have <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/metas-apologizes-oculus-founder-palmer-luckey-ousting/">since apologized</a> for his ouster.)&nbsp;</p><div><p>Many tech companies are involved with military projects in some shape or form. Google and Amazon have a contract with Israel for a “Project Nimbus” that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24311951/google-project-nimbus-internal-documents">Google knew could have enabled human rights violations against Palestinians</a>, and Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/30/24145680/google-workers-fired-project-nimbus-protest-nlrb-complaint">has fired many workers</a> for protesting that deal. Microsoft is currently working towards <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18236116/microsoft-hololens-army-contract-workers-letter">outfitting over 100,000 soldiers</a> with a militarized version of its HoloLens headset. Meta <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24287951/meta-ai-llama-war-us-government-national-security">is now letting defense contractors</a> use its Llama AI model. I think it’s fair to say few of us boycott these companies or even think about these things when we use their products.</p></div><p>But where each of these companies can plausibly say “It’s just business” as they defend their cloud server<strong> </strong>contracts or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24282719/tech-leaders-trump-jeff-bezos-zuckerberg-pichai">when their CEOs</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320643/sam-altman-is-donating-to-trumps-inauguration-too">kiss</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319768/meta-1-million-donation-trump-inauguration">the</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320063/amazon-is-donating-1-million-to-trumps-inauguration">ring</a>, and it’s <a href="https://gizmodo.com/i-tried-to-block-amazon-from-my-life-it-was-impossible-1830565336">very hard to escape Big Tech’s orbit</a>, this is a fun but unnecessary product from a man with a specific point of view on weapons, war, and politics. Luckey has twice hosted fundraisers for Donald Trump (in 2020 and 2024) at his own house. He publicly expresses the fervent (and self-serving) belief that tech companies should get in bed with the military.</p><p>For Luckey, it’s not just business, it’s <em>personal</em>. And we’ve heard loud and clear that it’s personal for many of our readers, too. I’ve been testing the ModRetro Chromatic for over a month, and it’s <em>very</em> good. I believe it’s the best, most luxurious way to play Game Boy and Game Boy Color games. But if the goal is to restore and preserve our childhood nostalgia, the Luckey connection throws a wrench in the works. What you’re about to read is a real review of an excellent product, one I genuinely enjoyed using — but one that left me feeling somewhat tortured in the process.</p><p>For Luckey, the Game Boy itself is personal. It’s how he got his start. Before Anduril, before Facebook, before Oculus, Palmer Luckey was a teen who modded Nintendo Game Boys. “ModRetro” was the name of the very first thing he founded: an online forum for gaming hardware modders like himself.</p><p>So as you’d expect, his company has some strong ideas about what a modern Game Boy should look like.</p><p>Where <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">the $220 Analogue Pocket</a> seeks to update the Game Boy experience for the present day —&nbsp;with support for other handheld cartridges, ROMs, save states, a TV dock, and so on —&nbsp;the Chromatic stays squarely rooted in the handheld’s past. There are few modern amenities here. It’s designed to <em>feel</em> like a vintage Game Boy, only now with the rough edges sanded off.</p><p>Nintendo’s easy-to-scratch casings, screen lenses, and buttons? They’re made of metal, sapphire, and PBT plastic now. Those hard-to-see screens? You now get a custom IPS display at the same size, resolution, and pixel structure as the original Game Boy and Game Boy Color, one so bright you can play in direct sunlight like we did back in the day. It does come, however, with a brand-new copy of <em>Tetris </em>that optionally adds T-Spins, instant drops, and the ability to hold pieces for later, modernizing the classic game that famously came bundled with the original.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Direct sunlight on the Chromatic’s screen.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>At its heart, the Chromatic is an attempt to faithfully cross the original 1989 Game Boy with the 1998 Game Boy Color. There’s no SD card reader, no user-accessible operating system, no ability to add or play ROMs: when you slide the top-mounted power switch, it instantly boots your Game Boy or Game Boy Color cartridge using a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip that emulates an actual Game Boy’s processors. Like with the Analogue Pocket, the upshot is more responsive, quirk-free gameplay than software emulators allow.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m a parent, and “I don’t have time for this shit” comes with the territory, so I immediately assumed I would miss “save states,” the feature that lets practically every video game emulator and retro handheld pause and resume your game at literally any moment.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->10</p><p><figcaption><em>Hardware comparison gallery: Chromatic next to the originals. (3D-printed stand designs </em><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/joshnoodles/designs"><em>by Joshnoodles</em></a><em>.)</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Then I fired up <em>Pokémon Pinball </em>on an Analogue Pocket, and found I was wrong. I was on a pokémon-catching roll like never before. I caught Charmander, my daughter’s favorite pokémon, and for the first time in <em>Pinball</em>, I evolved it into a Charmeleon, then a Charizard, all without losing my ball. The stakes were high, so I reflexively tapped the Save State shortcut so I could retry if I failed.</p><p>Immediately, the pressure was off — but I felt a chunk of my excitement vanish along with it. I caught those Pokemon fair and square without loading the save, but I’d <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-cheated-not-only-the-game-but-yourself">cheated myself</a> of a pure victory, even if I didn’t wind up cheating the game. When I stuck that same game back into the Chromatic, a handheld without save states, the excitement came back. This is the way the game is meant to be played, and those stakes are there by design. That’s the experience ModRetro wants you to have,&nbsp;and the only one you’ll get. Ditching that modern amenity is a choice, and it isn’t for everyone.</p><p>It’s just one of many ways the Chromatic feels more authentic. Even though it’s a mash-up of two different Game Boy models, it instantly feels familiar in ways the Analogue doesn’t, from the sliding power switch and volume dial (the Analogue has you hold down closely spaced digital buttons and takes longer to start a game) to the button layout and feel.</p><p>The Chromatic is basically the size of a Game Boy Color, with the same bulging battery compartment curve providing a rounded perch for your fingers to rest. But it’s clearly been designed for those who appreciate the original 1989 model too. It’s got the original’s iconic slanted, cake-sprinkle Start and Select buttons, its glossy domed A and B buttons, its larger D-pad, its more protected cartridge slot, and the rounded lower-right corners of its flat-faced chassis and cover glass. All of them bring me back to the handheld that made me a gamer.&nbsp;</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The D-pad and start/select have a very different texture, but they feel great.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p>I wonder if they bring Luckey back to his early days, too. Because while ModRetro appears to have made a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/106916/modretro-chromatic-better-than-the-game-boy-color-it-emulates">remarkably repairable handheld</a> and is currently <a href="https://modretro.com/pages/downloads">open-sourcing its CAD files and firmware</a>, this bespoke device is not exactly what ModRetro was originally created to make.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Luckey cut his teeth turning <em>existing</em> Game Boys and GameCubes into arguably better, more portable versions of themselves by reusing bits of old and new electronics. “It’s a lot of fun because it’s about taking old technology and then cutting out the old parts, replacing them with new parts and making it into something that was never possible before,” he told <a href="https://voicesofvr.com/5-palmer-luckey-on-modretros-influence-on-oculus-vr-the-oculus-subreddit-facebook-acquisition-reactions-the-future-of-vr/"><em>Voices of VR</em></a> in 2014. The ModRetro Chromatic is all custom, though, right down to its in-house screen.&nbsp;</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Palmer Luckey, age 16, with modded GB Pocket.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Still, ModRetro’s original approach to development has been on display throughout Luckey’s professional history. Luckey’s key insight with the Oculus Rift was that low-cost smartphone components could finally make VR accessible, a belief <a href="https://www.markbolas.com/blank">he shared with researchers at the lab where he worked</a>, too. Repurposed commercial supply chains are also Anduril’s pitch to become the world’s most efficient weapons manufacturer, “so that the same processes used to build fiberglass bathtubs can just as easily be reconfigured to build missile airframes,” <a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/feature/american-vulcan-palmer-luckey-anduril">as <em>Tablet Magazine</em> described it</a> in August.</p><p>With that approach, Anduril has rapidly built out an arsenal in just seven years, including multiple drones that can kill — one is a “loitering munition” that remotely dive-bombs a target, another effectively a recoverable ground-to-air missile.&nbsp;</p><p>When I look at the Chromatic and its prominent “MODRETRO” logo right above the screen, often I just see an excellent Game Boy. But sometimes I see the latest high-tech product from a man who makes high-tech missiles.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, you might be wondering: just how excellent is this hardware to justify all this soul-searching? Let’s start with build quality:</p><div><ul><li>It’s made of metal, not plastic, which can seem a little cold at first touch, but I can’t overstate how solid and premium this gadget feels. The build is incredible.</li><li>I even intentionally dropped a Chromatic twice onto concrete, from 4.5 feet, without destroying it. More on that in a sec.</li><li>The battery latch is a physical spring-loaded lever, which takes a little getting used to, but has such a satisfying snap.</li><li>Unlike every official Game Boy, there’s no front speaker grille. But unlike all my official Game Boys, the bottom-facing speaker is loud, crisp, and clear.</li><li>The Start/Select buttons are no longer pliable mushy rubber, but rather PBT plastic with the same firm clicky presses as A and B.</li><li>The volume dial is big and easy to find and use by feel alone.</li><li>The battery compartment is nearly the same thickness as the original Game Boy’s, giving it a beefier grip than any Game Boy since (though not quite enough for my friends with big hands).&nbsp;</li><li>The D-pad, a bit of a sore spot for some Analogue Pocket enthusiasts because it can sometimes allow accidental inputs, feels tight and responsive – almost too firm, mine wore in after many hours of play.</li><li>When I tested it against an Analogue Pocket at the same brightness, using rechargeable AAs, the Chromatic lasted three entire hours longer. (You can watch a sped-up timelapse in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/verge/reel/DCjvFOQJhcB/">my Today I’m Toying With video</a>.)</li><li>I simply plug the Chromatic into USB if I’m ever running low on charge — at under three watts of power draw, any old port will do! I powered it from my phone.&nbsp;</li><li>I could even <em>hotswap</em> AA batteries that way. Plug it in, swap AAs, unplug, all without losing my game.&nbsp;</li></ul></div><p>The Chromatic’s pixel-perfect screen isn’t strictly necessary: I generally had just as good a time on the Analogue Pocket’s bigger, higher resolution display if I enabled the right filters and color palettes, though I did appreciate that the Chromatic got the Game Boy Color feel just right out of the box. The Chromatic even <a href="https://modretro.com/pages/chromatic-manual?srsltid=AfmBOoo-klp0wAw3FLaFKGN3rJ4z_6LVT_nLIV0E2O6ZyBp8mHaj0l2F">lets you summon green-tinted original Game Boy palettes</a> by holding down buttons at boot.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->10</p><p><figcaption><em>Screen comparison gallery time! The Chromatic’s subpixels are visible in this macro image (though the yellows are a little yellower in real life). </em><a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25749229/eyedropper_pokemon_chromatic.jpg"><em>Tap this link for a larger image</em></a><em>.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>There are also some ways it’s not completely faithful to the original Game Boys, just FYI:</p><div><ul><li>There’s no longer a visible gap between the screen crystal and the LCD, and the screen is no longer a blank green or grey when powered off. It’s a laminated black mirror like modern phones.</li><li>While it’s largely the size of a Game Boy Color, it’s nearly as heavy as a fully loaded original Game Boy at 10 ounces (285g). Compare to 7.5oz / 212g for the Game Boy Color.</li><li>There’s an extra button beneath the volume dial that lets you change brightness, turn on <a href="https://modretro.com/pages/chromatic-manual?srsltid=AfmBOoqMa9GbAwzA5uy5EkUmXhkPK7IzLXtNmYnLKbfGD9dI5bn3CKaz#:~:text=Link%20Cable-,System%20Settings,-Hotkeys">frame blending and USB color correction</a> and… that’s about it for now.</li><li>You get a Game Boy Color-sized Link Cable connector, but with the extra notch of the Game Boy Advance’s connector for potentially more compatibility with other Game Boy gadgets.</li><li>You get two lanyard/charm holes, one on each side of the system, unlike the Color’s one on the left.</li><li>The battery compartment takes three AAs, not four or two.</li><li>There’s no longer a red power LED staring you in the face, but rather a multicolor LED on the bottom that only turns on for boot, low battery, and charging.</li><li>The Game Boy Color infrared port’s been slightly moved to accommodate the power switch.</li></ul></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The handheld comes with three AAs and a battery door that uses flexible fins to keep them from getting dislodged.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>And there were a few minor disappointments too. Mostly, I wish it worked a little better in quiet bedrooms and loud airplanes. The buttons and even the D-pad click louder than any of my old Game Boys, yet the 3.5mm headphone jack volume is the <em>quietest</em> of the pack. I could barely hear its chiptunes over the din of the plane, and I couldn’t compensate with my noise-canceling Bose QC25 since the Chromatic doesn’t have a four-pole headset jack.</p><p>ModRetro also advertises the Chromatic as “indestructible,” and if that sounds like marketing bluster, you’re at least half right. I dropped the Chromatic twice onto concrete, from 4.5 feet, and it came away with only minor dents, and I was impressed. But ModRetro also has <a href="https://modretro.com/products/chromatic-tetris-bundle?variant=47637522678062#:~:text=A%20handheld%20that%27s%20indestructible">a picture of the thing</a> getting run over by a car. When I ran it over with <em>my</em> car, the screen shattered. The frame is now badly bent.&nbsp;</p><p>I was also a tad disappointed to find the Chromatic’s USB-C port isn’t as potent as promised. While the company advertised USB-C video output and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170572/modretro-chromatic-game-boy-color-palmer-luckey-price-release-date#:~:text=he%20also%20told%20me%20you%20can%20even%20recharge%20your%20NiMH%20AA%20batteries%20over%20USB%2DC">even told me you could charge rechargeable AAs</a> using the do-it-all port, it turns out the Chromatic can only present itself as a webcam for desktop-style video recording, and NiMH AA charging didn’t make the cut. ModRetro CEO Torin Herndon, who was an engineer at Anduril from 2017 to 2021, tells me the company is beginning production on an optional rechargeable lithium-ion battery pack, but won’t talk price, capacity, or runtime just yet.</p><p>That said, I actually find I prefer AAs. At 50 percent brightness — far higher than I needed on the plane — I saw over eight hours from a set of Ikea-branded Panasonic Eneloop rechargeables, or closer to seven hours from Amazon Basics alkalines. That same brand of alkalines gave me over 12 hours at the second-lowest brightness setting, the dimmest I’d want to use in the daytime, and just under five hours at max brightness and max volume. And again, you can simply plug the Chromatic into a USB port if you’re ever running low on charge, then drop in new AAs without losing your game.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Yes, I’m really powering the entire handheld from my flip phone.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>There’s really no question in my mind that this handheld is the best retro Game Boy yet made, the one that best captures the physical feeling I had playing Game Boy as a kid. I <em>love</em> remasters because they can let you recapture that childhood joy, playing with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23173235/lego-galaxy-explorer-90th-anniversary-birthday-price-release-date#:~:text=With%20the%20Galaxy%20Explorer%2C%20says%20Psiaki%2C%20the%20goal%20was%20to%20trigger%20nostalgia%20by%20building%20the%20ship%20you%20think%20you%20remember">the Lego starship</a> or<em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21207441/final-fantasy-7-remake-ff7-review-ps4"><em>Final Fantasy </em>game</a> you think you remember instead of the one that actually existed.</p><p>But I don’t remember my childhood nostalgia coming with a side of possible guilt and fear about putting money into the pocket of a weapons contractor. Feels weird!&nbsp;</p><p>Even practically, I wonder who, outside of a handful of 1989 handheld lovers like me, would want a handheld that <em>just</em> plays Game Boy and Game Boy Color carts. Many of the best games are expensive and hard to find in physical form — <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> and the best <em>Pokémon</em> titles can easily command $100 each — and it’d be a more compelling gadget if it could play the arguably better library of Game Boy Advance titles as well. The Analogue Pocket does.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The only way GBA carts fit in the Chromatic: sideways. ModRetro </em><a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/09/modretro-is-certainly-going-to-create-an-fpga-game-boy-advance"><em>has said</em></a><em> it wants to tackle the GBA separately.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Luckey has said he wants to expand that original Game Boy library. Game developers never quite stopped making homebrew games for the Game Boy, and ModRetro is one of the few now publishing them on actual carts. Every Chromatic comes with a new copy of <em>Tetris</em>,<em> </em>and you can <a href="https://modretro.com/collections/games">already order 10 more titles</a>, including a new version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Tori"><em>Toki Tori</em></a> and <a href="https://joelj.itch.io/talesofmonsterland"><em>Tales of Monsterland</em></a>, sequels to <a href="https://horatiunyc.itch.io/traumatarium?ac=qfCyYFQF-yt"><em>Traumatarium</em></a> and <a href="https://pearacidic.itch.io/in-the-dark"><em>In the Dark</em></a>, and my personal favorite, the grindy JRPG <a href="https://spacebot-interactive.itch.io/dragonyhm"><em>Dragonyhm</em></a><em> </em>with some excellent tunes and pixel art.</p><p>This chiptune in particular, Dragonyhm’s “Gonrad Forest,” captivated me at once:</p><p>If you feel weird about ModRetro, you should know these games aren’t exclusive to the Chromatic, either — they played perfectly well plugged into an Analogue Pocket or a Game Boy Color, and some even worked on my 1989 original. Some may be available to <a href="https://patmorita.itch.io/hermano-game-boy">purchase as ROMs</a>. If you just want to try them, many have <a href="https://joelj.itch.io/tales-of-monsterland-dx">playable demos</a> you can try in an emulator, or even <a href="https://spacebot-interactive.itch.io/dragonyhm">a web browser</a>, like this:</p><p><small><em>On a desktop, tap to focus; press Enter to start; use Z, B, and arrow keys to play.</em></small></p><p>It’s not clear to me how serious Luckey is about funding a new era of Game Boy. For one thing, the Chromatic is already sold out at his website, and <a href="https://x.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1869538969022787704">he says</a> he isn’t making any more, but will focus on releasing new games while it builds <a href="https://x.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1869538970704679267">“something more sustainable”</a> in terms of hardware instead. (<a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fretro-consoles%2Fproducts%2Fmodretro-chromatic-gamestop-exclusive%2F20014956.html">A grey Chromatic</a> is still available at GameStop, for now.)</p><p>Second, as far as I can tell, all of ModRetro’s games beyond <em>Tetris</em> were already in development; some, like <em>Dragonyhm</em>, were already <a href="https://www.play-asia.com/dragonyhm/13/70gphb?srsltid=AfmBOoo7uRqQEcvAvT9aEixG9dEhAoeId2n4CjJZTm_MwDDbQgVXmfXr">headed to cartridge elsewhere</a>. Developing new games isn’t currently a company goal: “We are typically looking for games deep in development at this time, and try to push them across the finish line into being a full-on physical good,” Herndon tells me. He says ModRetro largely pays to create cartridges, boxes, and manuals, and gives developers a “pretty awesome” percentage of sales. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>The cartridges I tested — including 11 from ModRetro itself.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The pre-release carts that ModRetro sent me also had a couple issues that are hopefully getting ironed out: I mysteriously lost my entire save in <em>In The Dark 2</em>, and <em>Traumatarium Penitent</em> was missing a key bugfix the developer made almost a year ago. <em>Toki Tori</em> also booted into a full screen glitch the first few times I started it up, but it seems to be working now. </p><p>Even when people love the idea of revisiting the Game Boy and supporting retro game development, I suspect most will see a $200 handheld that makes you individually swap pricy cartridges as a luxury they can’t afford — not when every iPhone and a mountain of Chinese emulator handhelds can play the same games, ones they can (illicitly) download for free.&nbsp;</p><p>And if you find the Analogue Pocket isn’t vintage enough for your tastes, you could always do what I just did and add a modern backlit screen to your genuine Nintendo Game Boy. It won’t be pixel-perfect, but it might be good enough for me:</p><p>This is one of the more difficult reviews I’ve ever had to write, because I have no qualms recommending the ModRetro Chromatic on the strength of its hardware, which justifies its $200 price. It feels more like the Game Boy I remember than many of Nintendo’s actual handhelds when I pick them up today.</p><p>But like the Tesla Cybertruck, it’s also very much the product of one person in particular, a person who stands for <em>other</em> things that might clash with your ideals, and it could wind up being a symbol that you don’t terribly mind any of that, even if you actually do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Luckey <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flEhMMJ4qoU">recently told</a> a Pepperdine University audience that it’s not a bad thing to celebrate the power of weapons, saying that “societies have always needed a warrior class that is enthused and excited about enacting violence on others in pursuit of good aims,” and that “you need people like me who are sick in that way and who don’t lose any sleep making tools of violence.” He explained that his company is named Anduril after Aragorn’s sword in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> partly because that sword was “inherently<em> </em>good,” and “wielded only by the kingdom of man against the hordes of Mordor.”<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p><p>Real life contains no inherently good drones or inherently good missiles. And two major throughlines of Tolkien’s work are that war is hideous and that power inevitably corrupts. The joy I find playing with fake swords in the ModRetro Chromatic is now weirdly intertwined with a general fear: that Anduril’s real weapons might be misused. I won’t suggest that niche $200 Game Boys are actually <em>funding</em> those weapons in any meaningful way, but these still aren’t emotions I associate with my childhood Nintendo experience.&nbsp;</p><p>That means the Chromatic isn’t the ultimate Game Boy, even if it has the best build quality and the best screen. There’s still room for a better pair of rose-tinted glasses than the ones Luckey has paid to create.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Photography by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>At first glance, Crow Country is a nostalgia piece. It pulls on the horrific sprawl of Resident Evil, populating its theme-park setting with brain twisters and monsters contorting into human shapes. It borrows from the toy aesthetic of Final Fantasy VII, its characters rendered in blocky, plastic proportions like Playmobil. Yet, it's more than just a throwback, it lays bear the haunted roots of nostalgia culture.</p><p dir="ltr">Protagonist Mara Forest visited the titular theme park as a child, but it was not a happy experience. There, a strange man bit her and she gained some terminal illness, which is slowly killing her. She has returned to make things right, find out what happened, and stop it from happening again. She returns to what was, only fleetingly, a site of childhood joy. She finds death, its shadows, its echoes, its remnants.</p><p dir="ltr">Crow Country's entire setting is a place of childhood play. The park is clearly designed for small children. It lacks thrilling high-rise roller coasters and is instead populated by graveyard ghoulies, thicket mazes, and fairy-tale stage shows. It's all playful and encouraging. Even the "Haunted Hilltop" section of the park is more trick-or-treat than Horror Nights. But without the bustle of life--the parents and children to animate it--the park gains an eerie quality. This is not an original observation, of course. Theme parks are a common setting throughout horror, but Crow Country begins at the park's gates and ends when Mara leaves them once again. The whole game is enveloped by this childhood environment. It is in the contrast between the toy aesthetic and its eeriness--between theme park and haunted house--that Crow Country builds its horror.</p><p dir="ltr">Crow Country departs from its influences in that it does not have fixed camera angles. Instead, each room is a miniature diorama. The angle mimics peering over a dollhouse, lifting off the roof to see inside. For a time, the world outside is distant; you only see this room, its little objects, and its traps and puzzles. This is, of course, true of most video games, where there are only so many places you can go, but Crow Country draws its lines decisively and artificially, much like its theme-park setting. Yet, the theme park is continuous--interlocked. Like any survival-horror game, it is a set of keys and locks, each contingent on the other, one door opening another. Crow Country's world is a microcosm, apparently siphoned off, but actually the wider world in miniature.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413137-crowcountry2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413137" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413137-crowcountry2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413137"></a><figcaption>Mara kneels in front of a collapsed young man in the opening moments of Crow Country. She says she's here to help.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413137-crowcountry2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Crow Country spoilers ahead.</strong></em></p><p dir="ltr">Fittingly, the theme park itself is deceptively large, intercut with hallways and dug under with hidden depths. Mara wanders through backstage rooms and offices as much as playgrounds and rollercoasters. Eventually, she descends to the park's secret mining facilities, an underground environment made of metal scaffolds and endless abysses. Much like Resident Evil's manor, Crow Country has a secret industrial heart. However, much like the theme park itself, the mine is segmented. Each section holds a "root," a large tentacle-like object made of precious metals that the park's owner, Edward Crow, has been secretly mining. As the game progresses, the theme park becomes dirtier, overwhelmed with monsters, laced with traps and obstacles. The sun sets. The park turns as dark as the abyss below.</p><p dir="ltr">That structure, from the world above to the world below, and from day to night, mimics the game's plot, in which hidden things come to light. Edward discovered the roots touring the land with his father, wriggling in the dirt by their campsite. As an adult, he began to mine them, obscuring the operation with a cover story about a mine in Brazil. But then the creatures started coming through. Edward quickly discovered the creatures are, in fact, human beings. Edward Crow's mining of the portal has distorted what goes through it. The more the portal was mined, the more it stretches out, blob-ifies, and melts the people who pass through it. They cannot speak--only reach--and their touch contaminates. The portal is to the future: a prophetic warning of disaster and the planet rendered uninhabitable. But Edward keeps mining, obscuring this truth rather than spreading it widely.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet Edward has a curious reverence for the portal. He calls the creatures who come through it "guests," almost like they are visiting the theme park. One root he leaves intact, building a shrine for his childhood discovery. The rest he mines out, leaving them gaping like severed limbs. That might seem a curious contradiction, but it is mutually reinforcing. His own past is all that matters to Crow; the rest can rot.</p><p dir="ltr">Crow Country taps into a vein the rest of culture is also mining. The recent novel Birnam Wood concerns a billionaire secretly mining lithium underneath a New Zealand national park, an echo of Crow's extraction. Nobody would bat an eye at a reclusive millionaire having mining assets in Brazil, but a mountain of gold from a US backwater? That might be controversial. Both works call into question what violence is further unseen, when it's in countries outside of the global North.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413138-crowcountry3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413138" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413138-crowcountry3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413138"></a><figcaption>In a darkened hallway, Mara takes aim at one of Crow Country's creatures.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413138-crowcountry3.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Crow Country has parallels to Alan Moore's "Illuminations" as well, which is a short story that concerns a middle-aged man traveling back to the pier of a childhood vacation, only to be horrified when he finds himself actually traveling back to the past. The story turns nostalgic longing into pure terror: the kind of thing only a fool would actually want. Returning to the past with the knowledge you have now means returning as you are now, not as a wiser past you--an adult in child's garb.</p><p dir="ltr">Crow Country builds out a span between secretive economic exploitation and a personal longing for the past. Edward Crow's mission is in exact contrast to those of "the guests." They transport themselves from the future to the past to try to save it. In contrast, Edward maintains an imagined past to destroy the future. The one section of the park that is inaccessible is an unbuilt sci-fi section a la Tomorrowland. The future is unknown, far off, and those with the actual power to predict who are suffering the future's atrocities cannot be heard. Notably, Crow Country was not always called such. It used to be called Condor Country, presumably by its native inhabitants. That past is totally lost, completely overwritten, only found in Crow's own admission that the land was not always his. Nostalgia is by nature selective, often violent in what it chooses to omit.</p><p dir="ltr">To be clear, Crow Country is not exactly a startling work of horror. It is cute, and at times cuddly and warm like a worn VHS tape. But its treatment of nostalgia gives it hues, depths, and darknesses. That is what is so scary about it. It is that refusal to be merely cute, its desire to remember but not to commemorate, that makes it such a textured and lovely work. Any game looking to the past to make a future has a lot to learn from it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>
