Here's the official description of the book:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>On a bitter-cold day, in the December of his junior year at Harvard, Sam Masur exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of people waiting on the platform, Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn’t heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom. These friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster, Ichigo. Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won’t protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their hearts. Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach, California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin’s contemporary classic examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love. Clever, nostalgic and quietly profound, TOMORROW, AND TOMORROW, AND TOMORROW explores what it means to play—and keep playing—through everything life throws at you.</em></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/18/tomo-cover-flat-1763472774479.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We can also debut an exclusive excerpt from Zevin's new introduction, which offers insight into Zevin's gaming background and how that inspired the novel.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Without a shadow of a doubt, Call of Duty is primarily a multiplayer game. Following the meteoric rise of the original Modern Warfare’s PvP, the series has become an industry behemoth, and its success is entirely down to its online modes. And yet, year after year, Activision has dedicated a significant amount of cash to funding elaborate single-player campaigns. As someone who grew up on the likes of Half-Life and Halo, these campaigns are the reason I’ve come back to Call of Duty year in, year out. Sure, it’s been a rocky relationship, but it’s been worth enduring for the really good ones – like last year’s fantastically orchestrated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review">Black Ops 6</a>, with its conveyor belt of exciting mission concepts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this year is different. Black Ops 7 specifically brands its story mode as a “co-op campaign,” and has been designed around a four-person squad. As our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">review</a> points out, it is a significantly worse experience solo, to the point we could never recommend playing it alone. And so the entire Call of Duty package this year is multiplayer, a fact that has me wondering about the future of the series. Has it finally given in to the writing on the wall? Is COD single-player over?  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Co-op support does not always spell the death of solo play. Halo and Gears of War have both built legacies on campaigns that support both equally. But in Black Ops 7, developers Raven Software and Treyarch haven’t made a classic Call of Duty campaign that can be played with a couple of buddies. The mission structure is fundamentally different from the series’ traditional template. There are none of the scripted cinematic moments that have defined Call of Duty’s reputation, nor the experimental concepts that characterised last year’s campaign. Instead, the entire mission pool is geared around simplistic corridor shooting and bullet sponge boss fights – scenarios that are easy to orchestrate with multiple players who are potentially more interested in chatting than engaging with a plotline. Perhaps understandably, trying to support multiple players across something as delicately railroaded as Modern Warfare’s iconic stealth affair, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-all-ghillied-up-changed-call-of-duty-forever-art-of-the-level">All Ghillied Up</a>, or as attention-dependent as last year’s social espionage-flavoured Most Wanted, was considered a flight of fancy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, a great deal of Call of Duty’s foundational campaign DNA has been replaced. And by that I don’t just mean the addition of online infrastructure that eliminates the series’ atmospherically vital AI-controlled squadmate characters, and enforces no pausing and being kicked after a period of inactivity. No, I mean the introduction of enemy types with healthbars and, in the case of the new Endgame mode that caps off the story, damage numbers. The arrival of colour-coded, tiered weaponry that’s found in boxes, not on corpses, effectively turns guns into loot, and the open-world Avalon, frequently visited across the campaign before becoming your home for the Endgame, is peppered with small-scale objectives and activities, akin to Warzone’s battle royale map. Or a Destiny planet. Or a Helldivers world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, while there are 11 missions that lead into it, Endgame feels like the actual “point” of this campaign, more so than story, characters, or level concepts. This 32-player PvE mode will be supported throughout Black Ops 7’s lifetime, essentially turning it into an evolving, not-quite-live-service mode… one that, eventually, will be completely divorced from its original campaign packaging. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Activision already has plans to allow players to skip the missions entirely and get straight into Avalon. In a recent conversation with IGN, Black Ops 7’s associate creative director, Miles Leslie, revealed that on “day one, we want to make sure that people progress into [Endgame] naturally. We want them to get through that story, understand the world, the abilities, the characters. [But] what we've talked about is, at some point, and we haven't figured out just yet, when does it unlock it for everyone?” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Just 5% of PlayStation players have unlocked the campaign completion trophy of last year’s Black Ops 6.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s clear that Black Ops 7 is a new breed of Call of Duty campaign, one foremost designed around co-op multiplayer trends, rather than simply inviting other players to be involved in a traditional narrative shooter. From my perspective, it’s a much less interesting direction, but it’s undoubtedly a sign of the times. Just five percent of PlayStation players have unlocked the PS5 campaign completion trophy of last year’s Black Ops 6, and that only rises to eight percent if you go back to 2022’s Modern Warfare 2. Rewind even as far as 2019’s Modern Warfare reboot, arguably the last one that was universally agreed to be a must-play, and just 12.6% have the competition trophy. These stats clearly show that the vast majority of Call of Duty’s audience simply isn’t interested in playing alone, even for just the handful of hours required to clear these short campaigns. And with the budgets demanded, no wonder Activision has been investigating other, more multiplayer-focused alternatives… and no wonder it’s landed on something that feels like a mish-mash of Destiny, Borderlands, Left 4 Dead, and Warzone – games that have secured millions of players over the years, and broadly speak to “modern” tastes that have been more widely engineered by the likes of the always online, always social Fortnite. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this isn’t the first time that Call of Duty has attempted to go all-in on multiplayer. In fact, it’s been something of interest for Black Ops studio Treyarch for almost its entire COD career, starting with 2008’s World at War, where the campaign had (somewhat tacked-on) co-op support. A few years later, the studio would make a bolder effort with Black Ops 3, but that came with its own mistakes – a series of missions designed to be played in any order you wanted, akin to choosing multiplayer maps, meant the story lacked propulsion, coherence, and meaning. For its next game, it chose to scrap the campaign entirely, redirecting single-player resources towards Blackout, Call of Duty’s first stab at battle royale. This made Black Ops 4 the first and so far only purely multiplayer Call of Duty package – one I’m doubtful Activision will ever return to, but something that I think did signal inevitable shifts in development priorities. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We can see the colossal influence of multiplayer in other aspects of Call of Duty’s campaign design, too. 2023’s disastrous Modern Warfare 3 didn’t have co-op, but it did fully lean into the sensibilities of battle royale, tooling many of its missions to allow for the type of gameplay that those trained on Warzone would instinctively use. That went as far as even using whole sections of the Verdansk map as locations within the campaign, an idea Black Ops 7 has since pilfered with its use of Black Ops 6’s Skyline multiplayer map in the tail end of its campaign.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The infamously squashed development timeframe of Modern Warfare 3 is likely the most significant factor to blame for its “multiplayer recycled as single-player” feel, but I think there’s more to it. It wasn’t just that battle royale assets were there and ready to be Frankensteined together… it was also that Warzone was colossally more popular and more widely understood than the old-fashioned story campaign. And you can see that thinking in Black Ops 7, albeit from a new angle. Its campaign is designed around the interactions of a multiplayer shooter, not a cinematic story, and the result of that is a mode you can <em>technically </em>play alone, but one where the structure and balancing simply don’t make sense for it. And so, for the first time since Black Ops 4, Call of Duty is arguably a multiplayer game in its entirety. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But is this the future of Call of Duty? Will traditional campaigns be replaced by roughly-story-shaped co-op modes? It’s impossible to tell, since the series zigs and zags with yearly frequency. 12 months ago, we were given Call of Duty’s most ambitious take on its traditional single-player template since 2017’s Infinite Warfare, and yet the very same developers who made Black Ops 6 created this year’s wild left turn. In 2026, we’ll presumably get Infinity Ward’s next project, which could just as easily be a re-try of Modern Warfare 3’s Warzone-tinted experiment as much as it could be an emulation of the 2019 MW reboot or something else entirely. But as much as the future is impossible to see, the present paints a clear picture: Activision is assessing what Call of Duty means for the modern generation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For years now, Call of Duty has been a trifecta of single-player, multiplayer, and co-op, expressed through its campaign, online, and zombies/spec-ops modes. And when you see the resources that went into Black Ops 6’s spectacular campaign, only for it to be completed by barely anyone who bought it, you have to be amazed at (and even respect) Activision’s historic dedication to big-budget single-player. But returns can only diminish for so long. The triple-A campaign shooter is an endangered species, with barely a Doom or a Wolfenstein to bank on regularly, and often, Call of Duty is the only one of its kind to arrive each year. It’s clear that Activision knows the era of the narrative FPS is practically over, and that it’s spending money on something barely any of its mammoth audience wants. And so things change. That started with multiplayer elements repackaged as single-player content, and it’ll very likely go much further than campaigns reimagined as multiplayer – you can now play Call of Duty entirely in third person, just in case you thought some things were invulnerable to the influence of Fortnite and Sony’s first-party titans. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While significant, permanent change may not come next year, or even the year after, I think this year’s campaign is a sign of things to come. At this point, when Call of Duty is a Game Pass tentpole and needs to demand engagement month after month to spin up never-ending subscriptions, why wouldn’t you turn your formerly five-hour-and-forget campaigns into a mini Destiny? </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/does-black-ops-7-signal-the-end-of-single-player-call-of-duty]]></content:encoded>

Now, your university Mystery Research Club is prying open old wounds while revisiting this unsolved case.</p><p>Take on the role of first year college student Doppo <a title="Games > Aka [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/aka">Aka</a>zawa who has joined the Mystery Research Club. Their first research assignment leads them to Narumizawa to investigate the 30-year-old murder case of a famous landscape artist. Though irregularities were found and the primary suspect died in an apparent suicide, the case was closed. However, Doppo possesses something that those in charge thirty years ago didn’t have; the power to travel back in time. Unexpected new clues are revealed as you use your secret ability to peer into the past, viewing key items and events in a new light. Use your uniquely gained knowledge to steer conversations and interviews with witnesses and potential suspects. Maintain your own secrets while uncovering a series of long-buried clues leading to the true killer.</p><p>Structured like a TV drama, each chapter in <em>Path of Mystery: A Brush with Death</em> is presented in the form of an episode. The tension builds as you begin to draw key information from everyone connected to the murder 30 years ago. The game world is brought to life by a talented cast of voice actors, great character designs and beautiful backgrounds, with the retrocognition portions taking players back to the past with a retro art style.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

A person outside of Rockstar told him about GTA 6 for Switch 2, but no one at the company, he said.</p><p>For now, GTA 6 is confirmed only for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S when it launches in November 2026. History suggests that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-fans-waiting-for-the-possible-pc-edition-now-have-to-wait-even-longer/1100-6536055/" data-ref-id="1100-6536055">PC edition will follow later, but this is not confirmed.</a></p><p>The last GTA game for a Nintendo platform was GTA: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition in 2022. GTA 5 never came to a Nintendo platform. In 2009, Rockstar developed GTA: Chinatown Wars for Nintendo DS.</p><p>Rockstar owner Take-Two has suggested it could bring more games to Switch 2, but it's unknown if GTA 6 could be among them.

The delays were no surprise, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">Rockstar always delays its games.</a> The game has an enormous amount of hype behind it and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">projected to sell many millions of copies,</a> but people looking to GTA 6 to help save the gaming industry amid its current struggles might be in for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-wont-save-the-struggling-games-industry-expert-says/1100-6536219/" data-ref-id="1100-6536219">rude awakening. </a></p>

            <p>Dispatch developer AdHoc has no interest in using AI to replace voice actors or game development.</p>
<p>AI is still a hot topic within the gaming community, with many developers using the technology in their own releases. However, AdHoc has no intention to use AI for its own games, especially not when it comes to voice acting.</p>

<p>AdHoc's creative director Nick Herman and executive producer Michael Choung recently sat down with Eurogamer's sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dispatch-is-on-course-to-beat-its-three-year-sales-target-in-three-months-heres-how">GamesIndustry.biz</a> to chat all things Dispatch. The studio's episodic superhero workplace comedy has been a hit since its release earlier this year, with many (myself included) praising Dispatch's voice cast for elevating the experience. The cast includes Aaron Paul of Breaking Bad fame, as well as The Last of Us and James Bond actor Jeffrey Wright as retired superhero Chase, among others.</p>
<p>So, where does AI come into it? Well, speaking on Wright's performance as Chase earlier this month, Herman stated: "No AI is going to do what he did."</p>
<p>"He brought something to that character that we weren't expecting," Herman continued. "I mean, his performance and Aaron's performance and our whole cast are bringing performances and elevating the material in a way that you're just not going to get [with AI]. You're not going to be surprised because it's built on something you've heard before if you go the AI route.</p>
<p>"So, yeah, honestly, AI feels like a production solution, not a creative one. Maybe it's a creative one if you <em>aren't </em>creative."</p>

<p>"Whatever we're building, it has to connect," Choung added. "It's got to be made by people. It's got to connect to people. We're looking at AI, we're monitoring the stuff that AI is doing, like everybody else. But... it seems to be having a lot of trouble trying to get to a 'good enough' spot. And 'good enough' for us is the enemy.</p><p>"Also we're not getting up every morning and talking to ourselves like, 'hey, what if we did this with less people? What's the lowest number of people we can use to make this thing?' This is like not anything that we're too concerned with!"</p>
<p>The developers added they aren't going to judge others for their own use of AI, and they can "speak for themselves" should they feel it necessary to do so. But, for AdHoc, AI, "right now, it just doesn't make a ton of sense".</p>

<p>Earlier this year, AdHoc announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">Dispatch had sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to this success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-dispatch-getting-a-second-season-well-thats-something-the-developer-is-definitely-going-to-think-about">the studio is now considering a second season</a> (perhaps one with more sex scenes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>).</p>

            <p>If you really dug <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s Far Harbor DLC, you'll be glad to know a couple of modders have been gradually working away at adding a bunch more post-apocalyptic versions of real-life islands off the coast of New England to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s map for a little while now. Following the release of their first atomic-boomed atoll, Boon Island, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-4-mod-boon-island-isles-of-new-england">last year</a>, the pair have just released a trip to Massachusetts' Misery islands.</p>

<p>"What was once known for its scenic paths and seaside cottages now lies in quiet ruin, its history steeped in corruption, decay, and loneliness," reads the description modders Tenhats and Shreddah4 have penned for their latest creation, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/87983?tab=description">Misery Island - Isles Of New England</a>. Seriously, I hadn't heard of Great Misery Island and Little Misery Island near Salem, but they don't half sound like regular old England when introduced like that.</p>
<p>The two islands, which got their name thanks to a 17th century shipbuilder who ended up stranded during a winter storm, have been brought back to life in lore-friendly form as a location you can visit to explore, do some questing, or build a settlement. There's plenty of environmental storytelling inspired by the islands' real-life histories and backstory to uncover by poking about, as you listen to a new radio station and keep an eye out for some new gear.</p><p>If you're wondering what the isles'll have to uncover in terms of ruins, a leaf through the <a href="https://thetrustees.org/content/misery-islands-history/">account of their histories</a> from the trust which currently controls them reveals that prior to 1900, a guy called Daniel Neville owned the Misery Islands and was nicknamed "Lord of the Isles". His family then sold them to a group of Boston investors called the Misery Island Syndicate, who tried to turn the bigger island into a summer resort for posh holidaymakers, but quickly ran into money trouble. The ruins of that resort and other cottages which weren't destroyed in a 1926 fire remain, so it'll be interesting to see what sorts of Fallouty twists the modders have managed to work into that backstory.</p>
<p>Tenhats and Shreddah4 recommend that you hit level 25 or above before heading to the Misery Islands, which you can reach by seaplane from either Boston Airport in the main map or Far Harbor. By some miracle, the mod's description notes that it should be compatible with Fallout 4's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/maybe-hold-off-a-bit-longer-on-reinstalling-your-fallout-4-mods-as-bethesda-have-two-anniversary-update-patches-planned">recently-released anniversary edition</a> and well as the old gen and next gen versions.</p>
<p>In terms of requirements, the modders say you'll need the Far Harbor DLC and suggest you use a mod manager to install their creation. Then, you'll be ready to head off on a truly misery-filled holiday.</p>

That's crazy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the end of 2025 in sight, single-player role-playing game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has emerged as a frontrunner for GOTY. Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive Donkey Kong Bananza is also up for GOTY, which Shroud certainly took issue with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Imagine Donkey Kong, too… if Donkey Kong would win, this award show is just chalked,” Shroud said. “Who the f*** is playing Donkey Kong Bananza? Nobody’s playing Donkey Kong Bananza. Nobody. That is insane.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Admitting Expedition 33 is probably going to win GOTY, Shroud said he hoped Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 would emerge victorious instead. He believed Arc Raiders will win best Multiplayer, and Battlefield 6 will win best Action. He expressed confusion that Arc Raiders was not nominated for best Audio Design, given the plaudits it has received in that area.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Shroud had previously claimed that voting in The Game Awards doesn’t matter. “All the f***ing awards are rigged anyway, who cares?” he said. “When have you ever seen an award that’s actually legit?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Geoff Keighley’s The Game Awards uses a combination of votes from the games media and influencers as well as public fan voting.

                <p>Ghost of Yotei has a unique feature that allows players to press a button to travel back in time to see what main character Atsu was doing many years prior. This is available at specific places in the game world, but the original plan at Sucker Punch was to allow players to do this anywhere, any time.</p><p>Creative director Jason Connell said in a conversation with Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan that this feature was something he was "very excited about" when it was originally pitched years ago. He said the appeal was that players could be at one moment experiencing Atsu's story in the main timeline when things are dark and bleak and she's on her lone wolf quest, and the next they could travel back in time and feel the "warmth of her past" and understand what she's fighting for.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKJWi6Pagmw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1552">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NKJWi6Pagmw?start=1552" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"It started off as, 'Let's do that as many places we can, maybe everywhere,'" Connell said. "Like, can we do this as like a, like a stake-in-the-ground game feature?"</p><p>However, after about a year of working on this, and with the understanding that it would require double the art, Sucker Punch had to scale it back and only have this feature available in certain areas of the game. "So while it's this amazing feature, it saddened me the day that I had to to kill that and narrow it. But in the end, it was the right choice," he said.</p><p>Connell said the decision to narrow the feature came after feedback from testers and in discussions with colleagues. While Connell said he feels confident it was the right call, it was still "hard" for him.</p><p>He added that, had the feature been available across the entirety of the game, it ran the risk of feeling like a "gimmick" if Sucker Punch couldn't back it up with enough "meat" to make it worthwhile, narratively speaking.</p><p>Gilligan, for his part, said the situation could be like the delicate balance of salt on french fries.</p><p>"It's like salt on your french fries. There's nothing better than just the right amount of salt on your french fries. And then when you overdo it, you're like, 'Ugh, these are too damn salty,'" he said.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-lone-wolf/1900-6418414/" data-ref-id="1900-6418414">Ghost of Yotei review</a> praised the game overall, and specifically the time-travel mechanic. "By visiting her home and specific locations around Ezo, you can step into the past and revisit fond memories from her childhood, such as practicing sword fighting with her brother and working with her weaponsmith father in the family's forge," reviewer Richard Wakeling said.</p><p>"These windows into the past create further empathy for a character who eventually goes on to inflict brutal violence. You can feel the weight of her loss in each moment, and this persists throughout the game as you explore more and more of Ezo."</p><p>Ghost of Yotei launched in early October and has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-5-sales-draw-even-with-ps4-and-ghost-of-yotei-has-a-big-debut/1100-6536128/" data-ref-id="1100-6536128">exceeded 3 million sales so far.</a></p>

            <p>Activision's own response to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s release seems more muted than previous years.</p>
<p>Last night, the official Call of Duty social media account shared a post, congratulating developers Treyarch and Raven on the latest Call of Duty release, and thanking the community in the process.</p>

<p>"Across the opening weekend, we've seen a great response to the quality and depth of gameplay in Black Ops 7," it wrote, adding there will be more to come.</p>
<p>However, many have pointed out that the tone in this latest release post, which Activision acknowledges every year, is a little less enthusiastic than previous examples. </p>
<p>Last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a>, for example, received a post boasting about the game's stats. "#1 Total Players, #1 Hours Played, #1 Total Matches," it read, with Activision thanking the fan base for making Black Ops 6 "the biggest Call of Duty ever".</p>

<p>Meanwhile, according to The Game Business' Chris Dring, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 had "a smaller UK retail launch (physical sales) than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>" based on GfK data. Black Ops 7 also has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-the-lowest-metacritic-user-score-ever-for-a-call-of-duty-game">the lowest metacritic user score for a Call of Duty game ever</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-underperforms-on-steam-during-launch-weekend-but-does-that-mean-the-games-sold-badly">Steam player numbers have been lower than other series entries</a>.</p><p>Black Ops 7 has also come under fire for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-players-call-out-awful-apparent-use-of-generative-ai-for-in-game-calling-cards">apparent use of generative AI</a>. This matter was recently brought up by US Congressman Ro Khanna who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-members-of-the-us-congress-are-pushing-back-against-call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-ai-use">responded to Activision Blizzard's AI use in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 by highlighting the need for AI regulations in the United States of America</a>.</p>
<p>"A shift away from single-player leaves Call of Duty with its most lopsided and homogenous entry in decades, though what it does offer is consistently good fun when accepted on its own terms," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Eurogamer's Black Ops 7 review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve is making a game console that might take on Sony and Microsoft. It’s also making a gaming headset to compete with Meta. These are big, ambitious, and messy efforts, and we have <em>lots</em> of questions. So do you!</p><div><p>We’ve gotten a lot of questions about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/819080/valve-brings-back-steam-machines-steam-os-steam-frame-news-announcements">Valve’s huge 2026 hardware push</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/819080/valve-brings-back-steam-machines-steam-os-steam-frame-news-announcements#dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODE4NjIy">entry into the console wars</a>, and we’re compiling the answers we’ve got so far. Some of them are direct answers to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818113/valve-steam-frame-machine-controller-vr-headset-pc-ask-us-anything-ama">your subscriber questions in our AMA</a>; thank you for paying our salaries!</p></div><p>So, let’s start with…</p><div><p id="what-is-a-steam-machine"><h2>What is a Steam Machine?</h2></p></div><p>The Steam Machine is a specific living room gaming PC coming out in early 2026. It’s not your typical Windows PC. The 6-inch cube is barely bigger than a box of Kleenex (bless you), can come bundled with a wireless controller that connects directly to the box, and runs Windows games on the pick-up-and-play SteamOS. It’s basically a game console.</p><p><strong>So the Steam Machine is just a big stationary Steam Deck for the TV?</strong></p><p>Basically! Valve says it has six times the performance, will run all the same games, and runs the exact same SteamOS underneath. Valve says you can even pop the microSD card out of your Steam Deck, put it in the Steam Machine, and your <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818602/valve-steam-deck-machine-frame-microsd-card-game-cartridges">games should just work</a>.</p><p><strong>I don’t have a box of Kleenex handy. How small is it </strong><strong><em>really</em></strong><strong>? </strong></p><p>To be exact, Valve tells us it’s 152mm tall (148mm without feet), 162.4mm deep, and 156mm wide. The Nintendo GameCube is 150mm tall, 161mm deep, and 110mm wide, so they’re pretty close.</p><p><strong>Can I call it the GabeCube?</strong></p><p>We won’t stop you! Because you can swap out the front plate, there are lots of fun puns to turn into reality, like <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsub%2F469%2F" rel="sponsored">The Orange Box</a>. Or take Dbrand’s suggestion to make it a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/819863/dbrand-companion-cube-valve-steam-machine-skin">Companion Cube</a>.</p><p><strong>How much will it cost?</strong></p><p>We don’t know. Valve won’t tell us yet.</p><p><strong>Wait, Valve announced a console and won’t even say what it costs? </strong></p><p>Yeah, Valve says it hasn’t finalized the price. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview#:~:text=more%20expensive%20lately%3F-,Yazan%20Aldehayyat%3A,-If%20you%27re%20trying">Valve told <em>IGN</em> </a>that it’ll be “as affordable as possible.” Valve told us it’ll be “positioned closer to the entry level of the PC space” and “very competitive with a PC you could build yourself from parts.” And Valve <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/console-gaming/valve-brings-back-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-hands-on-with-valves-new-amd-based-living-room-gaming-hardware#:~:text=The%20market%20is%20kind%20of%20weird%20right%20now%2C">told <em>Tom’s Hardware</em></a> it’s aiming for “a great value,” but it’s tough to price right now because “the market is kind of weird” and “<a href="http://ontinue-to-soar/">memory prices are going up</a> like right as we speak.”</p><p><strong>Does it come with <em>Half-Life 3</em>?</strong></p><p>Do you <em>really</em> think Valve can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpw2ebhTSKs">count to three</a>? As we are writing this, no. But Valve is maybe, kind of, possibly, sort of, potentially hinting that… something… <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/820533/valve-secrecy-security-guards-steam-machine-valve-hq-no-hl3">might be revealed soon</a>.</p><p>Need more “hopium,” as the cool kids call it? <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660946/half-life-3-is-playable-end-to-end%5C">Here</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/1/24333632/2025-is-another-great-year-to-be-excited-for-half-life-3">you</a> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/half-life-3-confirmed-every-insider-is-pointing-at-november-19-for-the-big-day-and-im-also-huffing-hopium/">go</a>.</p><p><strong>Does it come with a gamepad?</strong></p><p>You can save money by buying it without one, but it can also come bundled with this Steam Controller:</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><p><strong>What in the Dreamcast is that?</strong></p><p>It’s the Steam Controller, and it has its own section, scroll down! Or you can bring your own gamepad.</p><p><strong>Is the new Steam box more powerful than a PS5? Why is everyone tweeting “8GB VRAM” like it’s an insult?</strong></p><p>Some PC gamers are getting <em>real </em>tired of good GPUs hamstrung by insufficient video memory, and the Steam Machine’s 8GB isn’t a lot for a console that claims it can do 4K! That said, Valve is upfront that you’re only getting 4K after using AMD’s FSR upscaling, and the PS5 has to rely on upscaling techniques too.</p><p>We don’t truly know how powerful the Steam Machine is, but both its specs and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement#:~:text=On%20a%204K%20TV%2C%20the%20demanding%20Cyberpunk%202077%20benchmark">our early <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> test</a> suggest we’re looking at PS5-plus, <em>maybe</em> PS5 Pro graphics. (It has a newer Zen 4 CPU, and <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Radeon-RX-7600M-XT-vs-Radeon-RX-7600S-vs-Radeon-RX-7600M_11550_11556_11552.247598.0.html">the closest AMD GPUs</a> boast a similar number of teraflops to that of the PS5 Pro.)</p><p><strong>How upgradable is the Steam Machine?</strong></p><p>Not terribly! It’s a proprietary motherboard with a soldered CPU and GPU, so you can’t upgrade those unless Valve offers them as a package deal. But the SSD storage should be easy (M.2 2280 or 2230 sticks are swappable), and it takes standard DDR5 laptop memory modules.</p><p><strong>Does it do HDR and VRR? FSR4 and frame gen?</strong></p><p>Both the HDMI and DisplayPort offer HDR, but they only support the AMD FreeSync flavor of variable refresh rate (VRR) for smooth gameplay even when your frame rate dips. Valve says it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818113/valve-steam-frame-machine-controller-vr-headset-pc-ask-us-anything-ama?commentID=a3b10546-2a76-4a4c-8af6-92e1ab2122f8">“hoping to improve” the FreeSync implementation</a>, too.</p><p>Valve’s official answer on FSR: “Steam Machine supports the AMD technologies that AMD supports on RDNA3 hardware, including FSR 3 and frame gen.” It’s a Navi 33 GPU, so a version of FSR 4 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqDWJCW06Ks">might be technically possible</a>…</p><p><strong>Can it play </strong><strong><em>Fortnite</em></strong><strong>? Will it play [INSERT GAME HERE]?</strong></p><div><p>Linux can now play almost any Windows game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/807711/xbox-ally-sleep-fail-bazzite-fix-performance">many of them better than Windows</a>. But the main exceptions are big multiplayer games so lucrative that their publishers insist on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284644/apex-legends-loses-linux-steam-deck-support-anti-cheat">powerful anti-cheat systems that don’t allow Linux</a> because the fear <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23999300/fortnite-on-steam-deck-sweeney-says-valve-needs-tens-of-millions-of-users-to-justify-it">currently outweighs</a> the Linux opportunity.</p></div><p>That means multiplayer games like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>PUBG</em>, <em>Battlefield 6</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>,<em> GTA Online</em>, <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Destiny 2</em>, Roblox, and sports games like <em>EA FC</em> all won’t work on SteamOS.</p><p>“We hope that the launch of Machine will change the equation around anti-cheat support and increase its support,” Valve <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-battlefield-6-work-on-steam-machine-valve-hopes-its-new-hardware-will-prompt-a-fresh-discussion-with-developers-over-kernel-level-anti-cheat">told <em>Eurogamer</em></a>. Sounds like Valve is just crossing its fingers.</p><p><strong>Can I put Windows on it to play those games?</strong></p><p>Valve won’t stop you! It’ll even help by making Windows drivers available at its website (not through Windows Update). Just know its track record of Windows support for SteamOS hardware <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/10/22971108/valve-steam-deck-windows-runs-drivers-no-support">isn’t great</a>, and we think we’re <em>still</em> waiting for Valve’s own dual-boot solution.</p><p><strong>If this runs Linux, how is it playing Windows games?</strong></p><p>Short version: it tricks Windows games into thinking they’re running on Windows.</p><p>For the long version, here’s Valve software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais:</p><div><blockquote><p>You’re going to be playing it through Proton, which is essentially a distribution<a href="https://www.winehq.org/"> of Wine</a>, bundled with everything you would need to run any sort of game that’s made for Windows.</p><p>The game itself is a Windows executable, right? At a core level, the Linux operating system does not even know how to load the program, and so, instead of invoking it through the OS, you invoke it through Proton, which is going to do the first step of setting up the address space, loading the segments of code into memory. The code coming from the app is all x86, and so Proton is a facilitator. It puts the code of the existing code of the app in a format and a layout that the Linux OS can understand and then starts executing that code.</p><p>Whenever that game code makes an API call for something it was built against in its original development environment, either just a core C runtime library or higher-level APIs like DirectX or DirectSound, or USB enumeration or input — whenever the game calls those functions, those functions exist in Proton’s code, and it’s going to be Proton implementing that and giving you results. Or giving the game a result based on the Linux OS, as opposed to the other environment that the game was designed for.</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Wait a second. Didn’t Valve do this already?</strong></p><p>This isn’t actually the first Steam Machine! <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5063760/we-try-the-steam-machine-valves-video-game-console-of-the-future">The original</a> from 2013 never went on sale but was meant to show third-party manufacturers the way; those third-party efforts (like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5281824/steam-machines-are-here-how-alienware-is-realizing-valve-console-dream">Alienware Steam Machine</a>) flopped, and Valve seemingly abandoned the idea in 2015.</p><p><strong>So what makes Valve think it’ll work this time around?</strong></p><p>Valve <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22579747/valve-steam-deck-steam-machines-editorial">learned its lesson</a> with the Steam Deck handheld, which the company built itself and uses a compatibility layer to make Windows games play great on the Linux-based SteamOS, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/618709/steam-deck-3-year-anniversary-handheld-gaming-shipments-idc">the device didn’t flop</a>. Now it’s bringing everything it learned to a box for your TV.</p><p><strong>Are we getting third-party Steam Machines again?</strong></p><p>Maybe! Valve’s Pierre-Loup Griffais tells us Valve is “excited to partner” with companies on Steam Machines like it did with Lenovo on a SteamOS handheld. “I think the first step is for us to ship what we have, and it will maybe show the way. Then it’s all based on the conversations we have after that.”</p><p><strong>Okay, so just how flexible is this new Steam Machine? Does it run Discord for chatting, OBS for streaming? What about Netflix and other streaming apps? </strong></p><p>Yes, yes, and yes. It’s a PC with an optional desktop mode, and you can find a whole app catalog there. Steam carries OBS Studio for livestreaming, too.</p><p>And since it’s a SteamOS device like the Steam Deck, you’ll almost certainly be able to use one of the many available web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) to launch streaming services, then <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?si=xyHHwsqpQZQ182sR&amp;v=RCVy2BzxzN8&amp;feature=youtu.be">turn them into more easily accessible web apps</a>.</p><p>They may not look their best on a 4K TV, though. Even on a Windows PC, many streaming apps don’t offer the same quality 4K HDR Dolby streams they do on even a cheap streaming stick.</p><p><strong>What about other game stores like Epic, GOG, Battle.net? Can I stream games from GeForce Now and Xbox Cloud? </strong></p><p>If it’s like Steam Deck, the <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/">Heroic Games Launcher</a> and Lutris can let you more easily access games from other stores on your Steam Deck, though you have to do a bit of work to get them set up.</p><p>Same deal with game streaming. You’ll have to do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hhscoRV9Ew">a little legwork</a> to get them set up in Game Mode alongside your other Steam games. Oh, and you should be able to stream games from your PS5 to the Steam Machine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xT0OPMNeXJs">with Chiaki</a>.</p><p><strong>Can I install game mods?</strong> <strong>Could I use it as a Plex server?</strong></p><p>It’s doable, including in Bethesda games like <em>Skyrim</em> and <em>Fallout</em>. Just don’t always expect it to be easy. And it looks like Plex has a service for Arch Linux, which underpins SteamOS and thus the Steam Machine, but we’ve never tried it!</p><p><strong>That sounds great. So I can replace my gaming PC with a Steam Machine?</strong></p><p>Probably not for the latest AAA releases on high settings. And unless you dual-boot into Windows, you can’t play a bunch of the biggest multiplayer games because their anti-cheat software doesn’t work on Linux. But if your gaming PC is getting old and you’re good with PS5-level performance…</p><p><strong>I can work with that. What’s there to be worried about?</strong></p><p>It might cost way too much — people are still used to spending $500 or less on the console beneath their TV! It also just might not work as well as a Steam Deck crossed with a PlayStation. We’ve only used it briefly, we don’t know exactly how capable the hardware is yet, and compatibility layers make it less of a sure thing than a PS5, which has games specifically made for it.</p><p>That said, we were pretty impressed during our initial hands-on, especially with the new Steam Controller.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="what-is-a-steam-controller"><h2>What is a Steam Controller? </h2></p></div><div><p>It’s Valve’s new controller, and some of us <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">might be</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/fhhwjX1je50">a teensy bit impressed with it</a>.</p></div><p><strong>What’s so impressive?</strong></p><p>This one might soon rule the roost where PCs are concerned. It now feels like a traditional gamepad in the hands — unlike the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price">original Steam Controller</a> — but with all the extra inputs and unprecedented customizability of the Steam Deck’s integrated gamepad. It has new TMR joysticks and capacitive sensors in the grips, a D-pad, four face buttons, two bumpers, two triggers, four back buttons, four menu buttons, a gyro, and two touchpads for replicating a mouse or trackball or for simultaneous two-thumb typing.</p><p><strong>Will I have to replace this controller in a year because the sticks start to drift?</strong></p><p>Probably not! Valve is using custom drift-resistant TMR (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">tunneling magnetoresistance</a>) joysticks in the controllers. Magnetic joysticks like these are getting more common in aftermarket pads, but Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft haven’t made the switch yet.</p><p><strong>I can’t get over the touchpads. Why are they tilted? They look uncomfortable. </strong></p><p>They might be! We only got to try the new controller for a few minutes. But we’re fans so far, and Valve says people preferred it this way. You don’t hold a gamepad the way you do a wide Steam Deck, do you?</p><p><strong>What about the grip sensors, what will those do?</strong></p><p>“Grip Sense” tells when you’re fully gripping it, and you can use that as a virtual on/off button to do whatever you want in games. A Valve employee wanted it for easier gyro aiming: just grip the controller to activate, no need to move your thumb off the face buttons or joysticks. It could be handy for fine-tuned aiming in FPS games.</p><p><strong>How do I charge the controller?</strong></p><p>The controller comes with a puck that doubles as a charging station and a low-latency access point for up to four gamepads. Just slide the puck under the controller, and it will magnetically snap into place for charging.</p><p>It’s called the “Steam Controller Puck,” but a Valve employee said that internally, it was called <a href="https://x.com/8izzozero/status/1988793330998927588">the “chongle,”</a> so do with that what you will.</p><p><strong>Does it have a headphone jack? I like the one on the DualSense and Xbox controllers.</strong></p><p>No, unfortunately. “We just didn’t feel like it was necessary,” hardware engineer Steve Cardinali <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/820747/the-steam-controller-doesnt-have-a-headphone-jack-and-valve-told-us-why-kind-of">tells us</a>.</p><p><strong>How many Steam Controllers can you connect to the Steam Machine?</strong></p><p>You can connect up to four to the computer’s internal antenna, which is dedicated to Steam Controllers. Each extra puck supports four more pads. Valve’s engineers told us they tried 16 controllers, though that isn’t officially supported.</p><p><strong>Can I use my own controller with the Steam Machine? Which ones? What about keyboard and mouse?</strong></p><p>Keyboard, mouse, your PS5 DualSense or Switch Pro Controller, practically any Bluetooth gamepad, and even some racing wheels should work! Steam Input natively supports many of their extra buttons and gyros, and will let you remap and assign macros on just about anything. Even the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/12/11/24319049/psa-youve-got-another-year-to-save-your-google-stadia-gamepad-from-a-wired-only-existence">Google Stadia controller</a> is supported. The Xbox One controller may not work, though. Valve tells us it’s still figuring out how to support the Xbox One wireless adapter for Windows.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="what-is-a-steam-frame"><h2>What is a Steam Frame?</h2></p></div><p>Valve’s new SteamOS VR headset is designed to play both flat-screen and VR games. It’s a standalone headset with an Arm chip, like the Meta Quest, and it can play Windows games locally or off a microSD card <em>because Valve now has an emulator for Windows on Arm, too</em>.</p><p>It can also stream your games from a nearby PC with very low latency using a dedicated wireless adapter and eye-tracking cameras.</p><p><strong>Why does that matter for the Steam Machine?</strong></p><p>If you have a Steam Machine and a Steam Frame, you can plug the Steam Frame’s wireless adapter into your Steam Machine to stream the games from it. They’ll look a lot better than if you ran them on the Frame directly. Or you could just use a normal PC, like Valve did for our demos.</p><p><strong>Wait, it’s tracking my eyes? That sounds creepy.</strong></p><p>Yeah, it’s watching your eyes move, checking their position between 80 and 125 times every second. And somehow we totally forgot to ask Valve whether it’s keeping track of what you look at.</p><p><strong>Straight to jail, Sean and Jay, straight to jail. You’ll ask Valve for us now, right? </strong></p><p>We just did, and we’ll let you know if we hear anything. And Valve <em>is</em> using it for something cool! The eye-tracking unlocks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/817993/valve-vr-steam-frame-foveated-streaming-rendering-link">“foveated streaming,”</a> which puts the highest-fidelity bits right in front of your eyes while lowering the resolution in your peripheral vision.</p><p><strong>Is there something special about the controllers?</strong></p><p>The controllers for Valve’s previous headset, the Index, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/28/18639084/valve-index-steamvr-headset-knuckles-controllers-preview">were fun</a>, but they were also bulky and didn’t have everything you might need to play flat-screen games.</p><p>The Frame’s new controllers, on the other hand, are two small wands packed with all the buttons and inputs required for both flat-screen games and VR games. AB <em>and</em> XY, triggers <em>and</em> bumpers. The Quest’s wands don’t have those extra inputs.</p><p><strong>Why do you keep talking about flat-screen games for a VR headset?</strong></p><p>Valve’s pitch is every game in your Steam library — VR or flat-screen, locally or streamed — will work on this lightweight headset, no cord required.</p><p>But you should know that the performance of a couple flat Windows games running locally on the headset — <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and <em>Hades II</em> — was a little choppy.</p><p><strong>Uh-oh. Do you know why?</strong></p><p>Valve told us after our demos that what we saw was a bug, and that it hadn’t yet fully implemented a shader pre-caching system that could have smoothed things out. So it’s possible the shipping product will perform better. We’ll have to test.</p><p>But issues with Windows games on Arm aren’t that surprising. Sean has messed around with <em>Silksong</em> on a phone, and while it worked, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/776180/hollow-knight-silksong-android-phone-windows-emulation-gamehub">it wasn’t perfect</a>. The processing power on the Frame is limited, too — it’s an older smartphone chip, but with a lot more power and cooling than you get in a phone.</p><p>Valve plans to have a Verified program for games it expects to run well on the Frame, so we hope that checkmark will be an indicator of good performance.</p><p><strong>Why use Arm for the Frame at all if there are extra hurdles to jump through?</strong></p><p>Battery and heat! “We chose Arm for Steam Frame for its power efficiency and low heat generation — especially important for a headset,” Valve hardware and software engineer Jeremy Selan tells us. The battery here is way smaller than in a Steam Deck, though, if you’re wondering how long it’ll play Windows games. Like half the size. 21.6 watt-hours.</p><p><strong>What’s the battery life?</strong></p><p><em>Not</em> six hours of <em>Hades II</em>, because we asked and Valve said no. Valve <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/features/steam-frame-vr-hands-on-quest-3s-biggest-competition-yet">told <em>Digital Foundry</em></a> to expect one to four hours of gameplay depending on settings; it <a href="https://youtu.be/bWUxObt1efQ?si=6SqxmDjSPP4LiNi_&amp;t=1950">told <em>Gamers Nexus</em></a> it currently consumes up to 7 watts streaming and 20 watts playing local games, which works out to about three hours and one hour minimum runtime, respectively. Valve says it’s still optimizing, and the rear USB-C port is in a great spot to plug in an external battery.</p><p><strong>So pack a battery for flights… Wait, can I use it on a plane at all?</strong></p><p>Selan says yes:</p><div><blockquote><p>Yes, we’ve played Frame on a plane from takeoff to landing without tracking issues. The onboard cameras work in tandem with the motion sensors in the headset to offset any external motion experienced when in a vehicle.</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>How about in bed?</strong></p><p>Selan once more:</p><div><blockquote><p>A bunch of us play this way. The game theater screen in VR is repositionable and resizable, and you can move it to be on your ceiling if you prefer.</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Is it comfortable to wear?</strong></p><p>We’ll have to test more, but it’s smaller and lighter than the Quest 3 with a plush and more balanced head strap right out of the box. It felt pretty great in a brief demo.</p><p><strong>How about with glasses?</strong></p><div><p>Our friend <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/i-tried-valves-steam-frame-machine-and-controller-coming-in-2026-steam-os-is-coming-for-your-face-and-tv/">Scott Stein at <em>CNET</em></a> writes:</p></div><div><blockquote><p>There’s support for prescription lens inserts, but my high index option wasn’t available at the demo, so I had to squeeze my glasses in. They fit, but just barely.</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Do the vents smell as good as the Steam Deck’s?</strong></p><p><strong>If it’s Arm, can I play Android games on it too? </strong></p><p>That’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/818672/valve-android-apps-steam-frame">the plan</a>! Developers will be able to publish the Android APKs on Steam, and Valve will send Steam Frame devkits to some of those developers.</p><p><strong>Is it more powerful than a Quest 3? </strong></p><p>It should be, based on the raw specs.</p><p><strong>Does the Frame have any other cool tricks?</strong></p><p>We love modular gear <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24190757/modular-laptops-repairable-upgradable-diy">as a general rule</a>. Did we mention the Frame is modular?</p><p><strong>Modular?</strong></p><p>Modular. The “frame” and “lenses” come apart. The headband, speakers, and battery detach from the core compute module of the Frame. And on that core module, right above where your nose is, there’s an expansion slot for extra cameras to slot in.</p><p><strong>Will Valve sell other headbands I can slot in instead?</strong></p><p>Not Valve, at least to start, but you can expect other companies or regular people to cook up their own ideas. From Selan:</p><div><blockquote><p>We will be sharing specs and external CAD to enable folks to make accessories for the front expansion port (like an extra camera) and alternate head straps. For companies who wish to sell Steam Frame accessories for these ports with our official partner branding, there will be a partner program.</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Why would I want an extra camera?</strong></p><p>Valve cut corners on its passthrough cameras to bring the price down, it claims, so you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/821170/steam-frame-doesnt-let-you-see-the-real-world-in-color-because-valves-considering-your-wallet">can’t see the real world in color</a> through it like Meta’s latest headsets.</p><p><strong>What about other XR stuff? Can I run multiple apps, pin them to different places in my home, and expect them to stay?</strong></p><p>Selan isn’t promising a rich catalog of apps yet, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/818672/valve-android-apps-steam-frame#:~:text=you%E2%80%99ll%20be%20able%20to%20bring%20up%20a%20browser%2C%20have%20floating%20windows%2C%20all%20of%20the%20multitasking%20environments%20you%E2%80%99d%20expect%2C">some of this, yes</a>. “You’ll be able to bring up a browser, have floating windows, all of the multitasking environments you’d expect.” Room setup and multiple windows are “on the list” for launch. He didn’t address pinning specifically.</p><p><strong>How does the Steam Frame’s pixel density compare to other headsets?</strong></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy XR is 4K per eye, with incredibly clear visuals. We can read a phone pretty easily through the headset, as long as it’s not too close to the headset’s cameras.</p><p>This is 2K per eye, a lot closer to the Meta Quest 3, where it’s good enough to make out a phone, but grainy.</p><p><strong>Charging headsets is a pain. Will Valve sell a dock for the Frame?</strong></p><p>Selan:</p><div><blockquote><p>We have nothing to announce, but we’ll be sharing external CAD, if others wish to make docks (similar to Steam Deck).</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Is the streaming adapter just for the headset, or can I use it to stream games from PC to other gadgets? </strong></p><p>Just for the headset for now. Selan again:</p><div><blockquote><p>In terms of using a dedicated Wi-Fi adapter for a direct connection between an untethered device and the PC, we are excited about that potential but have nothing to announce at this time.</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Do I need fast USB ports for the 6GHz adapter? </strong></p><p>The adapter “works great” over USB2 and USB3, Selan says.</p><p><strong>Why not make the headset even lighter by making a battery or compute puck?</strong></p><p>“We explored many different options and decided on the built-in battery for simplicity, weight balancing, and ease of use,” Selan says. “External compute via puck is interesting, but being able to leverage your existing PC’s compute is such a compelling experience that we chose to prioritize wireless streaming technologies instead.”</p><p><strong>I saw pictures of the Controller and Frame with clear shells that I desperately want. Is Valve going to sell those?</strong></p><div><p>It’s not planning to, but you can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/817411/here-are-pictures-of-the-see-through-steam-frame-and-steam-controller-you-cant-buy">admire them in our photo gallery</a>!</p></div><p><strong>Will Valve sell replacement parts for the Steam Frame and Steam Machine like with the Steam Deck, and if so, when?</strong></p><p>Selan and hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat told us, for both products respectively, that Valve plans to have replacement parts available.</p><p><em>Linus Tech Tips</em> got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3FkuZNSGkw">slightly more context</a>: “While Valve hasn’t actually told iFixit that this product is coming yet, they did say that they’re hoping to continue their partnership that they’ve had on the Steam Deck making replacement parts available for end users.”</p><p>Also, the Steam Controller’s battery is user-replaceable and pops right out.</p><p><strong>I saw a picture of a Steam Machine with an e-paper screen. How about that?</strong></p><p>Sadly, Valve won’t sell it. “The e-paper faceplate will not be available for sale,” Aldehayyat tells us. “That was a (very cool) mod that one of our engineers made internally during development.” We want it, too.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/820293/steam-machine-frame-hardware-faq]]></content:encoded>

              <p>A cordless workstation is a clean workstation, and it can also be an efficient one with the right gadget at hand. If your everyday work involves dealing with multiple devices at once, a solid docking station can be an excellent investment.</p>
<p>The best options out there that feature multiple ports and reliable power delivery usually don’t come cheap, but Amazon is currently making it easier than ever to grab one. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5667/">Right now, the Anker 14-in-1 USB-C laptop docking station is going for just $43 on the retailer, after a sweet 39% off its retail price.</a> The deal, however, is selling out fast, which means the offer (or the stock) won’t be around for much longer. We highly recommend acting fast to grab yours before it’s too late!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5667/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Connectivity Options for All Your Essentials</h2>
<p>You’re getting 14 connectivity options in a compact, lightweight build. These include two 4K HDMI ports, a 1080p VGA port, a 5 Gbps USB-C port, a 100W USB-C PD-IN port, five USB-A ports, a 1 Gbps Ethernet port, an SD / micro SD slot, and an AUX port. The two 4K HDMI and one 1080p VGA port let you connect up to three external screens at the same time. Windows users will enjoy extended display support, while on macOS, the displays will only mirror what’s going on your main display. Regardless, these are great for adding multiple screens for a bigger, more productive setup. With Windows, you can be hosting Zoom calls on one and present using the other. Or work on one while having reference documents open on the rest; the possibilities are endless!</p>
<p>The USB-A and USB-C ports support ultra-fast file transfers at impressive 5 Gbps speeds. This hub also offers up to 80W of pass-through charging, which means all your laptops will stay charged as you power through your productive days.</p>



<p>Compatibility-wise, the hub plays nicely with USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt 3/4 laptops, and supports Windows 10/11, macOS (12 and up), and ChromeOS systems. And since it’s quite lightweight, you can carry it around with you easily. Just toss it in your laptop bag, and you’re good to go!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5667/">Anker also throws in an 18-month warranty with your purchase for some extra peace of mind</a>. All things considered, it’s a great option to consider if you’re looking to manage a bunch of different devices in a compact, clean way. The current discount puts the hub in a much more affordable range.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>'s CEO believes the gaming industry is heading towards PC dominance, despite the company's upcoming publishing juggernaut <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> so far only slated for Xbox and PlayStation.</p>
<p>Strauss Zelnick made the comments earlier this week, while chatting with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/take-two-ceo-gaming-consoles-pc.html">CNBC's Squawk Box</a>. "I think [the industry is] moving towards PC, and business is moving towards open rather than closed," Zelnick said.</p>
<p>"But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours that you play on a big screen - that's never going away," the CEO furthered.</p>

<p>Zelnick's comments come one week after Valve announced its own range of gaming hardware, notably the Steam Machine, which is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-steam-machine-preview-a-powerful-customisable-mini-pc-for-couch-gaming">console/PC hybrid which will be able to run PC games on a television or as a normal gaming computer</a>.</p><p>Zelnick also touched on the mobile gaming market, which he said is growing more rapidly than the console market. "Mobile, of course, is taken with you, it's repeatable, and it's enjoyable," Zelnick said. "And I do think because it appeals to the broadest possible audience, it will probably continue to grow more rapidly."</p>
<p>During an earnings call, Zelnick stated Take-Two expects the mobile business to increase by roughly 10 percent in the next quarter.</p>

<p>Many publishers have moved to release their games on PC as well as consoles. PlayStation, for example, has steadily been making its once-console exclusives available via the likes of Steam over recent years. Earlier this year, former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida admitted porting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-games-on-pc-is-almost-like-printing-money-says-former-exec-shuhei-yoshida">PlayStation-exclusive games to PC is "almost like printing money"</a>, and provides an opportunity to invest in further games.</p><p>There is still <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-pc-version-teased-by-take-two-boss-acknowledges-platforms-growing-importance">no word on a GTA 6 PC release from Rockstar and Take-Two</a>, though. Earlier this year, Zelnick teased a PC release of GTA 6 will be on the way, but added the company tends not to "go across all platforms simultaneously". At this time, Take-Two's head noted the PC version of a multiplatform game can generate 40 percent of overall sales.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-update-1-7-adds-faction-turf-wars-expedition-mode-more/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ukrainian developer GSC Game World has released a major STALKER 2 patch, updating the game to version 1.7. The new version introduces the long-awaited 'turf wars' between factions, powered by the A-Life System, which was initially lacking and is now <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gets-big-1-5-patch-fixing-a-life-and-adding-mod-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being restored to its original vision one patch at a time</a>.</p>



<p>Now, factions can expand their control over new territories but may also lose control of their own lands if they fail to defend them. Various points of interest, checkpoints, and locations (but not hubs, to avoid disrupting missions) are contested by different NPCs and mutants, who also seek to defend their lairs and territories from their hostile neighbors, the titular Stalkers. Other AI improvements have made stealth in STALKER 2 more realistic and less frustrating, because NPCs won't easily spot players who successfully hide in reeds or tall grass, and even when they do, they'll be less accurate when shooting at bushes. On the other hand, human and creature NPCs have learned the art of tactical retreat if the fight isn't going their way, and they are also smarter when it comes to choosing the distance when fighting.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl — Expedition Showcase | Update 1.7" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iJdwhpMdpuA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Update 1.7 also introduces a new Master difficulty level, which can only be selected at the beginning of the game, and Expedition mode, which limits autosaves to when exiting camp and during specific missions, and locks players out of manual saving, except for saving to exit the game. Both are designed to increase the tension players feel while roaming the Zone.</p>



<p>STALKER 2's new patch features new anomalies, a rework of the stamina and sprint system (another source of frustration in the launch version of the game, in my opinion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as noted in my review</a>), an update to inventory and equipment stats, some improvements to the controller experience, and a new light rain weather scenario. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/596291616874954993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full changelog</a> also lists a ton of bug fixes.</p>



<p>The game is currently 30% off on Steam. The PlayStation 5 version <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is set to launch in just two days</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s latest set of additions, dubbed the California Resistance update, have arrived today, November 18th. Alongside the unboxing of the new suburban skirmish setting that is the Eastwood map and a sabotage mode, the update brings a sizeable patch with tweaks aimed at the likes of ensuring bullets do end up where you intend and making sure mortars are clean enough to eat meals off of.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ok, so maybe that last bit is exactly what the patch notes for update 1.1.2.0 mean when they speak of a "major polish pass to deployable gadgets, including the LWCMS Portable Mortar, LTLM II Portable Laser Designator, and Supply Crate systems." What they do make clear beyond all doubt is that the update's bringing golf carts. Eastwood has them nestled among its pools and fairways, and I assume they'll likely feature in the vehicle battle-focused "Rodeo" missions being added to gauntlet mode.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, sabotage is an 8v8 mode centered around bomb site destruction and probably listening to the Beastie Boys back catalogue on repeat. California Resistance also brings two new guns, the DB-12 shotgun and M357 trait sidearm. Finally, EA have announced that battle pickups, powerful guns with limited ammo you can grab for a short burst of firepower, are coming "later in the update".</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>The patch's other tweaks to the general field battling experience include aim assist being reset to what it was like during the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>'s open beta, with the aim of keeping aim slowdown "consistent across all ranges" by undoing a ratcheting up on long-range slowdown that came with release. Along similar lines, controller input latency and stick response has been revamped in order to allow for smoother aiming and better movement responsiveness.</p><p>In terms of tweaks to guns themselves, EA have "fixed unintended weapon dispersion increase rates and improved non-recon sniper rifle accuracy while globally reducing dispersion across all weapon types". Basically, most weapons should now have a better chance of hitting what you're aiming at. Away from the firing range, challenge and progression requirements should now be clearer and easier to keep track of.</p>
<p>The full notes are in the post above if you want the full briefing before heading to the war-torn golf course. If you do give the update a go, make sure to tut at anyone cheeky enough to try slapping the roof of a golf cart in case it flies up into the air and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-latest-update-shoots-down-hammer-wielding-drone-riders-and-permanently-fixes-lock-on-missiles">gives them a combat advantage</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The boss of Take-Two has said the industry is “moving towards PC” even as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> is still down for launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S only.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CEO Strauss Zelnick told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/take-two-ceo-gaming-consoles-pc.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC’s Squawk Box</a> that the video game business is trending towards “open rather than closed,” but insisted consoles — or console-style gaming — isn’t going anywhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it’s moving towards PC and business is moving towards open rather than closed,” Zelnick said. “But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours that you play on a big screen — that’s never going away.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The future of the video game console has become one of the hottest topics in the industry, with Microsoft expected to release a PC / console hybrid as its next-gen Xbox. Gaming rival Sony is expected to release a more traditional console as the PS6. Nintendo, meanwhile, is sticking firmly to its long-standing hardware position, bolstered by blockbuster exclusives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelnick’s comments come amid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-announces-next-gen-steam-machine-says-its-over-6x-more-powerful-than-steam-deck-but-theres-no-price-yet">Valve’s announcement of a next-gen Steam Machine</a>, itself backed by a new Steam Controller. The Steam Machine is a gaming-focused PC designed to be more accessible than a standard desktop PC, with a sleek, cube-like design and SteamOS on-board. It’s a clear play for the PC in the living room space, and gets in ahead of Microsoft’s own reported next-gen console ambitions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-welcomes-steam-machine-announcement-in-congratulatory-message-to-valve-with-next-gen-xbox-waiting-in-the-wings">Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer welcomed the Steam Machine announcement</a>. “Gaming moves forward when players and developers have more ways to play and create, especially across open platforms,” <a href="https://x.com/XboxP3/status/1988677531801944496" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Spencer tweeted</u></a>. “Expanding access across PC, console, and handheld devices reflects a future built on choice, core values that have guided Xbox's vision from the start. As one of the largest publishers on Steam, we welcome new options for players to access games everywhere. Congrats on today's announce.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Next-gen Steam Machine Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A recent report claimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-will-reportedly-play-playstation-games-like-god-of-war-and-spider-man-because-its-a-console-pc-hybrid-that-runs-steam"><u>the next Xbox is a console / PC hybrid that will play PlayStation games released on PC via Steam</u></a>. That means the likes of Sony Santa Monica’s God of War, Insomniac’s Spider-Man, Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Tsushima and pretty much all other PC games will all be playable on the next-gen Xbox in an industry first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-ambitious-new-xbox-your-entire-console-library-the-full-power-of-windows-pc-gaming-and-more" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Windows Central</u></a> reported that while users of the next-gen Xbox can remain inside the Xbox ecosystem if they want, they can exit to Windows, where the console acts like a traditional Windows PC. That means having access to PlayStation games on Steam, and mouse and keyboard games from Blizzard's launcher, Battle.net (World of Warcraft), and Riot's launcher (League of Legends).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following that report, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-funny-that-people-think-about-the-console-pc-as-two-different-things-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-drops-biggest-hint-yet-that-the-next-xbox-is-basically-a-pc"><u>dropped yet another hint that the next-gen Xbox is basically a PC</u></a>. In an interview with <a href="https://www.tbpn.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TBPN</u></a>, Nadella responded to questions about the evolution of the company’s gaming business, and in doing so dropped a clear hint at where the company is going.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Remember, the biggest gaming business is the Windows business,” Nadella began. “To us, gaming on Windows… and of course, Steam has built a massive marketplace on top of it, and they’ve done a very successful job. Now, we’re the largest publisher after the Activision [deal]. Therefore we want to be a fantastic publisher. Similar approach to what we did with Office. We want to be everywhere, in every platform. So we want to make sure, whether it’s consoles, whether it’s the PC, whether it’s mobile, whether it’s cloud gaming, or the TV, we just want to make sure the games are being enjoyed by gamers everywhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Second, we also wanted to do innovative work in the system side on the console and on the PC. It’s kind of funny that people think about the console-PC as two different things. We built the console because we wanted to build a better PC which could then perform for gaming. I kind of want to revisit some of that conventional wisdom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But at the end of the day, console has an experience that is unparalleled. It delivers performance that is unparalleled, that pushes I think the system forward. So I’m really looking forward to the next console, the next PC gaming.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward to last week, and Valve appears to have gazumped Microsoft by returning to the Steam Machine. In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview"><u>an interview with IGN ahead of the reveal</u></a>, we asked Valve software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais and hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat whether they saw gaming PCs being the natural evolution of the console, given both Microsoft and Valve’s efforts here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s how they responded:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pierre-Loup Griffais:</strong> When we think about what to work on next and working on things like Steam Machine and stuff, we're typically not looking at consoles or other products in that direction. Everything we do is informed by what's happening on the PC gaming side of things. Of course there ends up being quite a bit of overlap because we’re doing a bunch of stuff that helps PC gaming work better in the living room and that's traditionally where consoles have been. But really I would say that most of our thinking is not informed by what's happening on the console side, and so I don't know if we have many theories as to where that might be headed. But in general it seems like people seem to be recognizing that there's quite a bit of value in a more PC-like experience and the customizability and all that, and so we're happy to see more of these elements being embraced by platforms in general.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yazan Aldehayyat:</strong> As far as we're concerned the Steam Machine is a PC, so that delineation is not there. In our view, the Steam Machine is just one option in the ecosystem of gaming PCs out there. If you're already happy with your PC gaming experience, that's great. We love that. We are a PC gaming company. We're just trying to give you more options. And that's how we view it. It's just something that we think is a really great addition to a living room or a desktop, but it's just one other option that people can have available to them to play their Steam games basically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don’t know when exactly the Steam Machine will come out, beyond a vague 2026 release window, and we don’t know how much it will cost (Aldehayyat told us the Steam Machine “is going to be a really competitive price to that and provide really good value to it”).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for GTA 6, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-updates-main-gta-6-website-with-new-release-date-and-sorry-pc-gamers-its-still-down-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s-only">PC gamers are worried they won’t get to play the game until late 2027 or perhaps even 2028</a>, given its recent delay to November 2026. Will Rockstar bring forward the inevitable PC release as a result?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response"><u>Last year Zelnick was asked if the lack of a PC version of GTA 6 was set in stone</u></a>. Here’s Zelnick’s response in full:</p><blockquote>Well, the lack of an announcement is not something that could be set in stone as near as I could tell, because the only thing that happens after the lack of an announcement is an announcement, I suppose, or a continuing lack of an announcement, I guess that could happen too. It doesn’t seem to me that either would be set in stone.</blockquote><blockquote>But Rockstar has an approach to platforms which we’ve seen before, and they will make more announcements in due time. I do believe that the right strategy for our business is to be where the consumer is, and historically what this company has done is address consumers anywhere they are, on any platform that makes sense, over time.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">That was Zelnick dancing around the inevitable PC version of GTA 6, but he did point to Rockstar’s release strategy for its previous games. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/place-your-bets-will-gta-6-release-on-pc-on-the-same-day-it-does-on-consoles/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fans of Rockstar games</u></a> have noted the studio's historical reluctance to release other past games on PC day-and-date with console, as well as its fraught relationship with the modding community over the years. Still, some had hoped that a game as big as GTA 6 could be a turning point for the studio's PC gaming attitude, only to have those hopes dashed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big Rockstar titles tend to get to PC eventually, but the question is how long PC gamers will have to wait for the biggest entertainment launch of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on GTA 6 in the meantime, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/publisher-jokes-concern-and-a-lot-of-memes-the-internet-reacts-to-the-gta-6-delay"><u>how the internet reacted to the GTA 6 delay</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-shouldnt-be-surprised-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-delayed-rockstar-history"><u>why it’s no surprise it was delayed in the first place</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>Nintendo has told Eurogamer it has no intention of hindering the use of third-party <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> docks following its latest console update.</p>
<p>Last week, update 21.0.0 was issued that makes a number of software tweaks, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-update-for-switch-consoles-finally-indicates-if-your-games-are-digital-or-physical">addition of symbols to indicate if software is physical or digital</a>. However, some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/third-party-switch-2-docks-reportedly-no-longer-compatible-after-nintendos-latest-console-update">Switch 2 owners reported third-party docks no longer worked</a> following the update.</p>
<p>Nintendo has now issued a response. "Nintendo Switch 2 outputs audiovisuals once it detects that it is docked into a Nintendo Switch 2 Dock," the company told Eurogamer. "Nintendo Switch does the same, outputting audiovisuals once it detects that it is docked into a Nintendo Switch Dock. Nintendo does not have any intention to hinder or invalidate legal third-party dock compatibility."</p>

<p>The Switch 2, of course, comes with a dock in the box, but some users have purchased additional docks to play in other rooms or for travelling, for example.</p>
<p>An official dock from the Nintendo store will set you back £92.99, however, so many users have purchased third-party options instead.</p>
<p>It would appear, following Nintendo's statement, that any incompatibility issues caused with third-party docks are unintentional.</p>
<p>Outside of games, Nintendo has two big films in the works. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-breakdown-of-the-super-mario-galaxy-movies-first-trailer-with-the-easter-eggs-weve-spotted">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie got its first official trailer</a> last week, while the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-think-these-set-photos-are-telling-us-a-lot-more-about-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-than-nintendo-is-letting-on-analysis">Legend of Zelda movie has now begun filming</a>.</p>

            <p>I’ve moaned plenty about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-best-settings">technical and performance woes</a> that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> inflicted upon itself, and only seems committed to remedying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patches-will-keep-coming-if-almost-as-slowly-as-the-game-still-runs">at a glacial pace</a>. Yet on the possibility of future RE Engine-powered games suffering the same fate, even I haven’t been as worried as certain Capcom investors, who recently extracted an assurance from the developer-publisher that upcoming horror sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a> will arrive in better shape.</p>
<p>During a conference call to discuss fiscal earnings and other businessy matters – the official transcript is <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_02.pdf">here</a>, translated from the original Japanese – Capcom were asked if there was "a risk that Resident Evil Requiem will experience technical issues similar to those seen with Monster Hunter Wilds." The response: nah mates, probably not.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In as many words, anyway. The full answer reads: "Resident Evil Requiem differs from Monster Hunter Wilds in terms of gameplay, system architecture, and network features. At present, we do not anticipate similar risks. We are developing the game to provide a smooth gaming experience across a wide range of PC specifications."</p>

<p>While it’s a stretch to pin much of Wilds' crap framerates, popping textures, or complete misappropriation of frame gen tech on "network features," it is true that Requiem is a very different game. It’s also made by a separate team within Capcom, and has the benefit of following two previous RE Engine-built Resi games whose imperfections on PC didn’t come anywhere close a Wilds-level disaster. When Katharine (RPS in peace) was hardware ed, she declared <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> one of the "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-village-pc-performance-best-settings">best-looking PC games of the year</a>" that nonetheless ran "supremely well" provided you kept within your GPU’s expected limits.</p><p>More recently, in July 2025, I played Resident Evil Requiem itself on a PS5 Pro and it seemed pretty much fine. This was the same <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-requiem-has-its-own-version-of-lady-dimitrescu-but-i-doubt-youll-be-thirsting-for-this-hag">hag-dodging demo that Edwin tried</a> previously, though since we lost comms this morning after he disappeared down a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/morsels">Morsels</a> reviewing hole, I don’t know whether he played that on a PC or console. Or, indeed, if any of us will ever see him again.</p>
