		<p>EpicTellers Entertainment has announced that those who have backed Starfinder: Afterlight with the closed beta access option will be able to play some of the early parts of the game in February. If you are interested in getting in on the closed beta, you can still back Starfinder: Afterlight on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epictellers/starfinder-afterlight?ref=33q47w&amp;utm_source=steam&amp;utm_campaign=closedbeta&amp;utm_medium=steamnews&amp;utm_content=devpost">Kickstarter</a> which will grant access. Additionally, EpicTellers Entertainment has stated it is aiming to launch Starfinder: Afterlight’s early access in Q2 or Q3 this year.</p>

<p>Those who get to play the Starfinder: Afterlight closed beta will have the opportunity to experience the opening 45-60 minutes of Act 1’s gameplay, three pre-made character builds to try including Human Soldier, Vesk Envoy, and Shirren Operative, and to explore the Entertainment District of Hivemarket on Akiton. This opening section will also give players their first interactions with Preach, Sterling,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Larva, which will contain full voice acting. Additional details about the closed beta are going to be announced closer to the time of release.</p>
<p>At full release, Starfinder Afterlight will have between 40 to 60 hours of gameplay, with multiple difficulty settings available for those who want everything from experiencing the story to challenging combat. There will be a full voice cast and Eduardo de la Iglesia is composing the soundtrack, and Starfinder Afterlight will also support mods. The game itself is a &nbsp;CRPG based on the Paizo’s sci-fi and fantasy tabletop RPG.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, we learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-developer-direct-showcase-january-2026">Microsoft has announced another Developer Direct, set to take place on the 22nd January</a>. It'll feature Fable and Beast of Reincarnation, as well as a "deep dive" into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>, with a focus on gameplay and reveals of new features.</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 6 will be set in Japan, as revealed by Microsoft at this year's Tokyo Game Show. Not only that, it will be the biggest and "most full" of any map in the series so far.
</p>
<p>"This map that we've created for Japan, or Horizon's version of Japan, is big, but also dense," art director Don Arceta recently said. "There's always something around the corner for you to discover and see." What's more, the map will include Tokyo too - "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-6-will-integrate-japanese-culture-into-the-most-full-series-location-so-far">the biggest city that we've done in a Horizon game yet</a>."

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/850479/desk-pc-keyboard-razer-kobo</link>
            <guid>1402462</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Stevie Bonifield is a news writer here at </em>The Verge<em> and, they say, “I cover a little bit of just about everything, from the FCC to AI shopping tools to Linux.” Before joining our news team, they wrote weekend news for </em>PC Gamer <em>and did reviews, news, features, and guides for </em>Laptop Mag<em>, along with some stories for </em>Tom’s Guide, IGN, TechRadar<em>, and </em>XDA<em>. “I’ve been reading (and watching) </em>The Verge<em> since I was in high school,“ they add, ”so it’s pretty exciting to be part of the team now.“ </em></p><p><em>Outside of writing, Stevie says “I also love gaming, reading, and TTRPGs (tabletop roleplaying games). As you’ll probably be able to tell from my workspace, I’m kind of a total nerd.” </em></p><p><strong>Let’s begin with the basics. Where is your work space located?</strong></p><p>My desk and work space are in my bedroom. I share my apartment with a roommate, so we both work from our bedrooms so we don’t distract each other during the day. I don’t really mind not having a separate office — it means I only have to worry about decorating and managing one space instead of two. I recently moved to New Jersey from Pittsburgh, PA, so I’m still getting everything set up here.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>A VIVO adjustable desk, together with a Haworth Breck chair, makes working more comfortable.</em></figcaption></p></div><p><strong>Could you tell us about your desk and your chair?</strong></p><div><p>I’m using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073K1JSW7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">VIVO 3-stage adjustable desk</a> with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WQ117GP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">VIVO 60-inch desktop</a> and a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D1025X1701640%26xs%3D1%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fstore.haworth.com%252Fproducts%252Fbreck-office-chair" rel="sponsored">Haworth Breck</a> chair. I got both when I moved last month, so I haven’t been using them for long, but I like them so far.</p></div><p>This is actually a standing desk, which I’ve never used before. I got it so I could have my desk height pretty low — I’m on the shorter side and most desks are too high for me. This one goes all the way down to 24 inches, lower than even I need, which is really nice. The option to use it as a standing desk is a cool perk, even though that isn’t what I bought it for. My cable management under the desk still needs some cleaning up, but I’m working on it! I have a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CV9P2FR5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">VIVO clamp-on cable management net</a> containing most of it for now.</p><p>I like the Haworth Breck so far, but it’s a pretty basic chair. Like my desk, a big part of why I got this one is its height range. It’s extremely difficult for me to find decent desk chairs that go as low as I need them to (<em>without</em> requiring a footrest). This one has a minimum seat height of around 15 inches and has adjustable seat depth, both of which I’ve really appreciated. That said, I wish it had a headrest.</p><p><strong>Tell us about the various tech devices you’re using. </strong></p><p>My setup is a little crazy because I have three different computers running to my two monitors.</p><div id=":R1j1djeab96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>A gaming PC with unfortunate issues.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>This desk side device lets laptops hang off the side of the desk.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>My gaming PC lives on the floor under my desk. It’s currently temporarily out of commission because I’m having a hardware issue. Unfortunately, my RAM seems to be on the fritz, which is pretty bad timing considering the current <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/839506/ram-shortage-price-increases-pc-gaming-smartphones">RAM pricing nightmare</a>. Most of it is still working, though! It has an AMD Ryzen 7 7700X CPU, an AMD Radeon RX 6600 GPU, an Asus ROG Strix B650-A motherboard, and a pair of 16GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5 RAM sticks (which apparently need to be replaced, after less than a year of use).</p><p>That’s also my Linux PC — it’s currently running Fedora 41 with the Cinnamon desktop environment, but I’m updating to Fedora 43 soon and planning to switch to the KDE Plasma desktop environment.</p><p>Hanging off the side of my desk are my work and personal laptops, both the M4 MacBook Air. My laptops are only connected to my left monitor, which is a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZTBVKKW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">27-inch 1440p Viewsonic Omni (VX2728J-2K)</a>. My gaming PC is connected to both monitors. I mainly play games on the right monitor since it has better color accuracy. It’s a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CV24GQ9W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">27-inch 1440p Asus ROG Strix gaming monitor (XG27ACS)</a>.</p><p>Neither one of my monitors is anything fancy, but both are good enough for my needs. Between the two, I would probably recommend the ROG one more, although I’m not a huge fan of the buttons being located on the back since I need those to swap input modes so I can switch to my Mac. When I’m working during the day I usually have my work laptop running on the left monitor and my Linux PC on the right monitor. My keyboard and mouse I chose specifically because they make it easy to jump between all my devices.</p><div id=":R1k9djeab96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The Nuphy Halo75 V2 with Nuphy’s Mint switches.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>This mouse is Stevie’s favorite right now.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>I’ve reviewed quite a few keyboards, so it’s a little ironic that the one I’m using now I actually haven’t reviewed. It’s the <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/nuphy-Mechancial-Swappable-Bluetooth-Raspberry/dp/B0D5Q5XYLV?sr=8-2&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Nuphy Halo75 V2</a> with Nuphy’s Mint switches. It sounds and feels great, works really smoothly with macOS, and I can jump between my laptops and PC with a quick keyboard shortcut. The battery life could be a bit better, but admittedly I leave the RGB on, so that’s probably not helping. Overall, though, I really like the design and sound quality on the Halo75 — it’s one of the only keyboards I’ve tried that I’m happy with out-of-the-box without making any DIY customizations.</p><p>My mouse is actually one of my favorite devices right now. I’ve tested some great gaming mice, but this one is my personal daily driver and not one I reviewed. It’s the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22403511/razer-orochi-v2-wireless-gaming-mouse-battery-life-custom-price-features">Razer Orochi V2</a>, and I got it on sale for $35 on Amazon earlier this year. It’s nothing fancy, but the size and feel are perfect for me. Most gaming mice feel kind of enormous in my hand, but I swear Razer designed the Orochi for my palm specifically. Like my keyboard, it’s also able to jump between a Bluetooth connection and a 2.4GHz dongle. Despite the budget-friendly price, it’s a great mouse.</p><p>Underneath that I’m currently using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09GWBBPXK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Matrix Blizzard mousepad</a>. I got it on Amazon, but unfortunately, I think it’s sold out now. I wanted something with a little bit of a design going on, but not anything too detailed or distracting. This design just about perfectly fit what I was looking for. I wish it was a tad thicker, but it’s more interesting than a plain black mousepad, and that’s good enough for me.</p><p>I have two controllers on my desk, a <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Headsets-Console/dp/B0F1HTGDTL?sr=8-2&amp;tag=theverge02-20">standard Xbox controller</a> for my Mac and the <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Xbox-One-X-S-Windows/dp/B09C13DWYL?sr=1-1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">wired Razer Wolverine V2</a> for my gaming PC. I don’t normally like wired controllers, but I really love the Wolverine. The clicky buttons on Razer controllers are so satisfying to me, and they tend to offer consistently good performance in my experience. My favorite mobile controller is also from Razer, the <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Gaming-Controller-Android-iPhone-Smartphone/dp/B0CXGMPLWK?sr=1-1&amp;ufe=app_do:amzn1.fos.9fe8cbfa-bf43-43d1-a707-3f4e65a4b666&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Kishi Ultra</a>.</p><p>My preferred headphones are my <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Translation-Headphones-High-Fidelity/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?sr=1-3&amp;tag=theverge02-20">AirPods Pro 3</a>. The ANC and spatial audio is fantastic for watching shows and movies on my laptop (and helps me focus when I’m working). I don’t like wearing earbuds all the time, though, so I also keep a basic pair of on-ear Sony headphones around, the <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-CH520-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone/dp/B0BS1QB15L?sr=1-2&amp;tag=theverge02-20">WH-CH250</a>. The audio quality on these isn’t particularly impressive, but they’re super affordable.</p><p>Last, but certainly not least, I also have a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Seiren-Chroma-Microphone-Mute/dp/B0CT7D7JVR?sr=8-2&amp;ufe=app_do:amzn1.fos.9fe8cbfa-bf43-43d1-a707-3f4e65a4b666&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Razer Seiren V3 Chroma</a> mic off to the side of my desk on a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091TL554W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">clamp-on mic arm</a> I got on Amazon. I’ve been using the Seiren for a couple years now for gaming and playing <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> with my online group. The audio quality could be a bit better, but it’s a significant improvement over most built-in headphone mics, and I’ve never had any bugs or issues with it. Notably, it works on Linux for me without needing any tweaks or work-arounds.</p><p><strong>That is a great laptop holder you have at the side of your desk. What is it?</strong></p><p>I just got that when I moved last month, and it’s one of my favorite additions to my desk setup. It’s a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQX3WTB8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">double-decker laptop mount</a> I got for around $30 on Amazon and just clamps onto the side of my desk (no screws necessary!).</p><p>I wanted to free up some desk space, and this lets me keep both of my laptops nearby and out of the way at the same time. I also used a command strip to stick a USB-C hub to the back of the laptop tray, so I can quickly hop between my personal and work laptops on my external monitor by just moving over the USB-C cable and charging cable.</p><p><strong>Great wall decorations. Tell us a bit about your Elmville map and what surrounds it.</strong></p><p>This is the wall across from my desk that people see when I have my webcam on, so I put all my coolest stuff on it. I’m a huge fan of <a href="https://watch.dropout.tv/dimension-20"><em>Dimension 20</em></a> on Dropout, so I immediately picked up one of those Elmville maps when they released them. For those who haven’t checked out <em>Dimension 20</em> yet, Elmville is the main setting for <em>Fantasy High</em>, one of the best shows Dropout has to offer, in my humble opinion.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>There is a lot of really cool stuff up on the wall across from the desk.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The smaller horizontal picture below the map is actually a page from Dropout’s 2025 <em>Dimension 20</em> calendar that I got at their Madison Square Garden show last January. It’s a scene from season 2 of <em>Fantasy High</em>, and I just thought the artist did such a great job with it that it deserved to be framed. Off to the right above that one is a print I got from an art convention. It’s not from any show or movie as far as I know; the design just resonated with me.</p><p>The two smaller prints above the map are also from art conventions and were made by the same artist, <a href="https://www.1000deaddraculas.com/">Natasha Tara Petrović</a>. The purple one is some cool Mothman art — I have a soft spot for cryptids and spooky stuff. The blue one is a <em>Dark Souls</em> print that makes the game look <em>way</em> cozier than it is.</p><p>And last but not least, I’ve got some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B83GQKR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Nanoleaf Elements</a> tiles lighting up that wall. These are the first smart lights I’ve ever bought, and they’re pretty cool, especially with the more mellow wood look. I have them set to shift colors and brightness throughout the day.</p><p><strong>You’re obviously into <em>Star Wars</em> and other science fiction / fantasy worlds, judging from the toys over your bookcase and the figures on that little shelf. Are you a serious fan or do you just like the genre?</strong></p><p>I am a huge <em>Star Wars</em> fan. One of my earliest memories is watching <em>The Phantom Menace</em> on VHS, and I’ve loved the franchise ever since. Obi-Wan is my favorite character, which I’m noticing is a bit obvious in my work space.</p><p>The lightsaber above my bookcase is Obi-Wan’s from<em> The Phantom Menace</em>. I’ve had it since probably kindergarten or first grade, so it’s a little beat up. And next to that I’ve got a special edition Obi-Wan Funko Pop. Then above my desk I have a Lego model of Obi-Wan’s Jedi starfighter from <em>Attack of the Clones</em>.</p><p>On the shelf below that I’ve managed to squeeze in the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> series minifigures I’ve collected (I’m a few shy of the full collection). These shelves ended up being way smaller than expected, so I’m planning to add more so things aren’t quite so cramped. I thought Lego did a great job with these <em>D&amp;D</em> minifigures, though, and would love to see them do more <em>D&amp;D</em> sets. My personal favorite from this series is the dragonborn paladin.</p><div id=":R1ppdjeab96:"><div><div><p><figcaption><em> Obi-Wan’s lightsaber from </em>The Phantom Menace <em>along with some Funko Pops.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>A Lego model of Obi-Wan’s Jedi starfighter.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><div><div><p><figcaption><em>A collection of </em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons<em> series minifigures.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>And finally, the rock collection.</em></figcaption></p></div></div></div><p>The other Funko Pop next to Obi-Wan is Vi from <em>Arcane</em>, which is a truly phenomenal show and a personal favorite of mine. I’m not much of a Funko Pop person, but I’ll get them from time to time if it’s a character I really like.</p><p>I guess I would say I’m a serious sci-fi and fantasy fan, although I tend to connect with specific series or books and stick with those. To go back to the <em>Star Wars</em> example, on one of the lower shelves in my bookcase, I have most of the old <em>Jedi Apprentice</em> books. They’ve gotten pretty hard to find, but I loved them as a kid, so I’m trying to collect them all again.</p><p>On the fantasy side of things, I love epic fantasy like <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, but also like some YA books, especially <em>The Hunger Games</em> and <em>Percy Jackson</em>. At the moment, I’m reading <em>The Name of the Wind</em> by Patrick Rothfuss and <em>Brigands &amp; Breadknives</em> by Travis Baldree, which is the third book in his <em>Legends &amp; Lattes</em> series. Both are great, although they have drastically different tones.</p><p><strong>You also have a rock collection!</strong></p><p>I do! Much like a goldfish, it has grown to fill the size of its container, and now it can grow no more. I’ve always had an interest in geology and have had some of the rocks and minerals in that case since I was a kid.</p><p>I have a bunch of quartz, a geode, some copper, chalcopyrite, amazonite, dravite, moissanite, a sliver of obsidian, a lump of basalt, some feldspar and sedimentary rocks, and a bunch of smaller tumbled stones. There’s also a chunk of petrified wood in the back that I found in a streambed. My favorites are the chunk of amber in the front and the bismuth above it — I love how bismuth crystals get that neat geometric shape.</p><p><strong>Anything else I missed that you’d like to add?</strong></p><p>While I don’t use it for work, my <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.kobobooks.com%2Fproducts%2Fkobo-clara-bw" rel="sponsored">Kobo Clara BW e-reader</a> is almost always on my desk. My bookcases are pretty much full (and a bit small — I’m planning to replace them eventually), so I’ve been reading more ebooks over the past year or so.</p><p>I switched from a Kindle to a Kobo several months ago and have been loving the Kobo. The display and user experience on the Clara are better than their Kindle counterparts in my experience, and you have more freedom to add books from outside Kobo’s store and back up everything in your library on other devices. My Kobo is in my everyday carry now, although in hindsight, I wish I’d gotten one with a color display.</p><p><em>Photography by Stevie Bonifield</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzA3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Barbara Krasnoff</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/850479/desk-pc-keyboard-razer-kobo]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/859675/diora-review-playdate-monument-valley</link>
            <guid>1402459</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://play.date/games/diora/"><em>Diora</em></a> might be the most ambitious game I’ve played on the Playdate. It’s all about perspective: You turn the handheld’s crank to rotate your viewpoint of the bite-size 3D landscapes, which lets you peek around corners to find solutions to various puzzles. On a device with a 1-bit, black-and-white display, the miniature worlds feel miraculous, like little dioramas you can spin around in your hands. But the most impressive part is the puzzles that will have you twisting your brain as much as the crank.</p><p>In <em>Diora</em> you play a “network technician” traveling to various locations across a city, fixing up machinery in the wake of a strange accident. Repairing things is easy; all you have to do is reach the computer at the end of each level. Getting there is the hard part.</p><p><em>Diora</em> starts out relatively simple. You hit switches to open up gates or push platforms to create pathways. What makes these familiar puzzles interesting, though, is how <em>Diora</em> plays with your viewpoint. You have to constantly shift where you’re looking to find the right way forward. This can turn even seemingly simple challenges into real brain-scratchers. Each level also steadily ratchets up the intensity. Most have you exploring multi-level structures where the first few floors introduce a concept before hitting you with something more complex.</p><p>It’s reminiscent of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317107/monument-valley-3-netflix-launch-ustwo-games-interview"><em>Monument Valley</em></a> or <em>Fez</em>, though <em>Diora</em> is different in a few key ways. For one, the architecture (mostly) isn’t filled with M.C. Escher-inspired impossibilities, but instead buildings and structures rooted in reality. And whereas <em>Monument Valley</em> is an almost serene experience, <em>Diora</em> can get <em>really</em> hard. I found myself stuck on more than one occasion, as many of the solutions involve making decisions in a very precise order. There’s no hint system to help you out, which can be frustrating, but <em>Diora</em> does at least have a checkpoint system that means you won’t be replaying huge chunks of the game after making a mistake.</p><p>This game is also a good sign that, a few years after launch, developers are really pushing the edges of what the Playdate is capable of. There aren’t many 3D titles on the handheld, and <em>Diora</em> has a sort of grittiness that both fits the Playdate’s aesthetic and lends the game a surprisingly chill postapocalyptic vibe. <em>Diora</em> even has a built-in level editor so you can create your own puzzles.</p><p>Not long ago I wrote that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/811497/playdate-puzzle-game-reviews-lexgrid-togglebot-what-time-is-it">one of the Playdate’s strengths was its steadily growing library of puzzle games</a>. They suit the device perfectly: experiences you can play in short bursts when you’re on the go, but also lose yourself in when you’re traveling or otherwise killing time. <em>Diora</em> is right near the top of the list of games I’d recommend; it’s technically impressive, but more importantly, it’s a puzzler that forces your brain to see things in different ways.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/859675/diora-review-playdate-monument-valley]]></content:encoded>

			<p>British developer <strong>Playground Games</strong> will be the absolute star of the <strong>Xbox Developer Direct 2026</strong>, with the first in-depth look at the long-awaited <strong>Fable</strong> reboot and the proper reveal of <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong>, a sequel to a massively successful game that is estimated to have been played by over 50 million users. Sure, there's also Game Freak's Beast of Reincarnation and even a <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-features-secret-fourth-game-says-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored 'secret' fourth game</a>, but those two games are going to be the centerpiece of the showcase due to air on <strong>January 22</strong>.</p>



<p>Officially, both Fable and Forza Horizon 6 are only announced for <strong>PC</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series S|X</strong>. However, given <strong>Microsoft</strong>'s multiplatform policy, they are almost certainly coming to other platforms, starting with <strong>Sony's PlayStation 5</strong> console. Forza Horizon 5 launched in April 2025 on PS5 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performed extremely well there</a>, after all, which is why some users were surprised when the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got announced only for Microsoft's traditional platforms</a> a few months ago.</p>



<p>A few hours ago, speaking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jph13-tKWcY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the latest episode (#154) of the VGC podcast</a>, Andy Robinson shared why that might be the case. According to his sources at Playground, Forza Horizon 6 simply wasn't ready to launch on PS5 right away, but Fable very well might. </p>



<p><em>Fable's day and date. That's what I've been told. Those are the sort of details where insiders misstep, right? Those are the sorts of details that can be changed a week before or a day before. The other stuff is kind of like a bit more set in stone. Yes, it's coming to PlayStation 5. I'd expect it to be day and date because I know they've been targeting PS5 for a while. </em></p>



<p><em>[as for] Forza Horizon 6, I mean, I don't know the full story of Forza, but the explanation I was told by someone who was there was, like, it just wasn't ready. I don't know how true that is, because I mean, it's going to be absolutely massive, but that game would be absolutely massive if it's launching on everything day one, right? You'd kind of think that's a bit of a hindrance for them. I mean, even Xbox stalwarts are starting to drift away from playing on the console now. It'll have a humongous PC launch, but PS5 I mean, look at like Indiana Jones: The Great Circle. It did so well when it came out on PS5 afterwards. I imagine they'll do their best to get that out as soon as they can.</em></p>



<p>It is indeed surprising, but Playground wouldn't want to delay the launch of FH6 just to wait for the PS5 version to be ready. After all, there's now evidence that even the very late launch of FH5 resonated strongly with the PlayStation community; a few months shouldn't be a problem. On the other hand, launching Fable immediately on all major platforms should enhance the game's visibility.</p>



<p>Neither game has a specific release window yet, but that should change at the aforementioned Xbox Developer Direct 2026. Currently, though, it is believed that Playground will start off with Forza Horizon 6 somewhere in Q2, while Fable will probably debut later in the year (although likely still before GTA 6, if at all possible).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342952/best-runs-of-agdq-2025-speedrunning-charity-twitch">Games Done Quick</a>, the biannual charity speedrunning event currently going on right now, not only helps organizations like the Prevent Cancer Foundation and Doctors Without Borders — it helps indie games get noticed, too. Indie game developers face an incredible uphill battle not only getting their projects funded, completed, and launched, but discovered as well. Events like GDQ can be a boon to developers, exposing tens of thousands of viewers to little-known games like <em>Bat to the Heavens</em>, <em>Small Saga</em>, and more.</p><p>“It was extremely exciting,” said Ceroro, developer of <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3044100%2FBat_to_the_Heavens%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Bat to the Heavens</em></a>, a platformer in which the character must ascend to the heavens using a bat because she cannot jump. <em>Bat to the Heavens</em> is Ceroro’s first official game and was released in 2024. It was featured during Awesome Games Done Quick 2026 and late last year at <a href="https://horaro.org/rtaij/rtaijw2025">RTA in Japan</a>. Ceroro said that while her game has been generally successful, getting on GDQ gave it a big boost. “Right after the AGDQ run, there was a large burst in sales and wishlists I haven’t seen since I initially released the game!” she said.</p><p>Solo developer Darya Noghani said <a href="https://smallsaga.com/"><em>Small Saga</em></a>, her turn-based RPG about a mouse who wants to kill god, got a nice uptick in attention after being featured at GDQ as well. “A number of streamers played the game on Twitch, several commenters recommended the game on platforms like Bluesky, and there was a nice uptick in sales,” they said.</p><p>But the attention of getting your game run at a GDQ event can come with a price. “You’re in a state of apprehension,” said Noghani. Speedrunners extensively exploit glitches and develop techniques to skip large chunks of gameplay, which might show viewers a less-than-ideal version of the game. “Runners are pushing the game to break in particular ways, and you know this is adjacent to the game just crashing and ruining the run.”</p><p>But Noghani also said that the <em>Small Saga </em>run was relatively glitch-free: “I’ll take that as a win.”</p><p>Sometimes a runner breaking a game is what the developer had in mind. “Exploits and glitches are something that taps into the nature of game design,” Ceroro said. While the <em>Bat to the Heavens </em>run also didn’t make extensive use of glitches, “A lot of the extreme movement and techniques used in the run are pretty much within bounds of the intended design,” she said.</p><p>Ceroro’s also not worried that watching a speedrun of <em>Bat to the Heavens</em> will spoil the game for potential new players. “The speedrun for <em>Bat to the Heavens</em> went by too fast to actually get a good understanding of everything or how the game actually feels, so it’ll be a shock to new players,” she said.</p><p>Thanks to GDQ, new players are coming. But while all the developers I spoke to were pleased with the newfound attention and increased sales, they also said the personal achievement of getting their game run at GDQ was just as important.</p><p>“It’s been exciting,” said Noghani. “Because GDQ is genuinely well-loved by both players and developers, not just for its charitable causes, but because of the efforts they’ve taken to cultivate an uplifting community.”</p><p>GDQ is much beloved in the online gaming community. Over the years, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23341082/awesome-games-done-quick-2023-online-event-florida-ron-desantis">event runners have implemented a top-down approach</a> to diversity and inclusion, hosting <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/site/blackinaflash">several</a> <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/site/framefatales">smaller events</a> focused on highlighting streamers from marginalized backgrounds. GDQ has also fostered a community where saying “trans rights” elicits the same kind of enthusiastic response that an OSU alum would get <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2180057762412949">shouting “O-H”</a> in a crowded Columbus bar.</p><p>“In the development community, it’s a giant moment,” said Xalavier Nelson Jr., creative director at <em>Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator </em>developer Strange Scaffold, which has had <a href="https://youtu.be/PevqoNW1ktg?si=VPZCw0Pze-wnE6Up">its games featured in GDQ events</a>. “I got about as many congratulations for appearing on Games Done Quick as I have for getting married. It’s that much of a touchstone — and that positive of an overall event and community.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/859891/awesome-games-done-quick-2026-indie-games-small-saga]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The online multiplayer mech base building and looter SAND: Raiders of Sophie is going to be releasing in March for PC, with <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10010847/">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/sand-raiders-of-sophie/9ng0ffht5mcb">Xbox Series XS</a> versions available to wishlist now too. Publisher tinyBuild and developer Hologryph announced the news with a brand new trailer that showcases different elements of SAND: Raiders of Sophie’s gameplay, including the mech base building, combat between the mechs, and looting areas in a procedurally generated map.</p>
<p><iframe title="SAND: Raiders Of Sophie | Release Month Reveal | Explosive Multiplayer Mech Action" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W0bcDA5y3yQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>SAND: Raiders of Sophie is set in an alternate 1910s where players can search for resources amongst the ruins of Sophie, and to settle scores. This can be done alone but the emphasis is on squad play, where players team up to build their walking bases known as Tramplers. These walking bases are a mix of a central base, a vehicle to help navigate the world, and a weapons platform that can engage in battle with other Tramplers. How Tramplers are constructed is up to the players with each one being fully customisable, so they can have their own layouts and looks.</p>
<p>Exploration is not limited to moving the Trampler from place to place. Players can walk around the world on foot and engage in PvPvE battles, taking on players from different Tramplers as well as the undead original inhabitants of Sophie. A price and exact date is yet to be confirmed for SAND: Raiders of Sophie, but at least we know it is not too far away.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Review: Fire Emblem: Path Of Radiance (GameCube) - Aged & Easier Than You're Used To, But Still A Winner]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/gamecube/fire-emblem-path-of-radiance</link>
            <guid>1402420</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161439/large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Did you know that the Japanese version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a> has a 'Maniac' difficulty mode? You did? And did you know that this mode sort of fixes my biggest problem with the game? You did? Can I do the review anyway? Thanks.</p>
<p>Jumping back into Path of Radiance, the first home console FE, for the first time since all the way back at Christmas 2005 (I got <strong>Goblet of Fire</strong> underwear, thanks for asking), my one complaint from 20 years ago remains an issue: it's all a little bit too easy, most especially if you're a big fan who's been hoovering up the newer stuff and becoming a strategy master in the meantime. Veterans may find even the toughest of the three available difficulty options — appropriately titled 'Difficult' — too sedate for their tastes.</p>
<p>But let's park that one specific point for a moment, because as important as it may be, it doesn't manage to derail what's still a fantastic slice of vintage <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/fire_emblem">Fire Emblem</a> goodness. Path of Radiance tells one of the series' strongest stories, you see. In fact, it's a story so strong (no spoilers ahead, I promise) that, regardless of how the combat may have aged over two decades, no matter how much sharper, more detailed and intricate the newer games are, this one still delivers a lot to love.</p>
<figure><a title="Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161435/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Path of Radiance is one of two FE games (the 'Tellius Duology' if you're down with the lingo) set on the continent of Tellius, with the other being its immediate follow-up on Wii, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/fire_emblem_radiant_dawn">Radiant Dawn</a>. So, upon locking into this one, you're all set for a doubleheader of epic proportions to disappear into. Which, let's face it, is exactly what everyone could be doing with right about now. *points at now*</p>
<p>Taking control of Ike, a member of the Greil Mercenaries, your job in Tellius as you join the action is to defend the borders of Crimea, a region of humans, against attacks and incursions from neighbouring Gallia, which is full of monsters. Because of course it is. Before long, things go quite spectacularly south, with the Crimean capital falling to invaders, and Ike and company spiralling into an arduous journey of revenge and justice-seeking. That's where we come in.</p>
<p>I won't detail anything further in terms of the story but it's fairly clear that, as the first Fire Emblem to feature voice acting (and 3D character models, maps, and battle locations) they went all-in, and as a result we get a banging narrative to jump into alongside battles that, whilst absolutely a little slow and cumbersome looking back from further down the series line, still provide the goods that series stalwarts thirst for.</p>
<figure><a title="Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161436/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>This is, after all, an entry that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-fire-emblem-games-of-all-time?page=2">consistently ranks highly in best-of lists</a>, and once you dig in, regardless of all the time that's passed, you'll find it sinks its hooks in fast. It's one of those timeless, classic numbers you hear old people (me) banging on about. Furthermore, and it's an important detail in the grand scheme of things, once you've played through this wondrous thing, you're all set up, fully locked and loaded, to dive into Radiant Dawn, which is another cracker, though one which is unfortunately exclusive to Wii at the time of writing.</p>
<p>So, you've got a great story here (one that will likely lead you into playing the next part), it still looks and plays really nicely, and the combat? Even when a Fire Emblem game has got a little long in the tooth, that core turn-based strategy goodness sings.</p>
<p>The face-offs here stick to the series formula of a rock-paper-scissors weapons triangle at the heart of the action. So, axes over lances, swords over axes, lances over swords - you know the score. Path of Radiance then adds slick 3D battle sequences to the action. Okay, so they were slicker back in 2005, but luckily you can turn off these extended animations for clashes, making for quicker fights all around. Indeed, once you've switched these off, it's hard to tell the game is really that old at all, given how great the text menu avatars and scenery all look. Even the rumble support is on point.</p>
<figure><a title="Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161434/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Path of Radiance also brings Luguz enemies to the table - transforming, lycanthropic foes who will shape-shift throughout battles into other forms such as birds or even dragons. It makes for encounters which feel elevated from the run-of-the-mill stuff of the time. They still feel strategically whip-smart, and are then further enhanced by a cool Bonus XP system that rewards efficiency (in turn pushing you to up your game and engage with all of your options) and, of course, permadeath. Oh, sweet permadeath, how you infuse everything with a touch more excitement and meaning. And tears.</p>
<p>And, really, excitement and meaning (and tears) are what you're getting. Over the course of 40ish hours, this one still has the power to razzle-dazzle with its magical melding of strategy and a story that adds drama where it needs it, whilst also introducing a plethora of entertaining friends and foes.</p>
<p>It might not be the latest or greatest Fire Emblem, then, but Path of Radiance is certainly well up there, and now that we've got it so easily to hand via NSO on Switch 2, it's really hard to criticise its gentle ageing all that harshly. Get over the fact it's not quite as feature-complete as your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_engage">Engages</a> or your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_three_houses">Three Houses</a>, and you'll soon find yourself all wrapped up in an adventure that's sucked me in all over again.</p>
<figure><a title="Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161427/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Now. Where can I find a copy of Radiant Dawn that isn't more expensive than a holiday?</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance still has the power to pleasantly surprise, bringing strategically satisfying battles in the signature series style, alongside a story that packs in plenty of fun characters and big moments across its running time. Yes, it's aged a bit, the 3D battle cutaways (which you can switch off) are a bit naff two decades on, and it's not as swish as the newer entries, but that's all to be expected.</p>
<p>Look past a little dust and time-weathered rough edges, and there's a wonderful time to be had here that leads you right into an equally excellent sequel.</p></section>

<p>Over the past week, a rumour about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> getting a "surprise" DLC expansion popped up online after Polish Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski mentioned how he was expecting a "paid add-on" for the game to be released as early as March 2026.</p>
<p>This was reportedly backed up by a Polish leaker known as 'Borys Nieśpielak', who claimed Fool's Theory (the Polish development team behind the upcoming remake of the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2022/10/the-witcher-remake-announced-rebuilt-in-unreal-engine-5">first Witcher game</a>) was involved in this new content (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-witcher-3-is-reportedly-getting-a-surprise-new-expansion-this-year/">via VGC</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="U0vFWbkMXWk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U0vFWbkMXWk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytU0vFWbkMXWk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/U0vFWbkMXWk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U0vFWbkMXWk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402be5jzgkoq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Now, in another development, <a href="https://pl.ign.com/wiedzmin-3/69405/news/wiedzmin-3-nowe-dlc-zabierze-nas-na-pustynie-ujawniamy-nasze-informacje-sprzed-lat-i-rzucamy-nowe-sw">IGN Poland has added fuel to the fire</a>, claiming it first heard about a new expansion for Witcher 3 years ago, but didn't publish anything as it was unable to corroborate this information. Here's what the Polish website was apparently told at the time, according to PC Gamer. Keep in mind there has been no official confirmation about a new expansion or what content it might include.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"IGN Poland said its source at the time claimed the new expansion would take players to the far-off desert of Zerrikania, which is mentioned in passing at a few points in The Witcher games. Zerrikania is also different enough from The Witcher kingdoms we already know that it could be a place where, for instance, Ciri could successfully undergo the Trial of the Grasses"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One other factor supposedly fueling this rumour is the news CD Projekt needs to generate around $277 million by the end of 2026 to achieve an "incentive program target". It's a goal one investor believes would be "extremely" tough without any new content this year (with the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/witcher_4">Witcher 4</a> not expected to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-confirms-the-witcher-4-not-releasing-in-2026-new-trilogy-sticking-to-6-year-plan/">release anytime soon</a>), so a DLC for the existing title could definitely help the company reach its target.</p>
<p>Chrzanowski also recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year">told Eurogamer</a> that CD Projekt Red was still short of its goal, with just "five quarters remaining", which "implies the need for something significantly larger than just another update or a version for a niche platform".</p>
<p>We'll try not to get too ahead of ourselves here, but If this expansion is the real deal, it would no doubt be the prime opportunity for CD Projekt Red to consider a Switch 2 Edition of The Witcher 3. And it's already proven what it's capable of on Nintendo's new hybrid system with its excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> port.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GameStop Is Reportedly Shutting Down Hundreds of US Stores as Its CEO Might Get $35 Billion ‘Long-Term’ Bonus]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/gamestop-reportedly-shutting-down-hundreds-us-stores/</link>
            <guid>1402390</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>GameStop</strong>, the largest retailer dedicated to videogames, is reportedly <strong>shutting down hundreds of stores in the United States</strong>. </p>



<p>The reports started appearing on social media and were quickly conflated into one very long list on the '<a href="https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameStop Closing List'</a> blog, which reckons there are at least <strong>410 GameStop stores confirmed to be closing</strong> and another 11 reported but as of yet unconfirmed.</p>



<p>This is only the latest round of closures for the retailer headquartered in Grapevine, Texas. In the annual 10-K SEC filing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000162828025014731/gme-20250201.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued in February 2025</a>, the company stated:</p>



<p><em>We have also initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review which involves identifying stores for closure based on many factors, including an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance. This review, among other things, resulted in the closure of 590 stores in the United States in fiscal 2024. While this review is ongoing and a specific set of stores has not been identified for closure, we anticipate closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025.</em></p>



<p>The employees being let go are understandably furious, especially since the latest wave of cuts occurred shortly after another SEC filing was issued this Wednesday, January 7, when GameStop <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638026000004/pressrelease-rclti.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a massive performance-based stock option for its current CEO, <strong>Ryan Cohen</strong>. Cohen, who assumed the role on September 28, 2023, is the largest individual shareholder and stands to gain up to <strong>$35 billion</strong> (yes, you read that right), albeit with a massive caveat: the company’s market capitalization would have to grow to $100 billion and the company would need to achieve $10 billion in Cumulative Performance EBITDA.</p>



<p>Considering that GameStop's current market <span>capitalization as of yesterday's closing was&nbsp;<strong>$9.51 billion</strong>, Cohen would have to somehow stage a 10-fold market capitalization</span> growth to receive his full bonus. Granted, there is a precedent: in January 2021, a short squeeze <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-shares-soar-70-as-short-sellers-account-hacked-children-harassed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">caused the company's stock to </a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-shares-soar-70-as-short-sellers-account-hacked-children-harassed/" target="_blank">surge significantly</a>, briefly reaching an</span> astounding pre-market value of <strong>$500 per share</strong> on January 28, almost thirty times the share's valuation earlier that month. Even then, though, the market cap only reached $33.7 billion, still quite far from that $100 billion threshold required by Cohen's bonus. And with the constant shift toward digital games, it's hard to imagine how the company could achieve such a high valuation. </p>



<p>There are, however, nine vesting tranches, the first of which is definitely more achievable for the executive.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Tranche</strong></td><td><strong>% of Award</strong></td><td><strong>Market Cap Hurdle</strong></td><td><strong>Cumulative Performance EBITDA Hurdle</strong></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>10%</td><td>$20 Billion</td><td>$2.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>10%</td><td>$30 Billion</td><td>$3.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>10%</td><td>$40 Billion</td><td>$4.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>10%</td><td>$50 Billion</td><td>$5.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>10%</td><td>$60 Billion</td><td>$6.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>10%</td><td>$70 Billion</td><td>$7.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>10%</td><td>$80 Billion</td><td>$8.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>15%</td><td>$90 Billion</td><td>$9.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>15%</td><td>$100 Billion</td><td>$10.0 Billion</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>By the way, GameStop is also restructuring its operations in other countries. They sold their Italian operations, closed down in Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, and Austria, and shared their intent to sell the Canadian branch. Now, <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/583322/eb-games-proposes-closing-all-new-zealand-stores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to RNZ</a>, they might be looking to close in New Zealand, too, although the proposal is apparently 'not final'. They currently have 38 stores there.</p>

<figure data-uuid="a237be6ccbb44"><a title="Star Wars Outlaws" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a237be6ccbb44/star-wars-outlaws.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Gosh, 2026 has been quite the year so far, isn't it? Luckily, we've got games to keep us busy, and we're going to go through which of the buggers we plan on playing this weekend.</p>
<p>In case you've missed the main headlines this week, let's take a peek at what's been going on in the world of Nintendo. First up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a> was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-expands-switch-2s-gamecube-library-with-another-game">released on the GameCube NSO app</a> for the Switch 2, so that's lovely. Fans of green and purple will also be pleased to know that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-reveals-first-new-joy-con-2-colours-for-switch-2">new Joy-Con colours</a> are being released in just a few short days.</p>
<p>We got a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/mario-tennis-fever-overview-trailer-serves-up-a-host-of-fresh-features">new overview trailer</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, which is looking really solid so far, while more 'evidence' emerged to suggest that <strong>Call of Duty</strong> might <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/rumour-call-of-dutys-nintendo-release-is-apparently-on-target-for-2026">finally make its way to Nintendo platforms</a> this year.</p>
<p>And now, let's see what Team NL is up to this weekend, hm?</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>It's a more-of-the-same week for me, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cast-n-chill-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Cast n Chill</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/expelled">Expelled</a> still occupying the left side of my Switch 2 home screen. The GameCube NSO app is there now, too, thanks to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Path of Radiance</a> dropping, and I also dipped back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi</a> the other morning with my coffee.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I'll be valiantly resisting the eShop sale. Gotta love that post-holidays quarterly tax bill. Have a good one, folks.</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I love Star Wars, but it's a franchise I really have to be in the mood for. As such, I often take lengthy breaks before diving back in. The good thing about this is that there's often a boatload of new content to enjoy when I do eventually sidle back into the fandom. With that in mind, I'm playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_star_wars_the_skywalker_saga">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/star_wars_jedi_survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, both on the PS5.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 is getting a bit of love, though. I'm currently making my way through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and it really is quite remarkable. Ubisoft nailed it with this one; it's just so darn fun with a wonderful sense of place.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I don't remember the last time that my weekend gaming plans were dominated by free demos, but here we are! I haven’t had a chance to touch either <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a>’s tasters yet, and I’m super excited to dive in. I’m not so excited by the prospect of falling madly in love with both of them and ending up with two meaty RPGs on my plate to start the year, but that’s the risky game I play.</p>
<p>Oh yes, I was also lucky enough to finally get Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2 over the holidays, so I have been busy tinkering around with all of the side quests I intentionally left untouched once I heard it was coming to the hybrid. May the Force be with you, dear readers!</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Being a Portuguese myself it never gets old listening to Portuguese NPCs speaking fluent Portuguese in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>. Really, they’re a bit everywhere in the game, I hope it all works out for them in the end (historical spoilers: It does not). I am not sure in exactly what percentage of the main story I have already completed, but there will surely be many hours spend this weekend in virtual 16th century Japan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> left me wanting more trooper based action so after a four year hiatus I have reinstalled <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/halo_the_master_chief_collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> on STEAM and resumed my single player campaign marathon where I had left it (two thirds into Halo 2). Having just completed (and loved) Halo 3 ODST, I am moving on to Halo 4.</p>
<p>Game of the week is actually a demo: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> is just a very cosy JRPG that ticks all my boxes. I hope to compete said demo before the real villain shows up: Monday!</p>

  </picture><h2>The Campaign Books</h2><p>With the return of the Chapter's Primarch (in <em>40K</em> 8th edition) and after starting his new Lord Commander duties, for which the Indomitus campaign still takes up a lot of his time, he has started a new campaign to regain these 500 worlds. Missions of reclamation have been given to the Ultramarines and their successor chapters, warriors originally pulled from the same gene-seed as the Ultramarines, but divided into smaller forces to avoid the huge collections of warriors that had such a critial effect during the events of the Horus Heresy.</p><p>500 Worlds Titus is a set of 4 linked books detailing the campaign. The first, simply 500 Worlds Titus, details the backgrond for the Ultramar sub-sector and the imperial forces that defend it. This includes some fantastic maps of the sub-sector and the 4 fronts of the campaign, information about 10 Ultramarine successor chapters, and details about Captain Demetrian Titus and his new retinue.</p><p>The book also includes background for the Necrons and their place in the sub-sector, along with specific details about the 2 new Necron miniatures we discuss later in this article. The book closes with the narrative around the campaign featuring Titus battling against these new enemies.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The second book, 500 Worlds Titus - War of the Vespator Front, is a full campaign system for fighting linked battles as part of the 500 Worlds reclaimation campaign in the Eastern tetra of the 500 Worlds. In the campaign, players build their forces and create alliances, then battle each other and record campaign points. The book details some unique Vespatro Front events for use in game, along with details of the various theatres of war with terrain guidance and unique twists. The book also has a dedicated mission pack, with 6 new missions to play out the various scenarios in the campaign.</p><p>The third book, 500 Worlds Titus - Dread Incursions, entirely focuses on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-boarding-actions-compendium-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">boarding actions</a>, which is one of my favorite ways to play <em>Warhammer 40K</em>. The book includes rule adaptations for boarding action missions, 2 brand new boarding action detachments, Shield of the Void for the Ultramarines, and Harbinger Cabal for the Necrons. It also includes 3 campaigns of linked missions that use the 12 missions included in the book.</p><p>The final book, 500 Worlds Titus - Detachments, is a 16-page booklet with new Detachments for both the Space Marines (Orbital Assault Force, Bastion Task Force, and Reclamation Force) and Necrons (Pantheon of Woe, Cursed Legion, and Cryptek Conclave). All of these Detachments are available in the newly updated <a href="https://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://assets.warhammer-community.com/eng_07-01_warhammer_40000_faction_pack_space_marines-9ps9uold3v-zei03cythi.pdf" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Space Marine Faction Pack</a> and <a href="https://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://assets.warhammer-community.com/eng_07-01_warhammer_40000_faction_pack_necrons-wgehvvo84t-ijjxadnsk6.pdf" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Necron Faction Pack</a>. Detachments are new with this edition of <em>40K</em> and give unique special rules for your forces, and usually some restrictions on the units you can take.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Captain Titus and Friends</h2><p>Titus returns to <em>40K</em> as a Captain, with a new entourage in tow. Previously available as Lieutenant Titus as a limited edition miniature (and in the <em>Space Marine II</em> board game), he now returns to his former rank to fulfil his new duties as Master of the Watch, defending the boundaries of the 500 Worlds.&nbsp;</p><p>Captain Titus comes in a box of 7 miniatures, which includes Titus and the Wardens of Ultramar - Veteran Sergeant Metaurus (who you might know from the <em>Secret Level</em> episode on Amazon Prime), Ancient Gadriel (whom Titus served with in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Space Marine II</em></a> video game), Lucia Vestha (plenipotentiary of Ultramar), Astropath Dainal Kornelius, Gaius Silva (Veteran Commodore of the Ultramar Defence Fleet), and Aemelia Minervas (Commander of the 30th Macragge Defence Auxilia).</p><p>On the tabletop, Titus is extremely difficult to kill as his Honour of Ultramar ability means that if he would be removed and hasn't fought yet, on a 2+, Titus can fight immediately after the attack is resolved, and if he destroys a model, he gets D3 wounds back. He can also fight later in the phase as his usual action, but he can only use the Honour of Ultramar ability once per turn.</p><p>The Wardens of Ultramar deploy as a unit that Titus can join, and includes all 6 of the Wardens. They all have different armaments and can redeploy 3 units after both players have set up, including putting these 3 additional units into strategic reserves if that suits your plan after seeing how your opponent has deployed. The Wardens can also join another unit, but if they do that, only Titus can join on top (they can't bring a different Space Marine hero).</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>C’tan Shard of the Nightbringer and Nekrosor Ammentar</h2><p>The enemies the Ultramarines face in the 500 Worlds campaign also get some reinforcements. Leading these enemies is Nekrosor Ammentar, a hero of the Destroyer Cult. Nekrosor is rapid, with a 10-inch movement, which is useful as they work best up close. At distance, they have the 18-inch range Enmitic Disintegrators, with 4 attacks, armor piercing -2, and sustained hits 2 for extra damage on 6s. But up close in melee is where they excel, with 2 different attacks for a total of 12 melee attacks, which benefit from Nekrosor's own Infecious Murder-madness aura that gives nearby Necron units sustained hits 1.</p><p>Releasing alongside Nekrosor is a new C'Tan Shard of the Nightbringer miniature, which has had their stats updated alongside the new release. Shard of the Nightbringer is a combat monster. In melee, they can target armored enemies with a strike from their sythe, doing 6 attacks at strength 14, armor piercing -4 and dealing D6+2 wounds each, or sweep attack for hordes with 14 attacks at strength 8, armor piercing -2, dealing 2 wounds each. To add extra killiness for anything that survives that, at the end of the fight phase, any enemies within 6 inches take D3 mortal wounds on a 4+.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Warhammer 40K 500 Worlds Titus Final Thoughts?</h2><p>I absolutely love this whole campaign. The format of the 500 Worlds campaign book is fantastic, with the background, campaign, boarding actions and new detachments, and releasing the new commanders for both forces alongside it makes it feel fresh and exciting. It's all geared towards Ultramarines and Necrons, so if you don't play either of those, the narrative, new detachments and new miniatures won't appeal that much to you, but the campaign gives players of any faction a chance to join, even if you don't have any Space Marine players as you can just tweak the narrative to a group of aligned forces trying to push back against the borders against another group.</p><p>The new miniatures of Titus and the Wardens, C’tan Shard of the Nightbringer, and Nekrosor Ammentar are all fantastic and full of detail. Both Necrons are murder machines on the tabletop, and I love that you can put Titus and the Wardens into another unit that can sit on and dominate an objective, and having to take Titus out twice is a fantastic mechanic that captures the lore-armor for a famous Space Marine hero.</p><hr><p><em>The copies of</em> <strong>Warhammer 40K 500 Worlds Titus, Titus and the Necrons&nbsp;</strong><em>used to produce this review were provided by Games Workshop.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <title><![CDATA[Weird New ARC Raiders Exploit Has Players Building Mobile Barricades]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-barricades-exploit-shield/</link>
            <guid>1402348</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent hours, clips have started emerging on social media showcasing ARC Raiders players creating mobile barricade systems via a newly-discovered exploit. With the assistance of ziplines and deployable barricades, users are building semi-useless bulletproof shields that they can carry either in front of themselves or as a complete, 360-degree shield.</p>



<p>It sounds strange, and it’s hard to convey, so be sure to check out the clips below to understand what we’re talking about.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-barricade-exploit-is-pretty-hilarious">ARC Raiders Barricade Exploit is Pretty Hilarious</h2>



<p>The recent barricade exploit in ARC Raiders has been popularized by streamers like TheBurntPeanut. The award-winning streamer was captured experimenting with the exploit during a recent broadcast, when one of his teammates – Hutch – was seen enshrouded by a four-barricade shield.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a later clip, the creator was using a bizarre contraption made up of a barricade, zipline, and jolt mine to push along a corridor while trying to deflect damage with his mobile shield. It wasn’t a successful effort, which has prompted ARC Raiders players to ridicule the exploit, dubbing it completely pointless.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple to complete this exploit. For those wanting to build a large, mobile shield, you’ll need four ziplines, four deployable barricades, and a ‘depot battery’. You need to place ziplines onto the battery, and then once deployed, you can place a barricade <strong>on </strong>the zipline, with a little fiddling around.</p>



<p>Do that four times, and you have your shield.</p>



<p>In the second clip from TheBurntPeanut, you can see the zipline trick was only completed once, creating a ‘riot shield’ of sorts rather than an encircling barricade.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you have any fun playing around with this new exploit in ARC Raiders.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mpc-25-kicked-out-of-cdl-by-pro-players/</link>
            <guid>1402345</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Call of Duty League has come under intense scrutiny once again from fans due to a questionable GA that has locked down anyone attempting to use the MPC-25 SMG. The weapon was used <strong>very briefly</strong> in recent days, most notably by Skyz, and all of a sudden, pro players have decided to nix the gun ahead of Major I.</p>



<p>This pushes the CDL back to a two-weapon meta, forcing players to use the Dravec and M15 once again, prompting an outcry from fans desperate for a little variety ahead of the season’s first Major tournament.</p>







<h2 id="h-mpc-25-is-gone-from-the-cdl">MPC-25 is Gone From the CDL</h2>



<p>The MPC-25 lasted no time at all in the Call of Duty League, the top flight of COD esports. It was used for a couple of hours and then pushed clean out of the rotation by a fresh GA (Gentleman’s Agreement).</p>



<p>This has prompted fans of the League to take to social media to rage against ‘soft’ pro players who will do anything to control every facet of the ecosystem.</p>



<p>ACHES, one of the most prolific former pro players in the space, said: <em>‘Slasher retired and the next day they GA’d the one gun used on 2 maps. The last of the old guard is gone.’</em></p>



<p>Sam ‘Octane’ Larew, one of the more recent retirees from the Call of Duty League, wrote:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The current set of pro players gotta be the most cry baby pussy set of players COD has ever had. They’d GA the M8 in BO3. <a href="https://t.co/esK6xiC1n8">https://t.co/esK6xiC1n8</a></p>— Sam “Octane” Larew (@OctaneSam) <a href="https://twitter.com/OctaneSam/status/2009833696279617691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Many pointed out how ‘busted’ the MPC-25 is under a 10-meter range, which is the leading reason behind the GA, but others have stressed that it simply doesn’t hold a candle to the existing meta and should have been left alone.</p>



<p>Another CDL fan wrote, <em>‘The MPC gets demolished outside of like 12 meters by the Dravec and M15, you’re taking a BIG risk pulling out an MPC, and you’re rewarded with a better TTK up close. That’s how it should be. Pros just HATE 3 gun metas, BO7’s our last good cod in a long time, we’re wasting it.’</em></p>







<p>Do you think the MPC-25 should have been given a fairer chance in the Call of Duty League? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong>At the same minute as this article was posted, the Apex Legends team gave an update confirming the resolution of this issue: ‘This incident is now resolved with the help of our community. Anti-Cheat is a constant cat-and-mouse game and your reports are imperative to bringing information to our attention, including the one that helped us today. Thanks for your patience as our teams jumped to tackle and resolve this issue.’</p>



<p>Fans have taken to social media to cry out against the latest Apex Legends hack. The situation is dire, and ‘a bad actor’ is utilizing an unknown exploit to control other players’ characters in the popular battle royale game. This has led to Respawn making an official statement declaring an ‘active security incident’.</p>



<p>In a two-minute clip uploaded on social media, users get a first-hand look at the depth of this issue. In the video, a player is toyed with multiple times, with the hacker emptying their inventory and throwing them off the map.</p>











<p>In a post on social media, the team at Respawn Entertainment wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are aware of an active security incident where a bad actor is able to control the inputs of another player remotely in (Apex Legends).</p>



<p>Based on our initial investigation, we have not identified evidence that suggests the bad actors can install or execute code as in the case of an RCE or injection attack. </p>



<p>We are actively working on a solution and will update you when we have more information.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This message was posted a few hours after a clip surfaced showcasing the exploit in question:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is far from being the first major hacking incident to hit Apex Legends, one of the oldest and most popular battle royale games on the market. In January 2025, some of the most notable pro players had their accounts hijacked, and in March 2024, the Apex Legends Global Series was <strong>taken over </strong>by malicious operators during a live broadcast, and the hack was <strong>very similar </strong>to this one.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to criticize the situation in the comments under Respawn’s post. One user pointed out:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Apex is a security risk to have installed at this point</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>lol maybe if they focused more on Anti-Cheats and better security they wouldn’t have these problems but instead they focus on buffing characters and more boring events.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Death In The Box monthly redeem codes to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Wheelspins and much more.</p>



<p>Death In The Box is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-volleyball-legends-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience that drops players into the middle of a high-stakes survival and strategy game. Players are required to compete against up to 15 other participants upon launch, and from there, navigate through a series of deadly challenges orchestrated by a menacing clown figure. With a unique blend of luck-based events and strategic card play, Death In The Box offers an intense competitive experience where players must outthink and outlast their opponents to be the last one standing.</p>







<p>Having been released in August 2023, Death In The Box has gradually gained traction and now boasts over 87 million visits with an active player base of more than 2,000 players. Although mastering the card system and understanding strategic voting mechanics is enough for players to improve their survival chances, using redeem codes to get extra Wheelspins is never a bad idea.</p>

<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes, so players can redeem the active codes safely.</p>

<p>Redeeming Death In The Box codes is a fairly straightforward matter, and they have made sure that even newer players to the game can navigate to the codes section and claim their rewards without too much fuss. Here’s how:</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Death In The Box in Roblox</li>



<li>Click on the button with the gears on the left-hand side of the screen</li>



<li>At the base of the pop-box, there will be a text box for codes</li>



<li>Enter or paste the active code in the box</li>



<li>Click on ‘Confirm Code’ to collect the freebie</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-death-in-the-box-codes">How To Get More Death In The Box Codes</h2>



<p>Death In The Box codes are typically released through the game’s community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official Death In The Box Discord server, which features a dedicated announcements channel where all new codes are posted first, and the ARK-ADE Roblox group, where updates and milestones are announced.</p>



<p>Codes often come out around special events, major updates, or game milestones, but if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops—or when it stops working. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself.</p>



<p>This page is refreshed as soon as new codes go live, and any expired codes are removed promptly, so you always see only the ones that are still active.</p>

<figure data-uuid="db4a5556cf705"><a title="Beast of Reincarnation" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/db4a5556cf705/beast-of-reincarnation.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Game Freak</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Pokémon developer Game Freak recently released the DLC <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Mega Dimension</a>, so what's it up to beyond this? In case you missed it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/game-freaks-upcoming-action-rpg-looks-awesome-but-dont-expect-it-on-switch-2-yet">when it was revealed last year</a>, the studio has a new action RPG <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/beast_of_reincarnation"><strong>Beast of Reincarnation</strong></a> in the pipeline.</p>
<p>In an update this week, it's now been revealed we'll be hearing more about it at Xbox's upcoming <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2026/01/xbox-developer-direct-2026-showcase-gets-official-date-alongside-three-confirmed-games">Developer Direct showcase</a>, taking place later this month on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>. This latest broadcast from Xbox promises to give fans an "inside look at not just the games" but also "the studios working to bring them to life".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>We’ll also be taking a trip to Tokyo to visit the legendary Game Freak, offering a first in-depth look at</em> <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em><em>, which we revealed at Xbox Games Showcase last year."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, while there may not necessarily be any Nintendo-related announcements here, we might at least get a look at the inner workings of Game Freak and how it goes about developing new projects.</p>
<p>For now, Beast of Reincarnation will release on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PC and Game Pass. It was officially revealed in June 2025 (just days after the launch of the Switch 2) and is published by Fictions and directed by Kota Furushima - a Game Freak employee who has <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Kota_Furushima">worked on the battle system and sound</a> in past Pokémon releases.</p>
<p>Beasts of Reincarnation is described as "an expansive one-person, one-dog action RPG built around demanding, technical combat". Here's a slightly more detailed description and the trailer from last June:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>In post-apocalyptic Japan, a land ruined by corruption and crawling with monstrous beasts, humanity’s last hope may rest with Emma—an outcast cursed as a Blighted One—and Koo, her loyal canine companion. Survive a journey across an ominous, ever-changing world where dangerous forests can erupt in the wasteland. As Emma and Koo push deeper into the unknown, their bond strengthens—and with it, strange powers bloom.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although Game Freak has mostly focused on major Pokémon projects over the years, in between these releases, it has worked on its own unique titles. During the Switch generation, it released games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/little_town_hero">Little Town Hero</a> across multiple platforms and even revived <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pocket_card_jockey_ride_on">Pocket Card Jockey</a>.</p>
<p>As for its latest Pokémon DLC Mega Dimension, it's not bad, but like the base game it lacks the freedom of the core series.</p>

<p>Games Workshop announces plans to bring Warhammer World to the United States by 2027</p>



<p>For those enthralled by the Warhammer universe, a Warhammer World could be coming to the United States within the next two years. Games Workshop announced on their website that they have begun working on the second Warhammer World just outside of Washington, DC.</p>







<h2 id="h-warhammer-world-in-the-u-s-won-t-be-a-full-blown-recreation-of-nottingham-location">Warhammer World In The U.S. Won’t Be A Full-Blown Recreation Of Nottingham Location</h2>



<p>The original Warhammer World first opened in Nottingham, England, in 1999. It is currently the ultimate destination for Warhammer fans, featuring a dedicated shop, dioramas on display in the Warhammer Museum, and more. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/u6jqjmvz/a-warhammer-world-in-the-usa-get-the-details-here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On their website, Games Workshop</a> notes that the future American Warhammer World won’t be a brick-by-brick recreation of the original. However, they hope to create something special for Americans passionate about the Warhammer hobby.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Based just outside Washington DC, this new Warhammer World will be a flagship venue that celebrates Warhammer in all its forms: gaming, painting, modelling, storytelling, events, and community.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>As for the video game side of Warhammer 40,000, Space Marine 3 is<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-is-in-development"> currently in development</a>, but there are still free updates planned for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 later this year.

    <div>
        
<p>Masahiro Sakurai is one of the most well-known game developers in the industry. Best known for his work in the Kirby and Super Smash Bros. franchises, he remains a pillar of Nintendo.</p>



<p>Now, he’s discussing the changes the game development process has undergone over the years and why he’s not a fan of massive teams.</p>







<h2 id="h-masahiro-sakurai-dislikes-how-game-development-teams-continue-to-increase-in-size">Masahiro Sakurai Dislikes How Game Development Teams Continue To Increase In Size</h2>



<p>Recently, he was interviewed by Japan’s <a href="https://www.47news.jp/13701368.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">47NEWS</a> and discussed how much more satisfying it is to see the results of your work when you work solo, rather than constantly checking in with others. To him, the strength of an individual’s work runs the risk of getting lost in the shuffle when part of a larger team.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Talking specifically about game development, it’s very satisfying to see the results of your hard work,” Sakurai said<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-says-it-can-be-really-frustrating-working-on-massive-games-with-hundreds-of-devs-there-is-work-that-clearly-shows-your-results-and-work-that-doesnt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> (via GamesRadar+)</a>. “You don’t get this when working in a team, and it can be really frustrating. For example, when a pixel artist draws a picture by themselves then they of course finished it. But when managing a team, it’s often difficult because you have to keep talking about what kind of pixel art is suitable.</p>
</blockquote>







<blockquote>
<p>“I feel like this is getting more difficult with large-scale games. Staff size is rapidly increasing into the hundreds. The sense of fulfillment gained from making something by yourself is different to something made as part of a group. What you are meant to do is also changing.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sakurai recently helmed the development of Kirby Air Riders, released exclusively on the Nintendo Switch 2. Check out our coverage of the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=kirby+air+riders">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop has announced plans to build a new Warhammer World in the United States with a late 2027 target for opening its doors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer World, in Nottingham, England, is the focal point for Games Workshop’s various tabletop games and a social hub for the hobby. It includes an exhibition centre with dramatic, large-scale dioramas featuring everything from famous battles in the grimdark sci-fi setting Warhammer 40,000 to the fantasy world of Age of Sigmar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For competitors, a sizeable castle-themed gaming hall lets fans play matches, often in scheduled tournaments. There’s a themed bar and restaurant, areas to paint miniatures, and an in-house store with exclusive products.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/u6jqjmvz/a-warhammer-world-in-the-usa-get-the-details-here/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warhammer Community</a>, Games Workshop confirmed its plans to start work on the new Warhammer World, to be built just outside Washington DC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This new Warhammer World will be a flagship venue that celebrates Warhammer in all its forms: gaming, painting, modelling, storytelling, events, and community,” Games Workshop said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The original Warhammer World in Nottingham, UK sets a very high bar. We’re not going to replicate it brick-for-brick, but instead build something equally uncompromising on quality and experience, something worthy of Warhammer’s rich settings and of course the title ‘Warhammer World.’ And of course, at the heart of all this is creating something extraordinary for all of you — the Warhammer fans!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now, there’s a lot to do – but with a fair wind, and the might of the Emperor and his inexhaustible armies, we hope to open the doors late in 2027.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Total War: Warhammer 40,000 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With this new Warhammer World, Games Workshop is clearly hoping to reinforce its explosive success and the ever-increasing popularity of Warhammer 40,000 in particular, which in recent years has grown far beyond the confines of a tabletop game. Its loyal fandom fusses over lore, analyzes new novels for fresh insight into the setting, and speculates about future development. The smash hit video game Space Marine 2 boosted interest in all things Warhammer 40,000 — so much so that playable character <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-just-promoted-titus-from-space-marine-2-with-a-fancy-new-trailer-that-sets-up-the-next-narrative-expansion-for-warhammer-40000">Titus is now the poster boy of the tabletop game and is even at the heart of its next narrative expansion</a>. And former Superman actor Henry Cavill’s upcoming Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe for Amazon will undoubtedly take it to new heights. It makes a lot of sense to have a Warhammer World in place to capitalize on the army of newcomers Cavill’s Prime Video work will surely rally together. (Cavill once visited Warhammer World in the UK and posted a video of his tour on Instagram.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, Warhammer 40,000 fans are bracing themselves for an announcement and release of the 11th Edition of the game, accompanying lore developments, and new model releases. And we’re arguably in the golden age of Warhammer 40,000 video games, with Space Marine 2 still receiving updates, Space Marine 3 in the works, and Dawn of War 4 and Total War: Warhammer 40,000 waiting in the wings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>AI is a bubble – one whose futuristic sheen deflects attention from a core of hot air. Anyone with sense recognizes this. But will it finally burst this year? Unfortunately, we have our doubts. On the latest <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours/"><u>Aftermath Hours</u></a>, we talk about that.</p><p>We begin the episode by diving into the good and the bad of this brand new year. First we reflect on my time attending Awesome Games Done Quick, the annual speedrunning marathon that raises money for charity and <a href="https://aftermath.site/agdq-2026-interview-speedrun-convention-charity/"><u>just generally rules</u></a>. Gaming communities can be forces for good – at least, when they don’t allow their ranks to be overwhelmed by shitheads. Who knew? Then we move on to less positive happenings: Ubisoft just <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-halifax-closed-weeks-after-unionizing-cwa-canada/"><u>shut down an entire studio mere weeks after its workers voted to unionize</u></a>. Suspicious, to say the least.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we close out the show by predicting the year ahead with 100 percent, crystal-clear accuracy. Will <em>GTA 6</em> finally come out? Yes. <em>Elder Scrolls VI</em>? Absolutely not. As for the aforementioned AI bubble, well, it’s complicated (see below).</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can forge a giant needle with which to personally pop the AI bubble, ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Here’s an excerpt from the conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Do we think that this is the year the AI bubble bursts?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>It’s hard to tell. You can say with certainty that it’s about to burst, but it’s been about to burst for a while now, and I’m skeptical that [it’s gonna happen overnight]. Your brain says it has to, and then all of this is a fiction anyway, so maybe they can continue to make it go, but it will just get shittier.</p><p>I think yes, but that presumes the shared reality that we will have lines up with how things work.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>When you think about NFTs or whatever, they required people to buy them, and nobody bought them. The metaverse required people to use it, and nobody used it. But here, it doesn’t seem to matter. In order for the bubble to burst, it has to float into a wall. What is the wall that it hits? Even if none of us have docked it at this point, does it matter? [Companies] shove it into Microsoft Office, or they put it in Google, and I don’t use it, but they can charge me more for my G Suite.</p><p>I’m definitely on Team “It has to burst, come on, this is absurd,” but what causes it? One of those big investors pulls out? It makes enough children kill themselves?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Clearly not a problem in this country.&nbsp;</p><p>I think in the meantime also we’re gonna see more and more moments like <a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-larian-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate/"><u>what’s happening with Larian</u></a> where they talked about using AI to make games, people got mad at them, and it seems like they’re digging their heels in. But I think we’re gonna hear about AI usage on more major games, and people are gonna have to make up their minds about how they react – where they draw their lines in the sand. As long as executives continue to believe that they can use AI to improve efficiency, allowing them to make games faster and for less money, they’re not gonna step back from this ledge.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> One thing I will say is that the sentiment toward AI will continue to get more and more rancid. Starting the year off with what Grok has been doing and with what X has been doing, I think it is only going to get worse. I don’t know if that actually means anything materially to these companies. But with Grok doing sex crimes out in the open, there’s a nonzero chance it ends with X getting removed from the App Store in some capacity. Being on X could be a crime at this point. As people live with it more and more, it’s gonna become a meme how bad this shit is.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I hope so. My concern is that people will grow numb to it. Going along with what I said a moment ago about people finding out that their favorite games are being made with AI, it also feels like a lot of those companies and a lot of the people in charge are gonna do their best to convince everyone that it’s here, it was inevitable, and now you’ve just gotta live with it. To try to win through attrition, basically – to get people to begrudgingly accept that this is just how things are now. And so maybe those rancid vibes turn into people being like “Well, what can be done, really? This is just the world now.”</p><p>So that’s my concern: that people could succumb to a state of numbness and acceptance instead of maintaining that energy of “Fuck this shit, this is bad, and I don’t want it in any of the things that I use personally.”</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/please-seek-help-immediately/"><div><p>Please Seek Help Immediately</p><p>Motherfucker have you listened to yourself</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>
