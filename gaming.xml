<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158778/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> didn’t need to do much; it just needed to be 'more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>'. That’s a huge task in itself; a slightly bigger, slightly better version of an already amazing, genre-defining game. But it’s clear that, after seven years of refining and perfecting and toiling, Team Cherry wanted more than just 'more Hollow Knight'. Hours and hours of love have been poured into every single aspect of Silksong, where the attention to detail is off the charts, and the surprises just keep coming. It elevates map design and purposeful challenge effortlessly, and is an improvement on Hollow Knight in every single way.</p>
<p>I knew from the moment I first stepped into Pharloom and was wowed by its beautiful colour palette and its eclectic mix of bug NPCs, I would fall in love with this game. But the moment that truly cemented it for me was when I was struck with a revelation (very literally) by being hit by an enemy for <em>two</em> masks of damage instead of one. Barbs, spikes, and booby trap benches lay in waiting to catch me off guard. Sawblades and pits are <em>just</em> out of view to punish a dashing Hornet. One time, I stood on a switch that activated a blade that killed me in one hit after a tricky platforming challenge. I couldn’t stop laughing; I owe Primal Aspids an apology.</p>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158768/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Pharloom hates you, and it hates Hornet, but I <em>adore</em> it. Its workers slave away until death and the coils of religion and silk are wrapped around many of the pilgrims wandering around the world. The golden and white faded halls of the Citadel are far from a safe haven for the people. The very harshness of Silksong is baked into every aspect, including the narrative, which enriches everything about the game for me. Sometimes, it’s relentless, but that’s kind of the point.</p>
<p>Eventually, every moment of frustration turned into elation as I mastered each environment and challenge put in front of me. Every time I opened up a new Bellway, I’d smile as the Bell Beast emerged and stomped her feet excitedly. Whenever I found a Flea and freed it from a cage or woke it up from a nap, I’d imitate its high-pitched bark. Pharloom is an oxymoron of a world, a twisted knot of beauty and terror with small pockets of joy and secrets to discover that it made me fall in love with failure.</p>
<p>And what a world to fail in, too. Pharloom is still a sombre world, but it's a rainbow compared to the muted tones of Hallownest. It also pops beautifully on Switch 2, particularly in handheld. It’s <em>also</em> perfect at 120fps. When I think of Silksong’s world, I think of the ornate converted bells made into homes and the thickets of leaves in the background of the swamps, all accompanied by Christopher Larkin’s incredible score. The poignant strings of Hunter’s March is one of my favourites, hinting at the kingdom of the ants’ fate from time’s past. Cogwork Core’s ticking and piano notes helped me time my platforming perfectly. Then there’s the incredibly fast-paced strings of Widow’s fight, a relentless onslaught of violins and cellos to match her snappy movement.</p>

<p>While failure is common, it’s alleviated by the fact that Hornet’s movement is sublime; she’s much faster than The Knight from the get-go, and that only grows the more skills she learns. Being able to dash <em>and</em> attack at the same time blows combat and platforming wide open, as does being able to heal in mid-air. You can see where Team Cherry has learned from some of Hollow Knight’s fiddly platforming and taken advantage of Hornet’s full range; climbing up a blizzard-ridden mountain or hopping over thorny pits feels seamless when you nail it.</p>
<p>Because of how fast Hornet moves, I didn’t really realise how big the map was until I reached Act 2 and pulled it up. It’s staggering to look at in comparison to Hollow Knight, and no room is purposeless or empty. Even if you find a dead-end, come back later and you’ll find a surprise or secret. NPCs who just seem like flavour text eventually become key figures. <em>Everything</em> matters in Silksong, and everything has a place.</p>
<p>It’s the same with combat, where Hornet has so many more options than The Knight. While Hornet has four different basic attacks, you can completely change these by equipping different Crests. I fell in love with the Reaper Crest, which changed Hornet’s idle slash into a wide-arcing, slightly slower needle swipe. But they all have their value; one late-game Crest turned Hornet’s running stab into a double-slash which shredded foes in my path, while another allowed me to drain enemy health and go into berserk mode whenever I used my silk to bind (aka, heal).</p>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158774/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The customisation is off the charts when you throw in Tools and Silk Skills, subweapons and magic-like attacks that allow Hornet to set traps or throw items from a distance or even parry and counter. Some Tools provide passive effects like adding poison to your damage or letting you grab onto walls without sliding down them; I tinkered around with these for boss fights and trials meticulously, as sometimes poison isn’t as effective or a boss could parry your own projectiles.</p>
<p>Silksong is tough, but really only in the sense that the skill floor is much higher than Hollow Knight’s was; once you learn to weave Tools, Skills, and movement into combat, victory tastes delicious in the way that I only really felt during Hollow Knight’s best fights. Most of those came from the DLC, which is where Silksong has plucked much of its boss philosophy from and refined.</p>
<p>At their best, bosses are a ballet of movement and action, where every action has a reaction and you move almost rhythmically. One secret boss in Act 2 has become one of my favourites of all time, a fast-paced brawl where you have to move constantly and always be on the offensive. By the time I beat the fight, I felt like I could read every single attack like the back of my hand, despite the fact that both of us were speeding around the arena like lightning bolts; I gripped the controller tightly, breathed in time with the rhythm of the fight, counted every single beat and hit before they happened. It was pure magic.</p>

<p>If I sound like I’m good at this game, I’m not. I died <em>a lot</em> and spewed many expletives as I tried again and again to master these dances. But the joy of a Metroidvania is that you can walk away and find something else to do to power yourself up. It’s the in-game equivalent of taking a breather, doing something a little less intense, grabbing a bit of extra money to buy a new Tool or discovering a new Crest that better suits your playstyle.</p>
<p>My only real gripe is with currency in the late-game. A patch has helped reduce the cost of some end-game stuff, but I always found myself a bit short of rosaries for Tools or upgrades and Shards to rebuild Tools. Nothing a few minutes of fast-paced pilgrim murdering didn’t solve, but a tiny bit more leniency wouldn’t go unappreciated.</p>
<p>But after spending over 60 hours with Silksong, it’s not the cruelty or the rare-stringent moment that sticks with me: it’s the triumph. It’s the blue lake hiding in the corner of a sewer system. It’s the hauntingly beautiful choral music echoing the Citadel’s chambers. It’s the friendships Hornet forged throughout the kingdom. It’s the tears I’ve shed after beating a particularly beautiful boss.</p>

<p>Silksong is a game that demands everything from you, but it returns just as much. The Last Judge is hard <em>because</em> it's the final guard before the Citadel. And, in return for finally overcoming it, you get so much more to explore, even better maps, and even better bosses. There are multiple paths you can take to certain quests that change the difficulty or reward you with different equipment. The way that areas blend together as you approach new biomes hints at what's to come.</p>
<p>Silksong's map tells a story of suffering and struggling that reinvigorates the way a Metroidvania map can be utilised. Obstacles exist for a reason, not just for some fun platforming, and it completely understands how to blend its <strong>Souls</strong> and Metroidvania inspirations and make everything purposeful.</p>
<p>I’ve fought some of the hardest bosses since <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/sekiro_shadows_die_twice">Sekiro</a> or <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/elden_ring_shadow_of_the_erdtree">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> and emerged triumphant. I’ve been at the very bottom, picked myself up, come back and sliced through challenges like butter over and over again. And yet, somehow, I <em>still</em> have more to uncover. But I’d gladly wipe my memory, go through the struggle, and perfect my techniques all over again.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong’s beauty is beguiling, hiding an interior that’s deliberately harsh but endlessly rewarding. Everything feels deliberate, pushing you to learn, improve, and perfect, or simply just explore a little more. And what a world it is to dig into.</p>
<p>Somehow, Team Cherry has surpassed my expectations tenfold and delivered a mesmeric blend of balletic combat and movement with persistence, joy, and an incredibly invigorating map at the centre. I’ve never felt better surmounting the challenges put in front of me, and I’m already raring to do it a second time.</p></section>

                <p>There have been some off-the-wall year collaborations in the past year, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-beavis-and-butt-head-trailer-is-a-sight-to-behold/1100-6532887/" data-ref-id="1100-6532887">the Beavis and Butt-Head skins in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>. However, developer Team Jade may have the wildest one of the year with the upcoming Delta Force x Saw crossover. In the teaser video, Saw's Jigsaw killer seemingly enters the world of this free-to-play first-person tactical shooter with a life or death ultimatum.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heyQ-uPTKyk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/heyQ-uPTKyk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the Saw films, the original Jigsaw killer, John Kramer, has been dead for almost two decades. And neither he nor his successors wore life-sized costumes based on Billy the Puppet. But the man behind Billy's mask in this clip certainly knows Kramer's modus operandi and his favorite catchphrases. It's only at the end of the video that he reveals himself as operator D-Wolf. This isn't the first time that Saw has crossed over into games, as Billy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-more-horror-legends-are-coming-to-fortnite/1100-6526825/" data-ref-id="1100-6526825">appeared in Fortnite</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-haunting-of-verdansk-zombies-jigsaw-night-map-more/1100-6483469/" data-ref-id="1100-6483469">Call of Duty</a>.</p><p>D-Wolf's Billy the Puppet skin will make its in-game debut on October 23--just in time for Halloween--alongside firearms and other items inspired by the Saw films. In the meantime, a new Delta Force season, War Ablaze, will begin on September 23. On that date, the game will introduce two new modes, Operation Warden and Operation Raven, as well as a new Warfare map called Fault. Additionally, a new operator, Raptor, will be added to the game's roster.</p><p>Last month, Delta Force reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/delta-force-surges-beyond-200000-concurrent-users-on-steam/1100-6534233/" data-ref-id="1100-6534233">a new peak of concurrent players on Steam</a> with 210,000. The game has steadily built up a following since its debut in December 2024. However, it appears that Delta Force is far more popular internationally than it is domestically, since it <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lxa6qdhp3k24" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">doesn't regularly show up in Circana's US engagement reports</a>.</p><p>As for the Saw movies, a new collection of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saw-movie-series-amazon-exclusive-4k-blu-ray-steelbook-editions-2025/1100-6534076/" data-ref-id="1100-6534076">Saw 4K Steelbook Editions are available for preorder on Amazon</a>. Earlier this summer, Blumhouse picked up a controlling stake in the Saw franchise, which will bring the original director, James Wan, back in a creative role for the first time since Saw 3 in 2006.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-thug-underground-intro-remake-remaster-ps2-activision-2000625750</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tony-hawk-recreated-thug%E2%80%99s-classic-intro-and-got-fans-more-excited-for-a-remake.1298517/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It was just earlier this year that Activision published<em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawk-pro-skater-review-is-it-good-levels-1851786124">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</a></em>, a remastered collection of two of the best games in the skateboarding series. But now, after a fun video from Hawk himself, fans are once again begging for a <em>Tony Hawk’s Underground</em> remake to join the series’ slate of recent re-releases.</p> <p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOg329HAQcP/e">Tony Hawk posted a short video on his personal Instagram page</a>. In it, the skateboarding legend re-created the intro cutscene found in the original PS2-era <em>Tony Hawk’s Underground.</em> Here’s the short video:</p> <blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOg329HAQcP/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14">  </blockquote>  <p>In the video, Hawk can be seen taking on the role of the player-created character, even wearing a similar outfit to the one sported by the default character. Using some nice editing, Hawk interacts with the game’s popular villain, <a href="https://kotaku.com/eric-sparrow-thps-3-4-thug-underground-remake-cameo-ps5-1851784341">Eric Sparrow</a>, even calling him a bully at one point. At the very end, Hawk leaves and jokes, “Whoa! I can get off my board?!”, a reference to the fact that in <em>THUG</em> players could, for the first time in franchise history, hop off their skateboards and walk around levels.</p>

 <p>But before you get too excited and assume Tony Hawk is teasing some future <em>Underground</em> remake ala <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-peeing-guy-canada-level-removed-censor-1851786232"><em>THPS 3+4,</em></a> calm down. The video is marked as “Not a <em>THUG</em> promo.” Hawk also claims that the reason he created this short bit of nostalgia bait is to have some fun and celebrate Video Games Day.</p> <p>“In hopes of bringing some joy to your timeline: Happy Video Games Day from E.S. and me,” posted Hawk on Instagram.</p> <p>And like, yeah, I get that he’s trying to make it clear this isn’t a teaser, but of course, the internet is going to internet. Many are already assuming or hoping that this Instagram post is actually the first bit of marketing for a full-on <em>Tony Hawk’s Underground</em> remake. And while I do think a <em>Tony Hawk’s Underground</em> remake is coming one day, I do believe Hawk here, and this is just him having fun with fans. <a href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-underground-thug-remake-remaster-activision-1851780287">The famous skater has said in the past that he would love a <em>THUG</em> remake</a>, but made it clear that he doesn’t get to make that call. It’s all up to Activision, and considering the five-year gap between <em>THPS 1+2</em> and<em> THPS 3+4</em>, I’d suggest fans go play <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/thug-pro"><em>THUGPro</em></a> or something else while they wait for a <em>THUG</em> remake, because it’s likely many years away.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Death to Death Runs]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/death-to-death-runs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-to-death-runs.1298499/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the release of <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, the always tiresome debate over difficulty in games has risen again to fuel our never-ending need for discourse. Obviously, that has compelled me to join the fray on the side that death runs are lame and suck and they should die.</p>

<h2>Do I Need to Git Gud?</h2>

<p>I know the response, just git gud, right?</p>

<p>Before I address my ability to git gud, let’s define a death run. Simply, you respawn after you die, and it's the path you have to take to get back to where you died. Sometimes it’s close to where you failed, other times it is not. It’s the other times I have a problem with.</p>

<p>As fun as it may be to throw a classic “git gud” in someone’s face, it’s not really a criticism that works when it comes to death runs. The problem isn't a lack of skill, it's the fact that doing the same piece of content over and over is tedious and boring.</p>



<p>Some may argue that death runs are part of the complete package of something like getting back to a boss. That the obstacles put in your way, the challenges like the platforming or what have you, are all part of the experience.</p>

<p>Think of them like a little “level” of the game where you must reach the end to fight the boss -- classic game design.</p>

<p>Maybe the first time going through the obstacle course that is a death run is really cool and fun, so the whole package does make sense. It's something you really enjoy. Will you enjoy it 5 times from now? 10? In reality, quite a bit more than that?</p>

<p>If doing the same thing over and over is fun for you, more power to you. For a lot of people, myself included, it’s tedium at best.</p>



<p>Especially when the point of so many games that employ death runs, like soulslikes, is overcoming a challenge and besting something difficult – the satisfaction of finally winning.</p>

<p>So, why in the hell would I want to do the same piece of content over and over again that I have already bested?</p>

<h2>Origins of Death Runs</h2>

<p>Naturally, I found myself asking just what is the point of the death runs? Where did they come from and why have they stuck around?</p>

<p>Old-school games are well-known for their difficulty, and they were notorious for having you play the same level or part of a level over and over again. There’s a few reasons for that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some reasons were physical in that cartridges didn't have a ton of memory, so some games had to be smaller, meaning making them more difficult lengthened their playtime. The influence of arcade games can't be overlooked either, where game design was incentivized to up the difficulty so players would fail and be forced to shell out more quarters to keep going.</p>

<p>Then there are the technical limitations like a lack of saving or checkpoints, so each level had to be self-contained and completed in one successful run.</p>



<p>There are certainly more reasons why games were hard and repetitive, but the majority were not made that way with the idea of making the game more fun or enjoyable. Technical limitations and things like incentives to eat up more quarters were more at the forefront than anything else.</p>

<p>At best, old-school games and gamers were just used to the idea that trial and error, throwing yourself at something over and over, was just how you played games. Things like tutorials, saves, and other conveniences we take for granted now just weren’t around.</p>

<p>Now that we no longer have those limitations, I don’t quite see the allure of making players do the same thing over and over again.</p>

<h2>Are Death Runs Good Game Design?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Even if we accept the idea that doing a death run on the way to a boss over and over is a good one, the design goals seem to be in conflict with one another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We want players to fight the boss, right? So, do we make the death run back just as challenging as the normal part of the game? If we don't, doesn't that conflict with the general design elsewhere in the game? If we do, is it maybe unfair or too challenging knowing there's a boss fight waiting at the end?</p>

<p>Also, does it make sense to make players redo content over and over as a sort of "gate" before a boss? Why do we want to make it a chore to get back to the most exciting parts of our game?</p>



<p>Some games seem to ask those questions above during level design, while other's don't consider the run back or where you respawn much at all. That means players are sometimes running through already-played, difficult sections to get back to where they died. Early <em>Souls </em>games are notorious for that in particular.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So what do the vast majority of players do with games like that? Run and dodge like hell to avoid any and all enemies on the way back to the boss, praying they don’t get swiped along the way. Thinking of it another way, they aren’t engaging with the designed elements of the game at all, and they’re really only hoping to not be penalized as they run back – no real pay off, just a downside. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Presenting those two ideas -- something easier and therefore less engaging, and something players don’t engage with at all -- can feel disingenuous, but there’s really no middle ground with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, I suppose there’s the third option that makes you do the insane obstacle course or enemy gauntlet prior to a boss every time, which, well, there you really have no option but to git gud I guess.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think a good majority fall into those first two categories, though. So it really begs the question, why do we have them at all then?</p>



<p>Other than to pad some time, what is the reason? I mean, even the kings of this sort of game FromSoftware realized death runs kind of suck when they added the Stakes of Marika in<em> Elden Ring</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At best, death runs are a flawed, incomplete experience of game design that get repetitive. At worst, they are repetitive obstacles in your way that players feel aren't worth engaging with.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Death Runs and Immersion&nbsp;</h2>

<p>A final thing I want to address is a common retort I see online that something like a death run helps immersion or contextualize where you are in a game. I can’t seriously entertain that idea.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why is one arbitrary point of respawn somehow more immersive than somewhere else? Why is having to run through a part of a game again, likely many times, more immersive?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silksong-bench.jpg?itok=TFqS6N2I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silksong-bench.jpg?itok=e3n-QaTf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The immersion of this bench is that it is cruel and hurtful.</figcaption></figure><p>The answer is it just isn’t. It’s an arbitrary position tied to some sort of save or checkpoint, that’s all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no context gained by seeing the part of a level that leads up to the boss again. You’ve already seen it, and it’s not like dying to a boss wipes your memories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If anything, having to start over far away breaks immersion more, taking you out of the area you just were. Is it not more immersive to remain immersed in that same area, continue the fight?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, I don’t need an arbitrary death run to serve as a “breather” to take a beat before I try a boss fight again. Believe it or not, I'm capable of just waiting and doing that all by myself.</p>

<h2>So Yeah, Death to Death Runs</h2>

<p>From all I can see, death runs are arbitrary and don’t serve much of a purpose than to pad some time. Even the well-intentioned design decisions to have them are flawed at best.</p>

<p>Here I focused on games designed around things like a unique challenge or boss fight as the exciting moment the game builds you up to. There may be some worthwhile discussion on games where they are more level-based, run-based in design.</p>

<p>But that’s a discussion for a different day.</p>

<p>So, death runs, please go away. They waste my time and keep me from engaging with the best parts of a game.</p>

The Persona 5 skins for Overwatch 2 make the game's heroes look exactly as you expect them to, so much so that it is actually a little difficult to realize what hero is underneath the costume.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft shut down the servers for its open-world MMO racing game, The Crew, on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/purchases-and-rewards/article/decommissioning-of-online-services-for-older-legacy-ubisoft-games-n-to-z/000105855">March 31, 2024</a>. It was unfortunate news, but not particularly surprising in today's modern age of online games having an expiration date of 'whenever the developer decides it can't/won't pay for the servers anymore.' But while the occurrence of online games being shuttered is now commonplace, The Crew's shutdown sparked something more.</p>



<p>It not only sparked a lawsuit that made players more aware than ever that they've <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-responds-to-the-crew-lawsuit-tells-prosecuting-players-they-never-owned-their-games/">always been buying a license to play a game</a>, instead of a copy of a game. It sparked enough backlash that Ubisoft committed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes/">adding offline modes for The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest</a>. It caused enough uproar that <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-now-warns-players-theyre-only-buying-a-license-to-a-game-at-checkout/">Valve added a warning to Steam purchases</a>, making it clear to players they're buying a license to play a game, instead of a copy of the game. And, perhaps most significantly, it was the match that lit the flame under the <a href="https://wccftech.com/publishers-argue-stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-games-prohibitively-expensive/">Stop Killing Games Initiative</a>.</p>



<p>While the Stop Killing Games and the Stop Destroying Videogames initiatives and petitions continue, and the lawsuit two Californian The Crew fans began is still underway, a group called <a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/about/">The Crew Unlimited (TCU)</a> has been working hard to bring The Crew back the old-fashioned way, by creating an emulator to run the servers on.</p>



<p>Today, <a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/news/?post=news-tcu-release">TCU realized its goal</a>, and players with a copy of the game can jump back into The Crew thanks to their hard work.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="IT'S BACK! Playing The Crew 1 in 2025!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqbKAMq029A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>If you own a copy of The Crew on PC, then you should be able to set TCU up for yourself to continue playing a game that's shutdown seems to have had more of an impact on the videogame industry than it did when it was still being distributed by Ubisoft.</p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>We’re all familiar with the trolley problem. We’re all so familiar with it that we’re also familiar with all the spoofs of the trolley problem that have sprung up in recent years. But I’m pleased to say I’ve found a fresh take on the entire scenario: even sillier (if smarter) spoofs of the trolley problem. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219410/The_Trolley_Solution/"><em>The Trolley Solution</em></a> brings the classic black-and-white sketches to life in a series of video game vignettes, beginning with the classic question, but quickly descending into fantastically funny nonsense, including some completely splendid mini-games, one of which is a visual novel love story.</p> <p>You know how the trolley problem goes:</p> <blockquote><p>“A trolley is rapidly approaching five people tied to the tracks.</p> <p>You have the option to divert the trolley onto a different track.</p> <p>This action would save the five people, but it would kill someone else.</p> <p>What would you do?”</p></blockquote> <p>But in&nbsp;<em>The Trolley Solution</em>, the classic philosophical dilemma and many absurd riffs on it are brought to life in 3D, bringing a whole new level of reality to the hypothetical problem when the crudely animated people splatter into little blobs. What if, for instance, rerouting the trolley would knock a dog’s bone away? Can you really make the choice if it means watching the little doggy look into his empty bowl, his tail down, his head despondently hung? Other new variants it introduces on the classic dilemma are more elaborate and wonderfully original, unlike anything I’ve seen in those overly long Reddit threads where people with undue confidence misattribute philosophical doctrine. For instance,</p> <blockquote><p>“A trolley is quickly approaching your girlfriend, who is tied to the tracks.</p> <p>You have the option to divert the trolley to a different track, but on that track is your best friend, also tied up.</p> <p>However, you discover that your girlfriend has been cheating on you with your best friend.</p> <p>But your best friend didn’t know she was your girlfriend.</p> <p>To complicate things, your best friend is terminally ill and will die of cancer in a month.</p> <p>What will you do?”</p></blockquote>  <p>Honestly, I’m simple enough that I’d have been charmed just by a series of increasingly daft scenarios like these, especially since you get to see each play out, choosing whether to pull the lever or not. But&nbsp;<em>The Trolley Solution</em> is much more ambitious in its daftness. Levels constantly introduce one-off mechanics, at one point seeing the game turn into a perfect spoof of the billions of monochrome “hidden object” games that appeared in the wake of the fantastic&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/hidden-object-puzzle-game-hidden-folks-is-getting-free-1843541062"><em>Hidden Folks</em></a>, here with an entire trolley “hiding” in enormous, screens-wide illustrations packed with visual gags. I scarequote “hiding” given it’s a trolley, and even glasses and a <em>Where’s Waldo</em> hat can’t quite do it. Bless it, it’s trying. (The <em>Where’s Trolley</em> joke works much better in the UK where the books are called <em>Where’s Wally?</em>)</p>

 <p>At another point it becomes a third-person racing game, as you jump between tracks to gather coins and avoid oncoming trolleys. And yes, in one extended and completely brilliant sequence, the game becomes a lampooning visual novel, in which you play a young Japanese girl who, on her way to school, falls in love with a trolley. It has many different endings, one of which describes the situation where the girl and the trolley rush too quickly into an overly committed romance, later realizing the foundations for a lasting relationship had never been established, the two growing to loathe one another, before finally, acrimoniously, breaking up. Another, naturally, results in people getting run over by a trolley. It’s all very romantic. It contains dialogue like,</p> <blockquote><p>“Tameko tells Tomodachi all about her dream. As she talks a weird gut feeling makes her uneasy. She explains the nuances of picking between Deontology and Utilitarianism. It feels like there is something more to it, like a prophecy in the making…”</p></blockquote> <p>As much as I want to blurt out every single surprise game mode that appears, l obviously won’t, but I do have to share one more: There’s an entire Tamagotchi sim in there, in which—yes of course—you must feed, clean, and play with a young trolley until it grows into a happy and profitable adult. “Can you take care of it until it gains monetary and moral stability?” asks the game.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000625734" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625734"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625734">©DanDans / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s worth saying&nbsp;<em>The Trolley Solution</em> is not taking anything seriously, and you’re going to see a lot of people get squished in front of trolleys. Because the game’s black and white, and because the human characters are like even simpler <em>Human Fall Flat</em> figures, obviously it’s nothing outlandish, but people sure do go splat when they’re run over. And you will want to note that it does include a moment with someone jumping in front of a trolley. When that happened I shouted, “GOD DAMN IT!” and laughed very hard, because it really wasn’t OK in the best way.</p> <p>I swear, for all the stuff I’ve mentioned, there are so many more surprises in here. There are whole other short games, spoofs of well-known genres I’m dying to tell you about, and while a few of these are perhaps a little over-long (something done five times can be a lot more fun than something done ten times), they’re all so well-realized and funny. There’s a total of 40 levels, each containing its own unique trolley problem situation, and precisely none of them take the conceit seriously. Thank goodness.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000625735" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625735"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625735">©DanDans / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I love stumbling on a game like this. I installed it simply because I liked the cartoon art, having no idea where it was heading. It turns out it was heading all over the place, with a wicked sense of humor, and the chops to pull off half a dozen genre spoofs along the way. (And don’t worry if you see the DLC on the Steam store—as much as you can absolutely buy it (and the developer deserves it!), it’s part of a gag.)</p> <p>What a joyfully silly thing to exist. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219410/The_Trolley_Solution/">You should go buy it right now, it’s only $6.50</a>.</p>

Enjoy more detail in Quality Mode, which runs at 60 frames per second in 4k while docked and in 1080p while in handheld, or prioritize super-smooth action with a higher frame rate in Performance Mode, which runs at 120 frames per second in 1080p while docked and 720p in while in handheld.

It’s had something of a troubled development cycle; after being announced at E3 2017, Nintendo announced in 2019 that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/01/25/metroid-prime-4-development-restarting-from-the-beginning">development was being restarted</a>. But here it is, six years later, finally coming out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This game puts you in the boots of the bounty hunter Samus and sends you to planet Viewros. There, you’re equipped with a very cool-looking motorcycle called Vi-O-La that lets you zip around large areas quickly. You can jump off ramps and fight aliens while riding, skidding into them as a form of attack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As with previous Metroid Prime games, exploration plays a big role. You can scan the alien flora and fauna to find out more about them. You also gain psychic abilities. If you buy the Switch 2 version, you get improved graphics and load times. You can also use the Joy-Con 2 controller as a mouse for aiming, which may offer more precision than the sticks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can find out more in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-played-metroid-prime-4-beyond-first-hands-on-preview">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond hands-on preview</a>.</p><p id="more-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More preorder guides">Other Preorder Guides</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">007 First Light Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Battlefield 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-clair-obscur-expedition-33-mirror-edition-ps5-xbox-amazon-exclusive">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Mirror Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-where-to-buy">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade (Switch, Xbox) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Ghost of Yotei Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-2-where-to-buy">Hades 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-switch-2-where-to-buy">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-preorders">Kirby Air Riders Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-where-to-buy">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch">Pokemon Legends Z-A Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-galaxy-2-for-nintendo-switch-where-to-buy">Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-switch-ps5-pc">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"That's really placebo level stuff."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Tech experts say <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> on PC has significant stutter problems, and have advised against running the game on its ‘Badass’ graphics setting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 launched big on Steam but it’s currently sat on a ‘mixed’ user review rating, mostly due to complaints about how the game runs on PC — even on high-end rigs with which PC gamers aren’t getting the graphics performance they’d expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford has spent some time on social media addressing those complaints, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/code-your-own-engine-and-show-us-how-its-done-randy-pitchford-goes-on-the-offensive-as-borderlands-4-pc-performance-row-intensifies">even directly responding to some disgruntled fans to clap back</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/digitalfoundry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a> have taken a look at Borderlands 4 on PC, and their <a href="https://youtu.be/2v1ST5qMoaY?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">initial analysis</a> shows stutter problems that will be familiar to anyone who’s followed the discourse around Unreal Engine game performance in the last few years.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to DF’s Alex Battaglia, shader compilation stutter (you’ve probably noticed Borderlands 4 spends time compiling shaders as you wait to load the game) can cause stutter when the engine does something for the first time in a new area, like your character picking up a new type of weapon or having an enemy perform a new death animation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PC gamers have complained about Unreal Engine game stutter for some time now, but last month Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney (Epic, the developer of Fortnite, makes Unreal Engine) <a href="https://clawsomegamer.com/tim-sweeney-on-unreal-engine-5-optimization-issues-the-main-cause-is-order-of-development/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suggested the way developers were making their Unreal Engine 5 games was to blame</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whoever’s to blame, for Borderlands 4, the stutter issue “makes the experience feel less polished,” Battaglia said.</p><div id="borderlands-vault-hunters-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands' Vault Hunters, Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands' Vault Hunters, Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">He also noted that vegetation starts to animate as you get closer, and it does “this very obvious flip when it does it and it looks like an LOD is changing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have no idea why they did it this way,” Battaglia said. “When you’re walking through the world and there’s a lot of grass on the ground you’ll see a lot of what looks like pop-in occurring. That’s actually just the animation turning on. So if you do see pop-in, it’s probably not pop-in in the traditional sense, but just the vegetation turning on to animate. It’s a little weird looking.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, real-time cutscenes are limited to 30fps, which is a “bit bizarre” because you can abruptly crash to 30 from a higher framerate in gameplay, “which seems a little out of place in a first-person game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DF chief Rich Leadbetter pointed out that Battaglia experienced stutter “on the fastest gaming CPU that money can buy” during the team’s testing, suggesting there's a significant issue here.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, DF commented on the ongoing complaints from PC players about the performance of the game, even on powerful PCs. Battaglia warned against running Borderlands 4 on what’s called the 'Badass' graphics preset, even if your PC should be able to handle it, because what you get from Badass doesn't justify using it over 'Very High.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“On the higher levels, I definitely don’t think you should be turning this game up to Badass,” Battaglia said. “It is woefully inefficient on the Epic setting. It is not good to use. That’s really placebo level stuff, usually. There’s probably some middle ground there that’ll give you a better visual experience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DF’s John Linneman added: “This one does seem to be running worse than usual for an Unreal Engine 5 game. It is below where it seems like it should be given how other games using this engine perform.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to DF, the recently released PC update — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-update-to-help-improve-stability-for-a-wide-range-of-pcs-released-but-there-are-no-patch-notes">the one with no patch notes</a> — does not appear to have improved matters. Gearbox has said it will continue to update the game, but PC players will be hoping meaningful patches arrive sooner rather than later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, Gearbox has posted a Borderlands 4 Nvidia Optimization guide on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/679602429802577921" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a>, advising players how to optimize their graphics settings for “better performance and framerates” on PC with the Nvidia app. Gearbox has also issued a piece of advice to PC gamers that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-asks-pc-gamers-to-keep-playing-for-at-least-15-minutes-after-they-tweak-settings-to-see-how-performance-has-changed-as-negative-steam-reviews-pile-up"><u>to me reads like an effort to prevent players from making knee-jerk reactions to the game's performance as soon as they’ve changed their settings</u></a>: “Please note that any time you change any of your graphics settings, your shaders will need to recompile. Please keep playing for at least 15 minutes to see how your PC's performance has changed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are delving into Borderlands 4, don't go without updated hourly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/Borderlands_4_SHiFT_Codes">SHiFT codes list</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>This article contains spoilers for Dying Light and its expansion, The Following. </strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, a continuation of the protagonist’s story from the original game, shambling onto console and PC in the very near future, it’s the perfect time to refresh your memory on Techland’s epic parkour zombie adventure, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dying-light">Dying Light</a>, and its massive expansion, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dying-light-the-following">The Following</a>. With ten years having passed since the original Dying Light, you’d be forgiven for being a bit foggy on the details. Lucky for you, IGN took impeccable notes, so here’s everything you need to know about Dying Light’s story before playing the upcoming sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and this should go without saying, but <strong>spoilers</strong> lie ahead.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/dying-light-1756911774399.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Dying Light quite literally drops you right into its fictional Middle Eastern setting: the city of Harran, which unfortunately has become ground zero to a devastating viral outbreak that transforms people into absolutely terrifying, flesh-eating creatures of darkness – also known as zombies. You play as Kyle Crane, an undercover agent for the Global Relief Effort (GRE), a humanitarian organization. You enter the city under the guise of aiding survivors, but your actual mission is to track down Kadir Suleiman, a political figure who has stolen a file critical to the GRE. If you’re already thinking that maybe the GRE is not exactly squeaky clean, you’ve got great instincts. Follow your gut.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your mission quickly goes sideways when you’re attacked by goons acting on behalf of a warlord, then bitten by a zombie and infected with the virus, all within your first few moments in the city, ‘cause you’re super good at your job. With your cover immediately blown and already experiencing the seizures that precede full zombification, you join up with a survivor enclave called The Tower, led by the only person qualified to be in charge during the apocalypse: a parkour instructor – in this case a really cool one named Harris Brecken. You follow his lead, learning the ways of parkour, and undergoing treatment with an experimental drug capable of staving off the effects of the zombie virus called Antizin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You also meet Jade Aldemir, a freerunner and fighter who has a heart of gold and would do anything for Dr. Imran Zere, a scientist working on a cure to the zombie virus, and, of course, her brother, Rahim Aldemir, a reckless guy who you can tell right away isn’t going to make it to the credits.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rais Against The Machine</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/dying-light-kadir-1756912055795.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With your crew of allies established, it’s not long before you’re properly introduced to Dying Light’s villain and the man who stole that GRE file. Kadir “Rais” Suleiman is a self-styled warlord who resorts to ruthless tactics and has a tendency to screw over those who make deals with him – all qualities that frame him as the perfect baddie you just can’t wait to punch right in the face. His crew has been hoarding Antizin and controlling Harran’s black market through intimidation and violence, so you and your crew begin to sabotage his operations and rally survivors against him. Naturally, he bites back by killing Rahim (who again, was very obviously going to die) and kidnapping Doctor Zere. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You go to rescue the good doctor, but get caught and thrown into a pit where you’re forced to fight loads of infected. After surviving the battle, Rais reveals that not only does he know that you’re working for the GRE, but he’s got dirt on them that he’s ready to publish. The plot twist? The GRE was complicit in the outbreak and has plans to weaponize it against its enemies. Yeah, see? Your bosses really weren’t very nice people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You manage to escape from Rais’ clutches and chop off the guy’s hand by suddenly showing off some serious martial arts skills, but Rais manages to escape with his life and Dr. Zere is killed before you can rescue him. Luckily, the fading scientist tells you that he’s given his research to Jade and wants it delivered to a new character, Doctor Camden, in the old part of town.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">GRE-AT at Doing War Crimes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Now having seen the GRE for what it is, you realign yourself with the people of Harran and the friends you’ve made at The Tower. You learn that the defense ministry, working alongside GRE, plans to firebomb the entire city, then claim there were no survivors to begin with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You meet up with some new friendlies in old town and concoct a plan to let the world know that you’re in need of help by setting off a series of charges in a skyscraper in the shape of a burning frowny face. But a fighter jet sinks it right away to cover it all up. You then pivot to climbing to the top of a communications tower and sending out a message to let the world know you’re there. This forces the fire bombing plan to be halted, but the GRE contacts you with a new proposal: bring it the cure Dr. Zere was working on, and you’ll be extracted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, you find out that Rais has kidnapped Jade before that happens – abduction certainly seems to be this guy’s favorite move. You reach her, but find out she’s been bitten and is turning into an infected. Rais gives you a single dose of Antizin and makes you both choose who will survive. Jade insists you take the drug and you’re forced to kill her after she fully transforms into a zombie.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Payback Time</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After mourning your loss and getting even with one of Rais’ goons, you bring the cure samples to Dr. Camden, but you still need to get the rest of Zere’s data from Rais. You go after him and learn that Rais, ever the fan of making the worst deals imaginable, has struck up an arrangement with the GRE to be extracted from Harran in exchange for the data. Naturally, you confront the guy on top of a skyscraper, and make him one final offer he can’t refuse by stabbing him in the neck and letting him fall to his death.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The GRE shows up looking for the data, but you heroically turn your back on the opportunity to save yourself, instead giving the data to Camden to save the people of Harran. A cure seems to be in sight, and it’s at this pivotal juncture that the story of Dying Light draws to a close. But Kyle’s story is not over, and things take a turn for the extremely weird in the game’s expansion...</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Following</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/dying-light-the-following-1756911889310.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After staying in Harran to help the city’s people, you hear a rumor from a crazed survivor that there are people out in the countryside who are immune to infection. The cure Dr. Camden is working on hasn’t made any progress yet, and Antizin is running low, so naturally, you head out to investigate. You quickly discover that the entire region beyond Harran has become enthralled to a cult called The Children of the Sun, who worship a mysterious figure known as The Mother. They perform bizarre rituals and seem way too comfortable getting up close and personal with zombies, but also seem to live without fear of the undead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You start working alongside this cult hoping to learn more, and eventually gain the trust of its super creepy masked officers called The Faceless, agreeing to do their bidding in hopes of bringing their cure back to Harran with you. You eventually learn that good ol’ Rais’ band of thugs are operating in the area, trying to get their hands on the cure themselves. You track them to a dam where The Mother is hiding, but by the time you arrive all of Rais’ men are already dead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s where things get really weird: you finally meet The Mother, and when she takes off her creepy cult mask, you see that she is fully infected – having been transformed into the most dangerous of infected: a Volatile. But bizarrely, she’s not feral like normal zombies, possessing sentience and the ability to speak despite looking like a horrifying corpse monster. She reveals to you that her cure isn’t so much a proper remedy as it is a compromise: she’s able to keep her zombie urges at bay during the day, but at night goes on killing sprees. In other words, she’s a zombie werewolf, more or less. Yikes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Bitter Ends</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/dying-light-the-mother-1756911986516.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mother proposes how you could end the infection once and for all: summon the Sun God. Spoiler alert – she’s talking about a nuclear bomb, which, to be fair, is definitely, technically a cure of sorts. This is where you’re given a choice: agree to help this absolutely insane lich with her plan to kill everyone, or, y’know, not do that. Pretty tough call.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you decide to side with The Mother, you’ll use her nuclear codes to launch a missile into Harran to purge it clean of survivors and infected alike (dope), but in doing so bring about a proper end to the outbreak. This is certainly the more metal of the two options, but given that The Beast will feature Kyle as its protagonist, I’m gonna go ahead and say that maybe this option isn’t exactly canon. Who knows, though. Knock yourself out, king.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alternatively, you can tell the monster to take a hike, but she forces you to drink the elixir, turning you into a sentient zombie. You fight and kill her, collect the vials, and escape the dam. After suffering blackouts, you find yourself outside the confines of Harran and come upon a family playing in a park. It’s at this point you realize you’ve been fully transformed into a volatile and let out a scream, hinting at an impending global apocalypse. Whoops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s where Kyle’s story ends, at least until Dying Light: The Beast arrives. Now, you might be thinking, “how in the heck could they possibly make a sequel to this?” and it’s a fair question. This sequel picks up years after The Following, and you once again play as Kyle Crane, who was apparently captured after the events of The Following by a sociopath called The Baron who experimented on him for 13 years. Now having escaped, he seeks revenge on his former captor and, as the title suggests, has some non-human DNA in him that seems likely to play a substantial role in the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not quite sure what Techland will do to address the branching decision in The Following, or how the heck the studio plans to fill in the 13-year gap, but I can’t wait to see the undoubtedly weird direction it all takes when Dying Light: The Beast arrives on September 19.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-the-story-so-far]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"I know a lot of you are dead set on playing at 4k with ultra max settings and using two or three year old hardware," he <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966952362293273013" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote</a>. "You do you, but BL4 and UE5 are doing a lot and for me that trade off for frames isn't worth it. I play at 1440p with settings super high and am super happy with that trade off--the game looks amazing at 1440p. If you're not 4k stubborn and just want to have a great, fun time with higher perf, please consider running at 1440p resolution. If you've got a beast of a video card, you're probably fine at 4k. But if you're in the middle or close to min spec, I would definitely recommend making that trade."</p><p>Pitchford also wrote about how he believes players to have unrealistic hopes for performance from older PC hardware; he characterized many complaints as originating from people who are attempting to run the game on several-year-old PC builds. In response to a comment from a person suggesting Gearbox "build [Borderlands 4] for the most common hardware in the first place," for instance, Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966958001216253985" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote that</a> "Borderlands 4 is a premium game made for premium gamers."</p><p>"Unlike on PlayStation and Xbox, we cannot prevent a PC player with sub-optimal hardware for the game try to play it," he stated. "So some try and get mad. And some have actual issues we need to fix. And some need to learn how their PCs work at the high end for this specific game in 2025 and use the tools available to them to find the right balance between frame rate, resolution, and graphics features... If you're trying to drive a monster truck with a leaf blower's motor, you're going to be disappointed."</p><p>Alongside expressions of irritation and resistance to the complaints, Pitchford also shared recommendations for "optimizing" performance on PC, including suggestions for using DLSS and tweaking certain settings. Gearbox itself <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1285190/discussions/2/596285654384682506/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a PC trouble-shooting guide on Steam to help players navigate potential issues or bugs.</p><p>Anecdotally, it appears that performance issues may occur inconsistently, vary across even minor changes in hardware, or generally be difficult to nail down. PC Gamer and Digital Foundry, for instance, have <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/ive-tested-borderlands-4-on-a-minimum-spec-pc-and-a-monster-rtx-5090-rig-and-it-runs-just-as-borderlands-at-launch-as-youd-expect/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported</a> sluggish frame rates on native resolutions even on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v1ST5qMoaY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top-of-the-line graphics cards</a>. Benchmarks have, not surprisingly, shown <a href="https://pcbench.net/benchmarks/borderlands-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wide variance across hardware and software combinations</a>.</p><p>If you're just diving into Borderlands 4, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-shift-codes-all-active-keys-and-how-to-redeem-them/1100-6533833/" data-ref-id="1100-6533833">ongoing list of Shift codes</a> that you can redeem to grab some cosmetics and items for your character.

                <p dir="ltr">EA has revealed a suite of quality-of-life fixes for The Sims 4, which will release over the next eight weeks. As part of this wave of updates, Sims players can vote on which quality-of-life features and bug fixes they would like to see first.</p><p dir="ltr">First of all, a base game update is set to arrive on September 18 on PC. The update will release five days later on console. This is an earlier release date than was originally planned, which is intended to help the team correct for errors and problems across the multitude of Sims players' set-ups and configs. Additionally, modders and content creators can use the extra time to update their offerings ahead of the upcoming expansion <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-the-sims-4-expansion-brings-vacation-getaways-and-imaginary-friends/1100-6534497/">Adventure Awaits</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In October, the team will continue to monitor the community and provide hotfixes for Adventure Awaits. Finally, another base game update will arrive in November. The update will include fixes, but will also offer new content for all Sims 4 players. EA has not released any information about what this update will feature, but has promised further information will come closer to November.</p><p dir="ltr">If you are a Sims 4 player and want to provide your input on which fixes the team should prioritize, you can log into the <a dir="ltr" href="https://forums.ea.com/category/the-sims-4-en/ideas/the-sims-4-bug-reports-en?ideas.widget.ideamessageswidget-tab-main-wlhmjz-1=mostKudoed&amp;amp;ideas.widget.ideamessageswidget-status-main-wlhmjz-1=in_review" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">official Sims forums</a> and upvote any threads which represent an issue you are experiencing.</p><p dir="ltr">EA recently reaffirmed its commitment to continual updates for The Sims 4, saying that <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-its-sold-too-much-sims-4-dlc-to-make-the-sims-5/1100-6533647/">a Sims 5 is not in the works</a>.

                <p>Rich Lambert, the boss at The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios, has said he hopes to make additional games beyond the popular MMO. In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-elder-scrolls-online-heads-on-the-aftermath-of-microsofts-cuts-and-the-future-of-the-long-running-mmo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>, Lambert said he wants The Elder Scrolls Online to succeed and thrive, but diversification is important, too.</p><p>ZeniMax Online Studios was reportedly making a new game called Project Blackbird that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-elder-scrolls-online-teams-reportedly-canceled-mmo/1100-6533760/" data-ref-id="1100-6533760">sounded like a cross between Cyberpunk 2077 and Destiny</a> before it was canceled amid wider cuts at Microsoft.</p><p>"I want to make more games," Lambert said. "I'm not done yet, and the team continues to want to make more games as well. I have lots of ideas. Hopefully we'll be able to share those at some point."</p><p>He added: "I don't think you can ride one thing into forever. I mean, obviously we want ESO to be successful, we want it to be that 30-year MMO, and commit to it. But if you put all your eggs in one basket, there's issues."</p><p>Also in the interview, Lambert shared an ambitious-sounding goal for ZeniMax Online Studios, and that is to be the "most successful studio" across all of ZeniMax. "That's a big thing to say because we've got Bethesda Game Studios, we've got MachineGames, and id--the list goes on. But I want us to be that group that everybody looks at, like we do with [Bethesda Game Studios]," he said.</p><p>Lambert said the track record of Bethesda Game Studios is enviable and has a "massive legacy." Lambert said, "That's what I want us to do."</p><p>The Elder Scrolls Online launched in 2014 for PC before expanding to PS4 and Xbox One in 2015 and then Xbox Series X|S and PS5 in 2021. It debuted as a subscription-based game before shifting to a free-to-play model, and it has <a href="https://x.com/klobrille/status/1849086170770153940" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reached more than 25 million players.</a></p><p>It's been running for more than 10 years, but it's not the longest-running MMO. Blizzard's genre-defining World of Warcraft has been online since 2004, and it's been subscription-based the whole time. The Lord of the Rings Online, meanwhile, has been up and running since 2007. EverQuest, then, has been running for longer than both World of Warcraft and The Lord of the Rings Online.</p><p>In addition to ongoing support for The Elder Scrolls Online, Bethesda is working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, but there is no word yet on when it could be released.</p>

              <p><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-5-tactica-tactics-rpg-review-switch-1851020804"><i><span>Persona 5</span></i></a> <span>collaboration was announced </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-18-persona-collaboration-skins-joker-2000619195"><span>shortly before the game’s current season began</span></a><span>, and at the time, we didn’t know who would be dressing up as a Phantom Thief in Blizzard’s hero shooter. I’ve grown increasingly tired of how Blizzard has turned </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>into </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> with all these licensed crossovers replacing its own iconography and worldbuilding, but I’m also a </span><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>superfan, and I get to be a mark sometimes. Today, Blizzard announced the five heroes who will be suiting up as the vigilante high schoolers, and while I’m excited that one of my mains is getting a collab skin, I’m also glad to see that Kiriko, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-kiriko-mercy-venture-reaper-season-12-skins-1851626893"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s teacher’s pet</span></a><span>, is nowhere to be seen this time around.</span></p> <p><span>Blizzard showed off Wuyang, Genji, Lifeweaver, Mercy, and D.Va sporting costumes based on the Phantom Thieves. These will all be available tomorrow, September 16, and they look, well, pretty much exactly like the characters they’re referencing. There are some interesting details, though, such as the rose petals falling from Mercy’s wings, which are evocative of Ann’s Persona Carmen; Lifeweaver’s flower-petal back piece, meanwhile, has some of Yusuke’s iconography attached to it, and D.Va’s mech has been made to look like Makoto’s motorcycle Persona, Johanna. The full rundown:</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Wuyang as Joker (Ren)</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Mercy as Panther (Ann)</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Lifeweaver as Fox (Yusuke)</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>D.Va as Queen (Makoto)</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Genji as Skull (Ryuji)</span></li> </ul> <figure id="attachment_2000625741" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625741"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625741">© Blizzard Entertainment / Atlus</figcaption></figure> <p><span>These skins will likely come with other cosmetics, but Blizzard hasn’t revealed those yet. When the collaboration was first teased, we saw what appeared to be a highlight intro based on </span><i><span>Persona 5</span></i><span>’s All-Out Attack animations, so we’ll see if all five characters get that, or just Wuyang. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/in-defence-of-persona-5-s-ryuji-1797700262"><span>Ryuji</span></a><span> is my favorite </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>character, so I wish I played Genji, but I do play Lifeweaver, so I will be donning the Fox mask for a few matches later this week.</span></p>

			<p>SEGA's latest trailer for the next Sonic game calls out Nintendo, and no, we've not time-travelled back to the 80s/90s. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is due out next week at the time of this writing on September 25, 2025, and ahead of that launch, and the release of a demo this coming Wednesday, September 17, SEGA put out a new trailer showcasing CrossWorlds that included a coy call out to Nintendo's Mario Kart franchise.</p>



<p>The trailer is titled, "<em>Come Race on Our Level</em>," and begins with a blurred image of Mario Kart on one screen with a narrator saying, "<em>We all know that kart racing game. It's great. We don't need to show it to you.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>But what if you can blast through and race on a whole other level?</em>,<em>"</em> the narrator continues, before diving into a showcase of gameplay from Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The trailer goes on to list a few gameplay features in Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, and before it ends, takes one more shot at Mario Kart, though the second seems more specifically targeted at <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>, by listing a slew of features in CrossWorlds and then saying, "<em>Or, what if you want to roam around on the open road?</em>"</p>



<p>It's all just a bit of fun, of course, but there's a certain tinge of nostalgia the comes from seeing SEGA pull stunts like this.</p>



<p>In any case, players will be able to make up their own minds if Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will be worth picking up for their Nintendo Switch 2 consoles or other devices, as a demo will be available on all platforms tomorrow.</p>

			<p>Developer GFA Games has announced today that its upcoming MMOFPS game Pioner will host an Open Beta test at some point in October. The game is still scheduled to launch later this year on PC, with consoles to follow at a later time.</p>



<p>Pioner was actually already available <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-demo-confirmed-for-steam-next-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for a limited time as part of June's Steam Next Fest</a>. Following that test, GFA Games shared some adjustments planned for Pioner's PvP mode:</p>



<ul>
<li><em><strong>Current Capture Point Method:</strong> We’re working on making the “Capture the Flag” mode feel more classic. Players will no longer be forced to spend excessive time capturing a flag.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Point Names: </strong>We'll assign point names — A, B, and C — to make it easier for players to navigate the map and communicate with each other.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Enemy visualization in TDM:</strong> We're addressing visibility issues by adding a special type of visualization for enemies (NPCs and players) that makes them stand out against the environment. We're also adjusting lighting components that interfere with visibility.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Player movement:</strong> We’ll work on fixing player movement desynchronization, which can cause noticeable "jitter" in the movement of enemies and allies.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Hit registration:</strong> The netcode is still being fine-tuned. It’s not fully polished yet, which may cause hits not to register or kills/deaths to happen much faster than intended.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Hit collision:</strong> We’ll improve hitbox accuracy on certain environmental objects. We tried to identify as many of these issues as possible before the test, but some may still remain in certain areas of the map.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Balance: </strong>We’ve gathered all the current feedback on PvP weapon balance and will make additional adjustments in the near future.</em></li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>Honestly, though, the game generally felt rough during the Steam Next Fest demo. As someone who has been looking forward to Pioner for a while (you might have guessed it from the two <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-2-devs-reveal-pve-pvp-mechanics-of-this-stalker-like-mmofps-confirm-beta-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviews</a> I previously conducted with GFA Games), I think it could use some additional time in the oven to improve its polish. Still, maybe there was a big improvement in the last four months, so let's check this new build first. Meanwhile, check out the new gameplay trailer embedded above.</p>

            <p>This news story about Fata Deum is written in homage of a random early access Steam reviewer who remarks that if you've never played a god sim before, they're kind of like idle sims. My word, the casually ferocious and embittered atheist poetry of that. Consider my fedora tipped, milords and ladies. I'm off to read the Screwtape Letters again.</p>
<p>Fata Deum isn't just any born-again idle sim. It pays overt homage to Lionhead's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-white">Black &amp; White</a>, with higgledy-piggledy 3D island maps and a familiar hand cursor, used to carry believers to safety or lob them into the sea. There are some significant differences, however. </p><!--more-->

<p>For one thing, you don't get a Creature avatar to first mold in your holy image and then end up squabbling with when you decide to do an Old-New Testament of sorts, flipping from Benign to Vengeful or vice versa midway through a campaign.</p><p>Ah, I remember how my Lion Creature kept extinguishing the houses I smote with thunderbolts, exactly as I'd taught him when he was a cub, and I was a smiling beard in the sky rather than a cosmic arsonist. I'm sorry to see less of that in Fata Deum, but the upside of not having a Creature is that you'll spend less of this god sim cleaning up godbeast turds.</p>
<p>Another difference is that Fata Deum operates around a day-night split encompassing two genres of godliness. By day, you're more of an indirect presence, influencing villagers through visions and blessings. By night, you can intervene directly to make them build stuff and, if you like, raid the dominions of rival gods. </p>
<p>There's a familiar spectrum of Nice and Nasty divine behaviour. You can sacrifice villagers to raise demons or turn the corpses into zombies. Or you can pat them on the head and have them throw wild parties. Or you can mix it up - a little from column Altruism, a little from column Bastard.</p>
<p>There are other gods to worry about. They include deities of Violence, Deceit, Fertility and Pleasure. Each god's behaviour is reflected in the appearance of the terrain. I don't see one for Idleness in the trailers or on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1330360/Fata_Deum__The_God_Sim/">the Steam page</a> - I guess I'll have to thrash that one out myself, by leaving the PC running for 10,000 years.

</p><p>Developers 42 Bits Entertainment plan to keep this humming along in early access till late 2026. "We firmly believe that reviving the god game genre is a rather difficult task that can only be successfully accomplished through intensive dialogue with the community," they note. Do you consider the god sim in need of reviving? I thought last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reus-2">Reus 2</a> did a pretty fine job of it myself. </p>
