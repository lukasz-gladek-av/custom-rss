                <p>Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game is launching on PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on July 29. While the charming life-sim game will be available digitally on all platforms, those who want a physical release will be able to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7MPVJ2W?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pick up a boxed copy on PS5</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7N1DWXH?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a> on launch day. The Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game physical edition will cost $40, and preorders are available now ahead of launch. No preorder bonuses have been announced, but it does come with a fold-out map of Bywater village and a download code for a digital soundtrack, so it's probably worth securing your copy ahead of time.</p><p dir="ltr">Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game is a life sim set in The Shire--y'know, the idyllic corner of Middle-earth where Hobbits like Frodo, Bilbo, and Sam call home. The game will cast you as a Hobbit and give you your own plot of land in The Shire to cultivate and tend. There will also be plenty of side quests and activities to engage in, like fishing, foraging, and trading with or cooking meals for other Hobbits in Bywater village.</p><p dir="ltr">Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game is one of several games getting "small batch" physical runs this year from companies like iam8bit, Limited Run Games, and more. We've put together a list of some other notable upcoming titles like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8CZZRQ3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tetris Forever</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7FX2GCF?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shin Chan: Shiro and the CoalTown</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8D9CZSP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metal Slug Tactics</a> that are launching over the summer and are available to preorder now.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> now has so many animals, enemies, and entities that it can be hard to keep track of. If you're looking to build a wildlife sanctuary or just seeking some of the rarer mobs, you may want to know all of the animals, monsters, and other mobs in the game. Some of these can be tamed, bred, or even ridden, while others drop valuable loot when killed. Most mobs are also affected by the game's mechanics in the same way that you are--meaning they can be killed, drowned, or even catch fire. Here's the full list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-games/2900-5289/" data-ref-id="2900-5289">survival game</a>'s mobs.</p><div data-embed-type="toc" data-hide="true"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">show</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#All_Minecraft_passive_mobs">All Minecraft passive mobs</a><ul><li><a href="#Allay">Allay</a></li><li><a href="#Armadillo">Armadillo</a></li><li><a href="#Axolotl">Axolotl</a></li><li><a href="#Bat">Bat</a></li><li><a href="#Bee">Bee</a></li><li><a href="#Camel">Camel</a></li><li><a href="#Cat">Cat</a></li><li><a href="#Chicken">Chicken</a></li><li><a href="#Cod">Cod</a></li><li><a href="#Cow">Cow</a></li><li><a href="#Dolphin">Dolphin</a></li><li><a href="#Donkey">Donkey</a></li><li><a href="#Fox">Fox</a></li><li><a href="#Frog">Frog</a></li><li><a href="#Goat">Goat</a></li><li><a href="#Glow_Squid">Glow Squid</a></li><li><a href="#Happy_Ghast">Happy Ghast</a></li><li><a href="#Horse">Horse</a></li><li><a href="#Iron_Golem">Iron Golem</a></li><li><a href="#Llama">Llama</a></li><li><a href="#Mooshroom">Mooshroom</a></li><li><a href="#Mule">Mule</a></li><li><a href="#Ocelot">Ocelot</a></li><li><a href="#Panda">Panda</a></li><li><a href="#Parrot">Parrot</a></li><li><a href="#Pig">Pig</a></li><li><a href="#Polar_Bear">Polar Bear</a></li><li><a href="#Pufferfish">Pufferfish</a></li><li><a href="#Rabbit">Rabbit</a></li><li><a href="#Salmon">Salmon</a></li><li><a href="#Sheep">Sheep</a></li><li><a href="#Sniffer">Sniffer</a></li><li><a href="#Squid">Squid</a></li><li><a href="#Strider">Strider</a></li><li><a href="#Tropical_Fish">Tropical Fish</a></li><li><a href="#Turtle">Turtle</a></li><li><a href="#Villager">Villager</a></li><li><a href="#Wandering_Trader">Wandering Trader</a></li><li><a href="#Wolf">Wolf</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#All_Minecraft_hostile_mobs">All Minecraft hostile mobs</a><ul><li><a href="#Blaze">Blaze</a></li><li><a href="#Bogged">Bogged</a></li><li><a href="#Breeze">Breeze</a></li><li><a href="#Creaking">Creaking</a></li><li><a href="#Creeper">Creeper</a></li><li><a href="#Drowned">Drowned</a></li><li><a href="#Ender_Dragon">Ender Dragon</a></li><li><a href="#Enderman">Enderman</a></li><li><a href="#Endermite">Endermite</a></li><li><a href="#Evoker">Evoker</a></li><li><a href="#Ghast">Ghast</a></li><li><a href="#Guardian">Guardian</a></li><li><a href="#Hoglin">Hoglin</a></li><li><a href="#Husk">Husk</a></li><li><a href="#Magma_Cube">Magma Cube</a></li><li><a href="#Phantom">Phantom</a></li><li><a href="#Piglin">Piglin</a></li><li><a href="#Pillager">Pillager</a></li><li><a href="#Ravager">Ravager</a></li><li><a href="#Shulker">Shulker</a></li><li><a href="#Silverfish">Silverfish</a></li><li><a href="#Skeleton">Skeleton</a></li><li><a href="#Slime">Slime</a></li><li><a href="#Stray">Stray</a></li><li><a href="#Vex">Vex</a></li><li><a href="#Warden">Warden</a></li><li><a href="#Witch">Witch</a></li><li><a href="#Wither">Wither</a></li><li><a href="#Wither_Skeleton">Wither Skeleton</a></li><li><a href="#Zombie">Zombie</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="All_Minecraft_passive_mobs">All Minecraft passive mobs</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486737-minecraft-mobs%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486737" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486737-minecraft-mobs%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486737"></a><figcaption>Minecraft Allay</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486737-minecraft-mobs%281%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Allay">Allay</h3><p>The Minecraft Allay was added during The Wild Update and resembles a small, blue, fairy-like creature. You can find the Allay in Pillager Outpost cages or Woodland Mansion cages. Break the cage to set the Allay free, and it will become loyal as a thank-you for saving it from imprisonment. Give it an item to carry, and it will follow you, meaning leading it back to your base is simple. It'll also go and seek more of the same item, bringing it back to you.</p><p>After an Ally becomes loyal to you, you cannot harm them even accidentally, but they can lose health if it's attacked by another mob. If that happens, it can regenerate its own health. Breeding an Allay is different from most other mobs in the game, too, as they can self-duplicate without the need for a partner. To do this, use an amethyst shard on an Allay while it's dancing to jukebox music.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486754-minecraft-mobs%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486754" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486754-minecraft-mobs%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486754"></a><figcaption>Minecraft armadillo</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486754-minecraft-mobs%282%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Armadillo">Armadillo</h3><p>The armadillo was added to Minecraft in April 2024 as part of the Minecraft Live mob vote. It can be found in groups of two or three in the Savanna and Badlands biomes. Approaching it quickly will cause it to curl up scared, so sneak towards it if you want to get near. Spiders are afraid of armadillos, so having some at your base should keep the arachnids at bay. While you cannot tame an armadillo, it can be bred using spider eyes. Armadillos periodically drop scutes, or you can harvest scutes by using a brush on them. Scutes can be used to craft wolf armor, making them a valuable item. It takes six scutes to make wolf armor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486831-minecraft-mobs%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486831" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486831-minecraft-mobs%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486831"></a><figcaption>Different colored axolotl</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486831-minecraft-mobs%286%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Axolotl">Axolotl</h3><p>Minecraft axolotls can only be found in Lush Caves. While not technically a biome, they are huge openings in deep caves. We've found more luck in finding these under jungle biomes thanks to the humidity. Look for an Azalea tree above ground to signal that a Lush Cave could be below. Axolotls spawn within five blocks of clay, so keep an eye out for them when seeking them out. You can collect an axolotl in a bucket before creating an enclosed habitat for them to live in at your base. As they can't be tamed, if the axolotl is set free near your base, it will swim away. They need to live in water at least two blocks deep, and can be bred using buckets of tropical fish. There are multiple colors of axolotl in the game, including leucitic, wild, gold, cyan, and the rarest one--blue. Blue axolotls can't be found in the wild and must be bred. Axolotls will attack aquatic creatures with the exception of frogs, turtles, dolphins, and each other.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486830-minecraft-mobs%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486830" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486830-minecraft-mobs%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486830"></a><figcaption>Minecraft bats</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486830-minecraft-mobs%285%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Bat">Bat</h3><p>Bats can spawn in groups of eight in dark areas anywhere below block layer 63. They don't drop any items or experience points upon death, so the only reason for killing them is if you keep getting jump scared by their screeching and swooping when you're trying to avoid hostile mobs in caves. When idle, they can be spotted hanging upside down from solid blocks, but if you approach, they'll fly away. The same happens if the block they're hanging from is broken. They can't be tamed, bred, or interacted with in any way. They simply just exist. Good for them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486829-minecraft-mobs%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486829" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486829-minecraft-mobs%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486829"></a><figcaption>Minecraft bees in a flower forest</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486829-minecraft-mobs%284%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Bee">Bee</h3><p>The Minecraft bee is responsible for the production of honey, making it a valuable mob to interact with. We've got more information in our dedicated Minecraft bee guide. Bees will generally keep to themselves unless you provoke them or their hives, and just like in real life, they'll die if they sting you. You'll want to keep a campfire on hand if you're going to try harvesting honey from their hives too, as this keeps them calm.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486828-minecraft-mobs%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486828" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486828-minecraft-mobs%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486828"></a><figcaption>Riding a camel through the desert.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486828-minecraft-mobs%283%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Camel">Camel</h3><p>Camels, while fairly rare, can be found in deserts and desert villages, and can be ridden by up to two players at the same time. Camels do not respawn if they're killed, so if you see one, you'll want to quickly saddle it. Finding two and feeding them cacti will cause them to breed, and considering their rarity, this is highly recommended. Camels also have an extra inventory slot, where you can store the saddle. Camels can spring, and saddled camels can dash and charge. You'll see an additional dash charge bar which fills as the camel is being ridden, and using the jump button executes the dash. As camels are tall, while riding one, you cannot be reached by zombies, vindicators, hoglins, silverfish, endermites, and piglins. Most hostile mobs will never attack a camel, so riding one at night is a straightforward way to stay safe.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486832-minecraft-mobs%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486832" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486832-minecraft-mobs%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486832"></a><figcaption> A black cat lying on a bed</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486832-minecraft-mobs%287%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Cat">Cat</h3><p>The most useful way to employ a Minecraft cat is to ward off Creepers and Phantoms, who are terrified of them. You can find cats in villages or swamp huts, and they can be tamed using raw cod or raw salmon. There is a high chance that a cat will bring you a gift in the morning if it has not been commanded to sit, and if you slept in a bed at night and not during a thunderstorm. You can find out more in our dedicated Minecraft cats guide.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4488896-minecraft-mobs-all.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4488896" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4488896-minecraft-mobs-all.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4488896"></a><figcaption>Minecraft chicken</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4488896-minecraft-mobs-all.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Chicken">Chicken</h3><p>The chicken spawns naturally in most overworld biomes in Minecraft, and you can usually tell one is nearby since they lay eggs that can be collected. They also cluck pretty annoyingly, but that's another matter. Killing a chicken will drop feathers and raw chicken meat. Their eggs can be thrown to the ground and have a small chance of spawning another chicken. To tame and breed chickens, you can use any type of seed. Chickens are one of the only mobs that don't take fall damage. Chickens have three variants--temperate, cold, and warm, exclusive to specific biomes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489207-minecraft-mobs-all%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489207" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489207-minecraft-mobs-all%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489207"></a><figcaption>Minecraft Cod</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489207-minecraft-mobs-all%282%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Cod">Cod</h3><p>This passive aquatic mob looks like the real-life fish of the same name. You can find it swimming in ocean biomes, and they are more prominent in cold or lukewarm areas. When killed they drop raw cod which can be used to tame cats, or cooked for food. You can catch them with a fishing rod or in a bucket, as a bucket of cod, meaning you can move them from the ocean to any in-game aquariums or fish tanks you may have built. Cod can't be tamed or bred.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489208-minecraft-mobs-all%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489208" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489208-minecraft-mobs-all%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489208"></a><figcaption>Minecraft cow variants</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489208-minecraft-mobs-all%283%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Cow">Cow</h3><p>The Minecraft cow comes in three variants--temperate, cold, and warm, exclusive to specific biomes. Cows drop raw beef, which can be cooked into steak, a high-value food especially in the early game. They also occasionally drop leather, which is needed to craft books and item frames, among other Minecraft crafting recipes. If you use a bucket on a cow, they can be milked indefinitely. Given milk removes status effects such as poison, this is very helpful. Use wheat to tame and breed cows.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489209-minecraft-mobs-all%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489209" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489209-minecraft-mobs-all%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489209"></a><figcaption>Minecraft dolphins can lead you to treasure</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489209-minecraft-mobs-all%281%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Dolphin">Dolphin</h3><p>Dolphins are useful in Minecraft since they have the ability to guide you to high-value loot and areas. It spawns in the ocean, unless it's frozen, and swimming near a dolphin will give you the Dolphin's Grace effect, greatly increasing your swimming speed. If you feed a dolphin raw cod or salmon, it will swim towards the nearest buried treasure or ocean ruins. Dolphins can leap out of the water, mirroring their real-life counterparts, and dropping an item into the ocean near a dolphin triggers it to chase after it.</p><p>They cannot be tamed or bred, and need water to survive, so trapping them on land will cause them to die. However, building an underwater tunnel to guide them into an enclosed underwater space at your base? Totally allowed, and even encouraged (by me). Try sailing a boat near dolphins and watch how they interact with it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489210-minecraft-mobs-all%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489210" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489210-minecraft-mobs-all%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489210"></a><figcaption>Tie a Minecraft donkey to a post using a lead</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489210-minecraft-mobs-all%284%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Donkey">Donkey</h3><p>Donkeys behave much like horses, but with one important exception--they can carry items. They spawn in plains or savanna biomes, and can be ridden once tamed. Taming a donkey involves repeatedly mounting it until it accepts you. Donkeys can also be equipped with chests, giving them up to 15 more inventory slots, and making them useful for across-map travel with important valuables. While they can wear saddles, they cannot have horse armor applied. Donkeys can be bred with golden apples or golden carrots, and breeding one with a horse will produce a mule.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489211-minecraft-mobs-all%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489211" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489211-minecraft-mobs-all%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489211"></a><figcaption>Minecraft foxes sleeping under a tree</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489211-minecraft-mobs-all%285%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Fox">Fox</h3><p>The fox is one of the most adorable mobs in Minecraft. It usually spawns in the taiga biomes in small groups, and they can be red or white, depending on the biome type. They are very anxious and will flee from you unless you're sneaking when approaching. Foxes can carry items in their mouth, including weapons and food, which they may use or eat. To breed foxes, you'll need to use sweet berries, and if a baby is born from two player-bred foxes, it will trust you and not run away. At night, foxes will hunt chickens, rabbits, and small mobs, and will attack mobs that are holding food.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489212-minecraft-mobs-all%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489212" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489212-minecraft-mobs-all%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489212"></a><figcaption>Three cold-variant frogs</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489212-minecraft-mobs-all%286%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Frog">Frog</h3><p>I wish frogs were more easily found in Minecraft. They will only spawn in swamp or mangrove swamp biomes, although they do come in three color variants-- temperate, warm, and cold. Frogs can jump exceptionally high, and they eat slimes and magma cubes. When a frog eats a slime it will drop a slimeball, and if it eats a magma cube it creates a froglight. This decorative block matches the color variant of the frog that created it. Frogs are tamed and bred using slimeballs. Instead of laying eggs, they create frogspawn, which hatches into tadpoles, eventually evolving into frogs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489213-minecraft-mobs-all%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489213" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489213-minecraft-mobs-all%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489213"></a><figcaption>A Minecraft goat observes the land from high up</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489213-minecraft-mobs-all%287%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Goat">Goat</h3><p>Goats are found in mountain biomes, usually at some obscure angle up the side of a cliff, bleating that they can't get back down. Goats can jump up to ten blocks high, and when they feel threatened, they'll charge and knock back players or other mobs. If a goat rams into a solid block, it has a small chance to drop a goat horn, which can be used to play different sounds. The unofficial screaming goat mob is thought to bleat more aggressively and ram harder than its counterpart. Goats can be bred using wheat, and don't drop meat or leather upon death.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489214-minecraft-mobs-all%288%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489214" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489214-minecraft-mobs-all%288%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489214"></a><figcaption>The glow squid is easily seen in dark waters</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489214-minecraft-mobs-all%288%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Glow_Squid">Glow Squid</h3><p>Glow Squids, much like their duller counterparts, are a passive aquatic mob. They spawn in dark underwater areas, but their subtle glow means they're easily spotted. When killed, they drop glow ink sacs, which can be used to craft glow item frames. The items inside these stand out in the dark. Combining glow ink sacs with dye means you can make the text on your signs glow, too. Glow squids do not shoot ink, and they don't flee from you when you're nearby.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489887-minecraft-ghasts%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489887" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489887-minecraft-ghasts%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489887"></a><figcaption>Ghasts wearing harnesses</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489887-minecraft-ghasts%283%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Happy_Ghast">Happy Ghast</h3><p>The passive alternative to the hostile mob is the Minecraft Happy Ghast. While we've got a dedicated guide on how to find, tame, and ride them, the most important thing you need to know is that they look adorable wearing their harness. They can carry items from one place to another in a hot air balloon-style contraption, and you can ride on them with up to three friends. They'll also stay still when a player is standing on their back, meaning construction high in the air is easier than it's ever been.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489215-minecraft-mobs-all%289%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489215" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489215-minecraft-mobs-all%289%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489215"></a><figcaption>A player rides a horse in diamond armor</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489215-minecraft-mobs-all%289%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Horse">Horse</h3><p>Horses spawn in plains or savanna biomes, and they can be tamed, ridden, and bred. To tame a horse, you just need to repeatedly attempt to mount it until it accepts you. They have a huge variety of colors, and they're not exclusive to specific biomes unlike other mob variants. They can wear horse armor, providing additional protection. Use golden apples or golden carrots to breed horses. Their offspring will inherit specific traits from their parents, such as movement speed or health. Horses drop leather, occasionally saddles, and occasionally horse armor when killed. Breeding a horse and a donkey will create a mule that can carry chests.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489216-minecraft-mobs-all%2810%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489216" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489216-minecraft-mobs-all%2810%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489216"></a><figcaption>Iron Golem protecting his villagers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489216-minecraft-mobs-all%2810%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Iron_Golem">Iron Golem</h3><p>Iron Golems are found in Minecraft villages, and they're a passive mob ... until they're not. The Iron Golem serves as a protector of the village and can be crafted to protect your own base, too. They are useful defense mechanisms during raids or hostile mob attacks, as they have a high health pool and strong attacks.

Llamas can carry items in their chests, granting up to 15 more inventory slots on the move. Llamas can be combined to make a caravan, which allows you to control all llamas at once. When tamed, which is done by attempting to mount them multiple times like a horse, they can be ridden. When provoked, llamas will spit to attack. You'll need to tame two llamas and then feed them both hay bales in order to breed them.

This rare biome can be spotted due to the mushroom-shaped trees. Mooshrooms resemble red and white cows with mushrooms growing on their backs in their most striking form, but you can find brown Mooshrooms, too! They can be milked, and mushroom stew can be produced in this way. Mooshrooms can be bred using wheat to create baby Mooshrooms. When struck by lightning, the Mooshroom may transform into a normal cow, and vice versa. If a Mooshroom is fed mushroom stew, it will consume the stew but return it to your inventory. Mooshrooms are a fantastic food source thanks to their infinite mushroom stew capabilities, but the rarity of the biome means it's difficult to track them down for most players.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489222-minecraft-mobs-all%2813%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489222" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489222-minecraft-mobs-all%2813%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489222"></a><figcaption>A mule is created by breeding a horse with a donkey</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489222-minecraft-mobs-all%2813%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Mule">Mule</h3><p>The mule is a hybrid that occurs when a horse and a donkey are bred together. The mule will inherit the donkey's ability to carry items in a chest, but will be faster than a donkey. Mules cannot be bred together, so to get more of them, you must breed more horses with donkeys.

They're smaller and only spawn in jungles. Like cats and foxes, they will flee when approached unless you're sneaking. Ocelots cannot be tamed, but you can earn their trust by feeding them raw cod or salmon. In Bedrock, they're passive, but in Java, they'll be hostile. Using raw cod will reduce their hostility towards you and reduce the likelihood of them fleeing. Ocelots are immune to fall damage, and Creepers and Phantoms are also afraid of them. You can breed ocelots with raw cod and salmon, creating an ocelot kitten, which moves faster.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489224-minecraft-mobs-all%2815%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489224" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489224-minecraft-mobs-all%2815%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489224"></a><figcaption>Two pandas eating bamboo</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489224-minecraft-mobs-all%2815%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Panda">Panda</h3><p>Pandas will naturally spawn in bamboo jungles, and they're incredibly adorable. There are variants, but rather than changing their color, their nature will change. You can get normal, lazy, playful, worried, and aggressive pandas. The only color variant is the brown panda. These personalities will change the way the pandas behave. Using bamboo will tame and breed pandas, with their babies inheriting traits from each parent. Sometimes, when a panda sneezes, a baby panda is born. Pandas drop bamboo when killed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489225-minecraft-mobs-all%2816%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489225" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489225-minecraft-mobs-all%2816%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489225"></a><figcaption>Many parrots in the jungle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489225-minecraft-mobs-all%2816%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Parrot">Parrot</h3><p>Minecraft parrots' most endearing trait is their love of dancing.

Pigs can be ridden using a saddle, but they're not as fast as horses, so they're not often used in this way. You can use a carrot on a stick to decide the pig's movement direction.

It's common to see an adult polar bear with its cub, and this is where you need to be cautious. Adult polar bears become hostile fast if a player approaches or attacks their cub, as they're very protective. Their melee attacks can deal a reasonable amount of damage, too, so an angry mama polar bear is definitely one to avoid. When killed, they drop raw cod or salmon.

These small, spiky mobs inflate whenever someone gets too close, causing poison damage and knockback. They can appear small, medium, and fully puffed, and with each stage of inflation, the damage they deal increases. Pufferfish drop raw pufferfish when killed. You can eat it, but it causes poison and hunger. Instead, try using pufferfish in potions such as the water-breathing potion. You can collect pufferfish in a water bucket to transport them to your base for an aquarium or fish tank.

These can be found in suspicious sand at any warm ocean ruins, where you may have sought the help of a dolphin to locate them. Sniffers cannot be bred traditionally and must instead be given torchflower seeds. It sniffs out and finds torchflower seeds or pitcher pods.

They prefer it in the lava--if you observe one on the land, you might notice it's shivering, meaning it's cold. To ride a Strider, you'll need to get a saddle on it, and control it using a warped fungus on a stick. Striders can also be bred using warped fungus.

When killed, they drop raw tropical fish, which are used to tame axolotls. Their nutritional value is so low that they're not worth cooking or eating.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489875-minecraft-mobs-all%2827%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489875" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489875-minecraft-mobs-all%2827%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489875"></a><figcaption>A baby turtle sits atop its parent's head</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489875-minecraft-mobs-all%2827%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Turtle">Turtle</h3><p>Turtles usually spawn on the sand near warm ocean, but have been known to spawn on any sand. They are incredibly slow on land, but can swim quickly. After being bred with seagrass, turtles return to the beach where they hatched in order to lay their own eggs. You can collect these eggs and move them to your own beach, as the turtles will remain here after they have hatched. Turtle eggs take a notoriously long time to hatch, and they can be trampled by players or other mobs, so make sure to keep them nice and safe.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489876-minecraft-mobs-all%2828%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489876" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489876-minecraft-mobs-all%2828%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489876"></a><figcaption>A Villager farming</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489876-minecraft-mobs-all%2828%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Villager">Villager</h3><p>Villagers are a specific type of passive mob that only spawn in a village. They are humanoids and have the ability to trade with players. They also have distinct professions that determine which goods or services they can offer-- blacksmiths, librarians, farmers, and more all offer valuable items that can be traded for emeralds. Villagers are bred using bread, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot, to create a baby villager. There must be enough beds in the village for this to happen. Villagers also level up through trading, meaning they will offer better items and enchantments. If you've ever witnessed a raid on a village, you'll know that Villagers are terrible at fighting and will run away instead.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489877-minecraft-mobs-all%2829%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489877" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489877-minecraft-mobs-all%2829%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489877"></a><figcaption>A player offers a milk bucket to the Wandering Trader</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489877-minecraft-mobs-all%2829%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Wandering_Trader">Wandering Trader</h3><p>The Wandering Trader will occasionally appear across the map accompanied by two llamas. He offers various goods in exchange for emeralds, and will often bring items you don't yet have. His items are randomized, and there's no way to influence the items or offers that he has from day to day. Traders, unlike Villagers, cannot be bred or employed. If you don't interact, the Wandering Trader will just leave your vicinity in peace. However, if you attack him, both he and his llamas will try to attack in return.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489881-minecraft-mobs-all%2830%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489881" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489881-minecraft-mobs-all%2830%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489881"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489881-minecraft-mobs-all%2830%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Wolf">Wolf</h3><p>The wolf is often referred to as the dog in Minecraft since it mimics real-life canines. They spawn in forests, taigas, and snowy biomes, and are typically found in packs. Take a good stack of bones with you, as feeding them a few will tame them and cause them to follow you. You can also command them to sit or stand, or attack mobs. Wolves will defend you even when not commanded to, making them a great traveling companion in a single-player survival game. You can also breed wolves with bones. You can heal your wolf by feeding it cooked meat. You can easily tell your wolf's health status by the position of its tail--if it's lifted high, your wolf is feeling well, but if it's drooping down between its legs, it probably needs some meat pretty quickly.</p><h2 id="All_Minecraft_hostile_mobs">All Minecraft hostile mobs</h2><p>While there are plenty of passive mobs to invite to your base, whether that's for food, practicality, function, or you just think they're cute, there are also plenty of hostile mobs who are just waiting for the sun to set so they can ruin your day.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489889-minecraft-mobs-all%2831%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489889" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489889-minecraft-mobs-all%2831%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489889"></a><figcaption>A triggered Blaze prepares to attack</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489889-minecraft-mobs-all%2831%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Blaze">Blaze</h3><p>The Blaze can be found in Nether fortresses, and drops Blaze Rods upon death. It's the only source of Blaze Rods, which are essential for getting to The End and completing the game, so you'll have to encounter them at some point if that's your goal. They spit fireballs from range, or if you get too close they will spin and attack with their rods. Blazes are immune to fire or lava damage, and they can also fly to get a good view of their prey. The most effective way to deal with a Blaze is to throw snowballs at it, or push it into powder snow. They will target and attack you if you're within 48 blocks of them, and it will alert other Blazes in the area if it is attacked by you.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489895-minecraft-mobs-all%2832%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489895" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489895-minecraft-mobs-all%2832%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489895"></a><figcaption>A Bogged waits under a tree</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489895-minecraft-mobs-all%2832%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Bogged">Bogged</h3><p>Bogged spawn in the swamp biomes, but can also appear in Trial Chambers. They may drop bones, arrows, poison arrows, or damaged bows upon death. They act similarly to skeletons, and shoot poison arrows at nearby players. They are very slow to reload their bows compared to skeletons though, so you have time to get attacks in if you find yourself face-to-face with one. They have less health than a skeleton too, so they don't pose much of a threat.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489946-minecraft1.21thebreezemobreveal0-25screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489946" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489946-minecraft1.21thebreezemobreveal0-25screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489946"></a><figcaption>The Breeze attacks in a Trial Chamber</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489946-minecraft1.21thebreezemobreveal0-25screenshot.png"></figure><h3 id="Breeze">Breeze</h3><p>The Breeze behaves in a similar way to the Blaze, but it is found in Trial Chambers only. It hovers in the air and sends wind charges flying towards you. It drops Breeze Rods upon death, which can be crafted into Wind Charges and Maces. They are guaranteed to drop Breeze Rods, but only if the death counts as player-inflicted, meaning you can't drop heavy items on them to kill them. They are immune to projectile damage, and even able to repel incoming projectiles back at you, so put that bow away.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490030-minecraft-mobs-all%2833%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490030" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490030-minecraft-mobs-all%2833%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490030"></a><figcaption>A Creaking looms over a player</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490030-minecraft-mobs-all%2833%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Creaking">Creaking</h3><p>The Creaking spawns in the Pale Garden biome from a Creaking Heart. The Creaking Heart must be activated either at night or during a thunderstorm. Looking at the Creaking within 12 blocks will alert it, if there is no player within that radius then it will return to its idle state. If looking at a Creaking, it is unable to attack you unless you're wearing a carved pumpkin on your head. If you're not looking at it, it will move towards you to attack. If the Creaking is spawned from a Creaking Heart it cannot take any damage, but a trail of orange particles will appear between it and its heart. Resin clumps will also ooze from nearby Pale Oak logs. Destroying the Creaking Heart will cause the Creaking to disintegrate. Illagers are scared of Creakings and will run from them. Creakings are immune to fire, lava, Warden, Zoglin, and Wither damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490052-minecraft-mobs-all%2834%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490052" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490052-minecraft-mobs-all%2834%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490052"></a><figcaption>A charged Creeper next to a regular one</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490052-minecraft-mobs-all%2834%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Creeper">Creeper</h3><p>I've lost count of the amount of times I've screamed and sworn at a Creeper that snuck up on me. They don't earn their name for nothing. These silent mobs will sneak up to you on sight before hissing and exploding, causing you damage and destroying or dismantling any blocks or mobs nearby. Creepers can be struck by lightning, causing them to become Charged Creepers, which explode with more violence. It also allows for nearby Piglin, Zombie, Skeleton, and Creeper heads to be collected if they die as a result of that explosion. The only overworld biomes a Creeper will not spawn in are Mushroom Fields and Deep Dark.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493254-minecraft-all-mobs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493254" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493254-minecraft-all-mobs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493254"></a><figcaption>A Drowned on the ocean floor</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493254-minecraft-all-mobs.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Drowned">Drowned</h3><p>The Drowned is the underwater version of the Zombie, and spawns in oceans, rivers, and dripstone caves, or can be formed if a regular Zombie drowns. They swim through the water towards you and use melee attacks, although some Drowned have a trident which can be thrown long distances. This is the only way to get a trident for yourself though, so if you hear that ominous 'ding' noise and you're wanting one for yourself, it may be best to fight the natural instinct to run. They may also be holding a fishing rod or a nautilus shell. It's also possible for them to spawn riding a chicken, creating a Drowned chicken jockey. Husks can transform into a normal Zombie and then into a Drowned. Drowned never naturally spawn wearing any armor, but if they were a regular Zombie wearing armor that then transformed into a Drowned, it's possible to find an armored one. They drop rotten flesh upon death, and can also drop copper ingots. Drowned are the only source of renewable copper, meaning setting up a farm to turn Zombies into Drowned and then killing them is a good way to set up a copper farm.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493255-minecraft-all-mobs%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493255" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493255-minecraft-all-mobs%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493255"></a><figcaption>Promotional art for the Ender Dragon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493255-minecraft-all-mobs%281%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Ender_Dragon">Ender Dragon</h3><p>The Ender Dragon is a giant flying boss found in The End, and it's the largest naturally spawning enemy in the game. The Ender Dragon guards the entrance to the End gateways. Without beating the Ender Dragon, you cannot get to the outer End islands. Beating the Ender Dragon is considered the end of Minecraft, as the credits will roll as soon as you jump through the portal back to the Overworld after defeating it. After beating the Ender Dragon you can re-summon it by adding End Crystals to the exit portal. The Ender Dragon drops 12,000 XP and a Dragon Egg. The dragon is immune to status effects, but can take damage from explosions and players. Occasionally, it will shoot Dragon's Breath towards the land, which pools. Stepping in those pools, even when the Dragon has stopped firing, will damage you over time. You can use glass bottles to collect Dragon's Breath--useful for creating lingering potions. There's plenty more information on this boss mob in our Ender Dragon guide.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493258-minecraft-all-mobs%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493258" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493258-minecraft-all-mobs%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493258"></a><figcaption>An Enderman holding Warped Nylium in the Nether</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493258-minecraft-all-mobs%283%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Enderman">Enderman</h3><p>The Enderman is a tall mob found in the overworld, the Nether, and the End. Endermen will usually ignore players, but if you look into their eyes, they'll become hostile and attack. They can be harmed by water, so if you find yourself surrounded by them, especially when fighting the Ender Dragon, it's best to create a pool of water and stand in the middle of it. Sometimes they'll collect blocks. Killing Endermen will give you an Ender Pearl sometimes, making them vital to take down if you're trying to get to the End. Once an Enderman sets its sights on you, it will pursue you until it is killed or distracted by rain or fire. Ranged attacks are pointless on an Enderman, as instead of taking damage, it will teleport to safety.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493257-minecraft-all-mobs%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493257" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493257-minecraft-all-mobs%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493257"></a><figcaption>Endermites emit purple particles similar to Endermen</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493257-minecraft-all-mobs%282%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Endermite">Endermite</h3><p>While the Ender Dragon is the largest hostile mob, the Endermite is the smallest. It may spawn whenever you throw an Ender Pearl. They attack by biting, and Endermen are hostile towards them. They have a 5% chance of spawning and will spawn where the Ender Pearl lands. It will despawn within two minutes unless you name it with a name tag. They don't drop anything other than a small amount of experience points. Since Endermen become hostile towards them, you can use a name tag on an Endermite in the End to easily farm Endermen. It's important to create an area for the Endermite to exist that will attract Endermen, but where they cannot reach to kill them. Create a trap near to the Endermites for the Endermen to fall into.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493261-minecraft-all-mobs%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493261" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493261-minecraft-all-mobs%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493261"></a><figcaption>An Evoker casts its fangs spell</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493261-minecraft-all-mobs%284%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Evoker">Evoker</h3><p>The Evoker is a spell-casting Illager found in woodland mansions and raids, and killing it is the only way to get a Totem of Undying. It has two spells--one which summons armor-piercing fangs, and one which summons Vexes. They do not respawn once killed, making them rarer than most mobs. Evokers may be found riding a Ravager during a raid. They move quickly--at the same speed as your sprint, meaning they can cover a lot of ground when trying to attack. If an Evoker is not in combat, it can change the color of any sheep from blue to red, though no one really knows why they choose to do this.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493262-minecraft-all-mobs%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493262" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493262-minecraft-all-mobs%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493262"></a><figcaption>Three Ghasts fly around the Nether</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493262-minecraft-all-mobs%285%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Ghast">Ghast</h3><p>The Ghast is the original, hostile version of the Happy Ghast. It spawns in the Nether and can sometimes be heard crying before it attacks. It attacks by sending a series of projectile fireballs towards players, which knock them back. This means traversing narrow bridges in the Nether can be fatal if a Ghast spots you, as you can soon descend into the lava below from just one of their fireball attacks. When killed, they drop Ghast Tears, gunpowder, and experience points. If a Ghast is in close range, its own fireballs can kill it, although it is usually immune to fire or lava damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493269-minecraft-all-mobs%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493269" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493269-minecraft-all-mobs%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493269"></a><figcaption>A Guardian attacks some Squid</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493269-minecraft-all-mobs%286%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Guardian">Guardian</h3><p>Guardians look like underwater mines, with tails and orange spikes.

If you come across bastion remnants in the Nether, it's likely you'll find stables that also house Hoglins. They'll attack any player, but wearing an item of gold armor prevents this. If a Hoglin is taken to the Overworld or the End, it will transform into a Zoglin after 15 seconds.

Baby Husks can spawn as a chicken jockey in Java edition, but in Bedrock, the list of mobs they can ride is far longer, and includes ocelots, wolves, other zombies, horses, sheep, and more. Husks will seek out nearby turtle eggs to trample them. They drop rotten flesh on death, and have a chance of dropping an iron ingot, carrot, or potato.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493274-minecraft-all-mobs%289%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493274" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493274-minecraft-all-mobs%289%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493274"></a><figcaption>The size difference between a player and a Magma Cube</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493274-minecraft-all-mobs%289%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Magma_Cube">Magma Cube</h3><p>The Magma Cube is found in the Nether and behaves in a similar way to a Slime. It is fireproof, and it jumps higher and deals more damage than a Slime. Magma Cubes drop Magma Cream and experience points when killed. When a Magma Cube finds you within 16 blocks, it will leap towards you. They can jump forward twice as fast as any other mobs. When you kill a Magma Cube, it will split into smaller Magma Cubes, which also need to be killed. They cause damage just by touching you, and can cause up to 12 damage per second on normal difficulty, making them one of the most dangerous mobs to get pursued by.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493275-minecraft-all-mobs%2810%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493275" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493275-minecraft-all-mobs%2810%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493275"></a><figcaption>Minecraft Phantoms spawn in the air</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493275-minecraft-all-mobs%2810%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Phantom">Phantom</h3><p>Phantoms are flying undead mobs that spawn if you have not slept for three or more in-game days.

They only spawn at night or during thunderstorms and will burn when the sun comes out again. The more nights you avoid sleep, the more phantoms will spawn each night.

Piglin Brutes appear in bastion remnants and do not barter like Piglins do. They also cannot be distracted by gold. Wearing gold armor or offering gold to a regular Piglin will stop them from attacking you, and can open the bartering interface, where Piglins can offer rare materials in exchange for gold ingots. The Piglin Brute holds a golden axe and will charge at you to attack. If a Piglin spots you holding a gold item, it will snort with jealousy. Piglins are afraid of zombified piglins, zoglins, and soul fire, torches, lanterns, and campfires. If it sees any of these, it will scream and run away. You might see up to three baby Piglins riding a baby Hoglin--weird, but cute. Mining gold in the Nether in sight of a Piglin will cause all of them nearby to turn hostile and attack you, even if you're wearing gold armor. Like a Hoglin, if a Piglin finds itself in the overworld or the Nether, it will be zombified.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493277-minecraft-all-mobs%2812%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493277" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493277-minecraft-all-mobs%2812%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493277"></a><figcaption>We've been trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493277-minecraft-all-mobs%2812%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Pillager">Pillager</h3><p>Pillagers can be found in wandering patrols, at pillager outposts, or during raids.

They continuously spawn in pillager outposts, and may spawn as captains. On death, they may drop a crossbow, an ominous banner, or an ominous bottle. Drinking a Bad Omen potion gives a status effect that lasts for 100 minutes, but it can be removed by drinking milk.

The Shulker is found in End cities and attacks by firing tracking projectiles at players, which then inflict levitation. A Shulker may spawn a new one of the same color if it's hit with a Shulker bullet. When the Shulker gets hit and has half of its health remaining, it has a one in four chance to try and teleport without spawning a new Shulker. There's a 50% chance of a Shulker dropping a Shulker Shell upon death.

They're very hard to aim at and kill, and move very fast around your feet, biting to attack. They infest stone and deepslate blocks in mountains, strongholds, igloo basements, and woodland mansions. Attacking a silverfish causes more silverfish nearby to emerge from the block they've infested to attack. You're usually likely to find Silverfish in the end portal room of a stronghold on your way to the End. They don't drop anything other than experience points, can't be tamed or bred, and generally only exist to be an annoyance, in my experience. It's possible to find yourself surrounded by hundreds of them very quickly.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493289-minecraft-all-mobs%2816%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493289" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493289-minecraft-all-mobs%2816%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493289"></a><figcaption>Skeletons can spawn in the Nether</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493289-minecraft-all-mobs%2816%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Skeleton">Skeleton</h3><p>Skeletons are one of the more common hostile mobs. They spawn at night or in areas with low light, and they use a bow and arrow to shoot from range. The only biomes they don't spawn in are the mushroom fields or the deep dark, but they can spawn in groups of up to four. It's possible for a skeleton to spawn riding a spider. Four skeleton horsemen will spawn when a skeleton horse trap is triggered, usually during a thunderstorm. The skeletons ride skeleton horses and usually have enchanted bows and iron helmets. They do spawn in the soul sand biomes of the Nether, although far less often than they spawn in the overworld. When they're killed, skeletons can drop bones, arrows, any naturally spawned equipment or bows, and experience. If a charged Creeper kills a skeleton, it may also drop its skull. They will chase players, baby turtles, and iron golems. They can climb stairs or ladders, but they'll burn when the sun comes up.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493291-minecraft-all-mobs%2817%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493291" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493291-minecraft-all-mobs%2817%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493291"></a><figcaption>Slimes of various sizes</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493291-minecraft-all-mobs%2817%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Slime">Slime</h3><p>Slimes are bouncy, cube-shaped mobs that behave similarly to the Magma Cube, although they don't jump as high or as far. They spawn deep underground in swamp biomes, or in specific 'slime chunks,' and attack by jumping at you. Larger Slimes split into smaller ones when they die, and they come in three sizes. They spawn most often during a full moon and never during a new moon. A slime chunk is determined in the game's code by combining its coordinates with the world's seed. A random number between 0 and 9 is generated, and if the number is 0 the chunk can spawn slimes. If a Slime is killed by a frog it will always drop one slimeball. If it's killed by you, it will drop between 0 and 2 slimeballs. They also drop experience points relative to their size--4 for large, 2 for medium, and 1 for small. Due to the way a Slime splits when it's killed, it's possible to get up to 28 experience from one large Slime and all of the subsequent smaller Slimes that split from it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493292-minecraft-all-mobs%2818%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493292" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493292-minecraft-all-mobs%2818%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493292"></a><figcaption>Promotional artwork for the Stray</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493292-minecraft-all-mobs%2818%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Stray">Stray</h3><p>A Stray is a skeleton variant that spawns in some snow-covered biomes.

You can create a Stray by trapping a normal skeleton inside powder snow. After seven seconds, it will begin to shake, and after a further fifteen seconds, it will become a Stray. Even if the skeleton had minimal health left, when transformed into a Stray, it will regain full health.

The appearance of the Warden makes me feel like Minecraft isn't a survival game at all, but a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-horror-games/2900-4900/" data-ref-id="2900-4900">horror game</a>. He's incredibly powerful, and is summoned by sculk shriekers in the deep dark. It can swing its arms down to the ground to deal the strongest melee damage in the game. It also has a sonic boom attack that can reach through obstacles. Wardens are completely blind, relying on vibrations, smell, and touch to detect you. Therefore, you can use wool or sneak to avoid it. Throwing a snowball or shooting an arrow in a different direction to distract it are also effective techniques.</p><p>The Warden is spawned if a player or mob activates a sculk shrieker three times. It will emerge hauntingly from the ground nearby, as long as another Warden isn't within 24 blocks of it. A Warden drops a sculk catalyst upon death, and only five experience--which, considering the difficulty you are met with when trying to face one, feels very low. After spawning, the Warden will move randomly around the world, following vibrations from nearby players. It can also sniff the air around it to locate you, even if you're not moving. If it picks up a movement, smell, or vibration, it will become increasingly angered. Even if the Warden isn't angered, it will cast a darkness over all players within 20 blocks of it, every six seconds. At the same time, you'll hear its heartbeat, which speeds up as it gets angrier. The Warden actually has more health than the Ender Dragon, so killing it can be exceptionally difficult.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493300-minecraft-all-mobs%2821%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493300" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493300-minecraft-all-mobs%2821%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493300"></a><figcaption>Witches standing on a lilypad</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493300-minecraft-all-mobs%2821%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Witch">Witch</h3><p>The Witch uses potions to her advantage, as weapons in the form of splash potions, and drinking potions for defense and healing. The Witch can spawn in all biomes apart from the mushroom fields or the deep dark. Every swamp hut spawns a witch and a cat inside, which never despawn. Some witches always spawn as part of raids from the third wave onwards. A villager will transform into a witch if lightning strikes within four blocks of it. Witches can drop sticks, glass bottles, glowstone dust, redstone dust, spider eyes, gunpowder, and sugar. If a witch is killed while drinking a potion, it can drop healing, fire resistance, swiftness, or water-breathing potions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493303-minecraft-all-mobs%2822%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493303" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493303-minecraft-all-mobs%2822%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493303"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493303-minecraft-all-mobs%2822%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Wither">Wither</h3><p>The Wither is another of the game's boss mobs, but can only spawn when a player constructs it. It's undead, hovers in midair, and fires explosive wither skulls at enemies. It considers anything living to be an enemy, and it's the only source of Nether Stars in the game. These are used to craft Beacons, making the Wither an essential opponent to face at some point if you'd like Beacons in your base. To spawn a Wither, place four blocks of soul sand or soul soil in a T shape, and then placing three wither skeleton skulls on the top three blocks. The last block placed must be one of the skulls. When the Wither spawns, it is immediately angered and creates a large explosion. The Wither always drops a Nether Star, but also drops 50 experience points.</p><p>As the Wither's health bar fills up upon spawning, it grows in size and cannot be damaged in this state. The spawn sound of the Wither can be heard across the map in all dimensions. It has 300 health points, more than the Ender Dragon but less than the Warden. It is immune to fire, lava, drowning, and freezing, but it is vulnerable to weapons with the Smite enchantment. When it takes damage, the Wither breaks all blocks within a 3x4x3 area surrounding it, including blast-resistant blocks such as Obsidian. The only blocks it cannot break are End Portals, Bedrock, End Portal Frames, End Gateways, Command Blocks, Structure Blocks, Jigsaw Blocks, Light Blocks, Moving Blocks, Moving Pistons, and Reinforced Deepslate. Whenever a Wither kills another mob, a Wither Rose is planted as long as it is on grass, dirt, moss, mud, soul sand, soul soil, or netherrack. It can passively regenerate its own health every second, and instantly heals itself when it kills a target directly. When its health gets to halfway depleted, it will get wither armor, making it immune to arrows and tridents.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493306-minecraft-all-mobs%2823%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493306" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493306-minecraft-all-mobs%2823%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493306"></a><figcaption>Wither Skeletons in the Nether</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493306-minecraft-all-mobs%2823%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Wither_Skeleton">Wither Skeleton</h3><p>Wither skeletons are taller skeleton variants that wield stone swords. Being hit by a Wither Skeleton inflicts the Wither effect, which acts like a poison. They spawn in Nether Fortresses and are the only place to get Wither Skeleton Skulls, which are needed to construct the Wither boss. They are also the only renewable source of coal, so they can be used to set up a farm for this purpose. On Halloween, Wither Skeletons can spawn wearing a carved pumpkin, but this isn't dropped upon death. The Wither spawns Wither Skeletons when it's below half health. Wither Skeletons can spawn riding a spider or cave spider in the Nether, but since neither spawns naturally in the Nether, it would need to be player-created.

If you're near a village at night, up to 20 zombies could spawn in the village, known as a siege. Zombies drop rotten flesh, but also have the potential to drop an iron ingot, carrot, or potato. Zombies actively seek out turtle eggs and baby turtles to attack, as well as villagers and wandering traders. When the sun comes up, zombies will set fire and die.

                <p>Tetris Forever earned positive reviews when it released last year, and now it’s gearing up for a physical release on August 28 for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8CZZRQ3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8D3B4QV?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/palia-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s something uniquely satisfying about putting down roots in a sleepy town in games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-for-switch">Animal Crossing</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-review-2024">Stardew Valley</a>, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-review">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>. Palia evolves this tradition to great effect, injecting large-scale multiplayer into that tried-and-true formula. After 50 hours of chopping down trees, hunting woodland critters, decorating my home, and hanging out with my fellow Palians, I’ve had a fantastic time catching up on all I’ve missed since the early days of the beta. I still have to dive into the new content and loads of updates that arrived today with its console launch and first major expansion, Elderwood, but I am eager to do so ahead of my final review.=</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palia is a cozy life sim with one major tweak: you’re in an online world that occasionally compels you to come out of your shell and interact with other humans – a sometimes Herculean task for the introverts often drawn to this genre. As you explore, you’ll encounter others out in the shared world going about their business, and are encouraged (or sometimes required) to cooperate with them. For example, you’ll get a buff for fishing with others and will find magical trees that can only be chopped down with the help of one or more friends. This has led to a community that’s astoundingly positive and helpful, with the vast majority of the public chat being PSAs from players who have found a valuable resource they’d like to share with strangers, then waiting for minutes on end for everyone to assemble before collecting it as a group. I spend a lot of time playing multiplayer games defined by the community’s potent toxicity and savage greed, so this kind of culture has truly been a shock to my system that I’m still adjusting to.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although multiplayer is its signature twist, you can still do the vast majority of Palia’s activities by yourself. There’s also just a whole heck of a lot for you to do however you decide to tackle it, all in service of building up your home and improving your relationships with the NPC townsfolk. The usual zen-like staples like cooking and catching bugs are all here and actually quite good – the fishing minigame, for example, is less mindless than you usually find in the genre, having you tug and pull on your rod as the fish leaps into the air and puts up a fight. There’s even a few less common options like hunting, where you’ll pick off poor critters who burrow into the ground and leap into trees as you pepper them with arrows. While an absence of stress is an intentional focus of Palia’s design, it sometimes tries a bit too hard to accomplish that goal, like in how your arrows will magically home in on your target incredibly aggressive, sometimes turning corners to aid your aim. I’m all for a laid back experience, but it can be a bit obnoxious when you’re trying to line up a shot and the magnetism training wheels curve your arrow toward a different creature altogether, frustrating what’s supposed to be a chill activity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palia has a surprisingly full-featured main story as well. It has you exploring ancient ruins to uncover the truth about a world which was once populated by humans who are curiously gone now, and the dark history of magic that seemingly caused the collapse of society. This adventure is much more light-hearted than that might sound though, and you’re mostly just given opportunities to learn about the world and hang out with the characters who accompany you on quests while you platform around and solve simple puzzles. Per Palia’s adherence to cozy virtues, none of this is particularly demanding, and the mainline quests can be completed in a matter of hours if you focus on them, but I enjoyed diving just a tad deeper into the world and the break from grinding for iron ore to craft the next piece of furniture I just couldn’t live without. The story was quite incomplete ahead of the Elderwood expansion though, so I’m intrigued to see where it picks up after that abrupt end.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Palia has one of the better home building systems I’ve seen. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s other minigames that further mix things up, like a hotpot-themed card game I spent way too much time playing, or a surprisingly intricate platforming puzzle that took me hours to master. Sometimes these experiments exceed Palia’s grasp, like the platforming puzzles in particular, which are held back by clunky controls that don’t seem like they were designed with precision in mind. Climbing can be a quite irritating experience as your character will let go of surfaces inconsistently, sending you plummeting to your death. Thankfully the stakes in taking these spills are always very low, so there’s not much to lose aside from a bit of your time wasted, but it can definitely make some of the quests feel a bit tacked on. Other times, you’ll find yourself doing a sliding picture puzzle and think “y’know, this is pretty nice,” so I mostly found myself happy they took these shots nonetheless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the purpose behind all these various undertakings is to gain as much gold as you can to upgrade and decorate your home, and Palia has one of the better home building systems I’ve seen. Rather than giving you no control over the blueprint of your house like in Animal Crossing or Disney Dreamlight Valley, or making you monkey around with a building mode that has you placing individual walls like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-4-review-2024">The Sims</a>, Palia favors a modular system: You unlock schematics for pieces of a home that you can freely snap onto various parts of your building, making it easy to design the general layout without having to get lost in the weeds. Then, once you’ve built your place, you can decorate it down to the most minute detail, dragging furniture, dolls, and cups around on a grid to make it just so. I could probably spend dozens of hours on this part of Palia alone, were it not for my insatiable need for cold hard cash to fund my homestead expansion. But that desire to make your place exactly as awesome as you want it to be is a serious motivator that sent me out in search of lumber and iron ore time and time again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those resource grinds each have their own progression systems as well, as you level up by repeatedly going out into the world and bringing back your haul of raw materials and collectibles to sell. I played dozens of hours of Palia as part of an early preview way back before it was even in its current open beta (and had my save file from that time tragically deleted), and the biggest change has been that its progression systems for these activities are much more streamlined and feel less grindy. Now, as you plant trees and craft furniture, you’ll unlock new equipment like a loom for creating fabric or a furnace for creating glass. You’ll also get better tools to perform cozy chores with, like a hoe that lets you till land faster or a bow and arrows that will let you take down prey in fewer shots, each of which feels like a handy upgrade that shows up at exactly the right moment you start feeling a need for it. The timegating that sometimes boxes you out of marathoning through everything in other life sims is mercifully absent here for the most part, so you can move as fast or as slow as you care to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other major pursuit in Palia is in getting to know and develop relationships with its 25 NPC residents, most of whom are really well-written and have a lot more to them than meets the eye upon first glance. I quite enjoyed hanging out with the sarcastic and moody daughter of the mayor, Kenyatta, who worked the front desk with all the enthusiasm of April from Parks and Recreation – but after helping her down the extremely chaotic path of discovering what she’s passionate about in life, I grew to appreciate her in a less superficial way. Even characters I really didn't jive with, like the cryptid-obsessed hippy who annoyed me to no end, Elouisa, was at least entertainingly irritating and I’ve learned to appreciate how much her personality bothers me over time. (We’ve all got a friend like that, don’t we?) Most characters have an arc that takes place over several quests where they let you see a bit more of their personality as you forge a friendship. And, of course, if you’re looking for more than friendship you can partake in Palia’s quite strong dating mechanics to get yourself a girlfriend or boyfriend, or several of them – no judging here.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Relationships are the one area where timegating gets in the way.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, this is one area where timegating gets in the way of a good time, and is one of the only places Palia boxes you out. You’re only allowed to chat with each character once per in-game day (a 30-minute period of real time), which improves your social links a very small amount, and you can only give each character a gift once per real world day. So if you’re trying to finish a particular character’s story, you’ll have to log on with regularity and be subjected to the same rotation of brief banter before you’re able to make any real progress. This is especially painful early on when your citizenship in Kilima Village is dependent on having someone in town to vouch for you – a task that’s made impossible to do in a short span of time by timegating. When every other area of Palia lets you play to your heart’s content, it’s pretty annoying to see such an essential part of this slice of life block you from progressing at your own pace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palia has come a long way since I played it over a year ago, but one thing that remained true ahead of this latest update is that it’s still missing quite a bit. The two maps I’ve explored are fairly small, and though they’ve got nooks and crannies to run around, you can more-or-less see most of what’s available in a few hours. Social features, though awesome when they happen, still feel quite slim for a game where the killer feature is supposed to be its online functionality, and there aren’t enough activities that encourage group play. And although there are quite a few options for decorating your house, surprisingly little of it can be interacted with once placed. You can’t lie in bed, turn on the sink, or really do much of anything with most objects, which sometimes made me feel like I was building a museum rather than a home. They did add the ability to flick the light switches on and off, which is at least something, but there’s a lot missing. These are all issues likely to be built out in the future, and I’m interested to see if Elderwood helps at all, but I’m a bit surprised that some of these aren’t farther along all the same.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Cozy Games</h3><p>If you're looking for a game that pairs well with a warm blanket and a hot cup of tea, look no further than these TieGuyTravis-approved recommendations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The other major issue with Palia has been its bugs and performance issues on PC, which have gotten remarkably better since I last played, but are still pretty common. I quite frequently see NPCs sink into the floor, sometimes altogether hidden underground to the point where I can’t interact with them, there’s a bunch of very visible pop-in that happens while you’re running around, and loading times when traveling between each section of the map feel far longer than they should. Playing on the Nintendo Switch is especially eyebrow raising, as everything looks pretty awful and runs significantly worse, to the point where I really can’t recommend it on that platform in the same way I enthusiastically would elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve put quite a bit of time into Palia over the past week and have had a hard time putting it down, even as I’ve completed all the major activities available before the Elderwood expansion arrives. I’m looking forward to seeing how it runs on the PS5 and Xbox, checking out the new area and quality of life improvements, and continuing my chase for unlimited money to flex on my friends with my meticulously decorated estate.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/palia-temp-score-1747169197396.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> is a great remaster of the classic 2014 puzzle game, and not just because of the Unreal Engine 5 boost it gave the graphics. It added a whole new expansion on top of the original game and the Road to Gehenna DLC, a prequel to the game's story called In the Beginning.</p>
<p>In the Beginning includes 18 new puzzles for players to solve, and what makes it and The Talos Principle: Reawakened particularly special is that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2806640/view/519709875052217858?l=english">16 of these 18 puzzles</a> were designed in collaboration with members of the game's community, people who had been making puzzles themselves for the last decade because they loved the game and its mechanics.&nbsp;Which also explains why these puzzles are some of the most difficult ones to solve across the entire Talos Principle series.</p>
<p>This guide will show you how to solve the Conundrum Cascade puzzle. However, if you just want a hint before reading the full solution, then what I'll say is, don't forget to use the ladders. I think if I said anything more, I'd give away too much.</p>
<p>If you want me to give more away, read on for the full solution.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Conundrum Cascade Puzzle Guide</h2>
<h3>Phase One - Get the hexahedron and both connectors</h3>
<p>To start solving this puzzle, you need to get the hexahedron that's behind a shield on the right side of the puzzle area.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up the fan that is on the ground and in front of a pressure switch right in the middle of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place it on the pressure switch on the right side of the puzzle area to deactivate the shield blocking the path to the hexahedron.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the hexahedron and place it on the pressure switch in the middle of the puzzle area when you walk into the puzzle.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the fan back on the vent in front of the hexahedron, and use it to fly up into the air to grab the first connector (C1). Drop back down to the ground with C1 in hand.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Connect C1 to the red laser generator in the middle and the red node on the left side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up the fan and place it on the vent that was sitting behind the shield that is now deactivated by C1. Grab the hexahedron and let the fan launch you into the air onto the platform in the middle of the puzzle.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the hexahedron on the left-most pressure switch to activate the vent and fan next to it.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Launch yourself to a smaller platform where you'll find a switch that will keep the shields blocking your path to the ladders permanently deactivated. Flip the switch, and jump down to the ground.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>For this next part, you can either use the fan to launch yourself back up to the taller platform in the middle of the puzzle area, or climb the ladder, but the point is you need to get back up there, and drop the hexahedron and the fan that was already up there down to the ground. Collect the hexahedron, both fans, and C1 together. Place one fan on the vent, then place the hexahedron on top of that fan, with C1 on top of the hexahedron.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the other fan down on the pressure switch so the hexahedron and C1 are flying in the air.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Use the ladder to climb up to the top of the platform and grab C1 and the hexahedron. Place the hexahedron next to the window on the right side of the platform, and then connect C1 to the red laser generator and the red node that will deactivate the shield blocking the path to the second connector (C2).</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Jump back down to the ground and use either of the fans to deactivate the first shield with the pressure switch on the right side of the puzzle area, and grab C2. Bring C2 into the middle of the puzzle area before you put it down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you've acquired all the tools you need to actually go ahead and solve the puzzle.</p>
<h3>Phase Two - Go for the solve</h3>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up C2 and connect it to the red laser generator and the red node on the left side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab one of the fans and place it on the vent. Grab the other fan and launch yourself and the fan back up to the platform in the middle of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the fan back on the vent at the top of the middle platform. Grab C1 and place it on the left-most pressure switch to activate the fan. Pick up the hexahedron to launch yourself and the hexahedron to the smaller platform on the left side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the hexahedron on the pressure switch, and jump back down to the ground.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and connect it to the red node on the opposite side of the wall that's on the left side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Use the ladder, or use the fan to launch yourself back up to the middle platform. Grab the fan off the vent, and drop down to the ground, and place it on top of the vent that's on the ground in the middle of the puzzle area. Grab the other fan and place it down next to the pressure switch on the ground in the middle of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Use the ladder leading up to the smaller platform, and grab the hexahedron. Place it on fan overtop the vent and then place the other fan on the pressure switch to have it flying through the air. Head up the ladder to put the hexahedron back on the middle platform.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C1 and connect it to the red laser generator and C2, then place it on top of the hexahedron like you did earlier.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Jump back down to the ground and use the ladder leading to the shorter platform to step on the pressure switch, so the laser can pass through and hit C2. Once C2 activates the node behind the wall, you can step off the switch with the shield deactivated.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab one of the fans and place it on the vent next to C2. Grab the other fan and launch yourself, with the second fan, up to the middle platform. Place the fan on either of the two pressure switches to the right of the pressure switch that activates the fan.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Jump back down to the ground and stand next to C2. Pick it up, and for the final time, launch yourself to the middle platform.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Connect C2 to C1, and to the red node that will deactivate the shield blocking the path to the tetromino. Place it down on the pressure switch next to the switch you placed the fan on.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>The fan and C2 standing on their pressure switches will deactivate the shield at the top of the middle platform, allowing the laser to pass through and hit the node to deactivate the shield blocking the path to the tetromino. Jump down to walk over to the tetromino and claim your prize.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's how to solve the Conundrum Cascade in the new In the Beginning expansion that came with The Talos Principle: Reawakened.</p>

I think it's kind of under-appreciated how funny Tetsuya Nomura is. In recent years his social media presence has become quite mysterious, in that he'll just kind of drop some kind of cryptic tease on Twitter and then not explain himself. Despite not having revealed a single drop of information about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Kingdom Hearts 4</a> since its announcement three years ago, Nomura <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1905427039227887864">hinted at some deeper lore about the series' paopu fruit</a> in a very nonchalant manner. It's just funny at this point! And he's done it again, this time with a Magic the Gathering card.

<p>
If you didn't know, Magic the Gathering is getting an entire Final Fantasy themed set that will probably single handedly get many people into Magic the Gathering. Yesterday, a whole bunch of cards from the set were revealed, including some special ones with fancy art. Unsurprisingly, everyone's favourite long-haired, long-sworded Sephiroth is a card with two bits of art, one with his regular look, the other his final boss form. It's that second one, "Safer Sephiroth", that Nomura has commented on that has me, and many others, wondering if it's actually a nod toward <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> 3 (or whatever it's called).

<p>
"This time around, I drew Sephiroth on both the front and back sides of the card. I actually drew them so that they would join up if placed one on top of the other, so if you manage to get two of the same card and line them up, you'll see how the original illustration looked," Nomura explained. "There is also a reason that the design for Sephiroth is different from the original game, but I unfortunately can't share more about that."
</p>
<p>
Of course you can't share more about that, Nomura! When can you! Why even bring it up in the first place? I doubt most people would have even noticed, and now you're going to be fueling fan theories for the next two years. In case you don't know what Safer Sephiroth looked like in the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, his right arm was just a wing. In this new art, he has both arms and that wing.
</p>
<p>
What could this mean? Maybe it's to keep Cloud and co out of arm's way (sorry)? Mostly, I have no clue, I'm just quite tickled by the fact that Nomura seems to get a kick out of dropping comments like these. Anyway, I'm off to sell a couple of organs to be able to afford a few booster boxes of this set because I do actually want that Sephiroth card!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/thunderbolts-marvel-avengers-cube-escape-room<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This past weekend, I finally pulled the trigger on watching <a href="https://gizmodo.com/thunderbolts-movie-review-florence-pugh-marvel-studios-disney-2000595603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s <em>Thunderbolts*</em></a>, and yeah, it’s not that bad — a <a href="https://letterboxd.com/eyezehuhh/film/thunderbolts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solid three and a half stars on Letterboxd</a>. My only gripes were that those <a href="https://gizmodo.com/thunderbolts-jake-schreier-breaks-down-its-big-post-credits-scene-2000597900" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two after-credit scenes</a> weren’t worth missing the night bus home, and I wish the film had stuck to its escape-room-style opening act instead of veering into being <a href="https://aftermath.site/marvel-thunderbolts-movie-im-so-tired" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bog-standard Marvel movie</a>. The most annoying part of it is, it almost was the movie I was hoping for.</p><p><strong>Spoilers for the movie’s first act.</strong></p><p><em>Thunderbolts</em>’ premise is pretty straightforward — granted, I had to pick my brain to remember all the characters it threw into its cast to comprise its post-<em>Endgame</em> “<a href="https://x.com/MarvelStudios/status/1919425100853477455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Avengers</a>” like fumbling in your kitchen utility drawer, fishing for batteries you're sure must be there. Julia Louis-Dreyfus’ character is a shady government official on the verge of being impeached for her super-secret and highly illegal superhero experiments. To cover her tracks, she enlists a bunch of depressed stragglers plucked from various small marquee MCU projects: Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Natasha Romanoff’s depressed little sister from that <em>Black Widow</em> you couldn’t pay me to watch; John Walker (Wyatt Russel), the crash-out divorce court Captain America from <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em>, which bored me to tears; Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) from the second <em>Ant-Man</em> movie that barely registers in my memory banks; and Taskmaster (lol). Their mission is to bury the evidence stashed at the bottom of a bunker somewhere in a random desert.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Marvel Studios’ T̶h̶u̶n̶d̶e̶r̶b̶o̶l̶t̶s̶* #TheNewAvengers | &quot;She Wants Us Gone&quot; Official Clip" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TD1Htfj785Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>After a <a href="https://youtu.be/7X8yvwKHmR8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well-executed fight</a>, remarkably coherent despite Marvel’s tendency to cut action scenes like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by4UZ-79MK4&amp;pp=ygURbGlhbSBuZWVzYW4gZmVuY2U%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liam Neeson scrambling over a fence</a>, the team realizes they’re included among the evidence they were sent to get rid of. The <a href="https://aftermath.site/james-gunn-suicide-squad-dc-comics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suicide squad</a> on suicide watch then rally together to break out of the locked evidence room before a bomb detonates, shimmy their way out of a well by linking their elbows and walking up its walls <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFkd73G0fDI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Emperor’s New Groove</em>-style</a>, and hold their own against an incoming militia hell-bent on finishing the job.&nbsp;</p><p>In the chaos, they stumble upon a mysterious civilian named Bob, locked in a box in the now scorched evidence room. Of course, the trailers and months of casting blogs already revealed that Bob is Sentry, the film’s central villain. The crew assumes that his presence indicates that this is an escort mission on top of their escape room situation, until they’re forced to relive the darkest moments in their lives when he makes direct contact with them.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="ABSOLUTE CINEMA | MARVEL STUDIOS’ THUNDERBOLTS* | MAY 2" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bqnRzjPfb5A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Wouldn’t you know it, this Marvel movie had me leaning forward and fully engaged because, for once, it felt like a film. Twenty minutes into the movie, I started to believe Marvel wasn’t just throwing around indie-film buzzwords for the sake of marketing. That they leaned into boasting a cast from <em>Midsommar</em>, <em>A Different Man</em>, and <em>You Hurt My Feelings</em>; the writers and director of <em>Beef</em>; the cinematographer of <em>The Green Knight</em>; the production designer of <em>Hereditary</em>; the editor of <em>Minari; </em>and the composers of <em>Everything Everywhere All At Once</em>. With director Jake Schreier (Kendrick Lamar’s “<a href="https://youtu.be/eAR2V7PZiIQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We Cry Together</a>”) at the helm, Thunderbolts felt like it could be wildly different from middling Marvel slop I’d sat through before — less about an apocalyptic beam in the sky or widespread destruction of a metropolitan city, and more about the characters themselves through the underutilized escape room genre.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, there’s still fun with the movie, depending on your tolerance for David Harbour delivering non-sequiturs in a thick Russian accent as Red Guardian. But I couldn’t help slinking into my seat, frustrated at the missed potential for Marvel to pull a <em>WandaVision</em> by making an unconventional premise (for them) that I would’ve loved to have watched instead. Basically, I was deprived of viewing what I believe could’ve been Marvel’s version of <em>Cube </em>(1997).</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Cube (1997) - Trailer" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Esjc0rPj3K4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Cube</em>, directed by Vincenzo Natali, is a 1997 Canadian sci-fi horror film. It follows a group of strangers who wake up trapped in a mysterious maze of interconnected cube-shaped rooms. Despite being identical, each room has its <em>Saw</em>-like traps inside, leading the group to decipher each room’s deal, chart a safe course out of the maze, and keep their paranoia in check before they go postal and start killing each other out of frustration. One of my favorite scenes is when the ragtag group cleverly figures out they can spring traps by tossing a shoe into the rooms. Only, their pump fake isn’t foolproof because a guy gets a face full of acid and dies after doing the shoe trick. <em>Cube </em>rocks, and for a moment, I thought <em>Thunderbolts </em>was gearing up to channel that same energy until it didn’t. What makes the situation even more maddening for me is that Marvel was originally going to do something similar to my fan-crafted storyline, until it changed plans.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/marvel/598425/thunderbolts-original-script-changes-die-hard-breakfast-club-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polygon</a>, original <em>Thunderbolts </em>screenwriter Eric Pearson revealed that <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/how-depression-became-the-villain-of-thunderbolts.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the original scripts</a> for the movie saw it take on a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/what-is-a-bottle-episode-meaning.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bottle episode</a> approach where its characters would’ve done pretty much what I wanted them to do above, saying:&nbsp;</p><p>The notes I got toward the beginning were like, “Let’s make this contained and very grounded.” And when you throw out<em> Die Hard</em> in your movie pitch, everybody just latches onto that” So yeah, they’re in this deathtrap, and I think they got out more toward the end of the second act, as opposed to the midpoint.&nbsp;</p><p>But that was maybe the first one or two drafts. And then as we folded in Bucky, as we folded in Bob, it pretty quickly became the midpoint. And then when Jake came on, he really wanted a little bit of road-trippiness in the second half of act two. At some points, we had way too much road trip stuff going on, when the movie really should be gaining momentum. But [with early drafts] you’re trying out new ideas, and some of them are ridiculous. But you try ‘em out and you’re able to scrap ‘em and move on.</p><p>Despite Pearson admitting that his original take on the film wasn’t “very good,” he maintained that the core structure of the final film remained largely the same as his initial pitch — save for Marvel Studios head honcho Kevin Feige tagging on one note that the low-stakes MCU movie would ultimately tie into the film <a href="https://gizmodo.com/thunderbolts-gives-the-mcu-its-new-avengers-now-what-2000595218" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rebranding its team as the New Avengers</a>.</p><p>“And I was like, ‘Oh, okay, cool. That’s your problem for later. And if that’s the only note that you’re giving me from this, then hell yeah, I’m going to take the money and run, and go start writing this movie,’ Pearson told <em>Polygon</em>. “I’ve been in plenty of Marvel pitches. You don’t get out of them with one note very often.”</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>The more I dug into <em>Thunderbolt</em>’s production after watching it, the more frustrating it became knowing it had all the ingredients for a genuinely spectacular, refreshingly different Marvel movie baked into its DNA. Instead, <em>Thunderbolts</em> remains, well… a Marvel movie, though granted it's pretty decent. I wouldn’t go so far to celebrate it solely for being a triumphant return to form for the MCU, but it's definitely a competent film that even CinemaSins wouldn’t ding for having the basics: a well-structured script, poignant themes, legible action, a director with an actual vision, and music that isn’t an afterthought.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, the film is good in that Marvel way — a carefully calibrated, user-retention way. It’s the kind of structured reliability woven into every MCU entry, like jangling keys designed to keep kids and middle-aged men transfixed with what’s next instead of what’s right in front of them. That said, the last time a director dared to break convention was Sam Raimi’s <a href="https://gizmodo.com/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness-review-marv-1848869929" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness</em></a>, and it sent folks into hysterics over <a href="https://screenrant.com/doctor-strange-multiverse-madness-unpopular-opinions-reddit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how uncharacteristically non-superhero it was</a>. So my wishful thinking about <em>Thunderbolts</em> embracing its boldest instincts would never make it past Marvel’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/martin-scorsese-marvel.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assembly-line approach to filmmaking</a>.</p><p>Still, suppose I had Sentry’s power during <em>Thunderbolts</em>’ production. In that case, I’d channel my inner Lady Macbeth, whispering — or more likely, screaming — “<em>Cube</em>” into director Schrier’s ear until he commits to making <em>Thunderbolts </em>a bizarre, different, and bold escape room horror thriller, rather than barely getting away with coloring outside the lines of the Marvel formula.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hag-capisco-office-chair-ergonomic-review-sit-weird"><h3>The HÅG Capisco Is A Great Chair For People Who Sit Weird</h3></a><p>The HÅG Capisco 8106 is an icon, but what you do in it almost isn't sitting.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-terraria-collab-is-coming-this-summer-though-i-have-some-questions-about-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Crossovers! Collabs! Whatever you want to call them, love them or hate them, in an age where the biggest companies only seem interested in serving you the same thing over and over again, we're stuck with them. This time around, it's a bit of an odd one, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> is getting a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a>-themed update sometime this summer. Why Terraria? Genuinely no idea, I suppose they might appeal to a similarish kind of crowd, outside of that I haven't the foggiest.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Titled "Tides of Terraria" (is it particularly ocean-themed? Why? Terraria isn't exactly an ocean-focused game), the update will apparently let you "catch, train, fight, and work monsters from Terraria just like Pals...?" I would have put a question mark at the end of that copy too, because the whole thing sounds a bit absurd, but I suppose it's better than just a Terraria-themed gun or whatever. Aside from being described as "large", there aren't any other details on the Terraria aspect of the update.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/pocketpair">Pocketpair</a> say that there'll be other new Pals to catch and islands to explore in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game's Terraria update, but again, no more than that. "The contents of the update will be announced across official Palworld social media channels over the next few weeks, so please follow!" they wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/518587145533786079">Steam post</a> about the update.
</p>
<p>
It wasn't that long ago that Palworld received its last patch, which wasn't a particularly massive one. The thing it was noticeable for was technically removing a feature, specifically making it so that when you glide, instead of doing so with a Pal, you just do so with a regular, boring glider. In case you were wondering, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-newest-patch-stops-you-from-gliding-with-your-pals-and-yes-it-is-because-of-nintendos-lawsuit">this is because of Nintendo's lawsuit</a>, so you can thank Mario for this one.

Despite not being able to share any details about gameplay, Horii said, "I am making it, putting lots of work into it... I can only say that the next work will be great too, [I'm] working really hard." He also called for fans to remain excited for the future of the franchise: "Please look forward to it, is the only thing I can say." </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Quest 12: The Flames Of Fate - Official Title Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>With the game now very likely to launch after the release of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, Horii was asked if there are any plans for the new console, especially considering the franchise's past commercial successes on the original Switch. Although Horii is vague in the interview about what Dragon Quest properties might come to the new system, he mentioned, "I believe it could be compatible with Switch 2 as well." </p><p>Most of the specifics we know about Dragon Quest XII come from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-12-the-flames-of-fate-announced/1100-6492022/" data-ref-id="1100-6492022">Horii's statements from around the time of its original announcement</a> four years ago. He shared that the game is meant to provide players more options and more choices with how to play, and that Square Enix will be significantly changing the franchise's command battle system. </p><p>While Dragon Quest XII may be a ways off, fans of the series still have something to look forward to this year: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preorders-are-live-at-amazon/1100-6530455/" data-ref-id="1100-6530455">Dragon Quest I + II HD-2D preorders are now live</a> and will launch later in 2025. This remake follows up last year's release of Dragon Quest III HD-2D.</p>

The game was originally slated to release this year but Skydance New Media, the studio developing the game, has announced it will instead come out some time in early 2026. </p><div><p>“Taking this additional time will allow us to add more polish,” Skydance <a href="https://x.com/SkydanceGames/status/1922275645402337325">wrote of the delay on their X account</a>. </p></div><div><p><em>Marvel 1943</em> was first teaseed in 2021 as the first project under Skydance New Media, a new gaming initiative spearheaded by parent company studio Skydance Media known for films like <em>Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning</em>.

We have one brief trailer from the game, released during last year’s state of Unreal address but no other details. Skydance New Media is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/19/23031936/star-wars-amy-hennig-naughty-dog-skydance-new-media">also working on a <em>Star Wars</em> game.</a></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Like many other free-to-play games in 2025, you can play the game and earn free rewards during each season as part of the active battle pass or spend some money (or in-game currency) to unlock a premium version of the pass that offers more rewards. However, unlike in most other games, once you buy a pass in <em>Rivals </em>you’re free to unlock its rewards whenever you want. But each pass is only available for a certain amount of time and if you don’t buy it during that window, then you can’t go back later and earn missing rewards. That’s changing this week, which is nice. Less nice is that costs are going up for these old passes. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250513/40954_1233900.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250513/40954_1233900.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As announced on May 13</a></span>, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is bringing back the very first battle pass from the game’s initial “Season 0.” However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Chronovium_(Battle_Pass)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Chronovium_(Battle_Pass)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Season 0 pass back at launch only cost 490 Lattice</a></span>. When it returns on May 15 it will cost 590 Lattice. That’s a jump from about $5 to roughly $6. The old pass will only be available for two weeks and will go away again on May 29. And there will not be a free option when it returns. So if you want any of the rewards, you’ll have to pay. </p><p>NetEase says that future passes might return, though they will not be back until at least two seasons have elapsed since their debut and the passes will cost 20 percent more when they return. </p><p>The first season in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-emma-frost-invisible-woman-dagger-blondes-1851774781&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-emma-frost-invisible-woman-dagger-blondes-1851774781"><em>Rivals</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>was short—just four weeks long—and happened over the holidays, so many players didn’t have a chance to get the first battle pass, which contains some great skins for Punisher, Black Panther, and Mantis. So it’s nice that its coming back and I’m happy to hear that all battle passes will seemingly be returning after a few months. But the price increase is shitty. Charging more for the same content, which is now months old, is gross and also means more players might be willing to buy a premium pass in future seasons to avoid higher costs later. Basically, <em>Rivals </em>has introduced some more FOMO despite the battle pass system actually being pretty nice. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The show stars Marvel's Zoe Saldana as a CIA officer who heads up the <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a44619029/special-ops-lioness-true-story/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Lioness" program of female operators. </a></p><p>Senior producer Philippe Ducharme, meanwhile, said he was a big fan of Oscar-nominated director Alex Garland's 2023 war movie, Civil War, which followed a team of journalists covering a new American civil war. "Some of the things that we're pushing [in this game], the film is actually a good reference," Ducharme said.</p><p>Campos-Oriola said a guiding theme for the Battlefield 6 campaign is exploring the concept of "talented but ordinary people put in extraordinary situations."</p><p>"That creates a very interesting dynamic in terms of relationships with other people. These are elements we're looking to capture in the single player," the developer said.</p><p>EA Motive previously developed the 2023 Dead Space remake, and Ducharme said that game is "obviously very different" from Battlefield. However, the Ducharme said the idea was to explore the "curve of tension" of the "highs and the lows to keep players hooked."</p><p>In addition to the campaign, Battlefield 6 will of course have a substantial multiplayer element, and DICE is returning to develop it.

However, if you don't have the accessories to look after all those cards, well, it's bad news. </p><p id="tldr-best-accessories"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="TL;DR: Best Accessories">TL;DR: These Are the Best Pokémon Card Accessories</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's nothing wrong with cheap deck boxes and relying on penny sleeves for bulk and budget decks; we all have to start somewhere. But as soon as trainers start putting more money behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-glory-of-team-rocket-single-prices-crashed-japanese">chase cards</a>, pulling gem mint cards, or investing in new sets like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-destined-rivals-preorder-guide-2025">Destined Rivals</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-where-to-buy">Black Bolt, and White Flare</a>, they must protect what they have. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are some great products I've found to do just that. From pre-grading your cards to affordable play mats for trainers, I've got you covered with decent products that will protect your collection for years to come.</p><p id="deck-boxes"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Deck Boxes">Best Pokémon Card Deck Boxes</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these deck boxes are felt lined and made of solid materials to protect your decks. If you're like me and double sleeve your cards, all of these deck boxes have the room to fit a full 60 card deck and change.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/pxl-20250506-071623765-1746515818077.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">My premium deck box cases - Credit: Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some even hold multiple decks and dice, which is very cool for someone like me who looks way too much into these things. The one I use holds three double-sleeved decks, has a dice drawer with felt lining and even features a faux leather Pokéball design. Perfection.</p><p id="grading-accessories"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Grading Accessories">Best Pokémon Card Grading Accessories</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It can cost upwards of $20 to get a single card graded, which is worth it if the Pokémon card is in awesome condition and worth a lot. But grading companies look at your cards down to a microscopic level to check for dints, scratches and other imperfections. You'll also need to penny sleeve then pop cards in a semi rigid sleeve or they won't accept them. If you're looking to get your cards graded, these are some of the accessories we'd recommend. </p><p id="display-options"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Display Options">Best Pokémon Card Display Options</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Magnetic card holders are a cheap way to display Pokémon cards on a shelf or stand without forking out a fortune to have all of your cards graded.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/pxl-20250504-163911753-1746515519420.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">My magnetic card holders, acrylic shelving with LED lighting - Credit: Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I personally use acrylic shelving and LED strips to really make my collection pop. If you want your card holders to stand up straight there's also a couple of options for acrylic stands too. It really doesn't have to break the bank to make those illustration rares shine.</p><p id="storage"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Storage">Best Pokémon Card Storage</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Going to a card show with some trades? They'll be something here for you. Want to display your grails in a nice looking cabinet? I've got you covered there too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/pxl-20250504-164349344-mp-1746515590684.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">My cardboard card organizer - Image Credit: Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ripping packs is awesome, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trading-card-storage-ideas">storing all that bulk</a> for a deck-building session isn't. Our recommendations include everything from basic cardboard boxes with rows and dividers to foam-padded storage boxes with enough room for graded and top-loaded cards. </p><p id="card-sleeves"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Card Sleeves">Best Pokémon Card Sleeves</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no good buying these cases, binders and deckboxes without card sleeves. If you like a card or pull anything holo, sleeve it. I personally like the "Perfect Fit" sleeves as they still fit in magnetic card holders, standard and penny sleeves. Double the protection, infinite peace of mind. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't build a deck without double sleeving cards. It's just a good habit to get into, especially if you're rocking all shiny energies and higher-end ex cards.</p><p id="binders"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Binders">Best Pokémon Card Binders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Binders are one of the cheapest ways to store your Pokémon cards, and it beats any art or coffee table book for casual browsing. All of these binders are double-sided with nine pockets on each side. One even has four front windows to showcase those banger chase cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just don't forget to sleeve your cards before putting them in. I'm a big fan of good binder behaviour and will 100% judge you otherwise.</p><p id="playmats"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Playmats">Best Pokémon Playmats</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I recently found my original Pokémon TCG playmat from when the base set released. It's literally a bit of fabric so I put a playmat underneath anyway, but how retro is this!? God bless that broken Professor Oak trainer card.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/pixel-9-2025-05-06t080928-872-1746515374018.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">My very first Pokémon TCG playmat from 1999 - Credit: Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're playing Pokémon TCG, you need a playmat, end of story. You can double-sleeve your all-shiny deck and have a felt-lined deck box all day long, but slamming cards onto hard surfaces is going to deck your deck. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You might notice that some of these playmats are actually mouse pads; that's because they're pretty much the same thing. Just do what I do: Pick a cool design and roll with it. </p><p id="latest-stock-updates"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Latest Stock Updates">Pokémon TCG: Latest Stock Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've dedicated your life to pulling chase cards yourself, here's what we can find <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-may-12-2025">in stock right now</a>. Just watch out for pricing over MSRP, as we Pokémon trainers are in a weird spot right now, so don't pay more than what you have to, or consider buying single cards instead of gambling on overpriced ETBs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever you decide, make sure you're having fun!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/card-marketplace-tcgplayer-offering-store-credit-promotion-on-may-16<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">All products purchased across the site will earn at least 10% in store credit.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Trading card marketplace TCGplayer is holding a special Mayhem promotion soon, where all purchases on the site will earn you at least 10% back as store credit. The offer will be available only from 9 a.m. ET to 11 p.m. ET on May 16, so you’ll need to plan ahead to take advantage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve never used TCGplayer before, it’s an online marketplace where sellers can post listings for all kinds of trading cards. You can buy specific cards or sealed products like bundles and booster packs, so there are options for established collectors or newcomers looking to build their first deck. Plus, you can preorder upcoming releases, including the anticipated collaboration between Magic: The Gathering and Final Fantasy (more on that in a bit).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are thousands of sellers on the platform with listings across an expansive list of games. That includes <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961055/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Magic: The Gathering</u></a>, Pokémon (in both <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961056/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>English</u></a> and <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961058/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Japanese</u></a>), <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961059/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Yu-Gi-Oh!</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961060/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Digimon</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961062/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Flesh and Blood</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961065/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Disney Lorcana</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961066/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>One Piece</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961068/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Dragon Ball Super</a>, and lots more. There are dozens in all, with a detailed filtering system that lets you specifically search for what you’re looking for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, let’s say you’re looking for Magic: The Gathering cards. You can select that as your product line, then further filters open up based on that line. So if you’re only interested in a particular color, you can specify that. Or if you want to see what’s available from a particular set, you can do that too. You can also filter by card type (like creature, sorcery, instant, etc.).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every product line has its own unique filters. So for Pokémon cards, you can see holofoil listings. For Yu-Gi-Oh!, you can see 1st Editions and Unlimited cards. For Disney Lorcana, you can see cold foils. You get the idea. Or if you’re on the hunt for a specific card, you can bypass all those filters and just type the card’s name in the search bar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For every card or pack in the shop, you’ll see how much the cheapest listing costs, how many total listings there are of that item, and the current market price of it. The market price is based on the history of completed transactions for that item. When you click on the item, you can see more information about the history of its market price and look at the prices and card quality of every available listing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All products on TCGplayer (other than gift cards) will be eligible for the store credit promotion from 9 a.m. ET to 11 p.m. ET on May 16. There are no limitations based on price, card type, or anything else. The timing might seem a little restrictive, but you can prepare beforehand by putting items in your cart and waiting to check out during the promotional period. That still counts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everybody who checks out during that 14-hour period will get a base return of 10% of the purchase price. Existing TCGplayer subscribers — or anyone who subscribes before they make a qualified purchase during the Mayhem promotion — will get a base return of 12% plus an additional return based on how long they’ve been subscribed. This means if you <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961277/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>subscribe during the promo</u></a>, you can get 13% back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we mentioned earlier, there are preorder listings for upcoming releases, and they’re also eligible for the store credit promotion. That includes:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2960906/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Magic: The Gathering’s collaboration with Final Fantasy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2960907/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Pokémon Destined Rivals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2960908/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Yu-Gi-Oh!

If a product doesn’t arrive by its estimated delivery date or isn’t in the expected condition, TCGplayer will work with you and the seller to deliver a replacement. If that’s not possible, then you can get a partial or full refund. If you suspect an item you received is counterfeit, you can submit a claim with the customer service team and receive a full refund if your item is deemed to be counterfeit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to check out everything on offer, you can head over to TCGplayer right now to get started. Remember, you can add things to your cart now, but wait to check out until the promotional period on May 16 is happening.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Right now Amazon has Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Gaming graphics cards in stock starting at $899.99 shipped. Inventory is reserved for Amazon Prime members only.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also for a limited time, you'll get a free voucher for the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> game with purchase. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/campaigns/doom-the-dark-ages-rtx-bundle/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Nvidia</a>, the version you'll receive is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-doom-the-dark-ages">Premium edition</a> that retails for $99.99.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU in Stock on Amazon</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Amazon Prime members only for some models</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although the MSRP for these cards range from $899.99 to $999.99, a reference GeForce RTX 5070 Ti card is actually <em>supposed</em> to sell for $750. More advanced cooling designs, a more uncommon colorway, or overclocking out of the box add to the cost, but even then, admittedly, these cards are still priced higher than what Nvidia originally advertised.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reality is that even third party manufacturers like Gigabyte, MSI, Asus (and pretty much everyone else) are also taking advantage of the high demand by marking prices up from the get-go. Unfortunately, you'd be hard pressed to find another RTX 5070 Ti GPU for this price or less. <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7Evpn?object_uuid=11b2045e-4487-40cd-a8c9-3ebe3097ad25&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RTX 5070 Ti GPUs are generally selling for over $1,000 on eBay</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The RTX 5070 Ti GPU Has Excellent 4K Gaming Performance</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Of all the Blackwell cards released thus far, the RTX 5070 Ti offers the best bang for your buck, especially when pitted against the previous generation GPUs. It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and already marginalizes the RTX 5080, which is only about 10%-15% faster but costs 33% more. This GPU is capable of high framerates in nearly all games, even at 4K resolution with ray tracing enabled. Heck, even if you plan on using this card for AI, the RTX 5070 Ti might be the better value than the RTX 50870 since both are equipped with the same 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

                <p>Following the announcement of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> last month, many players remarked on how similar it looks to the original Switch. Especially compared to the jump between the Wii U and the Switch--or even the Wii and Wii U--the Switch to Switch 2 transition is more iterative than revolutionary, at least in terms of the form factor. From recent comments <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250509e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in an investor call</a>, Nintendo itself is aware of this, and it stresses that the Switch 2's hardware has been built "from the ground up."</p><p>Responding to a question about the Switch 2's apparent lack of generational change, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa acknowledged that "it may appear that there is not a major change between Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch." However, Furukawa told investors that the Switch 2 was designed as a full new console, not beholden to the hardware of the original Switch. "We have created new hardware and accessories from the ground up," Furukawa said, "and these are products very characteristic of Nintendo, packed full of our development team's dedication to quality through various creative efforts and integrated hardware-software development."</p>

<p>Furukawa also explained that the Switch 2 is meant to allow Nintendo to continue innovating in gameplay and software. He noted that the original Switch's processing power has become an obstacle for game developers working with the platform. "Over the course of these eight years and counting," he stated, "it has become necessary to increase hardware processing performance in order for software developers to realize one of Nintendo's most valued tenets: offering new gameplay experiences. Thus, this time we decided to design the hardware with enhanced processing capability."</p><p>During the earnings call, Nintendo executives additionally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-nintendo-warns-of-substantial-negative-impact-from-tariffs/1100-6531512/" data-ref-id="1100-6531512">addressed the looming threat of tariffs</a>, mentioning that US tariff policy could cost the company tens of millions of dollars in forecasted revenue. This number may shift in light of continued changes in US trade policy, but Nintendo has been open about how the uncertainty caused by trade shifts have impacted the company's plans for the Switch 2 launch.</p><p>Switch 2 launches on June 5, and preorders are underway. The console costs considerably more than its predecessor, a change that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-price-could-affect-early-adoption-nintendo-says/1100-6531493/" data-ref-id="1100-6531493">Nintendo has said may pose an obstacle for widespread early adoption</a>. Despite this, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2 preorders quickly sold out at US merchants</a>, and there is no indication yet of when there might be a restock.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fbc-firebreak-is-getting-a-closed-technical-test-letting-a-lucky-few-try-out-its-oddball-fps-stylings<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> is a bit of a departure from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/remedy-entertainment">Remedy's</a> usual games, given that it's a three-player multiplayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">first-person shooter</a>. The shooty bit is nothing new, that's pretty typical of Remedy's games, even if the shooting always has something slightly off about it. It's the multiplayer angle that sets it apart, and, funnily enough, the fact that Remedy don't always make shooting feel all that great, so it's left me curious as to how it actually plays. I'm assuming some of you feel the same way, and there's some sort of good news: you can sign-up to playtest it this week.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, big asterisk here. Remedy notes that "due to the limited capacity of this Closed Technical Test, a sign-up does not guarantee access," meaning I would like it if you don't leave a comment blaming me for getting you all excited. That's just the way these tests go, I don't make the rules! 
</p>
<p>
You might want to get yourself signed-up soon though, the test kicks off in a couple of days on May 15th at 6am PDT / 9am EDT / 2pm BST / 4pm EEST. It'll then run until May 19th, 1:59pm PDT / 4:59pm EDT / 9:59pm BST / 11:59pm EEST, so you'll have a good few days to try it out. The test will be available on PC, of course, as well as those strange things called "consoles" I've heard so much about, like the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Oh, and you can sign-up right <a href="https://firebreak.firstlook.gg/signup/tech-test-may-2025">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
If FBC: Firebreak has somehow flown under your radar, and if it's looking a bit familiar, that's because it's a spinoff of Control (the FBC in its name standing for Federal Bureau of Control). The game is set after the events of the original Control, meaning the Bureau is still having to deal with all the Hiss and weird nonsense that goes on there. Think <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>, but in Remedy's universe. A strong concept honestly!
</p>
<p>
Not long to go until it's out either, as the game is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedys-co-op-shooter-fbc-firebreak-will-release-this-june">slated for a June 17th release</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/doom-the-dark-ages-is-surprisingly-playable-on-the-steam-deck/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>While working on our review of <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> last week, I was unable to test the game on the Steam Deck due to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1kijszt/no_doom_the_dark_ages_does_not_run_on_steam_deck/">a bug that prevented it from launching</a> on SteamOS. I didn't consider this much of a loss at the time, since I figured the Deck's 3-year-old portable hardware was rated way below the <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specs">minimum PC specs for the game</a>, which call for ray tracing-capable graphics cards at a minimum.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, though, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/529846144626329378">Valve released a preview build of a new version of SteamOS</a> that allows <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> to actually launch on the Steam Deck. And after a bit of testing, I found the game is surprisingly playable on Valve's portable hardware, provided you're prepared to turn down the graphics settings.</p>
<p>With all the graphical quality sliders set to "Low" (and FSR upscaling set to "Performance"), I was able to run <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> at the system's native 1280×800 resolution and a reasonably steady 30 to 40 fps.</p>


<p>Sure, the lack of fancy lighting effects was definitely a step down after enjoying "High" graphical settings on an Nvidia GTX 2080 TI-powered PC rig last week. And we'd prefer to run a reflex-based shooter at the Steam Deck's maximum 60 Hz frame rate (or even more on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/review-steam-deck-oleds-brilliant-screen-fixes-the-portables-biggest-flaw/">the Steam Deck OLED</a>).</p>
<p>Still, the fact that a ray tracing-forward game like this runs at all on the relatively underpowered Steam Deck hardware feels like something of a miracle these days. We can only imagine an "Ultra Low" graphics setting designed specifically for the Steam Deck could squeeze an even better frame rate out of the system, if Bethesda decided to make it a priority.</p>

<p>This effort is just the first of what the companies describe as a series of "co-branded marketing promotions" throughout Ubisoft's catalogue of games. They also stated that "select" Visa cardholders in Europe and the UK can expect Ubisoft+ promotions, game codes, and other exclusives.</p><p>This partnership comes in the wake of a turbulent year for Ubisoft. The video game publisher has gone through <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">several rounds of layoffs and budget contractions</a>, and some of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210">its high-profile efforts like XDefiant are shutting down</a>. This year, Ubisoft re-emphasized <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-doubles-down-on-open-world-and-live-service-games/1100-6529497/" data-ref-id="1100-6529497">its commitment to live-service games like Just Dance and open-world franchises like Assassin's Creed</a>, then <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/" data-ref-id="1100-6530434">created a subsidiary</a> to oversee and incorporate new funding for Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/summer-games-fest-website-geoff-keighley-polygon-palestine<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Summer Geoff Fest is less than a month away, and you know what that means: It is once again time to turn our attention to <a href="http://summergamesfest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">summergamesfest.com</a>, a URL of a common typo – the event is for some reason called Summer <em>Game </em>Fest, not Summer Games Fest – with a mysterious owner and <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-games-fest-website-geoff-keighley-taco" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a half-decade-long history of activism and cheese puffs</a>. This year, it’s looking a little different than last year.</p><p>As of this publishing, the URL redirects to <a href="https://haunts.neocities.org/polygon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Neocities page</a> that pays respects to Polygon and implores visitors to support both independent media – including Aftermath dot site – and laid-off Polygon writers, linking to their profiles as well as <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-polygon-workers-and-the-vox-media-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Vox Media Union’s GoFundMe</a> for them.</p><p>“I don't work in the games industry and don't even really play video games (aside from neopets),” the Polygon support page’s creator, a comic illustrator named Kaylee Rowena, wrote in a disclaimer on the page. “I've just enjoyed the work of folks at Polygon for many years &amp; want to give them some support and solidarity where I can. Workers of the world unite.”</p><p>But what has the mysterious owner of the summergamesfest.com URL, who did <em>not </em>make the Polygon support page, been up to for the past year? That’s where things get a little weirder. When we last checked in on summergamesfest.com during June of 2024, it redirected to <a href="https://donate.unrwa.org/int/en/gaza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a donation page</a> from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). Based on a scant few Wayback Machine snapshots, it appears to have stayed this way for the whole summer.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, in September 2024, for at least a couple days, the summergamesfest.com URL began redirecting to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/insiderthre.at/post/3l3tsgqcxbf2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Bluesky post</a> from Epic Games senior trust and safety investigations manager Bruce Knapik that reads “Bet you thought I was joking.” There is no further context for this comment; it follows a seemingly <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/insiderthre.at/post/3l3mbbfq4il26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unrelated post about pro wrestling</a> and precedes <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/insiderthre.at/post/3l4cta4xw7d22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another</a> about Bluesky informing Knapik that he was the platform’s 850,339th user. They are all days apart.&nbsp;</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Knapik to ask the obvious question: Are you the person who owns the URL?</p><p>“[If I remember correctly] I linked to that post as an accompaniment to a bullet point of ‘webmaster of summergamesfest.com’ on an introduce-yourself-to-the-team presentation at work,” Knapik told Aftermath. “But yeah, that’s me.”&nbsp;</p><p>Knapik explained that he snapped up the URL in 2020, around an hour after Keighley went live with the name of his now-ubiquitous E3 replacement.&nbsp;</p><p>"At that time, I was on a spree of registering goofy domains,” Knapik said, “and it just happened I was prescient enough to think '[the name of the event] should maybe be games.'"&nbsp;</p><p>(He’s right! It should be “games!” I’ve spoken to high-profile industry figures who still accidentally call it Summer Games Fest! Because there is more than one game!)</p><p>Occasional pre-orchestrated bits such as a short-lived <a href="https://x.com/giantbomb/status/1668787755114012672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaboration with Giant Bomb</a> last year aside, Knapik has mostly just enjoyed causing random online passersby to stumble into oddball humor and, at the other end of the spectrum, legitimately important causes.</p><p>"Overall, it’s just been a sounding board for silliness or things I think it would be nice if people stumbled onto/knew about,” he said. “It’s nice to have that kind of… megaphone? When you feel strongly about, and have a high degree of confidence in, your convictions.”</p><p>Despite the joy summergamesfest.com has brought Knapik, he would sell it to Geoff Keighley if approached with a “reasonable” offer.</p><p>"I think I’ve managed to keep the jokes in good fun – and avoid any actual brand confusion – so I don’t think he’d feel a heavy desire to go out of his way to make [an offer],” said Knapik. “No one’s ever attempted to actually contact me about it, to my knowledge.”</p><p>But if the right wealthy and/or evil benefactor came along, he would at least consider it.</p><p>"I’d probably never sell it to anyone but Geoff,” said Knapik, “but who knows what I’d say if a dipshit loser offered me $44 billion to let him kill it and use its corpse for fascist ventriloquism."&nbsp;</p><p>Many assumed that the original images on the summergamesfest.com page, variations on a plate of cheese puffs and a Dorito-orange taco shell with what <em>appeared </em>to be a hotdog in it, were a veiled reference to Keighley’s pre-Game Awards <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dorito-pope" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Dorito Pope” legacy</a>. But that is, in fact, not the case.</p><p>"The original images were part of a triptych I made for an extremely narrow joke, where I pre-empted the weekly 'Friday Food Facts!' local food news email that Epic’s office manager would send and sent one with an identical subject line just to [another Epic employee],” Knapik said.</p><p>Also, it’s not a hot dog.</p><p>"The taco shell contains a Beddar With Cheddar sausage," Knapik said. "I expect a retraction of last year’s – to be frank (ugh), libelous – assertion it was a 'hot dog.'"</p><p>We regret the error.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/thunderbolts-marvel-avengers-cube-escape-room"><h3>Thunderbolts* Could Have Been Marvel’s Cube</h3></a><p>It could have been an escape room movie starring Florence Pugh, but we got New Avengers instead

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/return-to-actuality-with-invisible-sun-electric-and-indigo-by-monte-cook-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Monte Cook Games has launched another Invisible Sun crowdfunding campaign: Invisible Sun: Electric and Indigo. The campaign includes another physical printing of the surreal fantasy TTRPG, a new supplement, and official VTT support.</p>

<h2>The <em>Invisible Sun: Electric and Indigo</em> Backerkit Campaign</h2>

<p>According to its Backerkit campaign page, <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/monte-cook-games/invisible-sun-indigo" rel="nofollow"><em>Invisible Sun: Electric and Indigo</em></a> contains two new products for Monte Cook Games' iconic, acclaimed TTRPG.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/invisible-sun-electric-and-indigo-game-box-artwork.jpg?itok=bmqmciZe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/invisible-sun-electric-and-indigo-game-box-artwork.jpg?itok=L7-fex-9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first of these products is <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em>. This is a re-envisioned version of the physical game with redesigned books and game pieces. If you own a copy of the game via the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/invisible-sun-return-of-black-cube-live-now-on-backerkit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Return of the Black Cube</a> campaign, you already have everything you need to play. Furthermore, the campaign includes the Vislae Companion, a book meant to give players a primer of the setting and gameplay basics.</p>

<p>The campaign's FAQ page further explains the difference between <em>Indigo</em> and the Black Cube. For <em>Indigo</em>, all core rulebooks are softcover, The Path of Suns is a mat instead of a game board, and the elaborate Testament of the Suns is gone. This was done to make <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em> a more affordable version of the game. This is reflected in this campaign's (slightly) lower prices compared to the last campaign.</p>

<p>For those already familiar with the game, <em>Invisible Sun: Electric and Indigo</em> includes a new sourcebook. Titled, <em>The Electric Sun</em>, it details a new emerging form of magic and its effect on the planes of existence beyond our own. It includes new magic, new characters, and new prewritten adventures.</p>

Full game support, including compendium, character sheets, cards, and more, will be coming both to Roll20 and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/alchemy-rpg-vtts-and-focus-on-roleplaying" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alchemy</a>. Considering how complex and dense this RPG is, the introduction of VTT support considerably lowers the barrier to entry for new players.</p>

<p>The different pledge levels for the campaign are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>The Electric Sun (Digital) for $19:</strong> A PDF of <em>The Electric Sun</em> supplement</li>
	<li><strong>Invisible Sun: Indigo (Digital) for $35:</strong> A PDF of <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em></li>
	<li><strong>Electric and Indigo (Digital) for $50:</strong> PDFs of both <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em> and <em>The Electric Sun</em> supplement</li>
	<li><strong>Invisible Sun: Indigo VTT for $80:</strong> Access to <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em> on either Roll20 or Alchemy</li>
	<li><strong>The Electric Sun for $54:</strong> Physical and PDF copies of <em>The Electric Sun</em> supplement</li>
	<li><strong>Invisible Sun: Indigo for $179:</strong> Physical and PDF copies of <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em></li>
	<li><strong>Electric and Indigo for $199:</strong> Physical and PDF copies of <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em> and <em>The Electric Sun</em> supplement</li>
	<li><strong>The Breadth of the Actuality for $287:</strong> Everything in the Electric and Indigo pledge level, digital and physical game props and character tokens, a Testament of Suns, a set of physical Wicked Keys, and five Vislae Companion books</li>
</ul><p>Lastly, the <em>Invisible Sun: Electric and Indigo</em> campaign addresses how the company will address trade tariffs. Simply put, Monte Cook Games will be decentralizing the production of their products in areas not subject to tariffs. The books will be printed in Canada, the games will be assembled in the US, etc.. Lastly, potential tariff costs have already been factored into the pledge tiers.</p>

<p>Essentially, Monte Cook are they are doing everything possible to address these unwelcome costs to production with this campaign and are maintaining transparency with their users. Given the stated intention of <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em> to provide a cheaper experience, this makes sense.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the Backerkit campaign has raised $135,999, overtaking its funding goal of $100,000. The campaign ends June 5.</p>

But, just to keep it real simple, Sciel uses a double-sided scythe for a melee weapon. There are actually really heartbreaking reasons for that, but in context, it does mean that despite everything else, she’s still got some powerful melee capabilities you can and should take advantage of. In particular, though, one of her bread-and-butter abilities, Sealed Fate, will depend on what element and what weapon you’ve got equipped, so more than some of the others, you still wanna choose her main weapon wisely, and not just for max Attack power.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Gustave In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>The main reason for that is because the vast majority of her abilities cast some form of Dark energy. She and, later, Monoco are the only ones who have consistent access to Dark skills, and given how rare it is for enemies to have a defense against it, that makes her innately pretty useful. But, of course, that’s the tip of the iceberg.</p><figure id="" data-id="dde9b0da41846bcb936995c0dfbb55cd" data-recommend-id="image://dde9b0da41846bcb936995c0dfbb55cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sciel chooses from her abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sciel chooses from her abilities." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dde9b0da41846bcb936995c0dfbb55cd" data-recommend-id="image://dde9b0da41846bcb936995c0dfbb55cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sciel chooses from her abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h983987"><a id="foretell"></a>Special mechanic: Foretell and Twilight</h2><p>And now, the feature presentation: Sciel’s tutorial <em>technically</em> tells players all they need to know to use the Foretell system, but it sucks at telling you how to use it effectively. And you can see why, given how easy it is for Sciel to become Death, Destroyer of Worlds with the right loadout. </p><p>So, there’s actually two special mechanics going on here. The first is Foretell. <strong>Think of Sciel’s Foretell cards like they’re little sticky bombs. You can stick a maximum of 10 onto an enemy, and whenever you’re ready, you can Consume them</strong>, which detonates some or all of them for additional damage. Obviously, you want a full payload of 10, and to hopefully not waste too many turns getting there. </p><p>The second is the Twilight mechanic. Each of Sciel’s skills is coded as either a Light or Dark skill, noted by the little sun and moon icons in the upper right of the descriptions in the menus. Using a skill generates a card with either a Sun or Moon on it. <strong>Once you’ve generated at least one Sun card and one Moon card, Sciel enters Twilight mode, which increases damage by 50%, but also doubles the amount of Foretell you can slap onto an enemy from 10 to 20</strong>. That damage increase actually goes up by 25% for every card of one type you generate before generating the opposite card to enter Twilight (i.e. adding multiple Sun cards before generating a Moon and vice versa). </p><p>It’s not a hard mechanic to grasp, but the trickiness mostly comes in the fact that the skill descriptions get very <em>Magic the Gathering</em> real fast, and especially when you’re just getting acclimated, they’re throwing a LOT at you. </p><figure id="" data-id="9636e95121a58a459fefb69cac01f647" data-recommend-id="image://9636e95121a58a459fefb69cac01f647" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Sciel's combat options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows Sciel's combat options." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9636e95121a58a459fefb69cac01f647" data-recommend-id="image://9636e95121a58a459fefb69cac01f647" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Sciel's combat options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h983988"><a id="builds"></a>Recommended builds and synergies</h2><p>We could honestly be here all day with this one.

It’s the best go-to trigger for Twilight once you’ve got your cards stacked. It’s right next to Phantom Blade on the Skills tree, so you can grab it early on; it does a pretty absurd amount of damage for only a fourAP cost. Pair it with the Critical Burn or Critical Break Picto/Lumina, and you’ve basically taken a chainsaw to a massive chunk of every enemy’s lifebar.The main thing to remember is that it does attack using your weapon’s element, so be aware if your opponent’s immune so you don’t wind up healing your enemy for thousands of points like a dumbass. And oh yeah, if you think that Skill hurts enemies now, once you’re actually in Twilight, Sealed Fate can be an absolute wrecking ball, especially once you’ve got the enemy up to 20 Foretell. Once you’ve unlocked Gradient Attacks, drop this right after Shadow Bringer, and watch enemies melt away. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Lune In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>While this is just a guide to get you started, it is worth noting just how much the game can and will change once you’ve got stuff like Fortune’s Fate in your back pocket. Also, when you’re finally brave enough to take down the colossal Sprong enemy hanging out in the southwestern part of the map, he’ll drop the Cheater Picto, allowing you to take two turns in a row, and putting that thing on Sciel makes her an absolute monster in terms of building up high Twilight percentages fast. If you go that route—and should—just make sure she has a skill that can trigger a Break, because she can get an enemy there <em>fast</em>. </p><hr><p><br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> is launching in early June amid ongoing drama and uncertainty about tariffs, and now Nintendo has put a dollar amount to how much of a negative impact it's forecasting as a result.</p><p>Speaking to analysts and investors as part of <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250509e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the company's latest earnings briefing</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said Nintendo has factored in a negative impact of "several tens of billions of yen at the profit level." Ten billion yen equals about $67 million, so it's not a small amount.</p><p>Furukawa said Nintendo is basing this off the US tariff rates effective April 10. It's now mid-May, and things have developed since then. Just recently, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-us-switzerland-tariffs-negotiations-b3f5174d086e39b2522ab848ddad9372" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the US and China reached an agreement</a> that sees the US drop its previous 145% tariff rate on China down to 30%, with China lowering its rate on the US from 125% to 10%. This deal is set to last for 90 days, which would take it beyond the Switch 2 release date.</p><p>Given Nintendo's forecast was based on what the tariff rate was on April 10, there might be different calculations going on at Nintendo now that tariffs on goods from China have been lowered massively. This has been a fluid situation for Nintendo and many other companies bringing in goods to the US from China (Switch 2 consoles are manufactured in China, Vietnam, and Cambodia).</p><p>Furukawa made these comments during Nintendo's latest earnings briefing on May 8, and the English translation was not posted until today, May 13. The US and China announced their joint trade deal on May 12.</p><p>Furukawa went on to say that the Switch 2 is expected to have a lower profit margin that the original Switch, which has been on sale since 2017.</p><p>"Our basic policy is that for any country or region, if tariffs are imposed, we recognize them as a part of the cost and incorporate them into the price. However, this year marks our first new dedicated video game system launch in eight years, so given our unique situation, our priority is to maintain the momentum of our platforms, which is extremely important for our dedicated video game platform business, and to rapidly expand the install base of our new hardware," Furukawa said.</p><p>The executive added that if there are further changes to tariff policies for China and other markets, Nintendo would consider "what kind of price adjustments would be appropriate," if any.</p><p>For context, Nintendo is <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">projecting</a> 320 billion yen in operating profit and 380 billion yen in ordinary profit for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026, along with 300 billion yen in profit attributable to owners of parent.</p><p>For the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fiscal year that ended March 31, 2024</a>, Nintendo made an operating profit of 528.9 billion yen, an ordinary profit of 680.5 billion yen, and 490.6 billion yen in profit attributable to owners of parent. <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">For the fiscal year that ended March 31, 2025</a>, Nintendo made an operating profit of 282.5 billion yen, an ordinary profit of 372.3 billion yen, and 278.8 billion in profit attributable to owners of parent.</p><p>Nintendo is expecting to sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-how-many-switch-2-consoles-it-expects-to-sell-during-its-first-year/1100-6531389/" data-ref-id="1100-6531389">15 million Switch 2 units during the current fiscal year that ends March 31, 2026</a>, and that's about the same as the original Switch over its first 10 months in the market. Furukawa said the Switch 2's "relatively high" price compared to the original Switch--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/" data-ref-id="2900-5761">it's $50 more expensive with inflation factored in</a>--represents one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-price-could-affect-early-adoption-nintendo-says/1100-6531493/" data-ref-id="1100-6531493">"challenges to early adoption"</a> of the system.</p><p>"The limits of our hardware production capacity were not a factor in setting our sales volume forecast. Additionally, the tariff situation in the U.S. or a possibility of a recession did not affect our sales volume forecast either," Furukawa said.</p><p>Nintendo held its big Switch 2 Direct on April 2, the same day that US President Donald Trump announced his "Liberation Day" tariffs on China. Responding to this, Nintendo announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2 preorders</a> would not begin on April 9, but were instead delayed to later in the month, with many wondering if Nintendo would raise the price of the console as a result. That did not happen, but the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-accessories-will-be-more-expensive-than-originally-announced/1100-6530965/" data-ref-id="1100-6530965">did raise prices on some Switch 2 accessories. </a></p>
