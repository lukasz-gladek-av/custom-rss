            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/counter-strike-2-player-count<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve's first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>has hit its highest player count since May 2023, and it isn't really clear why that's happened.</p>

<p><em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-surprise-releases-counter-strike-2" rel="nofollow">surprise-released in September 2023</a>, essentially serving as both a sequel to&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&nbsp;</em>and a major update for that game as well. In May that year, when it was still&nbsp;<em>Global Offensive</em>, the game hit its all-time Steam player count high of 1,818,773 (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/730/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">per SteamDB</a>).</p>

<p>This weekend, again according to SteamDB's numbers (with thanks to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dexerto.com/counter-strike-2/counter-strike-2-hits-massive-new-player-count-record-but-no-one-really-knows-why-3133997/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dexerto</a>),&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>managed to hit a concurrent player count of 1,741,837, representing the game's highest player numbers since the Steam launch of both <i>Global Offensive&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>itself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/counter-strike-2-concurrent-player-count-shooting.jpg?itok=jLhzaDON 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/counter-strike-2-concurrent-player-count-shooting.jpg?itok=-sLiONym 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Counter-Strike 2</em>'s player numbers have reached a recent high, and it's not clear why.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>'s numbers (which were originally those of&nbsp;<em>Global Offensive</em>, lest we forget) have been trending upwards since 2012, and that the game has routinely been playing host to over a million players per day since 2022.</p>

<p>Still, there weren't any major&nbsp;<em>CS2&nbsp;</em>esports tournaments over the weekend, and as far as I know, no major&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>content creators have done anything particularly noteworthy over the past few days either.</p>

<p>It's entirely possible that&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>'s numbers have simply hit this high as part of the aforementioned general trend upwards for the game, but it's still interesting (and no doubt encouraging for Valve, given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/counter-strike-2-600m-revenue-report" rel="nofollow">how much the shooter rakes in</a>) to see figures like this for the game.</p>

<p>Will&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>manage to eclipse its all-time player high within the next few weeks? If the player count continues to rise, then it's pretty much an inevitability, which can only mean more skin sales for Valve. Hooray, I guess!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/counter-strike-2-concurrent-player-count-barrels.jpg?itok=6BWGNT17 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/counter-strike-2-concurrent-player-count-barrels.jpg?itok=KKveFkqD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>makes big money for Valve.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're still in the dark about&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, it's a multiplayer first-person shooter that pits teams of terrorists against their counter-terrorist foes.</p>

<p>The game essentially plays the same as its predecessor; it's a reflex-based FPS with a focus on observation, quick thinking, and objective-based gameplay (unless you're playing in deathmatch, in which case it's a chaotic free-for-all).</p>

<p>When it made the switch to&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, Valve's shooter got itself a new Source 2-based coat of paint, as well as new server architecture, updated maps, and more.</p>

<p><em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">for free on PC via Steam</a>.</p>

            <p>Among the dorkiest aspects of Bethesda's winningly dorky <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> is the persuasion wheel minigame - also known as Persuasion Pie, also known as the Wheedlin' Roundabout, also known as the Dartboard of Indoctrination. (Maybe not so much the last two.) This saw you choosing methods of gaining NPC affection from a disc with quadrants labelled "Admire", "Joke", "Coerce" and "Boast", each of which elicits a different response previewed by the NPC's gurnishly changing expression. </p>
<p>You have to choose all four options at least once per round, and the underlying "pie" rotates every time you pick one. The underlying segments are partially filled in to show how much they'll affect the NPC's opinion, for better or worse. The idea, then is to match responses that have a positive effect to the largest chunks of pie, by picking them in the right order. If you think all that sounds incredibly overwrought and an offence to the character writer's art, then you are clearly not Don't Nod Montreal's Colin McInerney or one of the other hosts of Wheeljam 2025, a game creation jam dedicated to Bethesda's ole Tart Of Cajolement. Here is a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>The jam runs from Thursday, March 13th to Thursday, March 20th, the 19th anniversary of Oblivion's 2006 launch. Oblivion aside, it takes inspiration from Bass Reeves Can't Die, a game concepted by Strange Scaffold boss Xalavier Nelson Jr, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/colin.how/post/3lehstucgq225">created by McInerney</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69Ukg2BqIk0">promoted/discussed</a> by Youtuber Julian "Noodle" Morley.</p>
<p>"Feel free to iterate on the original persuasion-puzzle concept or abstract your wheel into something entirely new!" <a href="https://itch.io/jam/wheeljam">explains the jam page on Itch.io</a>. "If your wheel is recognizably derived from the Oblivion wheel in any way shape or form, it is fair game."</p>
<p>Entry is free, and the hosts have considerately put together some Unreal, Godot and Unity Engine templates for people to work from. They're also offering prizes in the shape of 3D-printed Oblivion Persuasion Models. From the Itch page: "They spin! And have magnets! Maybe I'll put your names and the categories on the back of the wheel? I dunno! I didn't think that far ahead!"</p>
<p>There are several prize categories. Under "Hotwheels", we file developers who "spend an exorbitant amount of time juicing your wheel, making custom graphics for it, and making it buttery smooth". Under "Reinvent The Wheel", we find those who "use the wheel in a way that even the most seasoned game designers couldn't possibly fathom". And under "Put The We In Wheel", we find developers who "somehow found a way to have multiple wheels".</p>
<p>I'm quite fond of Oblivion's Brainwashing Pizza. I'd love to see another developer randomly revive it as an in-game item - perhaps Kojima can be pie-suaded to build it into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>. I also adore gamejams run by sickos who are obsessed with extremely specific features or mechanics from many decades ago. I'll be keeping one eye on this while the other remains peeled for news of Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivions-rumoured-unreal-engine-remake-has-a-new-take-on-stealth-stamina-and-blocking-say-rumours">long-rumoured Oblivion remake</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Warhorse Studios has announced that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has sold two million units in its first two weeks.</p>



<p>The announcement was made on the developers X (formerly Twitter) page, where the developers said “A toast to you all for making #KCD2 a triumph!”</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 hit its highest concurrent player count on Steam last week at 256,206 players, far surpassing the original game that released in 2018.</p>



<p>On its success, Embracer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-ceo-says-teams-need-to-have-the-resources-to-make-games-after-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CEO Lars Wingefors praised the games success</a> and said its a “reminder” to the company about creating “great products”.</p>



<p>“When you have right teams, this trust benefits everyone, including gamers, employees and shareholders. I am convinced that we will remain among the industry leaders in our core business verticals in the future.”</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s official review</a>, Grant Taylor-Hill called Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 a “masterpiece” that was tough to “find one major fault” with.</p>



<p>“Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is beautiful in every aspect,” he wrote. “It’s deeply authentic and riddled with emotion and catharsis, and the way the story comes together is just perfection.”</p>



<p>Last week, it was announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modding-coming-to-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warhorse Studios will be bringing mod support to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>. </p>



<p>“Bohemia is about to get even more exciting,”&nbsp;they said. “Official modding support is coming to [Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2] on Steamworks.” But as for when mod support will be released, remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 launched on February 4, 2025 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>

<p>Days Gone Remastered can be grabbed through a $10 upgrade if you already own the game digitally or physically; however, if you own the game from PlayStation Plus, you are not eligible for this offer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1iok0hw/days_gone_remastered_game_redemptions_via_ps_plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStationPlus</a> subreddit, the Days Gone Remastered’s fine print clearly states that “Game redemptions via PlayStation Plus are not eligible for upgrade”. PS Plus players must pay $49.99 to play the Days Gone Remastered, whereas digital or disc copy owners can upgrade for only $10. Many players in the subreddit have stated that they would happily upgrade for the earlier price, but now that they have to buy the whole game, they aren’t interested.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During PlayStation’s State of Play event, Bend Studio announced that Days Gone Remastered will be released on April 25, 2025. The remastered version has been built for the PS5 and supports Tempest 3D Audio, VRR, DualSense’s haptic feedback, and adaptive triggers. The game also features improved graphical fidelity and better frame rates for the quality and performance modes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Days Gone Remastered includes new modes and features: Horde Assault, a survival arcade mode; Permadeath mode; Speedrun mode; enhanced Photo mode; and new accessibility features. The new features can also be accessed on PC by purchasing the Broken Road DLC, which costs $10.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the director of Days Gone <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slammed Bend Studio</a> for not protecting the game’s legacy in Astro Bot ads. Also, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/willl-there-be-a-days-gone-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whether the game will receive a sequel</a>.

Taken at face value, Marvel Rivals is remarkably similar to Blizzard’s game; while Marvel Rivals uses Marvel heroes and villains for its playable characters, it is, like Overwatch, a competitive multiplayer hero shooter with some remarkably similar mechanics and gameplay systems. Both Marvel Heroes and Overwatch 2 are free-to-play, monetized as live services, and lean on the addition of new characters to keep things feeling fresh.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-a-smash-hit-with-10-million-players-in-just-3-days">Marvel Rivals has enjoyed explosive popularity</a> since launching in December, and it is speculated that this has come at the cost of interest in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>. Blizzard’s game, according to the current narrative, is dwindling as NetEase’s Marvel Rivals gobbles up its players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/overwatch-2-director-welcomes-competition-from-marvel-rivals-as-the-team-have-never-really-had-another-game-thats-so-similar-to-the-one-that-weve-created/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a>, Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller discussed the new reality Blizzard finds itself in, with Marvel Rivals now out in the wild and attracting tens of millions of players.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Overwatch 2 Perks</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're obviously in a new competitive landscape that I think, for Overwatch, we've never really been in before, to this extent where there's another game that's so similar to the one that we've created," Keller said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’d think this would be a bad thing for Overwatch, then, but Keller called the situation “exciting,” and even said it was “really great” to see Marvel Rivals take ideas established by Overwatch in a “different direction.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Keller admitted Marvel Rivals’ success had forced a change in attitude within Blizzard when it comes to Overwatch 2, saying: “this is no longer about playing it safe."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reveals-radical-overhaul-of-overwatch-2-including-return-of-loot-boxes-perks-and-third-person-mode">Blizzard has announced radical changes coming to Overwatch 2 in 2025</a>. While the roadmap ahead includes much of what you'd expect to see in terms of new content, the core gameplay itself will see a seismic shift, including the additions of hero perks and the return of loot boxes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes will be on Overwatch 2 to see if these changes spark a resurgence in interest. We're now nearly nine years out from the debut of Overwatch in 2016, and two-and-a-half from the launch of Overwatch 2. And while Blizzard does not make Overwatch player numbers public, we can see concurrent player numbers on Steam are as low as they’ve ever been since Overwatch 2 launched on Valve’s platform in 2023, with a 37,046 concurrent player peak over the last 24 hours.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals, meanwhile, remains a top 10 most-played game on Steam, with a 310,287 concurrent player peak over the last 24 hours.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch 2 still has a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Steam.

Overwatch 2 subsequently endured a number of controversies including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-pve-hero-mode-canceled-a-difficult-choice"><u>the cancellation of its long-awaited PvE Hero mode</u></a> — the one feature, players said, that justified the sequel's existence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has loads more on Marvel Rivals, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-says-theyre-not-trolling-dataminers-wed-rather-spend-our-time-developing-the-game">the developer's clarification on datamining</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-developer-is-open-to-potential-future-release-on-nintendo-switch-2">thoughts on the possibility of a Nintendo Switch 2 version</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It’s the characters that are our vehicles down these cinematic roads paved in broken hearts, therapeutic laughs, and unnecessarily life-threatening stunts by Tom Cruise. The greatest characters in cinema history stay with us because they’re so well-written and acted that we can see ourselves having a drink with them, or dating them, or, in the case of most of Wes Anderson’s best characters, we just want to watch them, in all their colorful eccentricity, live in this world. </p><p>Anderson is one of the greatest filmmakers ever, and that’s in no small part because he’s created characters we find simultaneously surreal and relatable, even if we don’t understand why. Why do we admire people like <em>Bottle Rocket</em>’s Dignan (Owen Wilson), who refuse to accept reality, even when it’s slapping them in the face? Why do we sometimes cling to a version of ourselves that no longer exists like Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) in <em>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</em>? Anderson knows why, and he tells us through these unforgettable characters.<br></p><p>Before the acclaimed director releases his 12th film,&nbsp;<em>The Phoenician Scheme, </em>let’s revisit the characters that have defined his legacy and enriched our lives. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="842776bfa1b0e5abba050da15b65c67e" data-recommend-id="image://842776bfa1b0e5abba050da15b65c67e" data-format="jpg" data-width="736" data-height="690" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dignan deep in thought" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dignan deep in thought" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="842776bfa1b0e5abba050da15b65c67e" data-recommend-id="image://842776bfa1b0e5abba050da15b65c67e" data-format="jpg" data-width="736" data-height="690" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dignan deep in thought" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>We should all strive for the long-term optimism that Dignan (Owen Wilson), the protagonist of Anderson’s first feature film <em>Bottle Rocket</em>, has in his life’s blueprint. However, we probably shouldn’t base a 75-year plan on stumbling up the underworld ladder of criminality. Still, Dignan’s absurdist exaggeration of relatable human emotions—like the fear of mediocrity and the yearning for purpose—became an Anderson trademark that has endeared his characters to us for decades.</p><p>While Dignan isn’t as fleshed out as Anderson’s later characters, the depth of his delusion shifts from comedic to cautionary in the film’s final moments. As he sits in prison, his last words—“They’ll never catch me, man. ‘Cause I’m fucking innocent.”—perfectly encapsulate his unwavering belief in his own fantasy. Even in comedy, Anderson creates characters who can tickle our funny bone while simultaneously breaking our hearts.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="748aceecf10d39ba1b7352d50f1dc5fa" data-recommend-id="image://748aceecf10d39ba1b7352d50f1dc5fa" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1372" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Steve Zissou giving orders" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Steve Zissou giving orders" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="748aceecf10d39ba1b7352d50f1dc5fa" data-recommend-id="image://748aceecf10d39ba1b7352d50f1dc5fa" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1372" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Steve Zissou giving orders" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) embodies the tragicomic grandeur that defines Wes Anderson’s best characters—a man clinging to his past glory while barely holding his personal life together. His quest to kill the jaguar shark that ate his best friend is less about science and more about proving he still matters, making lines like “What would be the scientific purpose of killing it?” both hilarious and heartbreaking. His slow-motion strut through his boat&nbsp;the Belafonte, set to David Bowie’s “Queen Bitch,” paints him as a man desperate to maintain his legend, even as the world moves on without him.</p><p>Yet in the film’s most vulnerable moment, when he finally sees the shark, his whisper—“I wonder if it remembers me”—turns his vengeance into bittersweet acceptance. Murray brings Zissou to life with a perfect balance of deadpan humor and quiet melancholy, delivering every line with the kind of effortless charisma that makes him both absurd and deeply human. Whether he’s sulking in his wetsuit or rallying his dysfunctional crew, Murray’s presence makes Zissou more than just a parody of washed-up adventurers—he makes him unforgettable.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d5f360f90834166666fca199e7bf334f" data-recommend-id="image://d5f360f90834166666fca199e7bf334f" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="400" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Max Fischer teaching" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Max Fischer teaching" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d5f360f90834166666fca199e7bf334f" data-recommend-id="image://d5f360f90834166666fca199e7bf334f" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="400" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Max Fischer teaching" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is the blueprint for so many of Wes Anderson’s best characters—an overconfident dreamer, equal parts genius and disaster, whose ambition far outweighs his ability. He strides through <em>Rushmore</em> as if he owns it, despite being one of the worst students in the school, and his belief in his own brilliance is so unshakable that even when he’s failing, he’s still convinced he’s winning. His line, “I saved Latin. What did you ever do?” perfectly captures the delusional self-importance that makes him both hilarious and strangely inspiring. Like Steve Zissou or M. Gustave after him, Max isn’t just chasing success—he’s crafting his own legend, whether through his impossible aquarium project or his wildly over-the-top Vietnam War play, <em>Heaven and Hell</em>. </p><p>But Anderson’s best characters aren’t just cartoons; they’re flawed, deeply human figures hiding real pain beneath their quirks. Max’s heartbreak over Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), his crumbling friendship with Herman Blume (Bill Murray), and his desperation to matter in a world that keeps telling him he doesn’t, make him one of Anderson’s most enduring protagonists. And yet, by the end, as he orchestrates one last grand production—not a play, but a reconciliation—he learns that sometimes the grandest gestures aren’t about proving your worth, but about making peace. As “Ooh La La” by The Faces plays and he takes Miss Cross’s hand for a quiet dance, Max joins the legacy of Anderson’s most unforgettable characters—an outsider, a dreamer, and a legend in his own mind, but one we can’t help but root for.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="918816496f2f6da12cc2568d662665b4" data-recommend-id="image://918816496f2f6da12cc2568d662665b4" data-format="png" data-width="1240" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Augie Steenbeck looking out quizzically " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Augie Steenbeck looking out quizzically " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Universal</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="918816496f2f6da12cc2568d662665b4" data-recommend-id="image://918816496f2f6da12cc2568d662665b4" data-format="png" data-width="1240" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Augie Steenbeck looking out quizzically " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Augie Steenbeck (Jason Schwartzman) might be the most emotionally stranded character Wes Anderson has ever created—an expert at capturing the world through his camera but completely incapable of being present in his own life. When his wife dies, he doesn’t tell his children for three weeks, waiting until they’re quite literally stranded in the middle of nowhere before finally dropping the news with all the warmth of a weather report. </p><p>“She’s in the Tupperware,” he says flatly, holding up the ashes as if they’re just another piece of luggage. But Augie’s grief isn’t loud or theatrical—it’s buried so deep beneath his deadpan demeanor that even he doesn’t seem to recognize it. He moves through <em>Asteroid City</em> like a man rehearsing for a role he’s forgotten how to play, leaning on the safety of his routine and keeping everything—his emotions, his children, even himself—at arm’s length. </p><p>His moments with Midge Campbell (Scarlett Johansson) offer a glimpse of something raw, something unscripted, particularly their quiet, stunning exchange through the motel window, where she tells him to “just feel it” and he admits, “I don’t know how.” But Augie’s real breaking point comes not in the world of <em>Asteroid City</em>, but in the black-and-white void of the meta-play’s production, when he steps outside of himself entirely and asks the director, “Am I doing it right?” It’s the most vulnerable thing he could possibly say—not just about the performance, but about everything. About grieving. About parenting. About simply existing. And somehow, that single moment—simple, direct, heartbreaking—cements Augie as one of Anderson’s most painfully real characters.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="70c2936e87e0903dea664b0d1ed6e5a0" data-recommend-id="image://70c2936e87e0903dea664b0d1ed6e5a0" data-format="webp" data-width="800" data-height="439" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Francis Whitman figuring himself out" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Francis Whitman figuring himself out" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fox Searchlight Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="70c2936e87e0903dea664b0d1ed6e5a0" data-recommend-id="image://70c2936e87e0903dea664b0d1ed6e5a0" data-format="webp" data-width="800" data-height="439" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Francis Whitman figuring himself out" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Francis Whitman (Owen Wilson) is the kind of guy who hands his brothers laminated itineraries for their own emotional healing, as if a tight schedule and a few sacred temples will magically fix everything that’s broken between them. After nearly dying in a motorcycle accident, he rounds up his estranged brothers for a “spiritual journey” across India, but his idea of enlightenment is less about self-discovery and more about tightly scheduled temple visits and laminated trip plans. “I want us to be completely open with each other,” he declares, before dictating exactly how they should feel and what they should say.</p><p>His face, half-covered in bandages, is a perfect visual metaphor for the wounds he refuses to acknowledge. But beneath the forced optimism and suffocating leadership, Francis is drowning in unresolved trauma, haunted by a father who left him nothing but matching luggage and a mother who abandoned them entirely. His breaking point comes in a moment as ridiculous as it is raw—standing on a hilltop, screaming, “Let’s get a drink and talk it over!” as if healing can be scheduled like a pit stop. It’s only when he finally lets go—literally, dropping his father’s suitcases in the film’s final moments—that he begins to understand that some baggage is too heavy to carry forever. </p><p>Francis may never find the spiritual awakening he set out for, but in that quiet surrender, he embodies one of Anderson’s most enduring themes—the illusion of control in the face of grief—and cements himself as a pivotal figure in Anderson’s legacy of characters who mask deep emotional wounds with carefully curated exteriors.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ac011c440fec4f1b32c695bbac4a7229" data-recommend-id="image://ac011c440fec4f1b32c695bbac4a7229" data-format="jpg" data-width="2027" data-height="1140" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="M.

Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) <em>was</em> the hotel. Like so many of Anderson’s best characters, he is both a figure of control and a man completely out of his depth, clinging to a version of the world that no longer exists. He operates with impeccable charm and rigid etiquette, convinced that poetry, perfume, and perfect manners can hold back the tides of war and betrayal. But beneath the carefully curated exterior lies something deeper—a man terrified of irrelevance, desperate to preserve beauty in a world that seems intent on erasing it. </p><p>He fits perfectly in Anderson’s lineage of complicated men, from Royal Tenenbaum’s self-mythologizing to Steve Zissou’s delusional grandiosity—characters who perform their own importance even as their carefully built identities begin to crumble. What makes Gustave unforgettable is not just his refinement but his defiance, the quiet tragedy of someone who refuses to accept that the rules have changed. And yet, through the memory of Zero (Tony Revolori), he lingers—an echo of lost grandeur, as fragile and fleeting as the hotel itself.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="31010470ab37881d54319fba727e63cf" data-recommend-id="image://31010470ab37881d54319fba727e63cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="759" data-height="500" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arthur Howitzer Jr looking unimpressed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Arthur Howitzer Jr looking unimpressed" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Searchlight Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="31010470ab37881d54319fba727e63cf" data-recommend-id="image://31010470ab37881d54319fba727e63cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="759" data-height="500" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arthur Howitzer Jr looking unimpressed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>No one could create a character like Arthur Howitzer Jr. (Bill Murray) but Wes Anderson. He’s a<strong>&nbsp;</strong>man of quiet authority, deep sentimentality, and an unshakable devotion to a world that’s slipping away.  Howitzer is a figure who holds chaos together with a firm but gentle touch. He enforces a hilariously strict no-crying policy, yet he is the first to see the humanity in the stories his writers bring him, shaping their sprawling eccentricities into something refined. </p><p>Beneath his gruff pragmatism lies something deeply sentimental—he’s an editor who truly believes in the beauty of storytelling, even as the paper itself fades into memory. Bill Murray’s performance here is his best in any  Anderson movie (he’s been in ten), a masterclass in understated warmth and dry wit, embodying the weary but devoted editor with effortless charm. With just a raised eyebrow, a clipped piece of advice—”Just try to make it sound like you wrote it that way on purpose”—or a quiet, knowing glance, he gives Howitzer the gruff yet deeply sentimental presence that makes him feel like the soul of the newsroom.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f7d1a6a7e0d5a276d15982d56e32c241" data-recommend-id="image://f7d1a6a7e0d5a276d15982d56e32c241" data-format="webp" data-width="800" data-height="440" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Richie Tenenbaum getting ready" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Richie Tenenbaum getting ready" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f7d1a6a7e0d5a276d15982d56e32c241" data-recommend-id="image://f7d1a6a7e0d5a276d15982d56e32c241" data-format="webp" data-width="800" data-height="440" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Richie Tenenbaum getting ready" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There’s a certain kind of sadness that runs through Wes Anderson’s films—a deep, unspoken melancholy beneath the symmetry and pastel palettes—and no character embodies it more fully than Richie Tenenbaum (Luke Wilson). Among Anderson’s pantheon of emotionally stunted geniuses, misguided visionaries, and lost souls, Richie stands out as perhaps the purest example of quiet, unshakable heartbreak. </p><p>Richie barely speaks his pain aloud, instead carrying it in his hunched posture, his constant sunglasses, his resigned half-smiles. He is a man who once had a place in the world—graceful, adored, effortlessly talented—but now drifts outside of it, undone by love he can never fully have and a family he doesn’t know how to reconnect with. </p><p>What makes Richie one of Anderson’s greatest creations isn’t just his sadness but his underlying tenderness; he has the softest heart of any of Anderson’s tragic figures, and while others spiral into narcissism or self-indulgence, Richie’s pain is private, restrained, and deeply human. In a world of characters chasing lost potential, he is the one who seems to know, deep down, that it’s already gone—and yet, somehow, he still holds onto the smallest hope that something beautiful remains.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a69be0c611a4da7c0165026b3d0c656c" data-recommend-id="image://a69be0c611a4da7c0165026b3d0c656c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1030" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mr. Fox looking out optimistically" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mr. Fox looking out optimistically" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Fox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a69be0c611a4da7c0165026b3d0c656c" data-recommend-id="image://a69be0c611a4da7c0165026b3d0c656c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1030" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mr. Fox looking out optimistically" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There’s a restless energy to Mr. Fox (George Clooney) that makes him one of Wes Anderson’s most compelling characters—a rogue caught between the wild animal he was born to be and the domesticated family man he’s trying to become. He is, at heart, a creature of impulse, forever chasing the next thrill, whether it’s stealing chickens or outwitting farmers, even as the consequences pile up around him. </p><p>What makes him so fascinating isn’t just his charm or cleverness but the underlying insecurity that drives him; he longs to be exceptional, to be remembered, to be <em>more</em> than just another fox scratching out an ordinary existence. And yet, beneath the bravado, there’s an ache of self-awareness—he knows, deep down, that his recklessness puts everything he loves at risk, that his need to prove himself is as much a flaw as it is a gift. </p><p>In a world of neatly arranged stop-motion frames, he is a burst of chaos, a contradiction, a character whose triumphs always come with a cost. And yet, like all of Anderson’s best creations, he is impossible not to root for, because no matter how many mistakes he makes, no matter how much he loses, he never stops reaching for something greater—even if it’s just one last, perfectly executed heist.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="32d75e64e15aa0b864d4a81029147328" data-recommend-id="image://32d75e64e15aa0b864d4a81029147328" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chief looking excited " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chief looking excited " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Searchlight Picutres</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="32d75e64e15aa0b864d4a81029147328" data-recommend-id="image://32d75e64e15aa0b864d4a81029147328" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chief looking excited " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s almost absurdly funny that the same actor who played Walter White, the ruthless and calculating kingpin of&nbsp;<em>Breaking Bad</em>, can also deliver a deeply heartfelt and compelling performance as a grumpy, stray dog in a Wes Anderson stop-motion film. There’s a rawness to Chief (Bryan Cranston) that sets him apart from the other dogs in <em>Isle of Dogs</em>—a scrappy stray who wears his independence like armor, convinced he’s better off alone. </p><p>Unlike the pampered house pets exiled to Trash Island, Chief has never known human affection, and he resents the very idea of servitude. But what makes him one of Wes Anderson’s best characters isn’t just his toughness or his bite—it’s the slow, reluctant unraveling of his defenses. Beneath the gruff exterior, there’s a deep, unspoken longing to belong, a flicker of uncertainty that grows as he bonds with Atari, the boy who sees past his snarls to something gentler underneath. </p><p>His transformation—from a cynical loner to a loyal protector—is one of Anderson’s most quietly affecting arcs, proving that even the most hardened creatures can find their place in the world. And in a film filled with symmetrical beauty and precision, Chief remains a glorious contradiction: a creature of instinct wrestling with the unfamiliar weight of love.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="751c7789e627cad8f0d8acc1af5c4104" data-recommend-id="image://751c7789e627cad8f0d8acc1af5c4104" data-format="jpg" data-width="640" data-height="347" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sam (left) and Suzy (right) sitting together " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sam (left) and Suzy (right) sitting together " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Focus Features</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="751c7789e627cad8f0d8acc1af5c4104" data-recommend-id="image://751c7789e627cad8f0d8acc1af5c4104" data-format="jpg" data-width="640" data-height="347" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sam (left) and Suzy (right) sitting together " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It may be hard to accept that Wes Anderson, a filmmaker known for his intricately damaged adults—men burdened by lost love, fathers drowning in regret—crafted his most affecting characters in two 12-year-olds who run away from home with a cat, a suitcase, and a record player. But, it’s true. Sam and Suzy (Jared Gilman &amp; Kara Hayward) in <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em> aren’t just kids playing house; they’re two souls who, despite their age, understand each other in a way the adults around them never could. </p><p>Sam, an orphan and outcast among his peers, is pragmatic and fiercely loyal, while Suzy, with her sharp gaze and stolen library books, carries the quiet rage of someone who feels fundamentally unseen. Together, they create a world of their own, a secret island refuge where they can exist without judgment. But what makes them Anderson’s best characters isn’t just their rebellious adventure—it’s the earnestness of their love, the way they approach life with the sincerity that only children can. </p><p>In a world of emotionally stunted grown-ups, Sam and Suzy are the only ones brave enough to demand something more: a life where they are understood, where they belong. And that’s what makes their story, despite its pastel whimsy, the most profoundly human one Anderson has ever told.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler is undergoing some rather quick development, as the solid implementation seen in a recent game isn't based on the latest version of the upscaler.</p>
<p>As reported on the<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-games-with-ps5-pro-enhancements.1026072/post-135898977" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ResetERA forums</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a>, the second entry in the series released earlier this month, uses the upscaler's 9.60 version. While the high version number, by itself, suggests that PSSR has been undergoing plenty of development, as we previously only heard of much lower version numbers, a known developer on the ResetERA forums <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-games-with-ps5-pro-enhancements.1026072/post-135903003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that version 9.60 isn't the upscaler's latest version, although they couldn't add more on the matter for the time being before checking if something changed in NDAs regarding the upscaler.</p>
<p>A few days earlier, the aforementioned developer also revealed some <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-games-with-ps5-pro-enhancements.1026072/post-135644619" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interesting information</a> on the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler which suggests that already available older games powered by Unreal Engine 4 may not support the upscaler beyond the initial version. According to the developer, UE4, by default, only supports the initial PSSR version, and with official support from Epic on the engine's updates not being available anymore, developers need to backport snippets of Unreal Engine 5 code to use newer SDKs and thus never versions of the PSSR more upscale. This is the reason some <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-playstation-5-pro-new-patch-updates-pssr-to-latest-version-improves-image-quality/">patches</a> took time to implement more recent versions of the upscaler, and why some games may never get support for them, as this backporting of UE5 code requires time that some development teams may not have.</p>
<p>The PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler is only one of the many features that define the PlayStation 5 Pro. You can learn more about the system in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-release-date-revealed-for-july.1111335/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bushiroad Games and Arc System Works have announced the release date for upcoming anime fighter&nbsp;<em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact</em>, which will serve as the first major fighting game adaptation of the popular manga and anime.</p>

<p>As revealed during this weekend's Evo event,&nbsp;<em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact&nbsp;</em>will launch on July 17th. When it does, you'll be able to play it on PC, PS5, and Switch. No release has been announced for Xbox.</p>

<p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunter-x-hunter-fighting-game-announced-at-jump-festa" rel="nofollow">announced in December 2023</a>,&nbsp;<em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact&nbsp;</em>was originally scheduled for a 2024 release, but in September, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-delayed-rollback-netcode" rel="nofollow">it was delayed</a> in order to allow the developers to add rollback netcode to the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-release-date-fight.jpg?itok=LTE_vL72 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-release-date-fight.jpg?itok=KYgsXwlR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact&nbsp;</em>is locked in for a July launch.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering what rollback netcode is, it's essentially tech that improves the quality of an online fighting game experience.</p>

<p>The long explanation is very technical, but in short, rollback netcode "rolls back" the state of the game if it detects a delay, but retains your own inputs, which makes online fights feel much more smooth.</p>

<p>Rollback netcode has been implemented in a number of hugely successful fighting games, including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-fighterz-rollback-netcode-ps5-xbox" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em></a>, Capcom's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-rollback-netcode-will-be-better-open-worlds-detailed" rel="nofollow"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a>, and Bandai Namco's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/will-tekken-8-have-crossplay-and-rollback-netcode-katsuhiro-harada-responds" rel="nofollow"><em>Tekken 8</em></a>, as well as <i>Nen x Impact&nbsp;</i>publisher Arc System Works' own&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/guity-gear-strive-beta-impressions" rel="nofollow"><em>Guilty Gear Strive</em></a>.</p>

<p>In short, while a delay to&nbsp;<em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact&nbsp;</em>was unfortunate, it was put into effect so the developers could make it a more satisfying online experience, which it's hard to complain about.</p>




<p><em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact&nbsp;</em>is the first "full-fledged" fighting game to be based on the manga and anime series. It's a 3v3 battler in which you can play as a range of characters from the manga, including Gon, Hisoka, and Killua, among others.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check the game out when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456420/HUNTERxHUNTER_NENxIMPACT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10007325" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and Nintendo Switch on July 17th.</p>

But it’s vital to remember there <em>are</em> live-service games that are still raking it in. One of the most impressive success stories is Ubisoft’s <em>Rainbow 6 Siege</em>, which ten years on from release is due to reveal a major update which is being claimed as “a new era.”</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196299" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="385" data-playlist="196299,195734,195189" data-current="196299"><div><p>You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21849.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Rainbow Six Siege X</em>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/1yyppDElemqVlUXSVif55M&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/1yyppDElemqVlUXSVif55M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is described by Ubisoft</a></span> as “the biggest transformation in the game’s history,” with the obvious aim to refresh the aging multiplayer game for the foreseeable future. This will involve new game modes, “deepened tactical gameplay,” and most likely a significant graphical tidying up. The ambiguity here is because, in the tiresome way of modern life, this is all based on a teaser for a teaser, the announcement that there’s to be The Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase on March 13. It’s to be a live event, taking place in Atlanta, Georgia, but obviously will be streamed online <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via the game’s Twitch channel</a></span>.</p><p><em>Siege</em> first launched in 2015, and was a flabby <em>Counter-Strike-</em>me-do, with poor sales. Ubisoft cannily switched to the live-service model, and over the next few years persisted with the game, reinventing it with free DLC, until it had become something enormously loved, and hugely successful. Yes indeed, it’s hard to imagine, but instead of just junking years of work and hundreds of millions of dollars spent, developers instead worked incredibly hard to bring the game to the point of massive popularity. Bewildering.</p><p>Ten years on, it looks like Ubisoft is taking a big gamble, and meddling with the format. All changes bring the threat of a core player-base’s fury, but it looks like the goal with the showcase is to ease everyone in to the second decade of the game’s existence with careful explanation. (There will always be those who would prefer their favorite game wither and die than ever evolve or advance, but they need to shhhhhhhh.)</p><p>Here’s a thought: The brief information about the changes mentions “deepened tactical gameplay,” and I can’t help wondering if there might be a desire to return to <em>Rainbow Six</em>’s roots. When the first game came out in 1998, it was wholly different to the <em>R6</em> people know today. Most significantly, you didn’t control a single character, but rather an entire squad. Those first few games were about <em>planning—</em>you we given detailed briefings about what your team needed to achieve, and then you strategized your approach all before ever showing up. Played best, the bit with soldiers running around was just the unfolding of pre-determined plans, with on-the-fly improvisation if something went wrong.</p><p>It’d be fascinating if <em>Siege</em> were to think about adding modes that re-evoked the series’ original spirit.</p><p>We’ll find out what Ubisoft are actually up to in just under a month.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Spoilers ahead for the players that haven’t caught up with the new Daima series yet, but Goku reached his iconic Super Saiyan 4 transformation again during the latest episode,’ Awakening’, and the form is canon this time. The new Goku SSJ4 Daima transformation draws a lot of inspiration from its GT counterpart, but it is also different in some ways, such as the colours and Goku still being short. The modders have perfectly captured Goku SSJ4 Daima’s essence in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Former Activision-Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick, widely regarded as one of the worst CEOs in gaming, believes someone else deserves that title in a textbook case of the pot calling the kettle black.</p>
<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grit podcast</a>, the former Activision Blizzard CEO and former EA chief creative officer Bing Gordon revealed that they used to consider former EA and Unity CEO John Riccitiello as the worst CEO in the video game industry. At Activision, they thought that he was so bad that they hoped he would continue to be CEO so that they wouldn't have to worry about EA, and Activision would have paid for Riccitiello to be the EA CEO forever. Quite a statement, considering everything that happened at the publisher during Kotick's long tenure, which included prolonged workplace harassment, of which he was reportedly aware for years, that led to <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-california-lawsuit-discrimination-harassment/">a lawsuit in California.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="#229 Bobby Kotick, former CEO of Activision Blizzard; and Bing Gordon, Advisor at Kleiner Perkins" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D2urSgcuyyo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bobby Kotick has been Activision Blizzard's CEO for over two decades, sitting at the head of the publisher since he took over in 1991. He stayed as CEO for <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-kotick-depart/">a few weeks</a> after Microsoft's acquisition of the publisher finally went through as per Phil Spencer's request, and finally stepped down on January 1st, 2024. He has always been regarded by many as the actual worst CEO in gaming, although the former EA and Unity CEO could give him a run for his money, as Riccitiello has been involved in a multitude of anti-consumer controversies, including attempting back in late 2023 to introduce <a href="https://wccftech.com/unity-suffers-huge-backlash-for-runtime-fee-based-on-installs-then-rushes-to-clarify-some-points/">a runtime fee for the Unity engine</a> which would essentially charge developer per install. The backlash was so severe that Riccitiello had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-steps-down-following-runtime-fee-fiasco/">step down as CEO of the company </a>shortly after the whole fiasco.</p>

			<p>Okami 2 is being developed using the RE Engine, and fully realizing Hideki Kamiya's vision for the game wouldn't have been possible without it.</p>
<p>Speaking with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kami-2-is-being-made-in-re-engine-confirmed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>, Machine Head Works producer Kiyohiko Sakata confirmed the long-awaited new entry in the series will indeed use the engine that has powered all major CAPCOM games since Resident Evil 7.&nbsp;The studio's experience with the engine will aid Clovers, who has no experience with it, in the development of the game.</p>
<p>As for why Okami 2 is being developed using the RE Engine, CAPCOM producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi confirmed that the engine was picked because, without it, they wouldn't have been able to realize Hideki Kamiya's artistic vision for the game. The game's director himself added that the engine is famous for <em>"showing the best of the games that they have"</em> and that it is very good <em>"expressively"</em>, so it definitely sounds like the game is going to be a feast for the eyes.</p>
<p>The announcement of Okami 2 was among the biggest surprises revealed during last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/">The Game Awards show</a>. The only teaser shown to date essentially confirmed that Amaterasu will come back in the new game and that it will feature an updated version of the original's unique visual style. Better yet, as already mentioned, it will be directed by Hideki Kamiya, the director of the original as well as the creator of some of the best action game series ever made, such as Devil May Cry and Bayonetta.</p>
<p>Okami 2 is currently in development for yet to be confirmed platforms. Its release date has yet to be announced as well, so it may be a while until we see how the RE Engine has made it possible for Kamiya-san's vision to realize his vision.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase-date-revealed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft has a big launch on the new through Rainbow Six Siege X—a successor to 2015’s Siege. More original Siege content is on the way, but it looks like Rainbow Six Siege X is replacing its predecessor, and offering big upgrades.</p>



<p>Fun Fact: I got Rainbow Six Siege shortly after release and ended up selling it a few months later because <em>I couldn’t stop playing it</em>. Siege greatly disrupted my single-player gaming, and I decided to end the relationship. I fondly look back on those early days, and 10 years later, the game is as celebrated as ever. It’s a huge esports hit, the gameplay is still strategic and intricate, and tens of thousands of players still hop on each day.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-2-reveal-si-2025-rumour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siege 2 rumor</a> gained huge traction in January 2025. The leak came to fruition with the announcement of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-siege-x-update-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siege X</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-rainbow-six-siege-x-release-date">Do we Know The Rainbow Six Siege X Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>10 years of history. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no release date locked in for Rainbow Six Siege X, nor a vague release period.</strong></p>



<p>Common sense suggests Siege X will likely be released following the conclusion of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-y10s1-reveal-prep-phase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rainbow Six Siege Y10</a>. This isn’t factual though, so be sure to check back as we update you.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase-date">When is The Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase Date?</h2>



<p><strong>The Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase is penciled in for March 13 at 10 AM PT / 6 PM CT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT.</strong></p>



<p>A <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/4IUTIzwOdeRG4l3ms7h1Dz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft article</a> confirmed Siege’s X Showcase date. “A new era of&nbsp;Rainbow Six Siege&nbsp;will be revealed on <strong>March 13</strong> at the Siege X Showcase,” it said. The Showcase will show us every aspect of Siege X and its new changes compared to the original.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-watch-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase">How to Watch Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase</h2>



<p><strong>Ubisoft has confirmed you can check out the full Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase by watching the action unfold on the Ubisoft Twitch Channel.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft Rainbow6 Twitch Channel</a> is the home of all things Rainbow Six Siege. So it makes sense for Siege X to be unveiled here. It remains to be seen if any YouTube channels also broadcast the Showcase.</p>



<p>Keep your eyes peeled for alternative sources—as will we.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-rainbow-six-siege-x">What is Rainbow Six Siege X?</h2>



<p><strong>Rainbow Six Siege X is described as a “major evolution” of Siege, but it isn’t considered a sequel or normal update.</strong></p>



<p>Ubisoft game director Joshua Mills revealed Siege X aims to keep <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-siege-x-update-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siege around for the next 10 years</a>. He raised expectations for Siege X at the Rainbow Six Invitational: “It is not Siege 2, and it’s not just another update. It’s a major evolution. We’re expanding and reinforcing the very foundation of Siege to ensure it remains the pinnacle of tactical PvP first-person shooters.”</p>



<p>“Graphical and audio upgrades, deepened tactical gameplay, and new ways to play the game,” are also at the forefront of Siege X’s marketing ahead of the Showcase.</p>



<p>Check out its first teaser trailer below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>I imagine Siege X is following in the footsteps of Overwatch 2 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-hits-all-time-player-peak-on-steam-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CS2</a> by being a massively upgraded free-to-play enhancement of the original. If so, we can start dreaming of the new content, gameplay mechanics, and much more Ubisoft has in store.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s no secret Ubisoft needs a big win in the next year. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-preorders-in-line-with-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> might not be enough, but Siege continues to do the business. Does the prospect of X get you amped up? Which new features and twists does Siege X need to separate itself from the OG Siege?</p>



<p>Don’t be afraid to jump into Rainbow Six Siege now if you haven’t already. Let’s answer some common questions about Siege: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-rainbow-six-siege-cross-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Does it have crossplay?</a> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-rainbow-six-siege-have-cross-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is cross-progression enabled?</a> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-rainbow-six-siege-have-a-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">And is there a Rainbow Six Siege Campaign?</a></p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/17/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-review.1111281/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/17/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Citizen Sleeper is, in my opinion, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/24/game-of-the-year-2022-best-narrative/">one of the best narrative games ever produced</a>. It deals with massive themes of self, sacrifice, desperation, and the impact of choice in such a way that you can agonise over every story beat. It would always be a tough act to follow, but that follow up has arrived in Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector, bringing a new story, a wider location, and with added gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p><iframe title="Citizen Sleeper 2 - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ytLVnt3skzI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector follows the path of a new Sleeper and not the protagonist from the original, but there are similarities between the two. Just like the original Sleeper, the new Sleeper is on the run and trying to find their freedom, though in this case it is a criminal gang boss that is the pursuer rather than a mega corporation. They’re in far worse shape, though, with a memory full of holes and a body that is failing and glitching, and which is getting worse as time progresses.</p>


<p>Instead of being confined to a single space station, you’ll now be able to visit other places by jumping in your Rig. This Rig needs a crew, and this another new thing as you recruit crew members who can help on missions.</p>


<p>In Citizen Sleeper, your character needed stabiliser to continue functioning, but here that is not the case due to changes in how the new Sleeper operates. The risk now comes from stress and broken or glitched dice, with the former also having an impact on crew behaviour in missions. If a dice breaks it can be repaired, provided you have the components to carry those repairs out, whereas glitched dice become permanent and more numerous as the Sleeper’s system glitches build up.</p>
<p>Where a regular dice has different odds depending on its value, a glitched dice’s outcome value will always be 20% positive / 80% negative, meaning you are only likely to be successful with a glitched dice 1 in 5 times. The impact of stress impacts decision making and performance. The higher the stress level the worse your outcomes are likely to be, including dice breaking. If a crew member’s stress level reaches maximum during a contract mission they will abandon their role, removing their two dice and their skills from the equation.</p>
<p>The crew of the Rig is integral to the success of missions, with each having a combination of skills that can complement the Sleeper’s skills to get through missions efficiently. Ideally, you pick crew that have different skills to your Sleeper, and ones that will be viable on mission. However, as you will not know which skills you need on missions, you may make the wrong choice and take someone whose skills do not lend themselves to the task at hand. However, this does not make them useless, as you can still use their dice but with a penalty imposed. For example, if a crew member has a dice valued at six, the value will go down to four if used for a task they have no proficiency with. There was also a Push ability that lets you re-roll dice in the hope of getting higher values for the lowest value dice. Outside of missions, you can have the crew do odd jobs to acquire money or source fuel and food supplies, needed for travel and survival alike.</p>

<p>Narrative is the core aspect of the Citizen Sleeper, and each location in Citizen Sleeper 2 has its own stories occurring, which feed into the bigger arc. On one station there is talk of mutiny, while on another the focus is on growing food to be self-sustainable. There are the relationships between the characters to take into account too, with a few familiar faces popping up from the first game, with these also having an impact on some of the story progressing.</p>
<p>While Citizen Sleeper 2 has some very good writing, it doesn’t quite hit the same heights as the original. The story is still quite personal, but in the first game the story and relationships felt a lot more impactful. The writing is very good too yet, again, in the first game it came across as more concentrated and harder hitting. Branching out in terms of the scope is welcome in this sequel, but some of that magic from the original has been spread a bit thinner here.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I feel it comes down to the glitched and broken dice and the frustrations that they can cause. Either&nbsp;one or the other system would have been plenty of change to the original game, while both can make completing tasks much tougher than necessary.</p>

            <p>The Last of Us' Neil Druckmann has said making sequels to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s beloved franchises requires a level of confidence that, believe it or not, he claims he doesn't have.</p>
<p>Speaking during the DICE summit last week with fellow game developer Cory Barlog, the Last of Us' director was asked: "How do you and your teams approach character development over multiple games?"</p>
<p>Barlog said he had "way too much of the Charlie Day crazy conspiracy board" method of planning, referring to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nTpsv9PNqo">that Pepe Silvia scene from Always Sunny in Philadelphia which has become a bit of a meme</a>. But Druckmann, meanwhile, said he had a different approach, as he "never [thinks] about multiple games".</p>

"I think you're jinxing yourself if you're starting to think about the sequel when you're working on the first game. So when I was making The Last of Us 2, yeah, sure. Every once in a while an idea pops in your head of where it might go if we get the chance to do another one.

<p>Druckmann said that, when a sequel to a game does come around, it's only then that he looks back on what the studio has already done, to decide where story points and characters can go. "And if I feel like the answer is, they can't go anywhere, then I go, 'I think we'll just kill them off'," he said.</p>
<p>"I'm half joking, but we just find the next game," Druckmann continued. "When we made Uncharted 1, we had no idea we would do the train sequence of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted-2-among-thieves">Uncharted 2</a>, or where Nathan Drake would be. We figured it out when we made Uncharted 2. And eventually, [it was] the same when we worked on Uncharted 3, [and the] same when we worked on Uncharted 4, where we look back and say: 'How do we not repeat ourselves? Where else could this character go? What else could get him back into the adventure?'</p>
<p>"And we have to come up with a new answer. And if we don't have a new answer then we should ask ourselves, is this the right character? Is this the right game for us to work on? Or is it time to find something new?"</p>
<p>Barlog, meanwhile, said he found connecting elements in games today with something he worked on a decade or so ago "magical", although noted this has its own stresses.</p>
<p>"It is absolutely, unequivocally the most unhealthy thing ever, because it is insanely stressful to try to fold and connect each of these pieces," Barlog shared. "Because, give or take five years, there's hundreds of people involved, and then a whole new group of people often are moved in on the next project. That's a bunch of different... perspectives, and likes and dislikes that are going to negatively impact you setting something up that early. And they're going to be like, 'Let's talk about this, because that was kind of the dumb. I don't know if I want to do that.'"</p>
<p>"I think for me that requires a level of confidence I just don't have," Druckmann responded. "Like this is going to be so successful, I know where this is going next. I'm like, I just want to focus on the next five days in front of me, let alone 10 years down the line."</p>

<p>Back in 2021, Druckmann said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-3-has-a-story-outline-neil-druckmann-hopes-will-one-day-see-the-light-of-day">Naughty Dog had a story outline for The Last of Us 3 penned</a> that he hoped "one day can see the light of day". However, at this time, nothing was in development.</p>
<p>Then in 2023, Druckmann reiterated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-moving-on-from-uncharted-open-to-the-last-of-us-part-3-if-it-has-a-compelling-story">Naughty Dog is open to developing Part 3</a>, but only if "[the team] can come up with a compelling story that has this universal message and statement about love", as it did with Parts 1 and 2.</p>
<p>"With The Last of Us, it's up to us whether we want to continue it or not... If we can't come up with something, we have a very strong ending with Part 2 and that will be the end," Druckmann said at the time.</p>
<p>At the Game Awards in December, Naughty Dog lifted the lid on its upcoming game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">a sci-fi hack 'n' slash called Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>FromSoftware has confirmed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will receive post-release DLC, leading to speculation over what could be included.</p>
<p>Over on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/">Steam page</a>, the description originally included the line "Additional DLC - Additional playable characters and bosses" (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/elden-ring-nightreigns-steam-page-lets-slip-itll-have-dlc-bosses-and-player-characters/">PC Gamer</a>), though this has since been removed.</p>
<p>The DLC will be available by Q4 2025, though no further details are known.</p>

<p>The Steam page went up alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-announced-by-fromsoftware">news of the game's release date</a> and pre-orders beginning, all ahead of the network test that took place over the weekend.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-first-network-test-suffers-server-issues-due-to-congestion">network test initially failed</a>, with players unable to access the first session. FromSoftware was forced to reboot the servers due to congestion.</p>
<p>The rest of the test appears to have been a success, giving players a look at what to expect in the final game.</p>
<p>The test features four playable Nightfarers, but FromSoftware has confirmed the final game will include eight. However, it looks like more will be included in the forthcoming DLC.</p>
<p>It's hard to speculate on who these will be, considering we still don't know who the remaining four will be. The existing four from the network test - Wylder, Guardian, Recluse, Duchess - fit the typical all-rounder, tank, mage, rogue classes, but perhaps others will parallel the likes of the Wretch or Samurai classes from the base game.</p>
<p>As for additional bosses, there's plenty of potential for FromSoftware to add to the game, be that through additional Nightlords or special randomised events. We know already it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-will-feature-enemies-from-dark-souls-director-confirms">cherry-picking from across the Souls games</a> - the network test included the Centipede Demon from Dark Souls 1, for instance, while the game's trailer shows The Nameless King from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>.</p>
<p>What we've seen so far, though, has been only the bosses leading to one of the eight Nightlords, so there's still potential for the likes of Malenia or Maliketh to show up in the base game. We've seen nothing of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> though, so perhaps the DLC could add Messmer or other bosses from the expansion, alongside more enemies from past games?</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">Elden Ring Nightreign hands-on preview</a>, there's plenty of potential for FromSoftware to expand the game into a full live-service offering with constant updates and challenges. However, the existence of (presumably paid) DLC suggests this will be a fixed release instead.</p>
<p>We'll know more by the time Nightreign releases on 30th May this year. Did you get into the network test? What did you think?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-issues-update-on-rares-long-in-development-everwild<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We can give those teams time…"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">What happened to Rare’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/everwild">Everwild</a>? It’s been over five years since the game was announced back during Microsoft’s X019 presentation. Repeated no-shows during Xbox showcases and rumors of reboots have caused some to wonder whether Everwild had fallen by the wayside. Not so, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/02/15/xboxera-interviews-phil-spencer/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XboxEra</a>, Spencer listed Everwild as one of the games yet to come out that he was excited for, adding he’d recently visited UK studio Rare, which runs live service pirate adventure game Sea of Thieves, to get a look at Everwild and the progress the developers were making. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, State of Decay is just one of the franchises I love back from the original one, so that one stays on the board. I do think the work that Double Fine’s doing and how Tim [Schafer] kind of solicits feedback from the team. And the other one, I’ll say because I was recently out at Rare. It’s nice to see the team with Everwild and the progress that they’re making.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Spencer said Microsoft had been able to give the developers of those games (State of Decay, the next game from Double Fine, and Everwild) time while still having a packed schedule of releases (bolstered, obviously, by the acquisitions of Bethesda and Activision Blizzard).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can give those teams time,” Spencer said. “And next week I’m going to be up in Vancouver with the Coalition [Gears of War developer] — and how fun is that?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Everwild, it’s faced concern over the years after the aforementioned reboot rumor, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everwild-reboot-matt-booty-comments">which Microsoft has denied</a>, and the exit of creative director Simon Woodroffe in 2020. Rare filled the director's chair with veteran designer Gregg Mayles, who previously worked on Donkey Kong Country, Banjo-Kazooie, Viva Pinata, and Sea of Thieves.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But what is Everwilds? Reports have indicated it’s a third-person adventure game with god game elements, but given how long it’s been in development, that may have changed. The last Everwilds trailer, released in July 2020, carried the following description: “Everwild is a brand new IP from Rare. A unique and unforgettable experience await in a natural and magical world.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has a long list of in-development games, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/perfect-dark-reboot">Perfect Dark reboot</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/future-halo-games-moving-to-unreal-engine-as-developer-343-industries-officially-changes-its-name">the next Halo</a>, and Playground's new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-fable-reboot-shown-off-with-new-trailer-and-a-2025-release-window-xbox-games-showcase-2024">Fable</a> game. Meanwhile, Bethesda is working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-announcement-is-now-as-old-as-skyrim-was-when-the-elder-scrolls-6-was-announced">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, and Activision is of course working on this year's Call of Duty. In the shorter term, id Software's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> launches in May.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
