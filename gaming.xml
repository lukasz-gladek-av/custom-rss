Instead, she tweeted about how she’s not leaving and included an ad for her upcoming advice book. “I have champagne and four generations of Floridians in my veins.

However, during the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://kick.com/adinross/videos/44f70e5c-1021-46d8-bd85-50f1dc27963b&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kick.com/adinross/videos/44f70e5c-1021-46d8-bd85-50f1dc27963b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full seven-hour livestream</a></span>, it’s clear Ross isn’t offering this money to anyone and in fact, was just joking around with a friend. During that same stream, he also told viewers to evacuate Tampa Bay and suggested the hurricane was being used to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@abdenrose/video/7423283240120700190&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@abdenrose/video/7423283240120700190" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“distract”</a></span> people from the upcoming election. So a mixed bag.</p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has reached out to Adin Ross for comment about his stream and statements. </p><p>Even though the offer wasn’t real, that didn’t stop some streamers from claiming that they were streaming live from Florida in the path of the hurricane. One Kick streamer, MikeSmallsJr, claimed to be streaming from Florida with nothing but an air mattress and some snacks. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://kick.com/mikesmallsjr/videos/e537a9a5-9df8-45ed-84bc-067651a8a049&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kick.com/mikesmallsjr/videos/e537a9a5-9df8-45ed-84bc-067651a8a049" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">During one moment of his stream</a></span>, he admitted that Ross’ offer wasn’t real and was taken out of context, but suggested the streamer still should pay him something for what he was doing. </p><p>“At the end of the day, I was the first Kick streamer to do this shit during Hurricane Helene. I’m out here busting my ass to entertain the people,” said MikeSmallsJr. Later he reportedly heard he wasn’t getting anything and wasn’t happy.&nbsp;</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://kick.com/jamesworley&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kick.com/jamesworley" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another streamer, JamesWorley</a></span>, claimed to be streaming during the storm and, when asked what he would do when or if he lost cell service, said: “I guess the stream will end.” A few moments later, his stream cut off. It returned a minute later. </p><p><em>Kotaku</em> wasn’t able to verify their locations, but some did at least seem to be in Florida and were streaming during large amounts of rain. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/hurricane-milton-florida-10-09-24#cm22c79jm00053b6rp12zapy0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/hurricane-milton-florida-10-09-24#cm22c79jm00053b6rp12zapy0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The storm isn’t set to make landfall until 8 p.m. EST</a></span>, though thunderstorms and tornadoes are already covering much of the Sunshine State.</p><p>The reality is that even though Adin Ross didn’t actually offer large sums of money to encourage people to stream through the storm, the comments sadly might have inspired some people to stick around even as a deadly, incredibly powerful hurricane is about to hit where they live. </p><p>For some content creators, a massive hurricane is just an opportunity to risk their lives, troll their viewers, or create “edgy” content while possibly earning more views and subscribers. All of this in an effort to conquer the algorithm and rise above the thousands and thousands of other creators out there, all trying to desperately make money on social media and streaming platforms that, more and more, feel like  sinking ships and not the future of entertainment. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Dragon Age, a series not exactly known for being shy when it comes to chucking in a spider or two, is taking a novel approach to the increasingly common practice of implementing an arachnophobia mode for its upcoming fourth instalment: it's getting rid of all its spiders.
</p>
<p>
That's according to BioWare community manager blackhairvioleteyes (thanks <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-no-spiders-arachnophobic/">TheGamer</a>), who shared the news on the Dragon Age subreddit after fans began <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1fz1yyu/comment/lqz1wbr/">querying the lack of an arachnophobia mode</a> following Dragon Age: The Veilguard's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-five-difficulty-settings-and-a-further-option-to-customise-it-all">accessibility features reveal</a> earlier this week. "No mention of arachnophobia filter," noted redditor ZZssk, to which BioWare's blackhairvioleteyes replied, "No arachnophobia mode because there's no spiders!"
</p>
<p>
The immediate reaction to the news was mixed, albeit good-naturedly. Flyingfalcon01 was, for instance, overjoyed, writing, "Oh thank goodness!! My arachnophobic heart is pleased!", while others lamented the fact this almost certainly means the terrifying <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1doi01b/im_looking_forward_to_seeing_what_these/">spiders-with-human-hands</a> seen in BioWare's early work-in-progress renders got the chop.

<p>
Dragon Age isn't the first game to take an unusual approach to the arachnophobia problem, of course. Developer Coffee Stain opted to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/finally-a-video-game-with-an-arachnophobia-mode">replace spiders with adorable pictures of cats</a> in its automation sim Satisfactory, while Obsidian's Grounded - a game positively bursting with the things - let players dial the spider details all the way back to 'innocuous circle'. Then there was last year's Lethal Company, which imaginatively <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lethal-company-is-taking-a-novel-approach-with-its-new-arachnophobia-mode">replaced all its spiders with the word "spider"</a>, scuttling around the place. Dragon Age: The Veilguard is, however, probably the first game to take the scorched earth approach to solving the arachnid problem (unlike, say, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, which <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spider+Scorpion">stuck a scorpion on a spider</a> and made everything a million times worse).
</p><p>
So arachnophobes rest easy; you'll be able to adventure in spider-free bliss when Dragon Age: The Veilguard launches for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC release on 31st October. And even better news: BioWare's series revival is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">looking pretty good</a>.

<p>If you’re brave enough to delve into the unknown and venture through Silent Hill 2 Remake’s terrifying streets once, you can do it a second time in New Game Plus. It’s not enough to uncover some of the story and its secrets. It would help if you uncovered all of them, and it’s easier to do on a second playthrough. Here’s how the New Game Plus mechanic works!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-new-game-plus-in-silent-hill-2-remake">How to Unlock New Game Plus in Silent Hill 2 Remake</h2>



<p>To unlock the New Game Plus mode, you must first finish Silent Hill 2 Remake in its entirety once. It does not matter which ending you unlock or what difficulty setting you play on; so long as you beat the game all the way through the first time, the mechanic opens up for a second playthrough.</p>



<p>Once you finish the credits, navigate to the main menu. Upon selecting New Game, you can start either a standard playthrough or the newly unlocked New Game Plus.</p>



<p>Afterward, be careful which save file you load. Your New Game Plus file will be marked as such, while the regular playthrough will not have any such description by the file name.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-different-in-silent-hill-2-s-new-game-plus-mode">What’s Different in Silent Hill 2’s New Game Plus Mode?</h2>



<p>In most video games, New Game Plus enhances the player’s character, making them more potent than ever by retaining skills and weapons or unlocking unlimited ammunition. However, that’s not the case in Silent Hill 2. Instead, New Game Plus unlocks additional filters, items, and a couple of unique endings that are only available in this mode.</p>



<p>You’ll receive a total of 10 filters, eight endings, and a single new weapon. The Chainsaw is overpowered and fun to use, but it’s somewhat game-breaking. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, nothing whatsoever transfers over, so don’t expect to keep your current weapons and ammunition. You’ll start fresh!</p>



<p>Is New Game Plus worthwhile in Silent Hill 2? Let us know in the comments below, or start a discussion on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forums</a>!</p>

<p>Did you hear <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-is-exclusive-to-ps5-for-a-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill 2 Remake is exclusive to PlayStation 5</a> for the next year? That’s a long time for Xbox Series X|S fans to wait!</p>

If you're a big fan of racing games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/gran-turismo">Gran Turismo 7</a> or <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> and you've been using your standard PS5 or Xbox controller this entire time, then this sale might be the excuse you experience greater immersion in racing games for the first time.</p><p> Standout features include a gorgeous hand-stitched leather racing wheel with 900 degrees of rotation, sturdy metal base, durable steel ball bearings in the shaft, gear-driven dual-force motor feedback, stainless shifter and pressure sensitive pedals. The force feedback does an excellent job of simulating providing force and resistance and certain adds to the immersion; if you want something better than this, you'd have to shell out a lot more money for a direct-drive or belt-driven wheel, like Logitech's own <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wGVbD?object_uuid=5a094290-9a3d-4de0-a666-e824dffd9e28&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$1,000 G Pro</a> direct-drive <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/logitech-g-pro-racing-wheel-review">racing wheel we reviewed</a>.</p><p>The G29 is a bit nicer than the Xbox's G920 variant. The G29 has LED shift lights located on the top of the wheel's spokes. These LEDs light up progressively as the car's RPMs rise in-game. The G29 also has a rotary knob on the wheel that can be customized to different functions, like traction control, brake bias, or split differential.</p><h2>20% Off Logitech G923 TRUEFORCE Racing Wheel</h2></div><div id="208786" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="2c6b7e67-5eaa-4e3d-8abc-05a8d4e1810e"><p><h3>Logitech G923 TRUEFORCE Racing Wheel, Pedals, and G Driving Force Shifter</h3></p></div><div catalogid="2c6b7e67-5eaa-4e3d-8abc-05a8d4e1810e" id="208787"><div id="208787" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Logitech G923 TRUEFORCE Racing Wheel, Pedals, and G Driving Force Shifter</h3></p></div><p>The Logitech G923 (one of the best accessible racing wheels for both the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-racing-wheels-for-xbox-series-xs">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-racing-wheels-for-ps5">PS5</a>) is a newer model released in 2020 that is based off the G29 wheel. The biggest upgrade of the G923 over its predecessors is its TRUEFORCE technology. New vibrational motors built into the wheel adds haptic feedback on top of the DRIVING FORCE force feedback. Since immersion is the name of the game (and a big reason why many higher-end wheels cost hundreds more), this is a more significant change than it sounds on paper. In his <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/logitech-g923-review">Logitech G923 review</a>, Luke Reilly writes "The Logitech G923 is a great option for new racing game players who want a wheel that's a step up over the budget option... For a budget-friendly price, this wheel with a full metal pedal set lets you feel the intricacies of the road thanks to geared force feedback and Trueforce technology." </p><p>If you're looking for deals on other PS5 accessories, check out the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-prime-day-ps5-deals-october-2024">best Prime Day PS5 deals</a> going on right now (we update it often).

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> developer Bungie has teamed with Discord for one of the chat app's video game "quest" advertisements, offering players a free shader if they log in to its newly released content season, Revenant.</p><p>The blue-ish shader is called Celestial Ties, released during the Season of the Lost in 2022, and earning it is pretty easy if you're a Discord user, requiring you only to play Destiny 2 for a total of 15 minutes. Once that's done, you can redeem the quest in Discord for a redemption code to use on Bungie's website to receive the shader. It's altogether pretty easy--I completed the quest and got my shader before I was finished writing this article.</p><p>Here's what Celestial Ties looks like applied in action.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382164-20241009133907_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382164" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382164-20241009133907_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382164"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382164-20241009133907_1.jpg"></figure><p>Discord recently began offering "quests" to users as a new approach to advertising on the app, which, if you're somehow not familiar, offers voice and text chat functions and is often used as an alternative to in-game chat features. Quests encourage you to play a specific game while logged into the Discord app. The rewards quests offer vary, but several have previously provided users with icons or graphics to add to their Discord user avatars. The Destiny 2 quest is the first I've seen to offer an in-game item.</p><p>The quest works on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PS5, and is available to complete until October 22. Once the actual quest is done, you have until December 31 to redeem your shader.</p><p>Though it's easy to complete, you first have to find it on Discord to start it, which can be tough if you don't know where to look for it. Quests are kept in Discord's "Discover" tab, located under a little compass-like icon at the bottom of your list of servers and contacts on the left side of the app. Inside, you can find the quest for Revenant, but you have to click "accept" to activate it and set whether you'll play on PC or console.</p><p>Once that's done, your only requirement is to play Destiny 2 for 15 minutes with Discord running simultaneously. You'll receive a prompt on Discord to redeem the quest when it's done, which provides a code you can take to the Bungie redemption website, bungie.net/redeem. You need to link your Bungie and Discord accounts, though, and to log in on the Bungie website.</p><p>Inside Destiny 2, you can grab the shader from Special Deliveries kiosk in the Tower, located between Banshee and Cryptarch Rahool.</p><p>Revenant brings a lot of new content to Destiny 2, so check out our guide on what's new in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-onslaught-salvation-guide-potions-banes-and-new-defenses/2900-5849/" data-ref-id="2900-5849">Onslaught: Salvation activity</a> and the rest of our Destiny 2 coverage.</p>

                <p>The closed beta for NFL Primetime Fantasy is out now on Android devices. Ubisoft's take on fantasy football was announced back in August, introduced as a free-to-play game for both Android and iOS where you create a roster of players using collectible cards and compete with others online. While the NFL is already on Week 6 of the season, the beta should provide a glance at what to expect once the game releases later this year.</p><p>After pre-registering on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubisoft.nfl.primetime.fantasysports.football.live" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>, you'll have to wait and see if you're selected for the beta. If so, you'll receive an invite notification to download the game from the Android store. The same can be done on the <a href="https://register.ubisoft.com/primetime-fantasy?_gl=1*1l1s88u*_gcl_au*MTk5MTUzNDY2MC4xNzI4NTAwNjE4*_ga*MTA2NDgxNzAyOS4xNzI4NTAwNjE5*_ga_C4N5020N2R*MTcyODUwMDYxOC4xLjEuMTcyODUwMTczNC42MC4wLjA." data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">App Store</a>, but there's currently no closed beta for Apple devices. Pre-registering also guarantees an early access bundle at launch for both platforms, which will include x100 Adrenaline to enable modifiers during live games, as well as one Classic+ card pack with a Dynasty premium card guaranteed in it.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ItgPAy0q_I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9ItgPAy0q_I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As for what to expect in terms of gameplay, collectible cards have individual stat boosters that can be leveled up. You can then register lineups for multiple games in a weekend or just hop in alongside a specific team on Sundays. As expected, there are leaderboards to compete with others online and, well, microtransactions, although it's early to say how much you'll be able to ignore them.</p><p>If you want to scratch the NFL itch further, in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-25-review-gridiron-grates/1900-6418271/" data-ref-id="1900-6418271">Madden NFL 25 review</a>, Mark Delaney scored it a 6/10, highlighting the on-field gameplay, collision variety, and Team Builder mode. "I've played over 30 hours of Madden 25 so far, and I will play hundreds more before next August, at which point I will get the newest Madden and undoubtedly do it all over again," Delaney wrote. "In the end, maybe that's the real Madden Curse."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-system-requirements/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Can you believe the original Red Dead Redemption launched on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in May 2010? That’s such a long time ago, an entire lifetime for some players, and now we’re about to get the title on PC after more than a decade. To ensure you’re ready, here’s a look at the Red Dead Redemption system requirements!</p>



<h2 id="h-red-dead-redemption-minimum-and-recommended-system-requirements">Red Dead Redemption Minimum and Recommended System Requirements</h2>



<p>As a more than decade-old game, you wouldn’t expect something like Red Dead Redemption to tax your system. Well, it doesn’t. The open-world game’s system requirements prove relatively approachable, for the most part, with most systems able to easily handle even the recommended requirements.</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 64-Bit</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel® Core™ i5-4670 / AMD FX-9590</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 / AMD Radeon R7 360</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 12 GB Available Space (SSD Recommended)</li>

Wizards of the Coast's iconic fantasy TTRPG will be a part of the park's newest event. The aptly titled Universal Fan Fest will bring several beloved nerd properties to life in a new after-hours event.</p>
<h2>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Universal Fan Fest Announcement</h2>
<p>According to its <a href="https://www.universalstudioshollywood.com/web/en/us/things-to-do/events-and-seasonal-activities/fan-fest-nights">official event page</a>, the Universal Fan Fest will celebrate several beloved sci-fi, fantasy, and anime properties through immersive live experiences, themed-food, and exclusive merchandise.</p>

They will help the Harpers save the city of Waterdeep from the machinations of the mercenary leader, Xanathar.</p>
<p>But the Forgotten Realms won't be the only experience at the event. Attendees can also embark on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-trek-panic-review-she-cannae-take-anymore" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Star Trek's</em></a> iconic Enterprise-D bridge, join Luffy's crew for a <em>One Piece</em> pirate adventure, and witness an epic sorcery battle from the world of <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>.</p>
<p>The Universal Fan Fest is by the same creators as Halloween Horror Nights. This is another after-hours Universal Studios Hollywood event dedicated to Haunted House attractions based on horror properties like <em>Ghostbusters</em>, <a href="https://blog.discoveruniversal.com/events/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-strangerthings-4-house-at-halloween-horror-nights-2023-hhn/"><em>Stranger Things</em></a>, and <a href="https://halloweenhorrornights.fandom.com/wiki/Welcome_to_Silent_Hill_(Orlando)"><em>Silent Hill</em></a>.</p>
<p>Further details are scarce on <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Universal Fan Fest. According to an official <a href="https://x.com/UniStudios/status/1844061649327526162">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter), the event will be live between April 25 and May 18 2025. There is currently no information on ticket prices or pre-order details.</p>

<p>On the more academic side, Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-dd-adopt-classroom-partnership" rel="noopener" target="_blank">has continued</a> to leverage the creative application of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> in a classrom context.</p>
<p>The studio has recently partnered with the group Young Minds Inspired to create <a href="https://ymiclassroom.com/lesson-plans/places/"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Places, Cities, and Worlds</em></a>. It's a set of resources designed for students grades 3-5 and 6-8.</p>
<p>The goal of the kit is to get students to explore the role of settings in storytelling through the collaborative power of TTRPGs. It is designed to encourage creative thinking and narrative writing skills.</p>

Past examples I can think of include<em> Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</em>—which forced co-op players to whisper in-game to avoid enemies hearing them—and <em>Manhunt</em>—which let you use the mic to distract deadly guards. <em>Alien Isolation</em> also included a mic detection feature, too. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-2-sequel-confirmed-announced-sega-ca-1851666754&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-2-sequel-confirmed-announced-sega-ca-1851666754">Hopefully, it’s also in the just-announced sequel</a></span>. </p><p>I’m all for these weird features as they add a whole new layer to the gameplay.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bolt-action-3rd-edition-review-snapping-into-action<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the world of historical miniature wargaming, there are few conflicts that quite capture the imagination of gamers quite like World War II - and for those gamers, one of the most popular games on the market is <i>Bolt Action</i>. Warlord Games just released a new edition of the game, and they sent me a copy to review. Could this be a good entry point into historical wargaming? Read my <i>Bolt Action</i> 3rd Edition Review to find out!</p>

<p>First developed by Alessio Cavatore and Rick Priestley in 2012, <i>Bolt Action</i> is a 28mm miniature wargame taking place across the span of WWII. And while Warlord Games creates many different models for a wide array of armies, the game itself is technically manufacturer agnostic. As long as your miniatures are 28mm scale and set on round 25mm bases, there’s nothing saying you can’t use them.</p>
<p>In the game, players will collect, build, and paint armies from this era, clashing against one another on the tabletop. And while this review is also covering the rules in general, we’re mainly taking a look at <a href="https://us.warlordgames.com/products/bolt-action-battle-of-the-bulge-starter-set-with-hardback-rulebook">the new <i>Battle of the Bulge Starter Set</i></a><i>.</i></p>
<h2><b>What’s Included in the <i>Bolt Action Battle of the Bulge</i> 3rd Edition Starter Set?</b></h2>
<p>Included in the <i>Bolt Action</i> <i>Battle of the Bulge</i> 3rd Edition Starter<i> </i>Set are the Bolt Action A5 rulebook (this is the entire rulebook, condensed into a smaller sized softcover book), a starter scenario and assembly booklet, Bolt Action dice, and six-sided dice.</p>
<p>On the miniatures front, we get 24 hard plastic US Winter Army infantry models (on 4 sprees), 18 hard plastic German Winter Fallschirmjäger paratrooper models (on 3 sprues), 1 hard plastic M8 Greyhound armored car (can also make an M20 scout car) with a transfer sheet, 1 hard plastic Ruined Farmhouse terrain piece, plenty of pin markers, and templates for heavy explosive attacks.</p>
<p>For an extra $50 USD, you can upgrade the bundle to also include a hardcover version of the rulebook. And while I don’t know if I would have upgraded had they not sent me the hardcover, I’m glad to have it - as the text is much bigger and makes leafing through to run down a rule all the easier.</p>
<h2><b>How Do You Play <em>Bolt Action</em> 3rd Edition?</b></h2>
<p>In my opinion, the core of what sets <i>Bolt Action </i>apart and makes it special is the way the game handles activating units. For each of your units on the board, you’ll add a special six-sided die to a bag. Your opponent will do the same with their own (differently colored) dice. Then, someone will reach into the bag and remove one die - whoever’s color is pulled is first to activate a unit. Once that unit has activated, you repeat the process, pulling another die from the bag.</p>
<p>You get to choose which of your units you activate, and you get to choose how you activate them (more on that in a moment), but the thrill of not knowing when you’re going to get to activate adds some really nice tension to the game. This does a really nice job of breaking up the “I Go, You Go” nature of so many miniature wargames.</p>
<h2><b>Attacking in <em>Bolt Action</em> 3rd Edition</b></h2>
<p>When activating units, you’ll fire upon your enemies with various weapons, all of which have different ranges, amounts of dice they roll, armor penetration values (for larger weapons), and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To simplify things a bit, you’ll essentially be doing the following: rolling a collection of d6’s to see if you hit your target, then your opponent can potentially react by hitting the deck (and losing their action), and then you’ll roll for damage, and they’ll roll for cover saves! Each model has 1 health, so one point of damage takes them out. Remove enough units in one go, and you might just scare your enemy off the board if they fail a morale test.</p>
<h2><b>Activating With <em>Bolt Action</em> Dice</b></h2>
<p>The <i>Bolt Action</i> dice - those same custom dice you’ll pull from the dice bag to see who activates first - also tell you the six different actions you can assign to your units. Let’s break it down one by one, because it very cleanly lays out how to play the game!</p>
<ul><li><b>Fire </b>- Unit fires their weapons at full effect</li>
<li><b>Advance </b>- Unit moves their Advance speed (6” for infantry) and then fires<b> </b>(with a -1 penalty to non-Assault weapons)</li>
<li><b>Run - </b>Unit moves at twice their Advance speed</li>
<li><b>Ambush - </b>Unit holds their action and waits to attack</li>
<li><b>Rally - </b>Unit removes all pin markers (pin markers make it harder to shoot <i>and</i> harder to take any action at all)</li>
<li><b>Down - </b>Unit gains either 5+ cover save or (if already in cover) a +2 to their cover save rolls. Also, if they stay Down for two turns, remove all pin markers.</li>
</ul><h2><b>Units Included In the <i>Bolt Action Battle of the Bulge</i> 3rd Edition Starter Set</b></h2>
<p>Now I want to briefly chat about the units included in the <i>Bolt Action Battle of the Bulge</i> starter set. For the American forces, it instructs you to build one NCO unit of three (with quick-bursting SMGs), one 11-man unit, and a 10-man unit. You’ll also build the M8 Greyhound armored truck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of all of the army construction I did with this box, this was the only aspect that gave me trouble. Maybe it’s a skill issue, (though god knows I’ve put together my fair share of confounding Sylvaneth Treelord Ancients) but I seriously struggled to follow along, and ended up with (gasp!) extra parts left by the wayside.</p>
<p>For the German combatants, you’ll build one 3-man NCO team, and then three 5-man Veteran units (Veteran units are harder to hit, and have higher morale). Two of those three units also include a one-shot anti-vehicle weapon, giving them a shot against that Greyhound.</p>
<p>All in all, both sides of the field feel very well-balanced, especially when weapon upgrades are factored in. And the starter scenarios in the assembly booklet help ease you into the game (before, tantalizingly, presenting a final scenario where you need units not included in the starter set).</p>
<h2><b><i>Bolt Action </i>3rd Edition Review - Final Thoughts</b></h2>
<p>Though I didn’t have any experience playing any historical wargaming prior to this, I’ve had my eye on <i>Bolt Action</i> for a long time. For years, words like “accessible” and “fast-paced” have been thrown around when people talk about this game, setting it apart from the (perhaps incorrect) preconception of historical wargames as being a bit stuck in the mud.</p>
<p>When the opportunity to check out <i>Bolt Action </i>3rd Edition came around, I jumped at the opportunity. And what I found in this box is a game that is absolutely engrossing, with an approachable ruleset that doesn’t skimp at all on depth and detail. The rulebook is full of gorgeously painted dioramas and battle scenes, and there’s so much to dig into once you begin building beyond what’s included in the core box.</p>
<p>If I had any critiques of the Starter Set box as a whole, it would be the lack of diversity among models included. While I understand that keeping the models included in the box limited to infantry and one vehicle lessens the amount of rules needed to jump into the game, it would have been nice to see something like a mortar team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, because you’re starting with mostly infantry, playing the game was fun and, yes, fast-paced. The action economy in this game is second-to-none, and rolling a clutch of dice as your soldiers unleash punishing rifle fire is extremely satisfying, every time.</p>
<p>But more important than all of that is that fact that <i>Bolt Action</i> 3rd Edition completely ignited my imagination, and made me want to go out and learn everything I could about these specific WWII battles, and immerse myself in more of the in-depth, tactical history of the war.</p>
<p>That’s the true power of a historical wargame. Sure, <i>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</i> can inspire you to read fantasy literature. And <i>Marvel: Crisis Protocol</i> can inspire you to check out back-issues of your favorite super-heroes. But with a game like <i>Bolt Action</i>, I find myself looking for books to read and movies to watch about The Battle of the Bulge. It’s an experience that can be, for the right gamer, as enriching as it is entertaining - and when that happens, it’s truly something special.</p>

On Wednesday, Nintendo announced, of all things, the “Alarmo” alarm clock. But in classic Nintendo fashion, the clock has some playful tricks.</p><p>The clock responds to your movements, which you can use to snooze your alarm with motion. Its faces feature Nintendo characters from franchises like <em>Super Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em>, and you can set the alarm to wake you up with music from those franchises. The Alarmo can also track how much you move in your sleep.</p><p>The Alarmo — officially, the “Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo” — is available to purchase in “early access” for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers and at the Nintendo NY store.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/humble-games-parent-company-looks-for-assistance-in-laid-off-staffs-new-label/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Although Humble Games helped to publish some fantastic games such as TemTem, SIGNALIS, and Mineko's Night Market, July 2024 saw a huge change within the company that caused uproar across social media. It's no surprise that there was uproar, as Humble Games announced out of the blue that they had laid off their 36 staff in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/humble-games-says-it-is-not-closing-down-just-restructuring/">decision to "restructure" the company</a>. There was a lot of denial that they had laid off all of their staff, but those who worked within the company began to come forward and say their entire team was gone. Today,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-humble-games-staff-found-new-indie-publisher" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Eurogamer announced</a> that the staff who were laid off in July are now partnering up with Ziff Davis, the parent company of Humble Games. Considering that the choice to lay off the staff most likely came from them, this is a bit of a baffling choice to make.</p>
<p>As a result of this partnership, it means those who were laid off from Humble Games now get to continue working with them while working under their new label, the Good Games Group. Considering the harsh choice made to lay off the staff who were working there and helping publish the game, it seems like a bit of a strange decision now to enlist the help of those in the company.</p>
<p>While the games they will be working on and developing will be published under the Humble Games name, it's said that the workers at Good Games Group made this decision to help build up their network of indie developers. With how rough it is in the games industry right now, a decision like that makes perfect sense; it allows familiar faces to work with indie developers who may be treading uncertain ground and also allows the developers to put in a good word for the employees working at the company, which could lead to other projects being taken on in the future.</p>
<p>Although the decision to work with a company that rid them of financial security seems like a bizarre move, it seems like they are now using the collaboration to sway it in their favor, as the header on <a href="https://www.goodgamesgroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the website</a> shows off some of the previous games they worked on over at Humble Games, such as Supraland, SIGNALIS, and Ring of Pain. At the moment, it's unknown what games Good Games Group will be responsible for, as none of their projects are currently listed on the website.</p>
<p>Humble Games hasn't yet made a statement about the new collaboration, but it's uncertain if they will or what role either company will be playing in this collaboration.</p>

Mostly, I was curious about the audio quality. If the speaker in this relatively tiny clock sounds tinny or shrill, that would ruin the whole concept for me.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The top dial is very fun to bop.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Turns out, you don’t need to worry about that. I haven’t tried all of Alarmo’s various sounds, but<strong> </strong>even the <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> theme that plays during the setup process eliminated my worries that it would sound like crap. That setup routine is actually quite lengthy and might prove to be a bit much for a child. You choose the date and time, of course, but you’re also led through configuring the clock’s motion-detection features, which takes a bit of time, and I didn’t see any way of skipping it. Alarmo’s millimeter-wave presence sensor works with bed sizes ranging from twin to king, and the screen is meant to face the middle of your bed.</p><div><figcaption><em>The top dial can display a range of colors.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>GIF: Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The display is not a touchscreen, nor is it round. (And I feel like Nintendo’s promotional video exaggerates its size a little.) It does automatically adjust brightness based on ambient lighting. One fun little detail is that the clock screen and typeface will change depending on the alarm you’ve chosen. Whenever the regular clock is showing, the character onscreen will also move from left to right based on your own movements if you’re within range of the motion sensors. </p><p>You control Alarmo with the buttons up top. The large dial can be turned to navigate menus and pressed to make selections. There’s a back button to the left and a notifications button to the right. I’ve barely used the clock, but presumably, this is where you might get notified about your sleep metrics. (There’s no serious health monitoring or anything like that; don’t expect Mario to warn you about snoring or potential sleep apnea.)</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Hope you weren’t expecting a round display.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The top dial lights up in a range of colors; you’ll see quite a few within the first few minutes of using Alarmo. Aside from the core alarm functionality, Alarmo also has sleep sounds that you can doze off to. Nintendo plans to offer new sounds that can be downloaded to the clock with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.<strong> </strong>(When you access this menu, a prompt advises younger users to seek out a parent or guardian.)</p><p>Is this thing absurdly expensive for what it is? Certainly. But for its demographic, it’s very cute, and there are small, thoughtful Nintendo touches throughout the experience — and I’ve barely dug in.</p><p>Here are some more photos of the $99 Nintendo clock.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Alarmo includes alarms, sleep sounds, and hourly chimes.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Do not make Alarmo ask you twice.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Moving your body quiets the alarm, and getting out of bed stops it completely.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>You’d better not sneak back into bed.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Alarm is powered by a USB-C port. (It comes with a black cable, not the one seen here.)</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Stay tuned for our full review soon.</em></figcaption></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The refurbished console’s landing page states that the systems are “extensively cleaned, tested, and ready for a brand-new home.” Two versions of the PS5 are available refurbished: the base model with a disc drive and the digital one that comes without one.</p><p>That means that if you’re looking to potentially get a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-playstation-slim-release-date-size-comparison-1850926269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-playstation-slim-release-date-size-comparison-1850926269">slim model of the PS5</a></span>, your best bet is just picking up a brand new one at full retail price, though these consoles are <em>also</em> discounted for a short while right now. Otherwise, the only used systems being sold directly by PlayStation are the base versions that first launched in 2020.</p><p>The refurbished model with a disc drive is going for $400, undercutting the cost of a brand new PS5 by about $100.

Both come packing certified PlayStation replacement parts and a one-year warranty in case things go sideways.

Players rampage around a post apocalyptic version of Los Angeles in a first person action role-playing game where killing zombies as creatively as possible is encouraged. "Dead Island 2 is a hilarious gore-fest and a competent zombie-slaying adventure, but lacks creativity outside of its great sense of humor," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-island-2-review">IGN said in our 7/10 review</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Two Point Campus is a college simulation game with an attitude, where players can build their perfect campus and hire their dream team of staff to run it. "The wacky humor might be hit or miss, but as a management sim, Two Point Campus graduates with honors," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/two-point-campus-review">IGN said in our 8/10 review</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil in Me Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The Devil In Me arrived as the final game in Season 1 of The Dark Pictures Anthology from Until Dawn and The Quarry developer Supermassive Games. While the studio is seemingly forever seeking a return to form that was Until Dawn (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-ps5-and-pc-remake-suffers-a-rough-launch">and even its remake has gone down poorly</a>), The Devil in Me couldn't quite fill its shoes. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-dark-pictures-anthology-the-devil-in-me-review">It earned just a 5/10 in IGN's review</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Gris aims to be as much an art piece as a video game, describing itself as a "serene and evocative interactive" where players "explore a meticulously designed world brought to life with delicate art, detailed animation, and an elegant original score." <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gris-review">In our 6/10 review</a>, IGN said: "Gris’s beautiful exterior hides a simple, at times confusing, platformer."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Return to Monkey Island is the highly anticipated follow-up to the beloved Monkey Island series. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-monkey-island-review">It earned an impressive 9/10 in IGN's review</a>. "Return to Monkey Island expectedly comes packed full of smartly crafted puzzles, funny dialogue, and memorable characters," we said. "But as series creator Ron Gilbert returns to the series’ director’s chair for the first time since 1991, it unexpectedly offers a lot of heart, too. It is an adventure gamer’s delight."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>A multiplayer game with as much substance as one of its ghostly adversaries, Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed arrived in 2022 as another in the four versus one formula. Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed is an asymmetrical multiplayer game that’s mostly enjoyable, but badly needs more content," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghostbusters-spirits-unleashed-review">IGN said in our 6/10 review</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Firefighting Simulator: The Squad lets players join a major U.S. city's firefighting team and discover over 40 diverse deployment locations in an environment inspired by the North American west coast. "Equip yourself with authentic firefighting gear such as helmets, firefighter boots, and a breathing apparatus model by well known North American firefighting equipment manufacturers," reads the synopsis.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Off road racing game Overpass 2 has players compete in races and try to set the best time on extreme tracks behind the wheel of powerful and officially licensed ATVs and UTVs. Overpass 2 features 37 vehicles in three different categories, five environments, 31 circuits, and multiple race modes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>On yer bike. Tour de France 2023 is the video game version of, well, the Tour de France 2023. Players can pedal alongside the best cyclists, test their endurance, and show their panache to triumph on the Champs-Elysées.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Wildlands is the open world action game that Ubisoft released in 2017. It has been in the PlayStation Plus Games Catalog before too. "Ghost Recon: Wildlands has issues with repetition, but its co-op antics make it an entertaining military shooter," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-recon-wildlands-review">IGN said in our 7/10 review</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Virtual reality charmer The Last Clockwinder is a whimsical puzzle game about automation, where players must repair the Clocktower: An ancient haven for the galaxy’s plants and seeds built into the trunk of a colossal tree.

With <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-doesnt-leave-room-for-a-dino-crisis-reboot-creator-shinki-mikami-says">a modern attempt apparently shut down because of Monster Hunter</a>, the original is players' best bet for a shot in 2024. "Dino Crisis brings back the stylistic still camera angles, the multi-level labyrinthine structures, and the gallons of blood and gore with all of the shock and suspense that Resident Evil 2 delivered," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/01/dino-crisis-4">IGN said in our 9/10 review from 1999</a>.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/09/348c2c78947b9cb0b049ba2bd2574d6a11a56835-1728493247689.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>In the same month Silent Hill 2 remake was released, players can dip into more classic Japanese horror thanks to Siren also launching into the PlayStation Plus Classic Games Catalog.

Walmart+ members get automatic free shipping, otherwise you'll need to get your order total over $35 to get free shipping (just buy two). SanDisk, which is owned by WD, is the most popular brand of flash memory devices. In fact, all of the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/microsdxc-card-for-nintendo-switch-128gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Nintendo Switch memory cards</a> are actually rebadged SanDisk Micro SD cards.</p><h2>512GB SanDisk Ultra Micro SD Card for $19.99</h2><div id="168464" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Nintendo Switch Compatible</p></div><p><h3>SanDisk Ultra 512GB Micro SDXC Card</h3></p></div><p>The Nintendo Switch and Switch OLED have 32GB and 64GB of internal storage, respectively, some of it reserved for the OS. To give you an idea of how paltry those capacities are, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> uses up 16GB and Breath of the Wild about 13.5GB. If bought digitally, those two games alone would take up all of your internal storage on the OG Switch console. If there's any one <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-accessories">Switch accessory</a> that we think is absolutely required, it's a high-capacity memory card.</p><p>The Steam Deck is equally space constrained. Although it starts out with more base storage (64GB to 512GB), Steam games can easily take up far more space than that base storage. For example, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-steam-deck-games">best games to play on Steam Deck</a> take up over 60GB each. Even if you opted for the 512GB model, you're going to run out of space sooner than you think.

It's compatible with virtually any device that accepts the Micro SDXC card standard including the Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, and the ROG Ally. This is a U1 A1 V10 rated card with up to 120MBps read speeds. There are faster cards out there, but the Nintendo Switch can't take advantage of such speeds.

                <p>Interested in checking out Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for cheap? Then <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGGHMK89?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this bundle</a> available during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Big Deal Days</a> might be your favorite discount of the season. It pulls together an Xbox Controller, Fire TV Stick 4K, and a one-month membership to Game Pass Ultimate for <strong>just $75 (was $137)</strong>. Considering the controller alone retails for $70, this is a pretty awesome price cut.</p><p>Since the Fire TV Stick 4K supports Xbox Game Pass Ultimate via cloud streaming, it’s one of the most affordable ways to check out the service. Keep in mind that you won’t be able to download games like you can on PC or Xbox, meaning your catalog will be limited to titles that support cloud streaming.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4382102-51nhiuvefvl._sl1001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382102" data-ratio="0.56243756243756" data-width="1001" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4382102-51nhiuvefvl._sl1001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382102"></a><figcaption>Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Bundle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4382102-51nhiuvefvl._sl1001.jpg"></figure><p>Thankfully, many of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">best games</a> are compatible with the technology--including Halo Infinite, Fallout 4, Doom Eternal, and Forza Horizon 5.</p><p>This bundle is available in two formats. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGGHMK89?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cheaper option</a> includes an Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K, but for an extra $5 you can upgrade to a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGGG4NNK?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a>. The 4K Max gets you faster performance and support for Wi-Fi 6E, which could be useful for cloud gaming if your router supports the newer technology.</p><h3>Amazon + Xbox Streaming Bundles</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGGHMK89?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K + Xbox Controller + Game Pass Ultimate</a> -- $75 ($<del>137</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGGG4NNK?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max + Xbox Controller + Game Pass Ultimate</a> -- $80 ($<del>147</del>)</li></ul><p>Both bundles also let you choose between a few different Xbox controllers, including Sky Cipher, Velocity Green, Pulse Red, Deep Pink, Robot White, and Electric Volt.</p><p>Changing your controller won’t change the price of your bundle, so opting for the Sky Cipher Special Edition is the best choice. The new controller was released a few months ago and is regularly listed at $70, while the other variants often see $15 discounts.</p><p>If you do pick up this awesome bundle, you should strongly consider pairing it with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-3-months-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-for-50-off-today-only-october-9/1100-6526404/" data-ref-id="1100-6526404">three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>, as it’s on sale for <strong>just $29</strong>.

                <p>Amazon's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Big Deal Days</a> event is in its second and final day, and if you're in the market for a power bank that's compatible with your Steam Deck to extend your play sessions, you're in luck.</p><p>Amazon has the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Antank-Magnetic-Compatible-16000mAh-Detechable/dp/B0BNQFMQP5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Antank magnetic power bank for only $40 right now</a>, which is a nice savings from its normal $60 price point.

Because it's magnetically attached and charged with a USB-C cable, it's not compatible with a Steam Deck protective case, though.</p><p>Also worth noting is that while this is billed as being for the Steam Deck, it can charge other USB-C devices like a phone or an iPad.
