            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s a lot you can say about Ubisoft’s recent decisions, from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/21/ubisoft-major-reorganisation-brings-layoffs-game-cancellations-including-sands-of-time-remake-new-creative-houses/">cancelling games</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/07/ubisoft-close-a-studio-weeks-after-the-workers-vote-to-unionise/">closing studios </a>they have been making big changes, none of which seem to have affected their share price, which has tumbled over 95% over ten years.</p>
<p>But fret not, they have a new release, one that was announced during <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2682515870?t=0h0m1s">Twitch stream</a> that no one appears to have watched.&nbsp;Tom Clancy’s The Division – Definitive Edition is ready for you to download from the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/tom-clancys-the-division-definitive-edition/9pgffb0wzpkh">Xbox Store </a>and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0001-CUSA01262_00-THEDIVISIONDE000">PlayStation Store</a> and includes every single piece of DLC for the ten-year-old game at the bargain price of $49.99/£44.99</p>


<p>So to be clear, this is the first The Division game on PS4/XB1, an online-only multiplayer game that has a player count of just over *checks notes* 700<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/365590/charts/"> combatants on Steam&nbsp;</a>as of the time of writing. The base game has recently been on sale for $4.49. The game is so old that it doesn’t even have cross-play, but PS5 players did get a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/19/the-division-yes-the-first-one-gets-a-ps5-update/">60fps mode back in December.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>At this point I would post the trailer for the Definitive Edition, but it doesn’t exist, so I’m sticking to my standard replacement of kittens.</p>

<p>“Get the complete The Division experience in this Definitive Edition! The base game, all three Season Pass expansions, and multiple cosmetic packs await you,” its description reads on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tom-clancys-the-division-definitive-edition/9pgffb0wzpkh" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tom-clancys-the-division-definitive-edition/9pgffb0wzpkh" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tom-clancys-the-division-definitive-edition/9pgffb0wzpkh">Xbox store</a>. “The Definitive Edition also includes gear sets, weapon skins, and customization options, everything you need to stand out as an elite agent.”</p>

<p>We gave The Division a score of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/03/14/tom-clancys-the-division-review/">8/10 back in 2016 .&nbsp;</a>“At its core, it marries solid cover-based shooting with a loot heavy RPG and an enticingly beautiful setting, but it really comes together when you can team up with friends and take on enemies, whether rebellious AI factions or other agents in the fraught and tense Dark Zone. There are a few foibles, but it’s a game that can easily draw you in and have you playing for hours on end,” said Stefan.</p>
<p>The third game in the series, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/06/the-division-heartland-announced-standalone-free-to-play-game-coming-out-in-2021-22/">The Division Heartland</a> was cancelled by Ubisoft last year, with the publisher saying they would focus on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xdefiant">XDefiant</a> and Rainbow Six.</p>
<p>XDefiant&nbsp;was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-xdefiant-now-delisted-after-just-half-a-year/">shut down eight months later.&nbsp;</a></p>

		<p>Square Enix has announced that their social deduction multiplayer game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/killer-inn">Killer Inn</a> will launch into Steam Early Access on 12th February, with a ‘Free Stay Weekend’ trial and server test coming this week.</p>
<p><iframe title="KILLER INN | Steam???? Early Access Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KDtHM343udQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The muder mystery multiplayer m… game will be playable from 10PM GMT on Friday 6th February through to 9:59PM GMT on Monday 9th February on Steam. Everyone that participates in this trial, and that has played a previous closed beta test will receive a special weapon skin and nameplay banner for the full game.</p>
<p>With The Traitors a global TV sensation that adapts the already popular social deduction games of Werewolves and Blood on the Clocktower, Killer Inn could be a hit for those looking for a similar tone of game. But there’s a big injection of extra action to this particular game.</p>
<p>Players are divided into Wolves and Lambs, with the Wolves trying to kill all of the Lambs, while the Lambs try to gather clues and figure out the Wolves. As players are murdered, clues are left behind that give hints as to who the killer was, helping the Lambs narrow down who the Wolves are. When the Lambs are sure of their opponents, they can try to take them down in armed third person shooter combat, ganging up to take on their rivals with whoever they think are allies.</p>

<p>The game will feature 27 playable characters to unlock whether through play or with an optional in-game purchase, each with two unique abilities. The price during Early Access will be a rather modest £8, while the bundle with two extra playable characters, skins and advanced rule editing feature for custom lobbies comes in at £24 for the first two weeks, thanks to a 10% discount.</p>

<p>Not so black and white</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We're suckers for a good murder mystery game with a funky visual style, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/posthumous_investigation">The Posthumous Investigation</a> looks like exactly that.</p>
<p>This is an upcoming noir thriller from developer Mother Gaia Studio and publisher CriticalLeap, where you'll be trying to solve the murder of Brás Cubas in 1937 Rio de Janeiro. The catch is that you're caught in a time loop, and will have just one day to get to the bottom of things before everything resets.</p>
<p>The thing that immediately caught our eye with this one is the black-and-white visual style, which lends the whole thing a certain <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/return_of_the_obra_dinn">Obra Dinn</a>-esque noir flair that we can't help but enjoy. And with 14 different suspects to follow around the loop, we're anticipating more than a few "a-ha" moments to keep the dopamine levels high.</p>
<p>Here's a quick rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screens, courtesy of CriticalLeap:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Client is the Victim:</strong> Investigate a murder where the only witness is the ghost who hired you.<br>
<strong>Master the Loop:</strong> You have one day to solve the case, but infinite chances. Learn the routines of 14 distinct characters, shadow them through a stylized 1930s Rio, and use knowledge from previous loops to unlock new dialogue paths.<br>
<strong>A Living Literary World:</strong> Inspired by the biting satire of "The Brazilian Shakespeare," Machado de Assis, the game offers a witty, morally ambiguous narrative where no one—not even your client—is completely innocent.<br>
<strong>True Deduction:</strong> No hand-holding. Use your "Thinking Board" to physically connect clues, reconstruct timelines, and identify the killer through pure logic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one arrives on PC at the end of March, and the dev has confirmed that a Switch version is "to follow". Hopefully we won't have to wait too long to see what it's all about.</p>

            <p>
You know, sometimes I wonder if Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone ever sleeps. At any given moment it sounds like he's working on something, whether that be yet another update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valley-creator-breaks-silence-to-shoot-down-myths-about-haunted-chocolatier-including-that-2030-release-rumour">or the definitely still in development, just wait a while you silly sausages</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>. And, as it turns out, somewhere along the line, Barone had even considered making Stardew Valley 2.
</p>
<p>
Speaking in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-turns-10-the-big-concernedape-interview">IGN</a> to commemorate Stardew Valley's impending 10th anniversary, Barone was asked whether or not he'd consider doing a sequel as opposed to more updates. "Yeah, I would," Barone plainly responded. "In fact, I would love to because it would just be fun to work on a whole new set of characters, a whole new world, maybe capture some of that original energy that I had back in 2012, when I started working with Stardew Valley. 
</p>
<p>
"There's something fun about the number of possibilities in a whole new world, which I think would be fun for me. It'd be fun for my team. We'd be really excited about it. It's a bit difficult because people are so attached to Pelican Town and to the villagers in Pelican Town. I do fear a little bit that if it's a whole new cast of characters, people might feel put off by that."
</p>
<p>
Barone also floated the idea of setting Stardew Valley 2 in Pelican Town again, using the same cast but with a new story, but believed he'd have the same problem as just setting it somewhere new. "There was a time where I was starting to work on a Stardew Valley 2, but, I don't know. For various reasons, I moved over to Haunted Chocolatier instead. Haunted Chocolatier you could say is like the Stardew Valley 2, but it's a bit different of a game, so we'll see."
</p><p>
On making that comparison between Haunted Chocolatier and Stardew Valley 2, Barone noted later in the interview how he knows people are expecting his successor game to essentially be a sequel to the beloved farming game, something that weighs on him quite heavily. "That's been a constant struggle is like, 'Do I just do whatever I want and not think about the existing player base or do I try to please the existing player base?' And I feel like there's just going to have to be a little bit of a balance between those things."
</p>
<p>
The full interview is worth a read, as Barone is quite candid about a lot of his feelings and process towards Stardew Valley. Glad it's him making the thing and not me, sounds like a nightmare.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Barbie maker Mattel announced that it’s planning to make a live-action movie based on Tony the Tattooed Man, one of the company’s biggest flops ever. It’s yet another example of the toy giant tossing everything at the wall as it desperately tries to create another <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-barbie-movie-makeup-flash-games-y2k-lost-media-pc-1850680031"><em>Barbie</em></a>-sized movie success.</p> <p>On February 3, <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/tony-the-tattooed-man-tracie-laymon-directing-mattel-movie-1236707313/"><em>Deadline</em> confirmed that Mattel</a> has teamed up with up-and-coming director Tracie Laymon to develop a live-action film based on the toy maker’s failed 1992 product. The toy, <a href="https://failure.museum/tony-the-tattooed-man-1992/">which was quickly pulled from shelves after parents complained</a>, allowed children to cover a nearly nude man in tattoos that could also be applied to kids themselves.</p>

 <p>Making a movie out of this toy is a wild idea that seems destined to fail, assuming it ever even happens. But things get even wilder and funnier when you read the quotes Mattel and the director provided to <em>Deadline</em> about the toy and the film. These are all real, folks!</p> <p>“After seeing <em>Bob Trevino Likes It</em> [Laymon’s recent Sundance flick] and the specificity and emotional depth that Tracie brings to her characters, I knew that she was the perfect person to develop Tony the Tattooed Man,” said Robbie Brenner, Mattel Studios’ President and Chief Content Officer. “It’s a story that feels especially relevant today, one that explores looking beyond first impressions and leading with empathy.”</p>

 <p>Keep in mind, we are talking about a toy that nobody remembers, that Mattel only released in an odd attempt to appeal to boys, and which flopped so hard that buying these figures online is tricky, as they are considered somewhat rare and collectible. With that in mind, let’s check out what the film’s director and writer had to say about the project:</p>

 <p>“I was immediately drawn to Tony the Tattooed Man from the minute I saw his name and then learned about his short-lived journey as a discontinued toy,” said Laymon. “His story is a reminder of the healing power of second chances and not judging a book – or a person – by their cover, a message I believe the world needs right now. It is an honor to partner with Mattel, who are true allies for artists, on a film that will help restore our faith in humanity.”</p> <p>Read those last few words again and truly ponder them. A movie based on Tony the Tattooed Man will “help restore our faith in humanity.” We really do live in the weirdest and worst timeline, huh?</p>

 <p>Perhaps this is all just a way for the people involved to try to get folks talking about the movie. If that’s the case, it worked. Then again, I’ve heard plenty of execs talk earnestly about the dumbest stuff, so I know all of this could also be genuine. Well, as genuine as this crap can be. It all feels like this is a deleted scene from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63br4rwl6IM">Apple TV’s <em>The Studio</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Anyway, good luck, Mattel. I bet this movie will <em>definitely</em> match the success and <a href="https://kotaku.com/barbenheimer-barbie-oppenheimer-meme-wikipedia-war-1850664668">cultural impact of 2023’s <em>Barbie</em></a>. I mean, I won’t make that bet, but if <em>you</em> want to waste your money on it, go ahead. I’ll be there to see whatever arrives in theaters.</p>

          <p>Although it was finally replaced last year by the new Switch 2, the orginal switch isn’t done just yet. Many recent Switch games (and a handful of major updates, like the one for <em>Animal Crossing</em>) have been released in both Switch and Switch 2 editions, and Nintendo continues to sell all editions of the original console as entry-level systems for those who can’t pay $450 for a Switch 2.</p>
<p>The 9-year-old Switch’s continued availability has helped it clear a milestone, according to the company’s third-quarter financial results (<a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203_2e.pdf">PDF</a>). As of December 31, 2025, Nintendo says the Switch “has reached the highest sales volume of any Nintendo hardware” with a total of 155.37 million units sold, surpassing the original DS’s lifetime total of 154.02 million units. The console has sold 3.25 million units in Nintendo’s fiscal 2026 so far, including 1.36 million units over the holidays. Those consoles have sold despite price hikes that Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/citing-market-conditions-nintendo-hikes-prices-for-original-switch-consoles/">introduced in August of 2025</a>, citing “market conditions.”</p>
<p>That makes the Switch the second-bestselling game console of all time, just three years after it became <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/nintendos-switch-becomes-the-third-bestselling-console-ever/">the third-bestselling game console of all time</a>. The only frontier left for the Switch to conquer is Sony’s PlayStation 2, which Sony says sold “over 160 million units” over its long life. At its current sales rate (Nintendo predicts it will sell roughly 750,000 Switches in the next quarter), it would take the Switch another couple of years to cross that line, but those numbers are likely to taper off as we get deeper into the Switch 2 era.</p>

            <guid>1424377</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/google-project-genie-causes-video-game-stocks-crash/">Last week</a>, <strong>Google</strong> debuted its latest <strong>generative AI</strong> experiment, <strong>Project Genie</strong>. It's a tool capable of generating <strong>interactive three-dimensional environments</strong> made <strong>entirely through generative AI</strong> that you can explore for one solid minute.</p>



<p>All you need to do (after paying the <strong>$250 monthly fee</strong> for <strong>Google's AI Ultra</strong> subscription) is write a prompt to start generating your own game-like worlds, but besides the paywall barrier, there are more than a few limitations to this technology in terms of it becoming the new way to make games.</p>



<p>The fact that it runs at a slide-show speed of 24 frames per second, the fact that you can barely interact with anything in the environment, that the worlds it generates are devoid of any kind of level design, or anything to really do in them, all come to mind before getting to the fact that these worlds only live for one minute at a time.</p>



<p>Still, that didn't stop stock market investors from panicking, causing the shares of major video game industry companies like <strong>Take-Two, Roblox,</strong> and <strong>Unity</strong> to take a nosedive, as if investors suddenly believed the age of game development as we've known it was over, and Project Genie was here to usher in a new age.</p>



<p>Obviously, that won't happen, and even if it does, as <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/">SuperJoost Playlist</a> author and co-founder of SuperData Research, <strong>Joost van Dreunen</strong> puts it, "<em>World models like Genie represent meaningful progress in content generation. <strong>But they can't re</strong></em><strong><em>place the creative vision, narrative depth, and intangible elements that make games memorable</em>.<em>"</em></strong></p>



<p>Dreunen, co-founder of one of the foremost video game industry analytics firms, before selling it to NielsonIQ, <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/p/engine-failure">offered his take on Project Genie</a> after it was revealed and so significantly impacted the stock market for a day.</p>



<p>The top-level takeaway is the aforementioned obvious, that GenAI models like Genie cannot do the job of top-tier game developers. "<em>Creating compelling game worlds is harder than it seems</em>," Dreunen writes, "<em>much like how AI can't simply prompt its way to the next great American novel.</em>"</p>



<p>Even as the technology improves over time, as these GenAI models certainly will, so long as major players like Google and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/openai-strikes-300-billion-project-stargate-deal-with-oracle-to-build-next-generation-ai-and-cloud-infrastructure/">OpenAI</a></strong> continue to invest in them, Dreunen argues that people won't want to play the games they generate, because people want to experience what expert artists and creatives can do - not what a piece of software that's only iterating on the actual creativity of humans can do.</p>



<p>There's also the fact that, currently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-to-develop-concept-art-will-use-it-elsewhere/">players</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-is-theft-i-have-to-use-it-otherwise-ill-get-fired-gdc-reports-one-third-of-game-workers-are-using-genai-for-daily-tasks/">game developers</a> have made it clear that they have no serious love for GenAI tech and games made with GenAI. Dreunen cites the downfall of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-coming-ps5-next-year-xbox-port-under-consideration/">InZoi</a></strong>, but you need only look at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-says-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation-over-genai-backlash/">backlash <strong>Larian Studios</strong> faced</a> after it even flirted with the idea of using GenAI for concept art to see how players feel about the technology.</p>



<p>The only hope that GenAI world models like Project Genie and future iterations that will come after it have, if they have any hope at all, is potentially one day making something that people actually want to experience. Even then, it won't come without actual human input, with creatives using technology like Genie as a tool, if these technologies ever do find a place in game development.</p>



<p>"<em>The horseless carriage phase will pass. When it does, the winners won't be those with the fanciest AI tools. They'll be the ones who used those tools to make something genuinely worth playing</em>."</p>

              <p>Can the latest knock-off Vita out of China impress without breaking the bank? Blizzard QA testers win protections against AI and crunch. And <em>Apex</em>&nbsp;<em>Legends</em> will be unplayable on the original Switch starting later this year. Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture is back after unexpectedly taking a day off so this is a bit of a beefier edition.</p> <p>I’m getting to be an old man and recently said “$2 for beans, in this economy?” out loud at the supermarket to nobody in particular. So I feel this <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/miski.bsky.social/post/3mdwvnfrcik24"><em>Earthbound</em> inflation meme</a> deep in my bones.</p> <h2>Anbernic reveals a bunch of new Vita-inspired retro handhelds</h2>  <p>From the Ayn Odin 2 Mini to the Trimu Smart Pro, the market for Vita-likes continues to grow. However, Anbernic, which arguably leads the pack when it comes to new retro and Android-based handhelds, announced new Vita-likes that literally have “Vita” in their names. The RG Vita and Vita Pro come in white and black with some slick little design touches. There’s no pricing yet or specs, so we’ll have to wait to see how they stack up. The Pros look very nice, though. The OG Vita still looks the best, but these should be fun alternatives, at least until Sony announces <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-portable-sony-playstation-handheld-switch-2-1851707119">its own new rumored handheld</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>The Division: The Definitive</em> edition is just a DLC bundle</h2> <p>There was some speculation, and lots of fan copium, <a href="https://kotaku.com/division-3-definitive-edition-remaster-destiny-2000658970">that the recently leaked definitive edition</a> of <em>The Division</em> would be some sort of next-gen port or include new content. Instead, it has appeared on the Xbox store and in the process revealed that it’s simply a new SKU that bundles a bunch of existing DLC for $50. <em>*Long, extended sigh*</em></p> <h2><em>Arknights: Endfield</em>‘s rogue gacha microtransactions, explained</h2> <p>The <em>Genshin Impact</em> meets <em>Factorio</em> action-RPG had to shut off PayPal integration after players randomly got charged thousands of dollars. What happened? “Based on our review, the issue affected 3,429 orders across servers, involving around 1,800 players,” the company told <em>Eurogamer</em> in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arknights-endfield-paypal-problem-explained-80000" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.eurogamer.net/arknights-endfield-paypal-problem-explained-80000" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://www.eurogamer.net/arknights-endfield-paypal-problem-explained-80000">a statement</a>. “The total value of the affected orders was approximately $80,000, with the highest single affected transaction amounting to $5,289.” On the plus side, everyone accidentally defrauded gets their money back and the rewards they were accidentally charged for.</p>

 <h2>Nintendo’s Switch 2 Edition strategy lowkey sucks</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Getting hands on (head on? 🤔) with the Virtual Boy attachment for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoSwitch</a> Online. <a href="https://t.co/8dL44ZQRUa">pic.twitter.com/8dL44ZQRUa</a></p> <p>— GameSpot (@GameSpot) <a href="https://twitter.com/GameSpot/status/2018697252156424389?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Okay, that sounds harsh, but I think <em>IGN</em>‘s Logan Plant makes a compelling case for it. Nintendo held a recent round of media previews for its upcoming late winter and early spring lineup. The optional Virtual Boy attachment sounds <a href="https://twitter.com/GameSpot/status/2018697252156424389?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2018697252156424389%7Ctwgr%5E94b492268872a61b9810d9c128ea6ba1a6c9f1cf%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2000665133action%3Dedit">too uncomfortable</a> to be worth $100 for an authentic way to experience such a random assortment of subscription-only games. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/mario-tennis-fever-preview-switch-2/">The new <em>Mario Tennis</em> <em>Fever</em></a><i> </i>sounds fun, but not necessarily like the Switch 2’s first killer multiplayer game. And what about the curious Switch 2 upgrade for <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>?</p>

 <p>Its new edition includes some extra modes, bosses, and multiplayer minigames. “Nothing here comes close to justifying the $80 price tag attached to <em>Mario Wonder</em>’s Nintendo Switch 2 Edition,” <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-already-tired-of-nintendo-switch-2-editions-and-even-new-mario-wonder-content-cant-change-that">Plant writes</a>. “Yes, there’s a $20 upgrade pack for folks who already own <em>Wonder</em>, but for new buyers, a visually upgraded version of a 2023 Switch 1 game with a few new Bellabells and whistles costs more than 2025’s Switch 2-exclusive <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, which just feels completely out of whack.”</p> <h2>Blizzard QA testers ratified their first union contract</h2> <p>It guarantees annual wage increases, protects against mandatory crunch, and includes guardrails for how genAI is used. “After nearly two decades in the video game industry, it feels great to work with my fellow union members in ratifying a fair contract that makes it easier to see a real, long-term career in this work,” Blizzard Austin senior quality analyst Matt Gant <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/blizzard-quality-assurance-workers-ratify-video-game-union-contract-microsoft">said in a press release</a>. “This agreement gives us a better working environment with increased pay, benefits, and layoff protections that include recall rights and ensures that quality assurance work remains a stable and respected role for the workers who will build games long after us.”</p>

 <h2>Sony patents an endlessly customizable PlayStation controller</h2> <p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-has-patented-a-touchscreen-playstation-controller-that-lets-players-choose-where-to-put-the-buttons/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a> on a new PlayStation controller patent that turns the whole thing into a touchpad. It was filed back in 2023 and covers “designs and methods for a game controller.” Instead of remapping the individual buttons, the patented design would allow players to customize where the buttons themselves go. “Due to the size of physical control elements, game controls may be limited. In addition, inclusion of controls can increase controller size,” it reads. “There exists a need and a desire to allow for improvements and modifications to game controllers.” Probably not actually happening anytime soon, but it’s a neat idea!</p> <h2><em>Apex Legends</em> is quietly ditching the OG Switch</h2> <p><a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/2017296851247018038">Respawn announced the move</a> late last week, with season 29 being the final season update to come to the older hardware. “Starting August 4, 2026 (Season 30), <em>Apex Legends</em> will no longer be playable on the Nintendo Switch system,” the studio wrote. “Until August 4, 2026, players can continue to jump into the action, earn rewards, and enjoy matches per usual.”</p> <h2>How does Larian’s new RPG end?</h2> <p>“With a lot of fire.” The tease came from CEO Swen Vincke <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNKGRnvy5ds">during a studio livestream</a> of <em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em> on Switch 2. He also confirmed the game’s ending will include credits and be dependent on players’ choices. Bold reveals!</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-ai-art-banner-ad-confirms-discord-message-small-team-slop-2000665056"><strong>GOG did use AI for a game banner ad but actually releasing it was an accident</strong></a></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-tales-85-animated-series-trailer-netflix-2000665051"><em>Stranger Things</em> is getting an animated series to save its legacy</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/crunchyroll-price-increase-us-fan-tier-march-streaming-anime-2000665126">Anime streaming monopoly Crunchyroll is raising prices</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

<figure data-uuid="8dfe57f054943"><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined Ruff" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8dfe57f054943/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-ruff.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>2026 marks 40 years of the <strong>Dragon Quest</strong> series, a staggering achievement for one of the RPG genre's biggest and brightest. Known for its cosy atmosphere, warm character, humour, and iconic art, Dragon Quest is due a big year, and Square Enix is kicking things off with a brand new "reimagining" — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined.</a></p>
<p>Bringing what is regarded as one of the longest RPGs of the PlayStation era to Switch 1 and Switch 2, Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined has attracted joy — and a few raised eyebrows — for streamlining events and making a few tweaks to the game. What was a 100+ hour experience (or 70-ish-hours on 3DS) is now much leaner. So, how to you retain the magic when you're trying to appeal to new audiences, but make sure that old fans are satisfied?</p>
<p>We had a chance to ask the game's producer, Takeshi Ichikawa, a few questions about the upcoming reimagining — which, for the record, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">we absolutely loved</a>. Ichikawa has worked on the Dragon Quest series since 2018, starting out with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_builders_2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a> as an assistant producer.</p>
<p>As a long-time fan of the series, we asked him about his experience with the original PS version, what changes were difficult to make, and whether the team got to share their work with the series' artist, the late Akira Toriyama.</p>

<p><strong>Nintendo Life: Before we dive into Reimagined, can you share with us the first time you experienced Dragon Quest VII, and what you thought of the game - PlayStation or 3DS version?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Takeshi Ichikawa, Producer of Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined:</strong> I was in the lower grades of elementary school when I first played the PlayStation version. I remember thinking at the very beginning, “When will the battles start?” and I don’t think I managed to clear the whole game back then.</p>
<p>When I played it again as an adult, I was able to complete it successfully, and I found the dark world filled with irrationality especially striking and modern.</p>
<figure data-uuid="84316e918d5fb"><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/84316e918d5fb/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>There’s a lot of pressure to keep the traditions of Dragon Quest intact while modernising certain aspects. How do you juggle those expectations with a game like Dragon Quest VII Reimagined?</strong></p>
<p>As a major title with a passionate fanbase, there was certainly pressure. However, the excitement of being able to deliver this beloved franchise in a way that feels fresh outweighed it, and I believe we were able to enjoy the development process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I remember thinking at the very beginning, “When will the battles start?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Having worked on previous Dragon Quest games before in various different ways, how different is it working on a remake like Reimagined to say, a mainline entry such as Dragon Quest XI or a spin-off like Dragon Quest Builders 2?</strong></p>
<p>In a remake, we believe it’s essential not only to offer players a fresh experience but also to preserve the charm of the original version. Striking the right balance between these two is crucial.</p>
<p><strong>Given that it’s a big year for Dragon Quest in 2026 with the 40th anniversary, why is this year the right time to return to Dragon Quest VII? And why kick off the celebrations with this one?</strong></p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII: Fragments of the Forgotten Past originally released in 2000 - so this year is its 26th Anniversary! Because of this, we felt it was the perfect time to bring its storytelling and unique atmosphere to a wider audience - especially now, in today’s world.</p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined not only “reimagines” the story and emotional portrayal of its characters but also makes the game significantly more approachable and accessible. We believe this game will be enjoyable for both previous DRAGON QUEST VII players and newcomers alike!</p>
<figure data-uuid="e6e3829828eaf"><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e6e3829828eaf/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What attracted you to the diorama style that’s used in Reimagined? Why did you decide to go with something completely different, as opposed to the HD-2D style used for Dragon Quest III and Dragon Quest I &amp; II?</strong></p>
<p>The original DRAGON QUEST VII was defined by Akira Toriyama’s designs, featuring charming, stylized characters. We considered how to convey that cuteness while still capturing the game’s unique atmosphere.</p>
<p>At the same time, we discovered that movies and games featuring doll motifs were well-received globally, which inspired us to combine this concept with DRAGON QUEST VII’s character designs. We felt this approach would create a visually appealing style, leading to the visual expression seen in the game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we never had the opportunity to show this work to Toriyama. However, as mentioned earlier, we kept in mind throughout production that the visual style needed to match the charm of his adorable illustrations.</p>
<p><strong>Dragon Quest is usually known for being lighthearted and charming – at least, it always feels very cozy to us! But Dragon Quest VII is often considered one of the darker entries. How do you balance this and do you make any changes in Reimagined to lean more one way rather than the other?</strong></p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII is a work whose appeal lies in two aspects: the irrational and dark scenarios encountered throughout the journey, and the exciting coming-of-age story of an ordinary boy growing into the savior of the world. This title preserves that appeal while reimagining it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8152e720c2622"><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8152e720c2622/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You’ve talked about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/11/10/heres-how-the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-team-streamlined-its-main">streamlining the game’s narrative</a> and the discussions you had on which scenarios you wanted to keep, rather than get rid of. How tough was it to cut the sections you eventually settled on, and do you have a favourite that was a must-keep for the final game?</strong></p>
<p>We felt that reimagining the scenario was necessary to create a more fast-paced and immersive narrative experience. Throughout the process, we consciously made adjustments to ensure that the original version’s unique atmosphere and core story remained intact.</p>
<p><strong>If you were to sum up Dragon Quest VII Reimagined in one sentence (or one word if you want a challenge), what would it be?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, we never had the opportunity to show this work to Toriyama.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This title allows you to experience the irrational nature of the world and the exciting story of growth that lies beyond.</p>
<p><strong>And finally, to wrap up this interview, what does Dragon Quest mean to you? And how will you be celebrating the 40th anniversary?</strong></p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII is the story of the growth of a boy from humble beginnings, and I hope that, through developing this title, I too have grown. I would be delighted if this game could serve as the beginning of delivering a wonderful 40th anniversary celebration of DRAGON QUEST to everyone.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>This interview has been slightly edited for clarity and flow.</em></p>
<p>Thank you to Ichikawa-san and the team at Square Enix for making the time to speak to us.</p>
<p>Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined launches on Switch 1 and Switch 2 on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>. Will this be your first time playing the game, or did you play it on PlayStation or 3DS? Let us know down below!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Crimson Desert Surpassed 2M Wishlists; Rep Says It’s in the Middle Between The Witcher 3 and Breath of the Wild]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-2-million-wishlists-middle-the-witcher-3-zelda/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>South Korean developer <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> <a href="https://x.com/CrimsonDesert_/status/2018685912973242632?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced today</a> that the upcoming open world action/adventure game <strong>Crimson Desert</strong> has been wishlisted by <strong>over two million users across all platforms</strong>. </p>



<p>It is yet another strong confirmation of the mounting hype behind Crimson Desert. It's been a while since the market got a fantasy triple-A open world game of this scale (<strong>the world is said to be twice as big as Skyrim's</strong>), after all, and fans can't wait to get their hands on the game after many years of development.</p>



<p>Thankfully, in addition to celebrating wishlist milestones, Pearl Abyss is still sharing little nuggets about the game to keep players hooked until the <strong>March 19</strong> launch date. Just yesterday, we reported <span>on an interview in which PR Director&nbsp;<strong>Will Powers</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-campaign-very-small-percentage-of-content/" target="_blank">discussed the extensive amount of content players will encounter</a></span><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-campaign-very-small-percentage-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> beyond the main campaign</a> in Crimson Desert.</p>



<p>Now, another interview featuring Powers has appeared on YouTube. This time, the PR Director <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dacjty4cYE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was hosted by Luke Stephens</a>, who at some point said he felt the game leaned more toward Nintendo's <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong> than CD Projekt RED's <strong>The Witcher 3</strong> in terms of gameplay dynamics versus narrative. The Pearl Abyss rep countered that <strong>Crimson Desert is actually squarely in the middle between those two open world masterpieces</strong>:</p>



<p><em>If you're going to do it a scale from one side to the other.... There's narrative driven cutscenes in there, too, so I don't want to put it on the far scale there because it's much more in the middle. In The Witcher 3, what drives you through that game is the story. First and foremost, that is a story-driven game. CDPR has created this immersive, amazing, story-driven world. We sit in between those. Is it more one or the other? It's literally right in between because you have that central thread that's pulling you through it, but then there's those narrative-driven like cinematics and everything that are very heavy story. But it's not like The Witcher 3 in the sense that CDPR's game is story, story, story focused.</em></p>



<p>Of course, that's not to say the game's overall quality will be comparable to those two. The Witcher 3 and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild are <strong>two of the highest rated open world games ever made</strong>, only comparable to <strong>Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto</strong> and <strong>Red Dead Redemption</strong> franchises in this regard. Pearl Abyss would likely be happy just with getting relatively close in terms of critical reception.</p>

            <p>
The purpose of a Tamagotchi is to have a tiny, portable digital pet with you at all times that you can feed and feed and feed until it grows into something slightly bigger, different, a new creature almost. It's generally a sweet, albeit potentially irritating (the beeps…) little micro-game that may cause a touch of stress, but certainly no feelings of fear. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/in-full-bloom">In Full Bloom</a>, however, asks "what if your Tamagotchi was actually a blob of an organism with nothing but a mouth that you must continuously feed… or else…"
</p>
<p>
The Tamagotchi connection to In Full Bloom is an explicit one, the '90s classic toys are directly mentioned on the game's Steam page. Yet instead of finding the likes of Mametchi, or Kuchipatchi, or Ichigotchi, you just have… "the mouth." This mouth is, maybe, I'm not sure, something akin to an amoeba? Or really a lump of flesh adorned with nothing but a single orifice it uses to consume whatever you place inside of it. This, in its totality, is the game.
</p>
<p>
You take your mouse, you click and hold on an object with the left button, bring it to the mouth's mouth, and release. And bit by bit it grows. And you start to notice changes. Those dents, is it forming eyes? Right there… it has teeth now. More teeth. More teeth. Even more teeth, a dentist's nightmare amount of teeth. It continues to get bigger too, so you must feed it larger and larger objects until… well, I'm not sure. There's a demo available to try, but it only goes so far, though judging from the game's page it can get as big as a planet.
</p>
<p>
There is admittedly not much game here on a technical level. Yet it still makes for a deeply uncomfortable experience. Some excellent sound design fuels the sensations from dread as you contribute to this thing's growth. I was left with a few questions from the demo too, particularly around who I am meant to be if there is a person feeding it. Neat stuff! I won't sleep tonight! If you'd like to join me in the night terrors, you can try out the demo, or just wishlist it, on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3810240/In_Full_Bloom/">here</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Rainbow Six Siege Creative Director Stepping Down from Role]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-creative-director-stepping-down/</link>
            <guid>1424329</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a post on LinkedIn, the current creative director for Rainbow Six Siege, Alex Karpazis, revealed he’s stepping down from the role after the Six Invitational wraps later this month. He indicated that Josh Mills, a ten-year veteran of Ubisoft, will be filling his shoes as creative director going forward.</p>



<p>Last year, Karpazis dished on the future of Rainbow Six Siege as ‘Siege X’, the next generation of the popular tactical shooter, arrived. In 2024, he theorized that the game had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-director-siege-last-forever/">the potential to ‘last forever.’</a></p>







<h2 id="h-big-changes-at-rainbow-six-siege">Big Changes at Rainbow Six Siege</h2>



<p>Ubisoft has put a lot of stock in Rainbow Six Siege over the last few years. It’s one of the company’s flagship shooters, and it has enjoyed a ten-year stint in the sun, growing as Ubisoft’s most important esports title and one of the most valuable games in the industry.</p>



<p>Last year, it underwent an overhaul, taking on the form of ‘Siege X’ and staring down the barrel at some immense evolutions.</p>



<p>Now, in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7424497469817790464/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on LinkedIn</a>, Alex Karpazis has revealed he’s pulling away from the series, stepping down from his role of creative director:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Siege is about to embark on Year 11 after celebrating a historic milestone with the 10th anniversary. I am excited to share with you what the team has been working on at the 2026 Six Invitationals this February and I also want to share with you that this Invitational will be my last as the Creative Director of Siege.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then named his replacement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is with great excitement to announce that Joshua Mills will be taking over as the new Creative Director on Siege! Joshua and I have worked together for many years. Not only is he a great friend, but he has proven himself to be a strong leader and a champion of Siege values. We have been working on this transition of responsibilities for over a year, and I am confident he will lead this game to even greater heights.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Karpazis didn’t indicate what he’s going to do next, and it’s not known yet if he’s leaving Ubisoft entirely.</p>



<p>Joshua Mills is a solid replacement for Karpazis. Last year, during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-y10s1-reveal-prep-phase/">reveal of Y10S1</a> of Rainbow Six Siege, Mills presented the future of the franchise on stage, alongside Karpazis, and got visibly emotional about all the team had accomplished with the game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Union Reps Call For CEO Yves Guillemot’s Resignation]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-union-ceo-yves-guillemot-resignation/</link>
            <guid>1424326</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Two union representatives are calling for the resignation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/ubisoft/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> CEO Yves Guillemot.</p>



<p>From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shares-crash-by-30-after-restructure-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">falling share prices</a> to game cancellations to a complete restructuring of the company, Ubisoft has found itself in a precarious situation when it comes to its future. In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-union-representatives-call-for-resignation-of-ceo-yves-guillemot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, Marc Rutschlé and Chakib Mataoui spoke about Ubisoft’s struggles and where the company can go from here.</p>







<p>In short, it starts at the top where a change has to be made.</p>



<p><strong>“It’s his company, at the end of the day,”</strong> Rutschlé said while adding that Guillemot has surrounded himself with “yes men”. <strong>“That was also the issue during the sexual [harassment] scandal in 2020.”</strong></p>



<p>Mataoui then spoke about about Guillemot <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-and-tencent-co-ceos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making his son, Charlie,</a> co-CEO of Vantage Studios. Mataoui believes that the lack of any diversity at the top is what’s keeping the company from making successful games.</p>



<p><strong>“If you just put your white male friends in [those jobs], then you don’t promote any diversity or get any new opinions or ideas,”</strong> Mataoui said. <strong>“We are in a creative job. We need new ideas to come in to [help us] make great new games. But we don’t have that. We don’t have this mindset for creativity.”&nbsp;</strong></p>







<p>Mataoui says it’s a matter of trust within the company. Right now, he says, they don’t trust those in charge to right the ship.</p>



<p>A lot of that, according to the pair, stems from how the company handled the allegations against it in 2020 and beyond. They say that they created <strong>“a workplace where abusers could thrive.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“I think Guillemot should move away at this point,”</strong> Rutschlé said. <strong>“I think the level of hate people have for him [means] he should move on. Then, we could build some sort of trust again.”</strong></p>



<p>Employees at Ubisoft have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employees-vote-to-strike-against-recent-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already voted to strike</a> against the proposed layoffs at the company. From February 10-12, the France-based unions along with their international counterparts plan to strike.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Fallout 3 Remastered Out Now? Shadowdrop Rumors Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-fallout-3-remastered-out-now-shadowdrop-rumors-explained/</link>
            <guid>1424323</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout 3 Remastered is one of the most talked-about topics in the gaming space, and it has been ever since it first surfaced as a rumored release <strong>years ago</strong>. Bethesda Game Studios has kept a tight lid on things, and despite some insider claims and circulating whispers, <strong>almost nothing concrete </strong>has ever been confirmed about the game.</p>



<p>But several topics have emerged recently in the space that have us pondering when will Fallout 3 Remastered be released. It feels like it’s on the horizon, and as the release date of the <strong>final episode </strong>of Fallout’s second season drops, fans everywhere are anticipating a Fallout 3 Remastered shadowdrop.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-fallout-3-remastered-coming-out">When is Fallout 3 Remastered Coming Out?</h2>



<p>At the time of writing, Fallout 3 Remastered <strong>did not </strong>have a release date, but one of the biggest points of debate regarding its seemingly inevitable arrival was drawing to a close.</p>



<p>On the Prime Video website, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-3-remake-not-linked-to-mysterious-countdown/">a countdown has been running</a> for weeks, and while it seems to point to the <strong>end </strong>of the second season of the popular post-apocalyptic television series, many have theorized that it’s actually counting down to the <strong>Fallout 3 Remastered shadowdrop</strong>.</p>



<p>That’s mostly conjecture, but then out came VIRTUOS, a studio that specializes in remasters, to stir the pot:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Welcome back to the Wasteland, vault dwellers! The finale of the second season of Fallout has arrived on Prime Video – catch it today, 3 February 2026 at 6pm PT/ 9pm ET.</p><p>Our team worked on environment art, creating photorealistic landscapes that viewers will encounter throughout… <a href="https://t.co/FHQW4Jxkhr">pic.twitter.com/FHQW4Jxkhr</a></p></div>— Virtuos (@virtuosgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/virtuosgames/status/2018683026184806813?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>VIRTUOS worked on the Fallout show in some capacity, but the team is also known for the delivery of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, which dropped early in 2025 and received global praise.</p>



<p>For now, it’s another arrow in the quiver of those claiming the Fallout 3 Remastered release is drawing extremely close.</p>



<p>Watch this space, because when that countdown expires, we’ll have more to share… Hopefully.</p>

<p>It’s Christmas of 1994, and I am 16 years old. Sitting on the table in our family room next to a pile of <a href="https://www.techspot.com/article/2087-gateway-2000/">cow-spotted boxes</a> is the most incredible thing in the world: a brand-new Gateway 66MHz Pentium tower, with a 540MB hard disk drive, 8MB of RAM, and, most importantly, a CD-ROM drive. I am agog, practically trembling with barely suppressed joy, my bored Gen-X teenager mask threatening to slip and let actual feelings out. My life was about to change—at least where games were concerned.</p>
<p>I’d been working for several months at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/01/how-i-launched-3-consoles-and-found-true-love-at-babbages-store-no-9/">Babbage’s store No. 9</a>, near Baybrook Mall in southeast suburban Houston. Although the Gateway PC’s arrival on Christmas morning was utterly unexpected, the choice of what game to buy required no planning at all. I’d already decided a few weeks earlier, when Chris Roberts’ latest opus had been drop-shipped to our shelves, just in time for the holiday season. The choice made itself, really.</p>

<p>The moment Babbage’s opened its doors on December 26—a day I had off, fortunately—I was there, checkbook in hand. One entire paycheck’s worth of capitalism later, I was sprinting out to my creaky 280-Z, sweatily clutching two boxes—one an impulse buy, <em>The Star Trek: The Next Generation Interactive Technical Manual</em>, and the other a game I felt sure would be the best thing I’d ever played or ever would play: Origin’s <em><a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fwing_commander_3_heart_of_the_tiger">Wing Commander III: The Heart of the Tiger</a></em>. On the backs of <em>Wing Commander I</em> and <em>Wing Commander II</em>, how could it not be?!</p>
<h2>The <em>movie</em> is on my <em>computer!</em></h2>
<p>It’s easy to pooh-pooh full-motion video games here in 2026; from our vantage point, we know the much-anticipated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silliwood">“Siliwood” revolution</a> that was supposed to transform entertainment and usher interactivity into all media by the end of the millennium utterly failed to materialize, leaving in its wake a series of often spectacularly expensive titles filled with grainy interlaced video and ersatz gameplay. Even the standout titles—smash hits like Roberta Williams’ <em>Phantasmagoria</em> or Cyan’s <em>Riven</em>—were, on the whole, kinda mediocre.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But we hadn’t learned any of those lessons yet in 1994, and <em>Wing Commander III</em> went hard. The game’s production was absurdly expensive, with a budget that eventually reached an unheard-of $4 million. The shooting script runs to <a href="https://www.wcnews.com/news/update/11208">324 printed pages</a> (a typical feature film script is less than half that long—Coppola’s working script for <em>The Godfather</em> was 136 pages). Even the game itself was enormous—in an era where a single CD-ROM was already considered ludicrously large, <em>WC3</em> sprawled ostentatiously across <em>four</em> of the 600MB-or-so discs.</p>

      The <em>Wing Commander III</em> opening cinematic in all its pixelated glory.

  </div>
</figure>
<p>That’s <em>Wing Commander III’s</em> epic opening cinematic, upscaled for YouTube. Even without the upscaling and watching it on a 15-inch CRT, I was entranced. I was <em>blown away</em>. Before the credits were done rolling, I was already on the phone with my buddies Steve and Matt, telling them to stop what they were doing and <em>get over here immediately</em> to see this thing—it’s like a whole movie! A movie, <em>on the computer!</em> Surely only Chris Roberts could conceive and execute such audacity!</p>
<p>And what a movie it was, with an actual-for-real Hollywood cast. Malcolm McDowell! John Rhys-Davies! Jason Bernard! Tom Wilson! Ginger Lynn Allen, whom 16-year-old me definitely did not want his parents to know that I recognized! And, of course, the biggest face on the box: Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill, representing <em>you</em>. You, the decorated hero of the Vega campaign, the formerly disgraced “Coward of K’Tithrak Mang,” the recently redeemed savior of humanity, now sporting an actual name: Colonel Christopher Blair. (“Blair” is an evolution of the internal codename used by Origin to refer to the main character in the previous two <em>Wing Commander</em> titles—”<a href="https://wingcommander.fandom.com/wiki/Bluehair">Bluehair</a>.”)</p>

<p>Once the jaw-dropping intro finishes, the player finds Colonel Blair as the newly invested squadron commander aboard the aging carrier TCS <em>Victory</em>, wandering the corridors and having FMV conversations with a few other members of the carrier’s crew. From there, it’s a short hop to the first mission—because beneath all the FMV glitz, Origin still had to provide an actual, you know, <em>game</em> for folks to play.</p>
<h2>Through a rose-tinted helmet visor</h2>
<p>The game itself is…fine. It’s fine. The polygonal graphics are a welcome step up from the previous two <em>Wing Commander</em> titles’ bitmapped sprites, and the missions themselves manage to avoid many of the “space is gigantic and things take forever to happen” design missteps that plagued LucasArts’ <em>X-Wing</em> (but not, fortunately, <em>TIE Fighter</em>). You fly from point to point and shoot bad guys until they’re dead. Sometimes there are escort missions, sometimes you’re hitting capital ships, and there’s even a (very clunky) planetary bombing mission at the very end that feels like it directly apes the Death Star trench run while doing everything it can to shout “NO THIS IS NOT <em>STAR WARS</em> THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT!”</p>

<p>The space combat is serviceable, but the game also very clearly knows why we’re here: to watch a dead-eyed Mark Hamill with five days of beard stubble fulfill our “I am flying a spaceship” hero fantasies while trading banter with Tom Wilson’s Maniac (“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfQ-mF4mZ8M">How many people here know about the Maniac? …what, nobody?!</a>”) and receiving fatherly advice from Jason Bernard’s Captain Eisen. And maybe, just maybe, we’d also save the universe and get the girl—either Ginger Lynn’s chief technician Rachel Coriolis or fellow pilot “Flint” Peters, played by Jennifer MacDonald.</p>

<p>(Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the primary purchasing demographic, players tended to overwhelmingly choose Rachel—though this might also have something to do with the fact that if you don’t choose Rachel, you can’t customize your missile loadout for some important missions near the end of the game).</p>

<h2>Worth a revisit? Definitely!</h2>
<p>I will let others more qualified than me opine on whether or not <em>Wing Commander III</em> succeeded at the game-y things it set out to do—folks looking to read an educated opinion should consult Jimmy Maher’s <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2021/03/wing-commander-iii/">thoughts on the matter</a> over at his site, <a href="https://www.filfre.net/">The Digital Antiquarian</a>.</p>
<p>But regardless of whether or not it was a good game in its time, and regardless of whether or not it’s an effective space combat sim, it is absolutely undeniable that it’s a fascinating historical curiosity—one well worth dropping <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fwing_commander_3_heart_of_the_tiger">three bucks on</a> at the GOG store (it’s on sale!).</p>
<p>There are cheats built into the game to help you skip past the actual space missions, which range in difficulty from “cream puff” to “obviously untested and totally broken” because just like in 1994, what we’re <em>really</em> here for is the beautiful failed experiment in interactive entertainment that is the movie portion of the game, especially when Malcolm McDowell shows up as Admiral Tolwyn and, in typical Malcom McDowell fashion, totally commits to the role far beyond what would have been required to pull it off and turns in his scenery-chewing best. (He’s even better in <em>Wing Commander IV,</em> though we’ll save that for another day.)</p>
<p>You could find a worse way today to spend those three bucks. Slap on that flight suit, colonel—the galaxy isn’t going to save itself!</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-will-carefully-consider-a-switch-2-price-increase-says-furukawa</link>
            <guid>1424293</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="2af72df597d2f"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2af72df597d2f/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's latest financial report <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/switch-2-storms-towards-its-forecast-target-with-17-37-million-units-sold">paints a positive picture for the Switch 2</a>, with the console comfortably outpacing, well, pretty much everything that's come before it. Since launching in June 2025, its now shifted an astonishing 17.37 million units, and is well on track to hit its forecasted target on 19 million for the fiscal year.</p>
<p>However, comments from Nintendo's President, Shuntaro Furukawa, may raise a few eyebrows as we head towards the end of FY2026 and into FY2027 (thanks, <a href="https://jp.reuters.com/markets/world-indices/TUUSCEPJHBPUHI4W2N5VLZTRAA-2026-02-03/">Reuters</a>). Naturally, with memory prices rises exponentially thanks to the advent of AI, questions regarding a potential price increase for the Switch 2 are lingering.</p>
<p>When asked about this, Furukawa provided the most corporate-laced answer imaginable; one that we're certain won't assuage fears anytime soon. He simply said that Nintendo would "carefully consider the matter while taking a comprehensive look at the state of adoption of the platform, current sales trends, costs, profitability, market environment, and other factors."</p>
<p>So it could go either way, then.</p>
<p>As further covered by <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF2760P0X20C26A1000000/">Nikkei</a>, Furukawa also concedes that the rising memory prices may impact the company's financial performance in the future, though there are no immediate risks for the remainder of the fiscal year. When discussing the upcoming financial year, Furukawa said "If prices continue to rise for a long period of time, it could put pressure on profits from the next fiscal year onwards".</p>
<p>So despite the Switch 2 performing exceptionally well in its first year, the situation is undoubtedly more complex. It's not just a case of "console sells well, money goes up"; there are many factors to consider, and it seems that memory prices may well have a pretty huge impact in the coming months and years.</p>
<p>We'll keep a close eye on how Nintendo deals with the situation and provide further updates as soon as we hear more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo has had plenty of highs over its few decades in the video game industry. Popularizing home consoles with the NES, introducing new audiences to games through the Wii’s motion controls, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24242128/nintendo-ds-touchscreen-games-2004-launch">the touchscreen Trojan horse that was the Nintendo DS</a>, to name a few. But often these successes were followed by missteps; the Wii sold 100 million units, while its follow-up, the Wii U, couldn’t even manage a quarter of that. But that precarity looks to change. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/872768/nintendo-earnings-switch-best-selling-console-ds">The Switch is now Nintendo’s best-selling console ever</a>, surpassing the DS with 155 million units sold since its debut in 2017. And over that span Nintendo has transformed itself into a company better insulated against the ever-changing whims of the games industry.</p><p>One of the key factors behind the Switch’s success was how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17478950/nintendo-switch-structure-success-shinya-takahashi-interview">it represented a more unified version of Nintendo</a>. In 2013, the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/16/3881770/nintendo-to-unify-console-and-handheld-divisions-in-major">merged its two main game development divisions</a>, which had previously been split into home console and handheld groups. Given how the Switch straddled the line between console and handheld, this made a lot of sense. But it also allowed Nintendo to put the full might of its creative resources behind a single platform. The result was a string of massive hits: games like <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, and <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> all sold upward of 30 million copies.</p><p>Just as important, this structure allowed Nintendo to release big games consistently over the Switch’s lifespan. Even as the focus shifted to the next console, the Switch’s final years still included brand-new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Zelda</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario</em></a> games. The structure has also allowed Nintendo to seamlessly continue this success into the launch of the Switch 2, which got off to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712362/nintendo-switch-2-june-2025-sales">a very fast start</a> and debuted alongside a brand-new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart</em></a>, which was followed by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/835325/metroid-prime-4-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Metroid</em></a>.</p><div><p>But outside of games, which form the core of the company, Nintendo has also used the Switch’s success to steadily branch out in new directions. In 2023, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a> hit theaters, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23695720/nintendo-mario-movie-billion-box-office">earned more than $1 billion</a>, and now Nintendo has both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/867447/new-super-mario-galaxy-trailer-yoshi">a sequel</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/708143/nintendo-zelda-movie-casting-bo-bragason-benjamin-evan-ainsworth">a live-action <em>Zelda</em> movie</a> on the way. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan">Nintendo opened its first theme park in Japan in 2021</a>, and has since expanded to Hollywood and Florida, with a location in Singapore due up next. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">The company even opened its own museum in 2024</a>. In essence, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23608700/super-nintendo-world-entertainment-miyamoto-takahashi-interview">Nintendo is building an entertainment empire</a>. Its competition is increasingly the likes of Disney and Netflix in addition to Xbox and PlayStation. “I think people view Nintendo as a gaming company,” Shinya Takahashi, Nintendo’s senior managing executive officer, told me in 2023. “But we have always thought of ourselves as an entertainment company.”</p></div><p>It’s not a completely unique strategy: Just about every video game company is hoping to break out in film and television after the success of projects like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hbo/673868/the-last-of-us-season-2-finale-hbo"><em>The Last of Us</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/844926/fallout-season-2-review-amazon-prime-video"><em>Fallout</em></a>, and <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>. But in Nintendo’s case, the company seems to understand just how precarious a success like the Switch can be, and it used that success to steadily build itself up into something bigger in a deliberate, concerted way. It’s something Nintendo has tried to do before — see: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/8/13878378/super-mario-run-iphone-nintendo-shigeru-miyamoto-interview">the company’s ill-fated efforts into mobile gaming</a> — but its resurgence during the Switch era allowed it to approach these ventures with a new level of focus and ambition. This is a company that’s so confident <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/868569/nintendo-switch-online-virtual-boy-3d-lineup-launch">it’s about to release a $100 re-creation of the Virtual Boy</a>, one of its greatest failures.</p><p>All of this is to say that the version of Nintendo that launched the Switch in 2017 is very different from the Nintendo that exists now. Its footing is more solid, its future is more clear. And that future involves more than video games. This doesn’t guarantee future success, of course. The Switch 2 may be off to a strong start, but it’s also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643277/nintendo-switch-2-price-tariffs-doug-bowser-interview">facing many pressures outside of Nintendo’s control</a>, some of which have led to a world where <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/789734/game-consoles-too-expensive">many game consoles now get <em>more</em> expensive over time</a>.</p><p>But the new Switch also doesn’t need to match its predecessor’s success — it just needs to allow Nintendo to keep this momentum going.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/873098/nintendo-switch-era-best-selling-console]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/yugioh-lego-contest-rules-yugi-kaiba-characters-cards-2000665381</link>
            <guid>1424284</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Lego is asking </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/death-battle-ash-ketchum-pokemon-yugi-moto-yugioh-video-2000651417"><i><span>Yu-Gi-Oh</span></i></a> <span>fans to design its first potential set based on the card game anime, meaning 30 years after the manga originally launched, </span><i><span>Yu-Gi</span></i><span>-pilled millennials might finally be get to duel in Lego form. Anime could end up being the next lucrative frontier for the company’s licensed brick empire.</span></p> <p><span>The toy company has </span><a href="https://beta.ideas.lego.com/blog/b40e8dea-5622-4e9b-90bc-7aa254e58a6f"><span>announced a contest</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Yu-Gi-Oh </span></i><span>fans to submit ideas for a buildable set, but it has a few rules and regulations that will narrow down the eligible designs. The examples Lego gives include models of characters and their trademark monsters, such as Yugi and the Dark Magician or Kaiba and his Blue-Eyes White Dragon. Dioramas of iconic duels from the anime, or a standalone monster, are also allowed.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Lego is specifically looking for ideas based on the Battle City and Duelist Kingdom tournament arcs from the original anime, so if you were thinking of an idea for a character in one of the more recent anime series, think again. Each idea must have between 400 and 2000 pieces to be considered. Lego is not looking for chump sets here.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That’s all well and good, but I’m surprised Lego isn’t taking an obvious route and releasing a Millennium Puzzle Lego set when Yugi literally builds his signature pyramid pendant that he wears around his neck like an actual Lego. Maybe if this contest takes off Lego will consider other </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/konami-ai-yu-gi-oh-world-championship-commentary-2000624978"><i><span>Yu-Gi-Oh</span></i></a><span> models. That one seems like a no-brainer.</span></p>

 <p><span>Still, the focus on the original anime series does make it sound like Lego is targeting older fans who grew up with the classic cards and characters, which is in line with the marketing of other collaborations like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-lego-sets-release-date-price-pikachu-charizard-2000658895"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a> <span>sets that specifically called out people who have back pain and bills to pay.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But hey, these things are expensive, require a lot of patience to assemble, and are much more elaborate than the smaller sets you see marketed to kids. Submissions are open until March 10.</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/epic-games-store-give-away-662-million-games/</link>
            <guid>1424281</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Epic Games team has published a deep dive into the last year of operations for the <strong>Epic Game Store</strong>. The numbers revealed were pretty staggering, uncovering huge growth for the PC storefront that has swollen to accommodate more than 317 <strong>million </strong>users, including 78 <strong>million </strong>monthly active users (MAUs).</p>



<p>Many know the Epic Games Store because of the slew of free games it gives away on a regular rotation, asking <strong>for nothing </strong>in return from users. In 2025, the team offered 100 free games, resulting in more than <strong>662 million </strong>downloads for an average of $2,316 in ‘redeemed value’ per player.</p>







<h2 id="h-epic-games-epic-numbers">Epic Games, Epic Numbers</h2>



<p><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2025-year-in-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games revealed</a> that, in 2025, users on the platform spent a whopping 6.6 billion hours playing games, and that 2.7 billion of that was spent in <strong>third-party </strong>games hosted on the Epic Games Store. In 2025, those dipping into the store to splash some cash spent more than $1.16 billion, representing 6% growth compared to 2024.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that PC gaming is on the up (and has been for years), but numbers like this are a testament to that fact.</p>



<p>From January to December, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> offered 100 free games in the store, and the massive user base claimed them more than 662 million times. What’s even more incredible is that 77% of the free games offered skyrocketed to all-time peak CCU records, and 40% went on to experience a <strong>Steam </strong>CCU lift.</p>



<p>That’s the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-install-epic-games-store-a-step-by-step-guide/">Epic Games Store</a>‘s chief competitor, by the way.</p>



<p>Almost <strong>one billion people </strong>now have an Epic Games account, and the vast majority of those have found their way into the Epic Games Store.</p>



<p>According to a graphic released by Epic Games, the top five games on the platform in 2025 by player spend and engagement were:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fortnite</li>



<li>Wuthering Waves</li>



<li>StarRail</li>



<li>Rocket League</li>



<li>Genshin Impact</li>
</ul>



<p>The likes of FC 26, GTA 5, Hogwarts Legacy, Borderlands 4, and ARC Raiders came in just behind those top titles.</p>



<p>As the report wrapped, the Epic Games team offered a message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In short: we’re building a fairer, more open marketplace for players and developers. As we move into 2026, we remain committed to empowering developers and delivering the best possible experience for players, wherever they play.</p>
</blockquote>

            <title><![CDATA[Morrowind Remaster Would Sell Like “Hot Cakes”, Says Baldur’s Gate 3 Dev]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/morrowind-remaster-would-sell-like-hot-cakes-says-baldurs-gate-3-dev/</link>
            <guid>1424275</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 and Divinity devs believe that Morrowind Remaster would perform well if released today, despite former devs’ comments.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Bethesda developer and Skyrim lead designer Bruce Nesmith <a href="https://www.pressboxpr.co.uk/news/bruce-nesmith-exclusive-skyrims-design-lead-on-where-he-would-set-the-elder-scrolls-6-and-what-to-expect-from-the-future-of-fallout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spoke</a> about Morrowind Remaster not being the best choice. He stated that going and playing a 20-year-old game would make players cringe, and the title “would not stand the test of time according to his opinion. However, another dev believes otherwise.</p>







<h2 id="h-divinity-dev-thinks-morrowind-remaster-is-a-great-idea">Divinity Dev Thinks Morrowind Remaster is a Great Idea</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/baldurs-gate-3-and-divinity-dev-argues-against-ex-bethesda-skyrim-lead-says-a-morrowind-remaster-would-succeed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, Baldur’s Gate 3 and Divinity’s publishing director Michael “Cromwelp” Douse shared his thoughts on the Morrowind Remaster on <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2017752820913434903" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) recently. Cromwelp states that he believes there is “a very technically qualified developer out there that would happily remake Morrowind with a modern combat system, and it would sell like f***ing hot cakes.”</p>



<p>The players in the comments seem to agree with Cromwelp’s views, with the overall sentiment that the Morrowind Remaster will be appreciated. However, some have agreed with updating the combat system, while others have disagreed, stating that it was part of the charm.</p>



<p>In the previous interview, Bruce Nesmith also highlighted the fact that Morrowind is so old that he doesn’t know whether the original source code exists anymore, and even if it exists, there is no telling whether the devs will be able to compile it and put it into a new engine like the Oblivion remaster.</p>



<p>Another way to go about it would be to completely remake the title and rebuild it from the ground up. That would make this a project with a four-year development cycle, which poses the question: Why not go and make something new? They could also approach it in a way where they revisit the lands of Morrowind and do a new story.</p>







<p>During the same interview, Nesmith stated that ”&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-skyrim-lead-elder-scrolls-tv-show-not-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a live-action adaptation of The Elder Scrolls&nbsp;probably wouldn’t work</a>.” Additionally, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-is-being-released-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released again late last year</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-february-4-969/</link>
            <guid>1424272</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re in the middle of the week (for some), but it’s not time to slack off! If you’re maintaining an NYT Connections streak, guess what you need to do today? That’s right! You need to <strong>just keep going</strong>. With that being said, I’ve got the best NYT Connections hints and tips for you below, including the solutions for today’s NYT Connections puzzle.</p>



<p>Read on to smash this puzzle as quickly as possible today!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-4">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 4)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #969:</p>



<ul>
<li>FRICTION</li>



<li>MAGICAL</li>



<li>HEATED</li>



<li>RIVALRY</li>



<li>BOUT</li>



<li>CONFLICT</li>



<li>LIKE</li>



<li>WAR</li>



<li>NETSCAPE</li>



<li>BINGO</li>



<li>BULLSEYE</li>



<li>DISCORD</li>



<li>LOTTERY</li>



<li>ROUND</li>



<li>APPROX</li>



<li>CRAPS</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– When people just can’t get along</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Try your luck</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> </em>Inexact estimates</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – Words that begin with pro basketball squads</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 4:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-february-4-969">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, February 4 (#969)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>

<li><strong>Green</strong> – BINGO, CRAPS, LOTTERY, WAR</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – APPROX, BOUT, LIKE, AROUND</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BULLSEYE, HEATED, MAGICAL, NETSCAPE</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>
