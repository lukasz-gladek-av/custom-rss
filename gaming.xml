            <p>
Following Monster Hunter Wilds' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tU2XOxD9HM">latest trailer reveal</a> during Summer Game Fest, Capcom has been sharing more on what players can expect from the latest game in its hugely popular creature-battling series - confirming cross-play is in for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5, while still insisting cross-save is 'not possible'.
</p>
<p>
That information comes via a <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/">new update on the Monster Hunter website</a>, which explains players on PS5, Series X/S, and Steam will all be able to match with - and become friends with - each other, regardless of platform. However, cross-play can be disabled if players prefer.
</p>
<p>
The news is considerably less positive for anyone hoping Capcom might finally pull its finger out and implement cross-save for Monster Hunter this time around. The publisher confirms save data - including the likes of game progress and paid DLC - will be managed separately on each platform. As such, it insists it will "not be possible" to share save data across platforms.

<p>
The good news, of course, is that Monster Hunter Wilds is currently expected to release simultaneously on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC - meaning the lack of cross-save should be less of an issue without the staggered platform releases seen with Monster Hunter World and Rise.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Wilds was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-your-first-look-at-monster-hunter-wilds-coming-in-2025">unveiled</a> during last year's The Game Awards, along with a vague release date of 2025. It features new mounts called Seikrets, some very chatty cutscenes, large migrating herds of smaller creatures, and multiple biomes. Not the most enthralling stuff, admittedly, but hopefully Capcom will share more substantial details soon.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Wilds launches for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC next year.

<p>While many expected Black Myth: Wukong to be on PlayStation 5 (PS5), Xbox Series X|S, and PC when it releases on August 20, that won’t be the case anymore. Instead, Black Myth: Wukong will only be available on PC and PS5 when it first releases.</p>



<p>The game was originally confirmed for Xbox Series X|S at The Game Awards 2023. However, after releasing a new trailer at Summer Game Fest 2024, it was revealed that the Xbox version of the <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game was being held back</a>.</p>



<p>“PC and PS5 users can enjoy the full game starting August 20, 2024,” developer Game Science <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says in its “pre-order FAQ”</a>. “We are currently optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version to meet our quality standards, so it won’t release simultaneously with the other platforms. </p>



<p>“We apologize for the delay and aim to minimize the wait for Xbox users. We will announce the release date as soon as it meets our quality standards.”</p>



<p>As far as an Xbox release date, that wasn’t confirmed by the company. Nor was there any hint as to when a release date would be revealed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Devolver Direct 2024: Everything Announced]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/devolver-direct-2024-everything-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/devolver-direct-2024-everything-announced.894132/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/devolver-direct-2024-everything-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Happy Volvy's birthday, I guess? Devolver Digital just wrapped its annual Devolver Direct which, among plenty of weirdness, included a number of big game announcements. We got two new game reveals, including one from the devs of Hyper Light Drifter, new DLC for games like Cult of the Lamb, and release dates for The Crush House and Anger Foot.</p><p>A time was certainly had by all, but if you missed the show and don't want to go back and watch a 30-minute video of a lonely man trying to prepare for a birthday party, here's a quick recap of the announcements:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Tenjutsu</h2><p>The first of two brand new games announced during the event, Tenjutsu comes from Dead Cells designer Sébastien Benard. It's a "rogue-jutsu" game set in a crumbling city, where you play as a renegade yakuza taking down her former colleagues. Tenjutsu looks to be something like a combination of Dead Cells, Streets of Rage, and Sifu — your goal is to take down four crime syndicates, which you can tackle in any order as you slowly improve your skills at a complex brawler fighting system. You can also use resources you collect to build up the city with shops and restaurants, but spending too much time preparing will result in stronger enemies. Tenjutsu is coming to PC and consoles, but no release date just yet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Possessor(s)</h2><p>In Devolver's second game announcement of the evening, we took a look at Possessor(s). Art style look familiar? Yup, this is from Hyper Light Drifter and Solar Ash developer Heart Machine. It's a side-scroller action game with sci-fi horror elements where you play as Luca and her counterpart Rehm. The two explore a city wrecked by an interdimensional catastrophe. Possessor(s) has an open-ended world structure with multiple possible paths available at any given time, and focuses on tight combat, challenging bosses, and exploration. Possessor(s) is coming to PC and console in 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>The Crush House</h2><p>I've been obsessed with The Crush House since it was first <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-crush-house-preview-thirst-person-shooter">revealed earlier this year</a>. It's a novel premise for a game: you're a producer on the titular reality TV show set at a Malibu mansion. Every week, you select a four-person cast from 12 total actors and let them loose in The Crush House, filming spicy moments over several days to satisfy your drama-loving audience. When you're not filming, you'll likely spend your time obsessing over details like decorations, props, or other ways you can capture different audience segments...though you'll also quickly realize there's a deeper mystery going on beneath the brightly color veneer of the house. During today's Devolver Direct, we saw a new trailer for The Crush House capped with a release date: it's coming out on August 9 on PC, with a Steam demo available now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Anger Foot</h2><p>Free Lives, developers of Broforce, Gorn, and Terra Nil, were also at the Devolver Direct with their upcoming game, Anger Foot. We actually <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anger-foot-is-like-john-wick-with-some-extra-kick">went hands-on with Anger Foot</a> not long ago, and really enjoyed its compelling take on the stylings of Hotline Miami, but with a lot more kicking. It's a first-person...shooter? More like kicker. You kick your way through a place literally called Shit City, bringing down enemies, replaying levels with different types of kickers, and upgrading your weapons and sneakers as you go. Anger Foot is coming soon — it'll be out on PC on July 11.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>The Talos Principle 2 - Road to Elysium</h2><p>The Talos Principle 2 came out late last year, and we <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-talos-principle-2-review">praised its simultaneous exploration</a> of both puzzling and philosophy in our 8/10 review. But Croteam showed up to the Devolver Direct to expand on what it established in the base game with the Road to Elysium DLC, now with a release date of June 14. Road to Elysium takes place after the events of The Talos Principle 2, bringing back familiar characters and expanding on certain major moments from the game. It takes place over three distinct chapters, each with a different vibe and a different character perspective.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Cult of the Lamb - Unholy Alliance</h2><p>Finally, Cult of the Lamb stopped into the birthday party to share some news about an upcoming free update, Unholy Alliance. Unholy Alliance brings a new playable character, the Goat, to the game for the addition of local co-op. Local co-op brings with it certain new challenges, such as twists on existing minigames, the ability to swap weapons between the two characters, deal extra damage if fighting back to back, and plenty more. There are also new rewards being added to the game for solo players, so don't worry if you don't have a Goat buddy. Unholy Alliance will release on August 12 for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.</p><p>That's it for <s>Volvy's Birthday</s> the Devolver Direct! You can catch up on everything from Summer Game Fest and Day of the Devs earlier today with our round-ups here and here, and stick with IGN for everything else Summer of Gaming all month long.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

According to the developer, both the physical Deluxe and Collector's Editions will come with digital activation codes for the Digital Deluxe edition of the game, but will not have a disc.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In an FAQ, Game Science explained that this was due to limitations on resources, but said it was looking into releasing discs in the future.</p><blockquote>It is the first time for Game Science to release a console game globally, and we are currently facing limitations in offline resources required for the import, export, transportation, distribution, and sales of physical discs. These factors have made it difficult for us to sell physical discs simultaneously with the official release of the game.</blockquote><blockquote>Our publishing team is actively working on resolving these issues and exploring options to offer physical discs.</blockquote><p>In the same FAQ, Game Science also announced its Xbox edition of the game would be <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-black-myth-wukong-trailer-ditches-xbox-series-x-and-s-version">released sometime after the PlayStation and PC editions</a>, as the studio is "currently optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version to meet our quality standards."</p><p>Last year, IGN wrote an extensive report examining a number of sexist remarks and attitudes made by Game Science founders and members over the last decade. These comments have sparked criticism from a number of Chinese gamers, especially women and their allies, though others have stepped up to defend Game Science.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/slitterhead-interview-the-creator-of-silent-hill-explains-their-new-horror-game-exclusive<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In December 2020, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-creator-remake-more-difficult-resident-evil">Keiichiro Toyama announced the establishment of Bokeh Game Studio</a>, a new development company he founded together with select cohorts from his days at Sony’s now defunct Japan Studio. With Toyama’s resume including beloved titles like the <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill">original Silent Hill</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/siren">Siren</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/gravity-rush">Gravity Rush</a>, many fans had been looking forward to seeing his next creation.</p><p>Now, four years later, Slitterhead is ready to release this November as Bokeh Game Studio’s debut title. I was fortunate enough to actually play the horror action adventure game, and you can read my impressions in our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/slitterhead-exclusive-preview-a-combination-of-silent-hill-siren-and-gravity-rush">exclusive preview article</a>. Following my session with the game, I interviewed Toyama as well as producer Kazunobu Sato and game director Junya Okura.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Many fans have been eagerly awaiting a new horror experience from you. After playing the demo, I thought it was rare for a game that leans so heavily on horror elements to have a melee combat system. Could you tell us the reason behind this?</strong> </p><p><strong>Keiichiro Toyama, Founder, Bokeh Game Studio:</strong> We wanted players who enjoy modern action games to be able to enjoy Slitterhead, so we aimed for a game that is easy to familiarise yourself if you are used to playing recent games.</p><p><strong>Possessing and controlling multiple different characters functions as Slitterhead’s key mechanic. How did you come up with this idea?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama: </strong>With Slitterhead, we wanted to reinterpret the concept we originally had for Siren. Over the years, Siren has become somewhat of a cult classic, and I’m always honored when I hear people say they want to see it get revived. In Siren, you could dive inside the brain of other characters through a feature we called sightjacking. We wanted to evolve this idea by making it possible to possess and freely move around as other characters. This became the core of Slitterhead’s game design.</p><p><strong>It’s unique and interesting from a gameplay perspective, but when you’re continuously possessing different characters, doesn’t it become difficult for the player to know what or who they are? How did you approach this idea from a narrative standpoint?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> That’s something we’ve become quite good at through our previous games. While there are elements that confuse the player, I am confident that players will enjoy Slitterhead’s story. At first you might not be sure of what you are, but as you advance through the game there's an interesting narrative and relatable characters.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>With Slitterhead, we wanted to reinterpret the concept we originally had for Siren</p></div><p><strong>While you are reinterpreting Siren’s game design in a modern way, the setting of Slitterhead is quite different from Siren’s Japanese village.</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> That’s right. Slitterhead is set in a fictional Asian city during the early 1990s. Nostalgia for a world long gone is one of the main themes we had for the city. For example, many of the neon sign boards that used to be so common in Asian cities are getting removed these days. If you take a city like Hong Kong, you can see how much has changed. The first time I visited Hong Kong was in the 2000s. If I had gone earlier, I could have seen airplanes fly right above the city to reach Kai Tak Airport, which was located in the middle of the city. Drawing inspiration from places we would have liked to see or go is something we did a lot in Slitterhead.</p><p><strong>Wasn’t it difficult to recreate sights and locations that no longer exist?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> It was definitely challenging as there wasn’t always a lot of documentation to work from. That said, our environmental artists were extremely passionate about recreating the scenes they were inspired by. Some members even applied to work with us because they wanted to design a city like this. Some of them were so devoted that they put real-world details into the game that I’m not even familiar with!</p><p><strong>Were you also inspired by Hong Kong movies from the ’90s?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama: </strong>Definitely. When I was a student, Wong Kar-wai’s movies became popular. His movies changed the way I looked at Hong Kong cinema. When I was a kid, Jackie Chan movies were the first thing you would think about. I was captivated by the modernness and beauty of Wong Kar-wai’s movies.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Slitterhead Screenshots</h3></div></output><p><strong>I was impressed by the NPCs walking the streets. They were really detailed and their fashion and hairstyles perfectly matched the city’s atmosphere. I was even more surprised to actually be able to possess and walk around as them.</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> That’s great to hear. I think there are not many games that allow you to control this many characters. In the original proposal, I wrote that every person in the city should be a playable character. For game design reasons, we had to limit the amount of characters you can possess, but it’s still a lot. The motion differs depending on the character, so I hope players will enjoy feeling the difference.</p><p><strong>It’s a nice touch that the character you are possessing at that moment also appears during cutscenes.</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama: </strong>Yes, we tried to do that as much as possible. There were a lot of difficulties upon doing this. For example, weird stuff would happen for characters with different heights.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>I got to play the beginning of the game which had me explore the city, and later the insides of a condominium building. Is Slitterhead an open world game, or does it take a stage-based structure?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama: </strong>It’s stage based. Everything takes place within the city, but depending on the stage you get to see different situations and can experience the city from different angles. </p><p><strong>How long does the average stage take, and how long does it take to beat the entire game?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama: </strong>Stages are about 30 minutes long. It should take players around 15 hours to see the credits roll. After that, you can enjoy the remaining challenges. </p><p><strong>The stages I got to play were both during the nighttime. Are there any stages that play out during the day?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama: </strong>We narrowed the situations down to nighttime. It matches the atmosphere of the city better, and if we were to change the time of the day we would also have to change the atmosphere of characters, which would be a lot of work. Also, daytime situations are more challenging to fit in a horror game.</p><p><strong>Kazunobu Sato, Producer:</strong> In the original proposal we did have some daytime situations, but to make the experience more focused we decided to cut them.</p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> I think we had about two or three times the amount of situations in the original proposal.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In the original proposal we did have some daytime situations, but to make the experience more focused we decided to cut them</p></div><p><strong>Slitterhead has impressive city environments, horror elements, is narrowed down to nighttime, and you can reach the top of buildings. All this reminded me of Tango Gameworks’ Ghostwire: Tokyo. Did you notice the same similarities when that game was released in 2022?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama: </strong>Yes. Both (Shinji) Mikami and producer (Masato) Kimura are good friends of ours. When I heard that they went through twists and turns to come up with the game they did, it was easy for me to understand. I was shocked how well Ghostwire: Tokyo’s Shibuya was crafted though… It’s kind of scary to think that people expect something of that quality nowadays.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>I personally thought that Slitterhead’s city had a similar amount of detail to it.</strong></p><p><strong>Sato: </strong>That’s great to hear. When Ghostwire: Tokyo released, we were in the midst of developing Slitterhead. Their final product was something that felt quite close to what we were doing. Ghostwire: Tokyo is a first-person shooter that takes place in Tokyo, while Slitterhead has melee combat in a culturally Chinese setting, so they’re obviously very different games. That being said, as a product there’s definitely a similarity which I think works to our benefit. During presentations etc, mentioning how <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghostwire-tokyo">Ghostwire: Tokyo</a> turned out was a convenient way for us to convey the image of Slitterhead.   </p><p><strong>The monsters in Slitterhead are based on Yegouzi, a supernatural being in Chinese folklore. How did you come up with this?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama</strong>: I was inspired by monsters that appear in Japanese comics. Monsters that eat humans appear quite often, but that alone wouldn’t differentiate us enough. After looking into it, I learned about Yegouzi, a Chinese monster that eats human brains, so I decided to flesh out that idea.</p><p><strong>Did the idea of Yegouzi come first, or did you already have the idea of an Asian city before that?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> The city came first. I wanted to make a game about an Asian city in which a mysterious incident occurs. When searching for an enemy that matches this setting, I learned about Yegouzi.</p><p><strong>Is there a wide array of enemy types in the game’s different stages?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama: </strong>We developed a very rich and complex design for Yegouzi. We’re using this design as the base for all enemy types, but we created a lot of variation by giving it different looks, abilities and so on. Rather than creating a wide variation of enemy’s from scratch, we’re using one well-developed design in different ways. Slitterhead is Bokeh Game Studio’s first game, so this approach was more realistic for us.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/07/image-from-ios-1-1717803479104.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Keiichiro Toyama shows off Bokeh Ale. Photo by Esra Krabbe / IGN Japan.</figcaption></figure></output><p><strong>The city of Slitterhead is very detailed and well designed. Why did you decide to have an action-focused experience rather than focusing more on adventure and exploration?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> With games like FromSoftware titles, many gamers today are used to playing challenging and hardcore games. With that in mind, I thought that as long as we make the action feel good there would be the potential for more players to be interested in our game. Since I’m known as the creator of Silent Hill, I’m aware of the fact that many people are hoping for something closer to a horror adventure game. That makes me very honored, but the problem is that horror adventure games are kind of similar to extremely spicy food. People that are into it love it, but other people don’t really bother to try it out. </p><p>That’s why we decided to keep the essence of horror games while making a game that feels good to play. Of course we could have made a horror adventure game, but since many of our team members worked on the Gravity Rush series, we already had a team that knows how to develop good action gameplay. It is important to know what kind of game you want to make, but thinking about the potential and strengths of your team is important as well. With the team we currently have at Bokeh Game Studio, making a game focused on action just seemed like the right choice.</p><p><strong>While Slitterhead is mainly focused on action, I did get to enjoy some exploration elements during my playtime as well. The game started with a section in which I had to follow a visualized trail of scent as a stray dog, and later I had to roam the city to find lost memories of the spirit that I was controlling. What other types of exploration can players expect?</strong></p><p><strong>Sato:</strong> While indeed action is the game’s main element, there is some exploration as well. For example, there’s a part in which Yegouzi is hiding in human form, and you have to find out which human body it is hiding in.</p><p><strong>Junya Okura, Director:</strong> Since you don’t know what human body Yegouzi is hiding in, you have to go about and find out by talking to people and finding traces that lead to it. It’s kind of like an investigation part.</p><p><strong>Does the game have any side quests?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> With the limited budget we have, we decided to focus on the main experience rather than expanding the experience with optional content. </p><p><strong>During combat, you can attack, block, dodge and deflect, covering all the standard bases for a modern action game. What is it that makes Slitterhead’s combat unique?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> The fact that the character you’re controlling constantly changes. The main concept was my idea, but Okura – who was also the lead designer for Gravity Rush – created the game system based on that concept.</p><p><strong>Okura:</strong> Toyama said that he wanted me to utilize the possession mechanic as much as possible. It made me think of what would happen in a game in which you can freely possess different characters in a city. What kind of gameplay could we create based on that idea? Actually, we have a few main characters as well, and I came up with a system in which you switch between them. These main characters all have different characteristics and can use different skills.</p><p><strong>I got to play as a female character with claws as well as a character that uses Chinese martial arts. It was fun to be able to enjoy different movesets.</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama: </strong>Thank you. We gave each of these characters their own background. For example, one is a homeless guy who used to be a professional boxer. The motion of their attacks match their backgrounds, so I hope that players can enjoy that variety. Also, in the game’s proposal I wrote that the human body is weak and should be disposed of as you fight. This is something that Okura implemented in the game very well.</p><p><strong>Okura: </strong>The game expects you to dispose of the bodies that you have controlled. It works in your advantage to sacrifice them as you play.</p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> We noticed that many of the test players found this hard to get used to.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The 12 Best Horror Games on PC</h3></div></output><p><strong>You get attached to the old lady you’re controlling, right?</strong></p><p><strong>Okura:</strong> Yes, you get attached to them and try to keep them alive. But actually, sacrificing them works to your advantage.</p><p><strong>Sato:</strong> When playing with the same mindset as in other games, you tend to try to defeat the enemy using the same character. That’s why we make it clear during the tutorial that it’s OK to sacrifice bodies. It’s interesting to see players trying to protect the lives of the characters they control at first, and how they start to care less and less as they get used to the game. </p><p><strong>I played the game on Easy mode and had no real difficulties defeating the game’s enemies. How different are the Normal, Hard and Nightmare difficulty modes?</strong></p><p><strong>Okura:</strong> Depending on the difficulty mode, the frequency and damage of enemy attacks change. That means that combat becomes more challenging, but adventure parts stay the same. Normal is the difficulty that we think will suit the average player best, while Hard is the difficulty we originally wanted to go for. Nightmare is for people who want a real challenge. Actually, I’m making that one for myself! But it still isn’t so difficult that players won’t be able to beat the game.</p><p><strong>Sato:</strong> Are you sure about that? For me it’s too difficult!</p><p><strong>Okura:</strong> Well, I do die a few times myself (when playing on Nightmare mode)...</p><p><strong>What were some of the main inspiration sources for Slitterhead?</strong> </p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> There’s a lot, but I was especially inspired by manga like Gantz, Parasyte and Tokyo Ghoul. A lot of people die and the essence of horror is there, but at the same time these manga are focused on battle action, which I think makes them more accessible. Horror is quite a hardcore genre, so I looked at how these manga made horror more approachable for a wider audience. They have horror-like situations in which you’re worried that a certain character might die soon, but at the same time the battle action component makes it more entertaining for a casual audience. This is an approach unique to Japanese manga that I haven’t really seen overseas, so I wanted to bring that essence to video game format.</p><p><strong>You’re collaborating with Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka for the first in a long time. How did this come to be?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> We had been saying to each other that we wanted to do something together again for a long time, and with Slitterhead we finally got the chance. Working together with him again made me realize just how much of a genius he is. I hardly ever had to direct him into the right direction. Every song he composed was a perfect fit. For Slitterhead, he didn’t just compose music but was in charge of the game’s sound as a whole. The Cantonese pop song you hear during the opening of the game was composed by him as well. I really like that song. Yamaoka might be best known for dry rock music, but he’s actually really good at composing more ethereal songs as well. I think the latter is well represented in Slitterhead.</p><p><strong>Slitterhead is set to release for not just current gen consoles and PC, but also PS4. Are there any differences between the PS4 version and other platforms?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> Slitterhead can be enjoyed in 4K with 60 fps on the other platforms, but it’s 1080p and 30 fps for the PS4 version. We didn’t want Slitterhead to be only playable on high-end PCs, but also on the middle end, which made it possible to make it compatible with PS4 as well. Since Slitterhead is not a AAA title, developing it as a game that would only be playable on the PS5 would have made it too expensive. We decided to develop it on a realistic scale and finish the game on time.</p><p><strong>I think it’s pretty rare to actually have a game released within three or four years after opening a new studio these days.</strong></p><p><strong>Sato:</strong> I’m happy to hear that. But indeed, if we had made something that only runs on PS5, we probably would have still been working on it right now.</p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> I think that the fact that we didn’t try to make a game that can only be played on the newest hardware played a big role. It was the best thing to do given the size of our studio and it made the game accessible for more players at the same time.</p><p>Slitterhead is set to release on PS5\PS4\Xbox Series X|S/PC (Steam/Epic Games) on November 8, 2024.</p><p><em>Blogroll photo credit: Esra Krabbe / IGN Japan.</em></p><p><a href="https://x.com/RineD1987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Esra Krabbe</em></u></a><em> is an editor at IGN Japan.

Following much community speculation and wishlists surging past one million on Steam, Funcom has premiered a new cinematic trailer this week at Summer Game Fest that reveals a mind-bending alternate timeline that promises to put the future of Arrakis in the hands of the player. The trailer is voiced by Paul Atreides, as he contemplates a spice vision of a world in which he was not born. A vision of <em>Dune: Awakening</em>.</p><p>While drawing visual inspiration from the award-winning cinematography created for Denis Villeneuve’s masterpiece film series, <em>Dune: Awakening</em> will take place in an alternate timeline to that of the books and movies. Players will be met with a game that stays true to the beloved world of <em>Dune</em> while creating an opportunity to surprise players with a narrative that hinges on one key decision that reimagines the future of Arrakis.</p><p>In <em>Dune: Awakening</em>, Jessica Atreides never gave birth to Paul, instead choosing to obey the orders of the Bene Gesserit to have a daughter. She names her Ariste Atreides, who is a character players will meet in the game. This key decision causes a chain reaction that fundamentally changes the situation on Arrakis, leading ultimately to the survival of Duke Leto Atreides and a War of Assassins between the Harkonnens and the Atreides.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>This is the Arrakis that players are dropped into in <em>Dune: Awakening</em>; one torn by war between two Great Houses, the Fremen missing after being hunted down, and at the center of it all: the spice that must flow.</p></blockquote><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em> is in development for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,184 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,460 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,287 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>).

            <p>
Hyper Light Drifter developer Heart Machine unveiled its next game at the Devolver Direct showcase.
</p>
<p>
Called Possessor(s), it's a side-scrolling action game with a beautiful hand-drawn aesthetic set in a devastated mega-city. It's due out in 2025. 
</p>
<p>
Players control two protagonists - Luca and Rehm - with melee combat involving juggles with an array of weapons like swords, bats, and even an electric guitar.

<p>
It's unclear if the iconic Disasterpiece will provide the soundtrack as with Hyper Light Drifter, but the mournful piano music in the trailer is a counterpoint to the fast-paced combat. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyper-light-drifter-review">Hyper Light Drifter</a>, a top-down sci-fi Metroidvania, was exceptionally well-received and was followed up by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/solar-ash-review-nothing-breaks-like-a-heart">Solar Ash</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyper-light-breaker-now-targeting-summer-early-access-release-following-delays">Hyper Light Breaker</a> (this summer in early access). Possessor(s), then, seems like a departure for the studio in gameplay but retains a unique style and tone.
</p>
<p>
Another new game announcement was Tenjutsu, the next game from the designer of Dead Cells Sébastien Benard (not to be confused with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-definitely-still-room-for-the-rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> from Dead Cells studio Evil Empire).

</p>
<p>
As you may expect, it's another rogue-lite game but this time you play as a renegade yakuza taking down four powerful crime syndicates in any order, by beating up bad guys and altering playstyles through urban development.
</p>
<p>
It's set to launch on PC and consoles, though there's no release date yet.
</p>

<p>
The Devolver showcase also included some other news.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-talos-principle-2-review-a-thought-experiment-to-puzzle-over">The Talos Principle 2</a> will receive Road to Elysium next week, a three-part coda to the main game adding some of the most challenging puzzles yet and expanding the robot world. It's out on 14th June across Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-crush-house-is-a-thirst-person-shooter-that-holds-a-mirror-to-reality-tv-production">"Thirst-person shooter" The Crush House</a> now has a release date: 9th August on PC. The game sees players directing their own reality TV show, but with something more sinister behind the scenes. 

</p>
<p>If that tickles your fancy, there's a demo on Steam you can try out right now.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/TheCrushHouse_4-(1).png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>
Anger Foot also has a release date: 11th July on PC. It's a frantic first-person shooter where your character has particularly powerful legs. Different footwear can be worn for a range of effects, like high speed kicks, flames, floating enemies, or just pure rage.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cult-of-the-lamb-review-a-genre-mash-up-with-a-lot-of-ideas">popular Cult of the Lamb</a> will receive the Unholy Alliance Update on 12th August, which adds local co-op. A second player will take the role of a demonic goat to help out with battles and cult management. It's coming to all platforms.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">Summer Game Fest 2024</a>'s opening livestream has come to a close after bringing us trailers for upcoming games, updates for released titles and a couple of surprises too! No fear if you missed the showcase though as below you'll find everything announced during Summer Game Fest 2024.</p>
<p>Before we get started though - no, there was no new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> trailer. Sorry, nothing I can do about that. With that out of the way, let's take a look at what did make an appearance.</p>

<h3>Cuffbust</h3>
<p>The next trailer showed offer the new titles from the creator of Choo-Choo Charles - Cuffbust. This co-op game will challenge you to escape a prison in the form of a cute bear thing?

<h3>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind </h3>
<p>The tone then changed dramatically with the retro-style styled Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind. (Yes, the trailer is set to the Power Rangers theme tune.) While we don't know the release date at the time of writing, we do know it will be released on PC.</p>

<h3>Deer and Boy</h3>
<p>One thing I love about gaming showcases is how quickly the tune can change - we're gone from horror games to 90's children's TV shows to what looks like a touching game about a boy and deer foal exploring a world being invaded by magic. Deer and Boy is from Life Line Game Studio and will see the deer grow as you play.</p>

<h3>Wanderstop</h3>
<p>It was then time for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stanley-parable-and-tacoma-creators-fight-back-against-onslaught-of-coffee-games-with-tea-themed-wanderstop">Wanderstop - the latest game from Davey Wreden the creator of The Stanley Parable and Beginner's Guide</a>. Wanderstop is focused around running a tea shop and sitting on a bench. Oh and PTSD from the looks of it, which really makes me mistrust that whole tea shop setting... Wouldn't expect anything else form the creator of The Stanley Parable.</p>
<p>Wanderstop will be arriving on PC and PlayStation 5 later on in 2024.</p>

<h3>Alan Wake 2: Night Springs DLC</h3>
<p>Alan Wake 2 made a surprisingly musical splash last year and Remedy hasn't finished tormenting their favourite author yet. Sam Lake made an appearance, doing a little dance as he came on stage, to first announce the physical release of Alan Wake 2.</p>
<p>Named after the television show Alan used to write for, the Night Springs DLC will contain three episodes as you follow three familar characters exploring 'What If' scenarios. Very in keeping with The Twilight Zone inspiration - and it all has a super jazzy theme tune.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2s-deliciously-bizarre-night-springs-dlc-out-this-weekend-physical-version-finally-due-later-this-year">The Night Springs DLC for Alan Wake 2</a> will be released Saturday 8th June, which means it's probably out now as you're reading this!</p>

<h3>Monster Hunter Wilds</h3>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is the next installment in the Capcom series focused around doing exactly what it says on the tin. It will be released in 2025 on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>While we've still got a while to wait for this game, we have been given a good look at the monsters you'll be meeting, landscapes you'll be exploring and the characters you'll meet. Personally, I think the desert area looks particularly beautiful.</p>

<h3>Phantom Blade 0</h3>
<p>Summer Game Fest 2024 ended with a new trailer for Phantom Blade 0 - and it was all gameplay. If you've been considering playing this upcoming action RPG focused around Chinese martial arts, then I highly recommend giving this a watch.</p>
<p>Phantom Blade 0 is having a world touring demo, so check the end of the trailer to see if it's coming to a location near you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24171195/devolver-digital-direct-2024-summer-game-fest-news-trailers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Devolver Digital’s keynote events tend to be, let’s say, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22531132/devolver-maxpass-plus-event-announcements-trailers-e3-2021">unique</a>. And the publisher’s presence at Summer Game Fest 2024 was no exception. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23751914/devolver-digital-showcase-2023-trailers-summer-game-fest-volvy">Like last year</a>, Devolver focused on just a handful of really interesting indie games, which ranged from a game about fighting through an interdimensional catastrophe to an expansion that somehow makes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23320287/cult-of-the-lamb-review-steam-deck"><em>Cult of the Lamb</em></a> even weirder. There was both a first-person kicker <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/4/24121113/introducing-the-worlds-first-thirst-person-shooter">a thirst-person shooter</a>. If you missed it live, here are all the reveals.</p><p><h4><em>Possessor</em></h4></p><p><h5>Coming to PC and console in 2025</h5></p><p>A slick side-scrolling action game from the creators of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820899/solar-ash-impressions-annapurna-interactive-heart-machine"><em>Solar Ash</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/17/23725832/hyper-light-breaker-composers-roguelike-music">the <em>Hyper Light</em> games</a>, <em>Possessor</em> looks absolutely gorgeous. It also sounds like it’ll be plenty challenging. Here’s the official setup:</p><div><blockquote><p>Play as Luca, the host, and Rehm, her less-than-cooperative counterpart, as they explore a quarantined city ripped apart and flooded by an interdimensional catastrophe. Their only hope of survival is by learning to co-exist.</p></blockquote></div><p><h4><em>Tenjutsu</em></h4></p><p><h5>Coming to PC and consoles; no release window</h5></p><p><em>Tenjutsu</em> is the first release from Deepnight Games, a new one-person studio helmed by Sébastien Benard, who previously worked on <em>Dead Cells</em>. The game puts players in the role of a renegade yakuza fighting through the criminal underworld and mixes pixel art visuals with some fast-paced action. In keeping with its retro aesthetic, it’s planned for a release in 202X.</p><p><h4><em>Anger Foot</em></h4></p><p><h5>Coming to PC on July 11th</h5></p><p>This is a first-person shooter where you also do a lot of kicking, and also — obviously — collect sneakers. It comes from Free Lives, the studio behind <em>Broforce </em>and <em>Cricket Through the Ages</em>, so you can expect it to be both very silly and very violent when it launches this summer.</p><p><h4><em>The Crush House</em></h4></p><p><h5>Coming to PC on August 9th</h5></p><p><em>The Crush House</em> sounds like a solid concept for a strategy game, tasking players producing a reality TV show circa 1999. But there also appears to be a more sinister side to the game, as you can explore the house at night in search of darker mysteries beyond cast gossip. It’s developed by Nerial, the studio behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/7/16743406/reigns-her-majesty-review-iphone-android-steam">the excellent <em>Reigns</em> series</a>.</p><p><h4>Expansions for <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> and <em>The Talos Principle 2</em></h4></p><p>In addition to upcoming games, Devolver also showed off some new content for two of its bigger titles. First up, <em>Cult of the Lamb</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23320287/cult-of-the-lamb-review-steam-deck">the surprisingly charming cult simulator</a>, is getting its <em>Unholy Alliance</em> expansion on August 12th. The free update includes some new quests, gear, and items, but more importantly, it adds a co-op mode so you can experience the unhinged game with a buddy.</p><p>Meanwhile, on June 14th, the cerebral puzzler <em>The Talos Principle 2</em> is getting its <em>Road to Elysium</em> expansion. It introduces a host of new challenges spread across three chapters — Orpheus Ascending, Isle of the Blessed, and Into the Abyss — each with their own look and storyline.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/system-shock-remakers-night-dive-are-remastering-the-thing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Computer Artworks' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-thing">2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing</a> was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren't quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you're worrying about them, they're casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic "trust" and "fear" systems.</p>
<p>Sadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who'd been in my squad for too long. But it's the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They've just announced that they're making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.</p><!--more-->

<p>Announced during today's Summer Game Festivities, the remaster encompasses a bunch of visual enhancements but still very much looks like a game from the early noughties. Here's a squirming gobbet of announcement release to point your flamethrower at:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Thing: Remastered is a faithful restoration of the cult-classic 2002 third-person survival horror shooter game inspired by Universal Pictures and filmmaker John Carpenter's genre-defining 1982 film, The Thing. Nightdive Studios has upgraded this horrifying classic for the modern era through its proprietary KEX Engine for play on current-generation gaming devices up to a 4K resolution at 120FPS. Improvements to character models, textures, and animations have been hand-crafted by Nightdive Studios, with the implementation of advanced 3D rendering for updated lighting and atmospheric effects--for a suspenseful and disgustingly detailed remaster that reanimates the thrilling game for modern audiences. </p></blockquote>
<p>Nightdive have previously used their fancy Kex tech to overhaul Dark Forces, Doom 64, Quake II and the enhanced edition of System Shock. You can read more about their recent doings - including what it's like being acquired by the latter-day incarnation of Atari, who do not have great form for looking after older videogame series - in Rick Lane's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nightdive-studios-on-a-big-2023-acquired-by-atari-begging-for-dark-forces-and-remaking-system-shock">Xmas 2023 interview with the studio heads</a>.</p>

            <p>A goat or a lamb - which makes the better sacrifice? Trick question, it's neither. The best sacrifices are old rich people. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cult-of-the-lamb">Cult of the Lamb</a>'s next update, Unholy Alliance, you can sacrifice folks with a pal. The upcoming free update will add a co-op goat character so a friend can indoctrinate and stab alongside you. The developers have shown off the two-player update amid the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/summer-game-fest-2024">summer news plague</a> that is threatening to tear entire branches off the RPS treehouse this week. "Summoned by blood and born in corruption, this wicked new ally can join the holy Lamb in local co-op," say publishers Devolver. Ah, <em>local</em> co-op. Not online then. I guess this is for real-life people with real-life friends and a proper real-life sofa. Well. Good for them. I'm happy for them. Couldn't be happier. Happy happy happy.</p>

<p>Ah, I appreciate a fully animated misadventure included at the start of a trailer. I don't know who popularised this trend of cartoon fighting as a preamble to footage of the actual game. (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-cells-fatal-falls-dlc-is-out-now">Dead Cells</a>? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz8l935Bv0Y">Hades</a>?) Whoever it was, nice job. Although now that I've said it out loud, I will see this technique everywhere and it will begin to feel overdone. Don't you hate being a pattern-recognising animal?</p>
<p>You know who recognises no patterns? Goats. As the co-op horn-haver you'll be able to fight baddies, enjoy some fishing, and go on crusades. You'll also be able to play minigames together, like the dice-rolling knucklebones.  </p>
<p>"The Lamb and the Goat can swap weapons, deal extra damage when fighting back-to-back, or deal a critical hit if their attacks are in sync," say Devolver. There will also be "new tarot cards, relics, buildings, fleeces, follower traits, follower quests, and other secrets to discover." </p>
<p>None of that means much to me, I haven't led any innocent young farm animals astray myself. But Ollie wrote our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cult-of-the-lamb-review">Cult of the Lamb review</a> and found it very enjoyable. "Cult Of The Lamb absolutely oozes charisma and excitement at the tiniest opportunity," he said. He also admitted that his favourite thing in the game was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWlkbVklTbo">forcing old cultists to take part in ritual duels to the death</a>, a regular event at which all other cultists took reliable delight. What a sicko. I would never suggest something like that. </p>
<p>The Unholy Alliance update has an August 13th release date. Which is maybe enough time for me to find a human friend. Perhaps I will ask someone at my monthly book club if they fancy joining my farmyard cult. That's how you make mates as an adult, right?</p>

            <p>The news panamax has come in and all the shipping containers are spilling off the deck in an uncontrollable catastrophe of trailers. Here's another: you may remember <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crush-house">The Crush House</a>, the colourful 90s reality show where you film the cast by day, trying to please the audience, and creep around by night, trying to investigate the unsettling true nature of the show. No? You don't remember? Well, it has been a long year. Never mind, The Crush House now has a release date. But I'm not telling you what it is until you come watch the new trailer.</p>

<p>Okay, it's August 9th this year. That's the release date. You can go now if you like but I quite like having you here. Please don't go, I have more thoughts.  </p>
<p>You play a producer who walks around filming the cast as they fight, chat, and kiss each other on the mouth, as Edwin observed when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crush-house-is-a-saucy-90s-reality-tv-show-simulator-from-the-developers-of-reigns">spoke to the creators when it was announced back in April</a>. It's being made by Nerial, the developer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns">Reigns</a>, aka "Crusader Kings but on Tinder". For me this is an encouraging sign. Reigns is one of the few phone games I still show to non-gamers as a straightforward example of what games are actually like. Crush House looks very different, as you can see. It has a Malibu beach house for one thing. Crusty old kings don't have that.</p>
<p>There's also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2337820/The_Crush_House/">a demo on Steam</a>, the publishers say. That's cracker, we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wishlisted">love a demo</a>. Your aim seems to be to keep audiences pleased through salacious editing, but you are also free to talk to the cast after hours, against the strong advice of management. That's when you find there's something amiss here, and presumably do a lot of behind-the-scenes Nancy Drewing. </p>
<p>It was shown off a little more today by Devolver, who also describe it as a "thirst person shooter". Which is both a good joke and also possibly necessary information, since anyone new to the game might watch the above trailer and be forgiven for thinking it was some sort of Sims-esque personality <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management game</a>. I'm glad it's not. Falling down a rabbit hole of production company misdeeds and unsettling Furby-like toys sounds way more interesting. </p>

            <p>Door-and-peace-minus-the-peace <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anger-foot">Anger Foot</a>, the best game ever made, has finally got a release date: July 11th 2024. This is spectacular news, mainly because I’d already printed off a load of shirts that said ‘Anger Foot GOTY 2024.’ I was going to do some socks, too, but I do not trust this game anywhere near footwear.</p>

<p>If you’re not yet a dedicated Foothead, here’s the premise. You are a very destructive individual who cares but for two things: spiffy trainers, and leaving those trainer’s imprints in people’s faces. All who cross you in its short, speedy levels are doomed. They’ll wake up the next day, shake the bullets from their ribcage, go to brush their teeth, and realise it was not a terrible nightmare - for the indelible mark of your angry foot is now part of their crumbly visage forevermore. Here’s the press release saying some words:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shit City is a disease and your foot is the cure. Lace-up a capricious collection of formidable footwear to fight through a diverse series of deranged city districts. Are you the god of style, speed, or power? Discover secrets and unlocks that encourage replayability - and learn to tackle levels in new creative, ridiculous, and devastating ways.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here’s a trailer. Warning: it’s got feet in it.</p>

            <p>The creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Drifter</a> are not ones to rest. In the terrifying tidal wave of trailers that continually washes over us this weekend, they send word of a new game via the Devolver Direct. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/possessors">Possessor(s)</a> is a side-scrolling character action game of mysterious sci-fi horror set in a "quarantined city ripped apart and flooded by an interdimensional catastrophe". This is coming on top of the already-announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-breaker">Hyper Light Breaker</a>. Please, Heart Machine, pace yourselves. I barely have time to play the daily crossword.</p>

<p>You will play as the long-coated Luca, but also Rehm, a being that possesses her for some undisclosed reason. It'll feature "tense, precise, combat" says Devolver in a press release, with lots of combo-clobbering, boss-battering and joe-juggling. "Find and unlock a wide array of powerful weapons and upgrades to bolster your arsenal and explore previously inaccessible areas."</p>
<p>That sounds a bit somethingvania, right? The developers do say you'll be meeting a cast of washed-out post-apocalyptic folks as you go along, "each with their own heart-breaking story", in case you thought it was all jumpy-jumpy-punch-punch. It's not clear if this tale will follow Heart Machine's usual philosophy of wordless storytelling, but the trailer shows no chatter, so probably?</p>
<p>Otherwise, there's not a whole lot to see for now. The 3D environment design is giving me real <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inside">Inside</a> vibes, with all the glowing lights, gloomy corridors, and dripping water. But I feel like the real meat of this game is still hiding somewhere under the rubble. This is my polite way of saying that, going by the trailer above, it looks like lots of other side-scrolling action games that have come before.</p>
<p>But let us chill. It's all in the buttonfeel for this types of game and Heart Machine do have a reputation for satisfying slashin' and dashin' (Hyper Light Drifter is one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">25 best action games</a>). It's also worth remembering that they are working on Hyper Light Breaker, that follow-up to their most well-known work. Which itself looks <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hyper-light-breakers-first-gameplay-trailer-shows-off-stylish-action-and-fast-paced-traversal">pretty slick</a>, even if Edwin had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hyper-light-breakers-3d-reworking-of-drifters-combat-is-promising-but-a-little-raw">trouble with its hoverboarding in an early build</a>. In any case, let's give Possessor(s) a chance to fatten up a little. It's not due out until 2025 in any case.</p>

<p>I got an email from Devolver saying ‘Press Release’, but I could only find the ‘reply’ button! It told me that Tenjutsu casts you as a renegade Yakuza, "hellbent on defying her former associates and loosening their grip on the Secret Garden City." Here’s some more fresh Tenjutsu facts, straight from the very cool and different horse’s mouth:</p>
<blockquote><p>Revealed at today’s Devolver Direct presentation, this fast and fluid rogue-jutsu is the latest game from Sébastien Benard, designer of the acclaimed Dead Cells.

Four powerful crime syndicates control the city, ruling with an iron fist. To defeat them, you must master a brutal brawling system and build a diverse arsenal of weapons, upgrades, and martial arts techniques, breaking their hold on the streets in a flurry of violence.

As these sinister organisations fall to your fists, tackled in any order you wish, the city is reborn.</p>
<p>The ruined streets become vibrant and full of life, and you can spend gathered resources in shops and restaurants to help your on your quest.

Shape the city to fit your play style, unlocking new weapons, combat moves, and areas to explore. Just don't take too long: the longer you spend preparing, the stronger your enemies will become.

Tenjutsu will be coming to PC and consoles. Stay tuned for more announcements in the future’s future!</p> </blockquote>
<p>Yep, well up for a bit of this, wherever its roguelikey streets might take me. Reminds me a little of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/akane">Akane</a>, which I will never stop pestering people to play. You can find the official Tenjutsu website <a href="http://tenjutsu.com/">here</a>.</p>

  <p id="uWTo7X"><em>The Crush House</em> has everything: romance, drama, a Malibu mansion, and... a dark mystery. Behind the bubbly, colorful facade, <em>The Crush House</em> seems to have something lurking under the surface, something “worse than death,” according to a news release — the show’s  cancellation. <em>Reigns</em> developer Nerial announced Friday that <em>The Crush House</em> will launch on Windows PC on Aug. 9.</p>
<p id="Ycg7g1">As I’m sure you can tell, <em>The Crush House</em> is sort of like a playable version of <em>Love Island</em> or <em>The Bachelor</em>, set in a Malibu mansion in 1999. You play as the show’s producer, tasked with filming the cast’s shenanigans. But it’s not as easy as just pointing the camera and running with whatever happens — you’ll have to put people together to create that romance and drama to keep up with the audiences needs.</p>
<p id="DsZe5M">At night, you’ll explore the titular house and begin to uncover the darker side of the show. Here’s how Nerial described it:</p>
<blockquote><p id="eO6UEC">But there’s more to <em>The Crush House</em> than meets the eye, and a sinister mystery is waiting to be uncovered. Jae can explore the mansion at night when the show goes off-air, engaging in forbidden conversations with the cast to figure out the many dark and twisted secrets of <em>The Crush House</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p id="yq5ziw">I’ve never wanted anything more. <em>The Crush House </em>is out Aug. 9 on Windows PC, but there’s a Steam demo available now.</p>

  <p id="fXk6RU">It’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23298775/cult-of-the-lamb-review-roguelike-action-adventure-rpg-devolver-digital"><em>Cult of the Lamb</em></a>, but make it goat. That’s right, developer Massive Monster is adding two-player multiplayer co-operative play to <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> — with a goat. Announced Friday during Devolver Digital’s Devolver Direct, the free update, called Unholy Alliance<em>, </em>will be released on Aug. 12.</p>
<p id="DHNrUg">In the update, the Lamb and the Goat will be able to complete the entire <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> campaign in local co-op. Massive Monster said in a news release that <em>Cult of the Lamb</em>’s fishing and dice game, knucklebones, will have a two-player twist, too. The Lamb and the Goat will be able to “swap weapons, deal extra damage when fighting back-to-back, or deal a critical hit if their attacks are in sync,” according to the press release. But it’s not only about co-op: Solo players will have a few new powers and abilities to try out — on top of “new tarot cards, relics, buildings, fleeces, follower traits, follower quests, and other secrets to discover.”</p>
<p id="Xt95I7">Massive Monster and Devolver Digital released <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> in 2022, and it was a major hit. Since then, Massive Monster has released two free updates: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23982912/cult-of-the-lamb-sex-update-twitter-interview">the notorious “sex update” Sins of the Flesh</a><em> </em>and a combat-focused expansion called Relics of the Old Faith<em>. </em></p>
<p id="iLTEFd"><em>Cult of the Lamb</em>’s Unholy Alliance update will launch on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X on Aug. 12.</p>

But finally, our long national nightmare is almost over as <em>Borderlands </em>arrives in theaters on August 9. Sadly, I’m not sure its going to be worth the wait based on a scene released earlier today during <em>IGN </em>Live’s Day 1 showcase.</p><p>In the new scene, we see Roland (Kevin Hart), Lilith (Cate Blanchett), Tiny Tina (Ariana Greenblatt), Kireg (Florian Munteanu), and Claptrap (voice by Jack Black) in a dark underground facility filled with boxes and not many lights. It’s hard to see what’s happening. </p><p>This is supposed to be an action-packed sequence from a major motion picture, but it feels more like a pre-recorded skit from a so-so episode of<em> Saturday Night Live</em>. Enemies get shot and just fall down with no blood or gore, characters move around slowly even though this is meant to be a fast-paced sequence, and all of this is done to generic music that you’ll forget about the moment the scene ends. </p><p>But cheap sets, bland action, and iffy pacing can be overcome by great performances and sadly, even though the cast is stacked with people who have done good work, nothing in here lands. I love <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-3-the-kotaku-review-1838290570&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-3-the-kotaku-review-1838290570"><em>Borderlands</em></a></span>. A lot! I enjoy the jokes and the world. This...this isn’t that. I don’t know what this is. What I can tell you is after seeing this scene I’m convinced Hart, Blanchett, and Jamie Lee Curtis—who plays Dr. Tannis in the film—are not the right actors for these characters. Curtis feels especially out of place as Tannis. And Hart... I just don’t understand why one of the most serious characters in <em>Borderlands</em>, Roland, is being played by a comedian.<br></p><p>And keep in mind this is the scene the producers and people involved thought was good enough to debut online. This is what they are selling the movie on. This is their big “Take a look at this and get excited!” clip. If that’s the case, well, I fear for the rest of the movie.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Battle Vision Network is a 1v1 puzzle game, where you match up the same color of character to either attack or defend against your opponent. It has a similar cozy and cartoonish art-style to Grindstone and the matches are description as quick and fast-paced, offering five minutes of intense battling.</p><p>There are multiple different characters you can choose as the captains for your battle and there are a variety of different units to unlock and use. The battling is fairly simple, with matches of three or higher of the same color creating a unit. Vertical matches create attackers and horizontal create defenders. The game will have ongoing seasons where players can battle for different teams, one of which is crowned the champion at the end of a season. Getting a bunch of wins will also unlock plenty of customization options, giving you different looks for you captains and different emotes to taunt your opponent.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhag1fUQy_M" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zhag1fUQy_M" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Battle Vision Network is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2216850/Battle_Vision_Network/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and Netflix in 2025.

Shortly after that, though, perhaps the zaniest publisher, Devolver Digital, took to the digital airwaves to showcase six of its games in the 2024 Summer Devolver Direct presentation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you weren't able to catch it, or if you missed the name of the game you're excited to check out (or even its release date maybe), we've got you covered.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Possessor(s)</h3>

</article><p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/04/possessors-is-a-side-scrolling-action-game-from-the-devs-behind-hyper-light-drifter">Possessor(s</a>) is a new game from Heart Machine, the team behind <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/hyper_light_drifter/b/pc/archive/2016/04/06/game-informer-hyper-light-drifter-review.aspx#:~:text=Hyper%20Light%20Drifter%20has%20already,worthwhile%20rewards%20for%20your%20tenacity.">Hyper Light Drifter</a> and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/solar-ash/solar-ash-review-a-rollercoaster-of-style-and-substance">Solar Ash</a>, and it's coming to undisclosed consoles and PC next year. It features action combat inspired by platform fighters like Super Smash Bros. and is set in a quarantined city destroyed by interdimensional catastrophe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the game, you control Luca, the host, and Rehm, her less-than-cooperative counterpart as the two venture through a sprawling metropolis filled with ruined skyscrapers to explore and secrets about what happened to uncover. Devolver says the story features multiple paths in an "open-ended world structure" and upgrades to discover that allows Luca and Rehm to explore previously inaccessible areas, possibly hinting at a Metroidvania-inspired city layout.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Tenjutsu</h3>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="c0cde686-bc45-4b96-abd8-811f57cd88fb" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/04/tenjutsu-is-a-martial-arts-roguelite-from-the-designer-of-dead-cells">Tenjutsu</a> is a jujutsu-inspired action roguelite from&nbsp;<a href="https://deepnight.net/about/">Sébastien Benard</a>, lead designer of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/dead-cells/one-of-the-best-roguelikes-to-date">Dead Cells</a>&nbsp;and solo developer at Deepnight Games, and it's coming to consoles and PC sometime in the future. If you're familiar with Benard's work, you might recognize <a href="https://deepnight.net/games/tenjutsu/">Tenjutsu (48h version)</a>, which he released back in 2022 – Tenjutsu is a fully fleshed-out version of that 2022 concept.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Devolver describes the game as a "fast and fluid rogue-jutsu," leaning into the game's jujutsu roguelite action. In it, you control a renegade yakuza "hellbent on defying her former associates and loosening their grip on the Secret Garden City." To do so, you must fight four powerful crime syndicates. To defeat them "you must master a brutal brawling system and build a diverse arsenal of weapons, upgrades, and martial arts techniques, breaking their hold on the streets in a flurry of violence."&nbsp;</p>

<p>While you have to take down all four crime syndicates, you can do so in any order. As you do, you unlock new weapons, combat moves, and additional areas to explore. However, the longer you spend doing this, the stronger your enemies become.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Cult Of The Lamb: Unholy Alliance</h3>

</article><p>Developer Massive Monster still isn't done with its 2022 hit game,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/cult-of-the-lamb">Cult of the Lamb</a>, as it's bringing full campaign co-op to it this August. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/04/cult-of-the-lambs-unholy-alliance-update-adds-local-campaign-co-op-this-august">The Unholy Alliance update</a> hits the game on August 12 and adds a new playable character: the Goat.</p>

<p>With the Goat joining the titular Lamb, players can now experience the entire campaign in local co-op. Devolver says this update includes two-player twists on existing minigames in Cult of the Lamb, like fishing and kuncklebones, as well as additional corrupted weapons, tarot cards, curses, and relics.&nbsp;While playing in co-op, players can swap weapons, deal extra damage when fighting back-to-back, and deal critical hits if their attacks are in sync. Plus, solo players get some new powers and abilities to play with, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the update, Unholy Alliance adds new buildings, fleeces, follower traits, follower quests, and more secrets to discover.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Talos Principle II: Road To Elysium</h3>

</article><p>One of our favorite games of 2023 – The Talos Principle II – is getting a three-part "coda" expansion next week, on June 14, called Road To Elysium. Devolver says it will reunite players with beloved characters and put your puzzle-solving skills to the test through a series of thought-provoking new stories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Road To Elysium follows the event of The Talos Principle II and continues the evolution of the robot world while providing you with a new perspective on some of the base game's key moments. This expansion consists of three chapters, each with a distinctive look and feel:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Orpheus Ascending</strong>: Set in Ancient Egypt, in this chapter, you will explore the philosophy of love, death, and resurrection through the story of Hypatia and Sarabhai.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Isle of the Blessed</strong>: This chapter allows players to hang out with Yaqut and Miranda as they join Cornelius and Athena on a "puzzle-driven adventure set on a stunning Caribbean island."&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Into the Abyss</strong>: Devolvers says in this chapter, players will "return to one of the most dramatic moments from The Talos Principle II" to find out what happened to Byron when he was trapped in the Megastructure.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>The Talos Principle II's Road to Elysium expansion launches June 14 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It will cost $19.99.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/08/07/devolver-delays-the-plucky-squire-skate-story-anger-foot-pepper-grinder-and-stick-it-to">After delaying Anger Foot last year to 2024</a>, Devolver Digital has given the first-person kicker (and shooter) a PC release date: July 11.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Anger Foot, it takes place in the caffeine-fueled S**t City, and tasks players with putting the boot, literally, to a menacing menagerie of merciless gangsters.</p>

<p>"Unleash the world's deadliest feet on a colorful cast of anthropomorphic enemies, clearing out slums, sewers, and skyscrapers as you grab new weapons, unlock new sneakers, and upgrade your powers in absurd and wonderful ways," a press release reads.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>Devolver announced today that its reality TV-inspired "thirst-person shooter," The Crush House, launches on PC on August 9. However, the publisher revealed a new demo for the game is available to download and play right now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In The Crush House, you play as Jae, a new producer for The Crush House. As Jae, you'll take your camera into the show's Malibu, California, mansion to keep viewers glued to their screens by filming as much drama, romance, and tension as you can find. However, if you fail to keep the audience entertained, your show will get canceled.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p>And that's everything announced during today's 2024 Devolver Digital presentation.&nbsp;</p>

Revealed during today's Devolver Digital presentation, Tenjutsu is a fully fleshed-out version of <a href="https://deepnight.net/games/tenjutsu/">Tenjutsu (48h version)</a>, which Deepnight released back in 2022.</p>

<p>Devolver describes the game as a "fast and fluid rogue-jutsu," leaning into the game's jujutsu roguelite action. In it, you control a renegade yakuza "hellbent on defying her former associates and loosening their grip on the Secret Garden City." To do so, you must fight four powerful crime syndicates. To defeat them "you must master a brutal brawling system and build a diverse arsenal of weapons, upgrades, and martial arts techniques, breaking their hold on the streets in a flurry of violence."&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check out the Tenjutsu trailer for yourself below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FEtUvSA5v9I" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>While you must take down all four crime syndicates, the order you do so is up to you. As you take more and more down, you gain control of Secret Garden City and can seemingly upgrade its districts and more for rewards. Doing so will unlock new weapons, combat moves, and additional areas for exploration. However, the longer you spend doing this, the stronger your enemies become.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here are some Tenjutsu screenshots</strong>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no release date for Tenjutsu just yet, but it's coming to undisclosed consoles and PC.&nbsp;</p>

Revealed during today's Devolver Digital presentation, the Unholy Alliance update hits Cult of the Lamb on August 12 and adds a new playable character: the Goat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the Goat joining the titular Lamb, players can now experience the entire campaign in local co-op. Devolver says this update includes two-player twists on existing minigames in Cult of the Lamb, like fishing and kuncklebones, as well as additional corrupted weapons, tarot cards, curses, and relics.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check out the two-player action in the Cult of the Lamb: Unholy Alliance trailer below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r5rNzsy-5hA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>While playing in co-op, players can swap weapons, deal extra damage when fighting back-to-back, and deal critical hits if their attacks are in sync. Plus, solo players get some new powers and abilities to play with, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the update, Unholy Alliance adds new buildings, fleeces, follower traits, follower quests, and more secrets to discover.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here are some Cult of the Lamb: Unholy Alliance screenshots</strong>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cult of the Lamb's Unholy Alliance update hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC for free on August 12.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="311" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Devolver Digital kicked off Volvy’s 15th Birthday Party by showing off developer Massive Monster’s next major update for the popular base-building action roguelike <em>Cult of the Lamb</em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/08/battle-vision-network-is-the-brand-new-title-coming-from-the-team-behind-grindstone/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Amongst the amazing titles we’ve seen during the Day of the Devs stream, Battle Vision Network stands out as one to watch. It’s coming from Capybara Games, one of the best indie developers out there, creators of the iconic Might and Magic: Clash of Heroes and their most recent, and undeniably fantastic, offering, Grindstone. If you’re a fan of their previous works, it looks like Battle Vision Network is going to be right up your tactical, strategic, and characterful street.</p>



<p>Battle Vision Network is an online PvP Puzzle Battler fusing cozy color-matching puzzle gameplay with deep turn-based tactics. If you’ve played Might and Magic: Clash of Heroes this might sound familiar, and there’s definitely a real taste of that classic gameplay here. Set in a futuristic arena, where players set out to be the best in the galaxy while showcasing their amazing tactical skills,</p>
<p>Going head to head with other players looks like it’s going to be seriously compelling, and I can’t wait to pit my brain against those of my space-faring rivals. As a Netflix game, it’s coming to both mobile and PC, meaning you can get your strategic fix (nearly) wherever you game. If it’s anything like Grindstone, I can see myself spending a lot of time attached to my iPad in the search for galactic superiority.</p>


<p>Battle Vision Network is all set to be a live service game, so it will continue to be updated with new seasonal twists, fresh characters, ranking leaderboards and ongoing challenges. It looks as though it’ll be a game you can keep returning to day in, and day out, but the tactical gameplay that lies at the centre of it all will have to keep you coming back. With Capybara Games at the helm there’s every chance that it can, and will, do.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24171651/day-of-the-devs-showcase-summer-game-fest-2024-best<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The <a href="https://www.dayofthedevs.com/">Day of the Devs</a> showcase hosted by iam8bit is, to me, far more exciting than the main Summer Game Fest presentation. While it is fun to get hyped for the big releases, Day of the Devs represents something more concrete. The games featured get their own mini-spotlights with developer commentary and gameplay videos. It gives viewers a clearer picture of what these games are about, especially compared to the seconds-long (and <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-summer-games-fest-trailers-can-cost-devs-up-to-550k">apparently exorbitantly expensive</a>) sizzle reels or teaser trailers shown during the Keigh-3 keynote. My only problem, though, is that there are <em>a lot</em> of games to get excited about, making it hard to narrow it down to the 10 best.</p><p><h3><em>Cairn</em></h3></p><p>Rock climbing isn’t my thing. In fact, it looks terrifying, and that terror is what makes <em>Cairn </em>look so interesting. In <em>Cairn</em>, you must reach the summit of Mount Kami one piton at a time. You can climb anywhere, but just like in real mountain climbing, you’ll often face sheer walls and unpassable overhangs that force you to find another way up. One of the things I was immediately drawn to was the way the character’s legs shake as they climb, giving the game an air of urgency and danger that I want to experience for myself.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1376200%2FKARMA_The_Dark_World%2F"><em>Karma: The Dark World</em></a></h3></p><p><em>Karma: The Dark World</em> is a disturbing-looking game from Pollard Studio. It’s a psychological horror game in which you must investigate the mysteries of the dystopian real world and uncover truths in the gross, wet, and slimy world of people’s minds. It looks freaky in that <em>Silent Hill</em> kind of way, but I’d be lying if I didn’t say the horror hottie looking in the mirror is one of the things that really piqued my interest.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1147860%2FUFO_50%2F"><em>UFO50</em></a></h3></p><p>Getting introduced to quirky lil’ games is one of my favorite things about Day of the Devs. Last time, it was <em>Time Flies</em>; this time, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/7/16107594/ufo-50-retro-game-collection-spelunk-downwell">it’s <em>UFO50</em></a>. I love the premise of this game — you play through an assortment of 50 games to see the evolution of a fictional video game developer throughout the 1980s. Each game is complete and unique, and you’ll be able to see graphical and technical improvements in the games as the decade wears on.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1626620%2FKoira%2F"><em>Koira</em></a></h3></p><p>With cats overtaking the cute animal video game meta, I’m glad for games like <em>Koira</em> that reassert the supremacy of man’s best friend. I also love how <em>Koira </em>uses music and sound to communicate instead of dialogue or text.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2596420%2FArranger_A_RolePuzzling_Adventure%2F"><em>Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure</em></a></h3></p><p>Can’t have a best-of list without at least one puzzle game. In <em>Arranger</em>, you... well, <em>rearrange </em>tiles to get around the world with every row and column moving when you do. Shuffle your environment around to bring a key to a locked door or get around a barrier by using the end of a row to warp around to the beginning. The game reminds me of <em>Carto</em>, another puzzle game that I loved, which is apt considering one of the developers on that game is working on <em>Arranger</em>. </p><div><p><cite>Image: Crescent Moon Games; Those Dang Games</cite></p></div><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2805070%2FScreenbound%2F"><em>Screenbound</em></a></h3></p><p><em>Screenbound</em> is one of those games where you look at a short clip and immediately <em>get it. </em>It’s a platforming game in which you use a 2D gaming handheld to navigate a 3D space. Defeat enemies in the 3D world that you can only see on the 2D handheld and use objects from the 3D world to solve 2D platforming puzzles. </p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2458560%2FZoochosis%2F"><em>Zoochosis</em></a></h3></p><p>In <em>Zoochosis</em>, you’re a rookie zookeeper tasked with taking care of all of the animals. Even the mutated ones — <em>especially</em> the mutated ones. </p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2666920%2FBuilding_Relationships%2F"><em>Building Relationships</em></a></h3></p><p>Can’t ignore a pitch that goes, “the most stupid game you’ll see all day.” <em>Building Relationships</em> is a housing dating sim... I think. I love the inherent goofiness of this game, from the silly way Tanat Boozayaangool explains the pun to the way the house protagonist gets around by rolling like a katamari.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1629520%2FA_Little_to_the_Left%2F"><em>A Little to the Left: Seeing Stars</em></a></h3></p><p>One of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23473263/a-little-to-the-left-nintendo-switch-pc">my favorite games from a previous Day of the Devs showcase</a> is getting yet another DLC update, and I’m going to be there no matter what. <em>A Little to the Left</em> lets you bring order to your cluttered life with a collection of puzzles designed to soothe your inner neat freak. Fix something like a messy stack of books the simple way by putting them back on the shelves or go for one of the less obvious solutions by arranging them via color or alphabetically. </p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2449160%2FWhile_Waiting%2F"><em>While Waiting</em></a></h3></p><p><em>While Waiting</em> is another one of those games where I’m immediately charmed by the premise. It’s a game about all the shenanigans you can get up to while waiting for other things to happen. If you’re clever enough with how you use your time, maybe you can eliminate waiting entirely. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
