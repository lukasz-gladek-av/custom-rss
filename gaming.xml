  <p id="jdk8Rl">Just like any other MMORPG,<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/22381941/beginners-job-subscription-teleport-mount-shadowbringers-endwalker"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a> has raids. These eight-player boss fights are broken up by difficulty, with<strong> normal raids</strong> being the versions you can clear for loot and story and savage raids being the ones that drop best-in-slot gear and mounts.</p>
<p id="I6mSit">Below, we explain how normal raids work, where to unlock every normal (and savage) raid in <em>FFXIV</em>, and where to exchange loot for each raid series.</p>

<hr id="AuyD5H">
<h2 id="YxH2IK"><strong>FFXIV normal raids and normal raid roulette, explained</strong></h2>
<p id="UZ9NsM">Normal raids are <strong>eight-player boss fights</strong> that typically slot into a rich storyline in each expansion. There are typically 12 fights to each raid series released over the span of a single expansion; each of an expansion’s three patches drops four fights. </p>
<p id="9ZFslK">Normal raids typically reward unique gear that are close to best-in-slot at the time of launch, and the savage difficulty versions of these fights (usually referred to as savage raids) do drop the best-in-slot gear for the time. Savage raids are typically seen as <em>the</em> end-game content — with ultimate raids being even harder content that only the top percentage of players complete, but those are almost an entirely separate thing.</p>
<p id="HQ2647">Once the gear becomes outdated a few patches later, it’s effectively only good to be used as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/22384023/glamour-how-to-unlock-dresser-plates-prisms-quest">glamour</a>.</p>
<p id="a544DT">Rather than getting armor pieces straight-up, you’ll get <strong>specific drops that can be traded in for gear</strong>. The normal drops trade at the following rate:</p>
<ul>
<li id="YMU0h7">2 lenses/helms for head armor</li>
<li id="mGhGaN">4 shafts/armor for body armor</li>
<li id="YinlYn">2 cranks/gauntlets for hand armor</li>
<li id="txS5kF">4 springs/chausses for leg armor</li>
<li id="ZDcPRI">2 pedals/greaves for feet armor</li>
<li id="eZYV4u">1 bolt/bangle per accessory</li>
</ul>
<p id="NtxznP">The most recent set of raids may have raid drop restrictions on them, meaning you can only claim one drop from each fight in that set per week. Completing the last fight in each tier for the savage raids also rewards a special <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14/22382215/mount-unlock-chocobo-flying-level-requirement">mount</a>.</p>
<p id="QB6Y2t">Unlocking at least two raids from any series (except “The Coils of Bahamut”) will unlock <strong>normal raid roulette</strong>, which will give you EXP and other goodies in exchange for queueing into a random normal raid.</p>
<p id="Fg62VN">As usual with post-game content, you’ll need to beat a bulk of or all of the base game or expansion’s story to unlock it. For example, to do the Omega raids in <em>Stormblood</em>, you’ll need to complete the main scenario quest “Stormblood.”</p>
<hr id="l7X2tN">
<h2 id="60Xgwa"><strong>Where to unlock the A Realm Reborn raids, ‘The Coils of Bahamut’</strong></h2>
<p id="DVGsas"><em>A Realm Reborn</em>’s raid series is unlike any other raid in that there are 13 fights, referred to as “turns” and only four of the fights are available in savage.</p>
<p id="oAyeKE">To unlock the coils, talk to <strong>Urianger </strong>in <strong>The Waking Sands</strong> (Western Thanalan) to start the quest “Primal Awakening.”</p>

<p id="igxRVb">You’ll unlock the first five turns, then the next four turns, and then the final four turns all at once. You can just complete the last turn in each set to complete the quest.</p>
<p id="GlzKOQ">Note that nobody queues for the coils anymore, so to <strong>do not queue for these fights in the regular duty finder</strong> or else you will be stuck there forever waiting for people. Set up a party finder group and consider during these fights unsynced to finish the quests.</p>
<p id="8Rkeg4">This is also the only raid series to actually drop armor and equipment, so you don’t have to worry about trading loot in to an NPC.</p>

I’m not an expert. I don’t claim to be one.

Here you can test out the various weapons in the game, get familiar with controls and how <em>XDefiant </em>feels, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-year-1-all-factions-leak-datamine-rabbids-maps-1851513219&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-year-1-all-factions-leak-datamine-rabbids-maps-1851513219">even spot possible teases</a></span> for future seasons. </p><h2 id="h185736"><a id=""></a><strong>Stick to the “noobs playlist” at first</strong></h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-review-is-it-good-free-call-of-duty-ubisoft-1851499598&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-review-is-it-good-free-call-of-duty-ubisoft-1851499598"><em>XDefiant</em></a></span><em> </em>offers up a “Welcome Playlist” for players under level 25, and I recommend sticking in here for a while so you aren’t matched up against high-level players with more unlocked gear, weapons, and attachments. Once you feel comfortable with <em>XDefiant </em>and have unlocked some stuff, feel free to check out the normal playlists before reaching 25, but don’t feel pressured right at the start to hop in with everyone else. </p><h2 id="h185737"><a id=""></a><strong>Feel free to use the pre-made classes</strong></h2><p>Like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>XDefiant</em> lets you create custom classes made up of different weapons, explosives, and attachments. But early on, before you have a lot of stuff unlocked, I recommend using the game’s pre-made classes. These come with some stuff already unlocked and let you progress towards earning new attachments and weapons, too. </p><h2 id="h185738"><a id=""></a><strong>Switch to your pistol to run much faster</strong></h2><p>Anyone who has played <em>CoD </em>or other similar shooters likely knows this already, but you should switch to your pistol when you need to get across the map quickly. In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-new-fps-xdefiant-servers-matchmaking-ps5-pc-1851492107&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-new-fps-xdefiant-servers-matchmaking-ps5-pc-1851492107"><em>XDefiant</em></a></span><em> </em>you run really, really fast with a handgun out and it can help you cross some of the bigger maps in seconds. But…</p><h2 id="h185739"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t always sprint</strong></h2><p>I get that sprinting is fun and fast and feels good. I get it. But I recommend you don’t sprint all the time. Sometimes it’s better to be walking around a corner instead of running as you can quickly pull out your gun and aim down sights (ADS) to take out a foe. I love to go around corners slowly while snapping into ADS right as I clear the wall, as it usually lets me ambush other that are players hopping or sliding around.</p><figure id="" data-id="8a76fb5088019bbc9a7758d5f0ebb01d" data-recommend-id="image://8a76fb5088019bbc9a7758d5f0ebb01d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image shows characters from XDefiant.

You should play around with all the factions and their various abilities to get a feel for how they play and which ones you prefer. </p><h2 id="h185741"><a id=""></a><strong>Change factions based on the map and mode</strong></h2><p>Don’t feel like you have to stick with a faction forever. They operate more like heroes in a hero shooter and you should be switching between them depending on the map, the mode and the current situation. </p><p>For example, when I play Escort, I tend to pick the <em>Ghost Recon </em>Phantoms faction and use the blitz shield to push the objective forward. But when I play Hot Shot—a Team Deathmatch-like mode—I usually pick a Third Echelon aka<em> Splinter Cell </em>character so I can use the intel suit to help my teammates (and myself) pinpoint enemies as they run around the map.<br></p><h2 id="h185742"><a id=""></a><strong>Once you find a weapon you like, focus on it</strong></h2><p>As you use different weapons, you’ll progress through various firearm challenges—like getting 20 headshots with a rifle. These challenges often unlock new guns to play around with and you should check them out. </p><p>But once you’ve tried some and found a few you like, I suggest focusing on those weapons while playing matches. Doing this will help you level up your guns quicker and earn new attachments. Sure, feel free to shake things up if you need to, but by using a small selection of weapons you’ll quickly unlock more attachments to make them even better.<br></p><h2 id="h185743"><a id=""></a><strong>Vote on a map!</strong></h2><p>It’s hard to spot, but while waiting for players to join and the next match to start, you can actually vote for the next map. This option is somewhat hidden on the right side of the far-too- busy-looking lobby screen. Often I’m one of the only people to vote, letting me decide what maps to play and which ones to avoid. I love democracy!</p><figure id="" data-id="3ab7cdb5693447afda1b9a81337026fb" data-recommend-id="image://3ab7cdb5693447afda1b9a81337026fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the map voting screen as seen in the XDefiant lobby.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h185744"><a id=""></a><strong>Remove modes you dislike from matchmaking</strong></h2><p>While you can just pick a mode and play that and only that, <em>XDefiant </em>offers the option to create a custom playlist and pick which modes you want to play and which you want to avoid. Take advantage of this to avoid modes you hate or just don’t enjoy, while focusing on modes you like and do better in. </p><p>Just keep in mind that you might need to wait longer for matches if you choose to include fewer modes in your custom playlist. However, in my testing, this never delayed things for <em>too long</em>.<br></p><h2 id="h185745"><a id=""></a><strong>Use fire and spider drones to counter shields</strong></h2><p>I’ve seen some players complain that the blitz shield is too powerful. And the first time you encounter one of these mostly bulletproof shields it might seem broken. But there are a few ways to counter them. You can use firebombs if you pick the Cleaners faction to burn the shield carrier. You can also use the spider-drone if you’ve unlocked the Dead-Sec (<em>Watch Dogs</em>) faction, too. Sticky grenades are also useful for taking out an annoying shield. </p><h2 id="h185746"><a id=""></a><strong>On smaller maps try using a shotgun</strong></h2><p>I don’t see a lot of players using shotguns in <em>XDefiant </em>and I get why. The shotguns in this game don’t have great range and on many maps, you’ll lose in medium-range firefights. However, on maps like Arena which are smaller, shotguns can become deadly murder machines capable of wiping a team in seconds. Give ‘em a shot! </p><h2 id="h185747"><a id=""></a><strong>Please, remember the objective</strong></h2><p>This isn’t a game about kills. This is a game about playing the objective. Please, do that. Standing back at spawn and not pushing the escort payload forward doesn’t help anyone but the enemy team. You can still snipe, but try to take a moment to spawn with an SMG and run forward to push the objective, too.</p><hr><p>Now that you have some useful tips and tricks, feel free to hop into <em>XDefiant </em>out now on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. But please don’t use the tips on how to break shields against me, a player who loves my armored blitz shield and uses it all the time to rack up objective points. That wouldn’t be very nice.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A little indie game is taking the gaming world by storm right now. By little, I mean the size of your character because you play as a toy in Hypercharge Unboxed. The recent shooter, which is phenomenal, by the way, is available on PC and Xbox. But can you play Hypercharge Unboxed on Game Pass?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-hypercharge-unboxed-on-game-pass">Can You Play Hypercharge Unboxed on Game Pass?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, while the game is available to purchase and play on Xbox, Hypercharge Unboxed is not yet available on Xbox Game Pass. Could that change in the future? Certainly, but there’s no word about a Game Pass release for the multiplayer shooter.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-hypercharge-unboxed">How Much is Hypercharge Unboxed?</h2>



<p>If you can’t wait for Hypercharge Unboxed on Game Pass, you can buy the indie shooter for relatively cheap. It’s certainly not the cheapest indie game on the market, but it’s a lot of fun for the price tag.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Standard Edition ($29.99)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hypercharge Unboxed</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Complete Edition ($39.99)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hypercharge Unboxed</li>



<li>Supporter Pack</li>



<li>Breaker &amp; Mightus Pack</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-big-is-hypercharge-unboxed">How Big is Hypercharge Unboxed?</h2>



<p>Being an indie game, we don’t expect a massive file size for Hypercharge Unboxed. Thankfully, that’s true. The game requires just under 8GB of space on your system, and it benefits from an SSD due to the competitive shooter aspect of its gameplay.</p>

<p>Speaking of Game Pass, did you hear about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-coming-game-pass-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 coming on day one</a>?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-disney-games-on-ps5<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The House of Mouse has churned out excellent games for PlayStation in recent years, whether they’re programmed exclusively for the PS5 or PS4 titles that can be played on the PS5 as well. Whichever version you have, you can experience the same magic playing fun Disney games as you can get from watching any Disney movie or show. </p><p>Now that Disney owns Marvel, Star Wars, and various other franchises, more games than ever seemingly fall under the 'Disney' umbrella. Below, we've outlined five of the best Disney (or Disney adjacent) titles you can play on your PS5 right now. You can also check out our list of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-ps5-games">best PS5 games</a> overall.</p><h2><strong>Disney Dreamlight Valley</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Disney Dreamlight Valley is the perfect life sim game for Disney Adults who <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-is-a-game-like-animal-crossing">love Animal Crossing</a>, can’t get enough of Stardew Valley, and wish to interact with their favorite Disney characters outside of the theme parks. You play as a custom avatar that works to bring the titular land back to its former glory after it's plagued by the Forgetting, a supernatural event that caused some of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/disney-dreamlight-valley/Every_Character_in_Disney_Dreamlight_Valley">Disney characters living in Dreamlight Valley</a> to lose their memories and others to flee to their homeworlds as a result of the Night Thorns.</p><p>Although rebuilding Dreamlight Valley and constructing homes for the people who left takes a lot of hard work and resources to forage for, you get to befriend every Disney character you meet, even the villains. The game provides a pretty chill experience that you can share with the whole family sitting on your living room couch.</p><p><em>Read our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-review"><em>review of Disney Dreamlight Valley</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2><strong>Kingdom Hearts 3</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Although it was released on the PS4 in 2019, Kingdom Hearts 3 pairs remarkably well with the PS5 thanks to Square Enix making its graphics more enhanced than its predecessors. The game follows Sora on yet another adventure with Donald and Goofy to regain his Power of Waking after failing his Mark of Mastery exam in Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance; Riku and King Mickey searching for Aqua, Terra, and Ventus; and Kairi and Lea (formerly Axel of Organization XIII) training to become Keyblade wielders themselves — all in preparation for the final battle against Master Xehanort.</p><p>In addition to new gameplay mechanics such as Attraction Flow and Athletic Flow, Kingdom Hearts 3 has worlds inspired by Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Big Hero 6, Tangled, and Frozen (complete with the obligatory “Let It Go” cutscene). It also has the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-3-re-mind-dlc-review">Re:Mind expansion</a>, adding more meat to the main game’s story and offering you the chance to test your mettle against the data versions of Organization XIII members and the mysterious Yozora. If you’re up for the challenge, that is. </p><p>Overall, it's an excellent installment in the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-games-in-order">Kingdom Hearts franchise</a> and worth playing while we wait for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-4-release-date-gameplay-trailer-news">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>.</p><p><em>Read our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/01/24/kingdom-hearts-3-review-ps4-xbox-one"><em>review of Kingdom Hearts 3</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2><strong>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>A Grammy Award winner for Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is considered to be the the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-games">best Star Wars games</a> ever made. The story is set five years after the events of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Fallen Order</a>, with Jedi Knight Cal Kestis as he fights the Galactic Empire while searching for a place to hide from them.</p><p>You can customize Cal to look however you envision him to be, wield a Lightsaber similar to Kylo Ren’s with a new stance, and experience top-notch level design packed with more NPCs than you’ve seen in the previous game — or games outside of Star Wars, for that matter. Jedi: Survivor will make you feel immersed in the world of Star Wars with a kickass soundtrack to boot.</p><p><em>Read our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review"><em>review of Star Wars: Jedi Survivor</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2><strong>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Sony may have a tight grip on Spider-Man despite <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-company-disney-owns">Disney owning</a> every Marvel superhero, but we’re still giving Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 from <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/producer/insomniac-games">Insomniac Games</a> a spot on this list. The PS5-exclusive title centers on Peter Parker and Miles Morales struggling to balance their personal lives with their superhero duties as new threats loom over New York City, including Kraven the Hunter, whose supernatural powers turn the city into a hunting ground for superheroes, and the Venom symbiote which, as in Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man 3, turns Parker into a bully and threatens to destroy his relationships.</p><p>The game picks up where <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/spider-man-miles-morales">Spider-Man: Miles Morales</a> left off, and employs multiple elements from its predecessors, plus extra features such as new web-based gadgets and <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/marvels-spider-man-2/All_Marvel's_Spider-Man_2_Suits">Spidey suits</a> tailored to each Spider-Men and their play styles, including the Venom suit for Peter. It got so popular, it sold 2.5 million copies in the first 24 hours of its release and received a promotion on Wheaties cereal. It's no surprise it's our pick for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/top-10-spider-man-games">best Spider-Man game</a> ever made.</p><p><em>Read our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-review"><em>review of Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2><strong>Disney Speedstorm</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>If you want a racing game where you can race against nearly every Disney character in existence, Disney Speedstorm from Gameloft Barcelona has you covered. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-free-ps5-games">free-to-play PS5 game</a> plays the same as Mario Kart, only the racetracks are themed after the worlds of each racer’s films and franchises, such as Mickey and Friends, Mulan, Monsters Inc., Beauty and the Beast, Frozen, and Pirates of the Caribbean; and minor characters serve as Crew Members to their respective racers to boost their stats (i.e. Orange Bird plays Crew Member to Figment).</p><p>Disney Speedstorm has all the makings of a good crossover racing game save for the gacha-esque microtransactions — something other racing titles like Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing and Mario Kart 8 didn’t have to resort to. Who wouldn’t want to race against Mickey Mouse as Mulan, Sulley, Jack Sparrow, or even Elsa?</p><p><em>Read our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-speedstorm-early-access-review"><em>review of Disney Speedstorm</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2><strong>Gargoyles Remastered</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Gargoyles Remastered is a 2D side-scrolling platforming remaster of the original 16-bit Gargoyles game for the Sega Genesis developed for the PS4 by Empty Clip Studios. You take control of Goliath as you relive the story of the Gargoyles' fight against an evil artifact called the Eye of Odin from the time the Vikings invaded Castle Wyvern to their reawakening in Manhattan, New York a thousand years later.</p><p>The game allows you to toggle graphics between the new artstyle reminiscent of the popular Disney animated series and the classic 16-bit pixelated visuals to give you a nostalgia trip back to the Genesis days, and brush up your fighting and platforming skills with the instant rewind feature. The original soundtrack is also dynamic, meaning you can hear the remastered music when you're playing in remaster mode and the low quality version when playing in classic mode. You get the best of both worlds!</p><h2>Disney Classic Games Collection</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Disney Classic Games Collection is another retro classic hit updated for modern consoles courtesy of Digital Eclipse and Nighthawk Interactive. The compilation is a remaster of the 2019 release of Disney Classic Games Collection: Aladdin and The Lion King that comes with everything from the original bundle, including the console and handheld versions of Aladdin and The Lion King, plus The Jungle Book. </p><p>The game comes with features not seen in the original, such as an interactive museum, a rewind function, and an expanded soundtrack. If you already own the physical or digital version of the 2019 release of the bundle, you can get the DLC with the SNES version of Aladdin and console and handheld versions of The Jungle Book for just $10.

Instead, their sole purpose is to teach you about your team members and their lives. It proves that you’ve spent time with your characters and bonded with them.

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171289/star-wars-sith-boring</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars%E2%80%99-real-problem-isn%E2%80%99t-boring-jedi-it%E2%80%99s-boring-sith.889587/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171289/star-wars-sith-boring<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Dz0hob">In the esteemed circles of People Who Think Too Much About <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/">Star Wars</a>, there is a persistent and popular diagnosis of what ails the franchise. It’s got to do with the Jedi: Frankly, they’re boring. The fact that they have laser swords does a lot to mitigate this; <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22320227/disney-star-wars-fans-lightsabers-tiktok">people love a laser sword</a>. The magic powers are also cool, cool enough to tolerate the idea that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2019/12/13/21012853/the-last-jedi-luke-skywalker-buddhism-star-wars-philosophy">one must become an ascetic to obtain them</a>. Their interior life, however? It’s not very sexy — which is probably why the big Jedi stories of the films involve the temptation of the Dark Side. </p>
<p id="EOt356">This is the uphill battle faced by stories like the forthcoming Disney Plus series <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24105856/it-looks-like-star-wars-is-finally-getting-its-watchmen-in-the-acolyte"><em>The Acolyte</em></a>, which will be the first live-action Star Wars show to dive into the world of the Jedi at their peak. It’s got a bit of a leg up thanks to its murder-mystery structure and its wuxia-influenced action, and perhaps it will be successful in surmounting this challenge. Jedi, however, are not the real problem. The problem is that the Sith are boring, too. </p>
<p id="YyPpN3">Like the New England Patriots in the late Tom Brady era, no fictional group has ever won so consistently yet remained so dull. Their primary appeal is mostly twofold — cooler Force powers (lightning, choking) and sick accessories (masks, the color red). Going just by the movies, the Sith hardly make sense — motivated by lust for power and a grave threat to the galaxy, yet there are only two, per Yoda? Come on. </p>

<p id="75qykK">One of the funnier bits of old Expanded Universe Star Wars lore came from fan-favorite writer Drew Karpyshyn’s efforts to explain the so-called Rule of Two, and how a massive force of selfish strivers can even function if everyone wants to usurp the person above them. The result, the Darth Bane trilogy, is a fun read about a Sith’s rise to power that doesn’t originate from any inherent malice, but great talent gone sour in the margins of society. The short of it: Once upon a time there was a ton of Sith, until the conniving and powerful Darth Bane found a way to wipe out all the competition so he could rebuild the order from scratch. Unfortunately, the books depict the Sith at their peak as just as monastic as the Jedi, only super into recreational cruelty and beating each other’s ass.</p>
<p id="DCkmoX">This is especially amusing considering the central thrust of Anakin Skywalker’s fall from grace is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2020/1/5/21050442/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-ending-kylo-ren-prequels-anakin">love for Padmé Amidala</a>, forbidden under the Jedi Order and the fulcrum by which he is turned by Palpatine into becoming Darth Vader. It doesn’t actually seem any better on the other side, pal! Just virgins, all the way down. </p>
<p id="hjngs3">To paraphrase the late Roger Ebert, this sucks! Maybe the Jedi are locked into their dogma — exploring that is a <em>whole</em> other essay — but why can’t the Dark Side users have a little swagger, an interior life with interesting motivations, the freedom to move through the world independently, their selfish schemes enhanced by the Force? It’s baffling that the Sith, like their light-aligned counterparts, get very little on-screen interiority. They are merely the extra-crispy version of Original Recipe Jedi, and reading or watching stories about them just feels like following a bunch of slightly edgier nerds. Or, perhaps more accurately, the very religious. </p>

<p id="5arV1A">The end result is that just about anyone in Star Wars feels a million times more interesting than a Jedi or Sith. Hell, <a href="https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/51653/darth_vader_2015_1">Kieron Gillen and Salvador Larroca’s <em>Darth Vader</em> comic</a> introduced evil counterparts to C-3PO and R2-D2 and they practically stole the damn show.</p>
<p id="J996D5">Current canon doesn’t really have a deep-dive exploration of the Sith, instead preferring to root around the margins of the Force-sensitive populace like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23840577/star-wars-ahsoka-witches-of-dathomir-clone-wars">the Witches of Dathomir</a>, or establishing <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22969575/star-wars-inquisitors-explained">the Inquisitors</a> as a new branch of baddies that operate under slightly different rules. This could be a great opportunity — maybe even one <em>The Acolyte </em>might explore — to introduce a dimension that Star Wars has been lacking. </p>
<p id="z527lr">Love it or hate it, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/12/16749732/star-wars-review-the-last-jedi-rian-johnson-luke-rey"><em>The Last Jedi</em></a> articulated the potent idea of the Jedi religion as extremely limiting to the story potential of the franchise. While <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2019/12/21/21031872/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-spoiler-easter-egg-credit-guide-box-office"><em>The Rise of Skywalker</em></a> didn’t quite run in the same direction, it arguably agrees that the way forward is something more nuanced than the hard moralistic lines previously drawn for the Jedi. The same is true for the Sith. Villains are important in stories — interesting, engaging villains only drive heroes to become more compelling in response as they struggle to meet the challenges posed to them. The grand, operatic paragons of good and evil worked quite well for the epic sweep of the films, but as Star Wars gets narrower and (hopefully) deeper on television, some of those rules could stand to get bent a little. </p>

<p id="w1jBcr">The most memorable moment in Hiromasa Yonebayashi’s <em>Secret World of Arrietty</em>, based on Mary Norton’s Borrower books, isn’t dynamic or explosive. It’s a hushed, drawn-out experience where the biggest action is a character stopping to gape. Arrietty is a Borrower, a doll-sized girl whose equally teeny family lives inside the walls of a human family’s vast country house. At 13, she’s permitted to accompany her taciturn father Pod into that house for the first time, on a quiet raid to get some supplies: a single sugar cube and a single tissue.</p>
<p id="iGL7dN">On paper, the sequence might play like a thrilling heist movie, with Arrietty fighting off an immense, aggressive cockroach, ziplining up a narrow vertical space, and rappelling off a cabinet to the ground far below. But these events play out softly as a sweet coming-of-age ritual. Pod silently supports his daughter and smiles at her daring, and Arrietty alternates between boldness and nervousness. And then there’s the moment where she emerges into the vast empty space of a human kitchen for the first time, after a movie largely spent at mouse level, or in comfortingly well-appointed, close spaces. In that moment, she’s like a human standing on the edge of the Grand Canyon, and Yonebayashi manages to make everyday kitchen items look alien and monstrous as she takes them in with intimidated wonder. <em>—Tasha Robinson</em></p>

<p id="c5XNoY">Director Hayao Miyazaki sets the tone for his period fable <em>Porco Rosso</em> early on — even before the titular bounty hunter arrives on the scene to deal with some air pirates who have kidnapped a group of schoolgirls, the audience has learned that they’re buffoons. The kidnap victims are actually pretty enthused about getting to hang out with pirates, whooping in delight when they arrive and marveling at the skulls painted on their planes. (“It could use some blood!”) It’s a perfect mix of characters, as the pirates kidnap the whole class because “it’s not nice to separate them from their friends,” and the schoolgirls cause havoc on their planes, going through their food and weapons, and popping up in the gun turret. Even when the girls are rescued, they cheerfully say goodbye to the pirates, who grin and wave back in turn. It’s just cute! <em>—Karen Han</em></p>

<p id="0HrfsR">Isao Takahata was a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/28/21272659/studio-ghibli-movies-isao-takahata-grave-of-the-fireflies-princess-kaguya-only-yesterday">master of creating compelling stories</a> from the clouds of everyday life, and <em>Only Yesterday</em> captures the subtle joy of a slice-of-life story. The story flashes between adult Taeko, taking a break to the countryside to reevaluate her life, and young Taeko during small, important moments in her childhood — like the time her father splurged on a pineapple for the family. They all gather around for the ceremonial chopping, and tuck in under the winter kotatsu to try this exotic treat together. But the pineapple isn’t ripe; it’s hard and unpleasant, and the excitement drains away into a quiet, disappointed evening, with Taeko trying to convince herself it’s everything she was hoping for.</p>
<p id="aukWHP">I have a (now fond) childhood memory of feeling immense shame when I learned that for Victorian people, oranges were a rare, treasured delicacy. Here I was, a kid taking these beautiful little suns for granted just because they were easy to come by. This scene reminds me of that memory, not because of the fruit connection, but because small childhood moments like this reverberate forward and change who we are. An unripe pineapple is the disappointing fulfillment of a dream, but it’s also a fleeting bad feeling that we will one day consider fondly. Adult Taeko wonders if she has stayed true to her childhood dreams, but the truth is that dreams are like pineapple; sometimes they’re underripe. —<em>Jenna Stoeber</em></p>

It’s so understated: the protagonist, Chihiro, is just crossing a field of grass to return to her former life. But her friend Haku’s message to her not to look back, and the quiet reprise of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/27/21271852/spirited-away-music-joe-hisaishi-hayao-miyazaki-studio-ghibli-one-summers-day">the theme from the beginning of the film</a> bring up a well of emotion that encompasses everything Chihiro has gone through to save her parents. Working in the bathhouse, cleansing the River Spirit, dealing with No-Face, traveling to Zeniba, remembering that Haku has once saved her life — it all comes rushing back as Chihiro walks away, thanks to the music, the subtle animation of Chihiro’s expression, and the purple tie that remains in her hair. <em>—KH</em></p>

<p id="BYOA3G">Isao Takahata’s imaginative but heartbreaking 1994 movie <em>Pom Poko</em> has always been one of Studio Ghibli’s hardest sells in the U.S., because it relies on so many pieces of Japanese folklore that other cultures don’t share. To begin with, the main characters are tanuki — raccoon-like Japanese animals legendarily famous for shapeshifting, trickster mischief, and cheery hedonism, all summed up with their giant transforming testicles. In <em>Pom Poko</em>, a group of tanuki facing extinction because of human industrialism take one last shot at persuading the local townsfolk to fear and respect their power: the creatures mount a playful spirit-parade, taking on the form of a variety of gods and monsters from Japanese myth. The sequence is spooky and colorful, but it finds its best expression in a moment where two drunken salarymen reminisce about and dismiss their childhood belief in monsters, while missing the wild rumpus going on all around them. <em>—TR</em></p>

</p>
<p id="lrTamR">Viewers could be forgiven for not realizing <em>My Neighbors the Yamadas </em>is a Studio Ghibli film. Its style is a distinct departure from that of most of the studio’s films, with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/28/21272659/studio-ghibli-movies-isao-takahata-grave-of-the-fireflies-princess-kaguya-only-yesterday">director Isao Takahata</a> opting for an aesthetic reminiscent of yonkoma manga comic strips, giving the film the feeling of being sketched in faded pastels rather than inked. The characters are played mostly for humor throughout the film, and are presented as squat and compact. But that changes in one breathtaking sequence in which the father, Takashi, dons a hardhat and confronts a gang of bikers plaguing the family’s quiet block with their bullying antics. </p>
<p id="mM45t7">Once Takashi leaves the gate in front of his home, the entire style of the film shifts. The backgrounds, which throughout much of the film remain the empty beige color of a printed page, are suddenly fully sketched and inky with night. Takashi is rendered in a less-cartoony fashion, taller and more precisely drawn. He walks slowly, hesitantly, and a film typically filled with light comedy suddenly takes on an aura of dread. He’s a middle-aged man who could be badly hurt if the encounter goes awry. The bikers are sinister-looking and hulking in this style, and one image, of Takashi caught in a biker’s headlights, is both ominous and breathtaking. The spell is broken once Takashi’s wife, Matsuko, and mother, Shige, join him in the street. The style reverts to cartoon previous mode as the normally punchy Shige attempts to appeal to the bikers’ egos with gentle admonishment disguised as praise, asking them to be heroes instead of villains. The bikers, fed up with the situation, depart into the night, leaving the family unscathed and prepared to return to their cartoony lives. <em>—John Maher</em></p>

<p id="jLDumA">Hayao Miyazaki’s first film under the Studio Ghibli banner features a lot of visual elements that later became studio signatures — lush green landscapes, energetically sincere child characters, frantic bodies piled on each other in pitched battle, and so forth. But <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/25/21269323/castle-in-the-sky-studio-ghibli-movies-hayao-miyazaki-villains-explained"><em>Castle in the Sky </em>is largely conventional animated storytelling</a>, with cartoonish characters contrasted with elaborate, painted naturalistic backdrops. At least until protagonists Pazu and Sheeta have to fly through a hurricane to reach the flying city of Laputa. Suddenly, the action becomes strange and stylized, with dragon-like lightning bolts writhing around the children’s airship, and motion lines distorting the action. The color largely drops away, and Pazu spots his father’s ghost ahead of him, urging him on. It’s a lovely, dreamy sequence that feels entirely separate from the rest of the movie, visually and conceptually — appropriate for a sequence where everything changes for the characters. <em>—TR</em></p>

<p id="rNDNt1">A great deal of Hayao Miyazaki’s 2023 feature <em>The Boy and the Heron</em> plays out on what seems like a highly symbolic level — it’s an <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>-like fable full of metaphorical references to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23797923/how-do-you-live-boy-and-the-heron-hayao-miyazaki-review">Japanese folklore and to Miyazaki’s own boyhood</a>, run through the filter of an imaginative mind. There’s plenty to unpack in this movie, but no scene is as emotionally fraught and visually surprising as the sequence where the protagonist, Mahito, finally encounters his heavily pregnant stepmother in the depths of the subterranean world he’s been navigating, acknowledges her as his mother (though how to read that is up to the viewer, given the many possible interpretations), and tries to rescue her from the strange, alien world that’s taken her hostage. It’s a dizzying, mysterious sequence, but an intensely emotional one as well. —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="KBNeBw"><em>The Tale of Princess Kaguya </em>ends with a breathtaking encounter with divinity, something like <em>Wings of Desire </em>played backward and dappled with watercolors. As a cloud of deities arrives to return Princess Kaguya to heaven, she protests. They feel she’s experienced enough of mortal life, but she disagrees, and hopes for a last moment with her parents. They all cry together, until a magical robe makes Kaguya forget her mortal life. The human light in her eyes flashes out as her parents fall gently to the ground, sobbing and holding each other. Most encounters with the sublime emphasize rapturous joy or enormous terror, the alien construction of things beyond our understanding. <em>Kaguya</em> shows the fine line between the chaotic, paradoxical mix of emotions that make us human and the unspeakable, humbling might of creation itself. <em>—Max Genecov</em></p>

<p id="zAZGjT">One of the few scenes from <em>Howl’s Moving Castle</em> that is almost an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/28/21273827/howls-moving-castle-studio-ghibli-movies-diana-wynne-jones-adaptation">exact transcription of the novel it’s based on,</a> the breakfast scene also captures a moment of what normal looks like in the film’s fantasy world. That isn’t the wizard Howl and the shy teenager Sophie walking through air in the early part of the film, or Howl turning into a monstrous creature later on. It isn’t Sophie’s hair turning to starlight, or the witch who cursed her succumbing to a curse herself. It’s a cozy morning scene, except a magical fire demon happens to be making the eggs. As the movie progresses, these scenes of normal domestic life — the cleaning, the market trips, the laundry — become all the more important as Howl begins to lose his grip on humanity. Sophie, Calcifer, Markl, and this life they’ve created inspire Howl to stay and defend it. On a less thematic note, this scene contains some signature Ghibli food: the most delicious slices of bacon and the best-looking eggs ever to grace a screen. <em>—Petrana Radulovic</em></p>

<p id="PIUk6F">In the years before the second world war, Jiro Horikoshi, a gifted Japanese airplane designer, has been troublingly associated with a German ex-pat who’s critical of the Nazi party. Hunted by the Japanese secret police, Jiro hides himself in the home of his supervisor at Mitsubishi. His fiancee, Naoko, has been recovering from tuberculosis in a sanatorium, but the affliction will kill her, just as it killed her mother. Against all guidance, Naoko takes a train to Jiro. So the pair can live together in the engineer’s household, they agree to wed immediately, that night in that house, with the supervisor and his wife as the only witnesses. Jiro waits with his boss in a cold room. Outside, they see the warm glow of a paper lantern escorting Jiro’s soon-to-be wife. She’s frail, barely able to stand on her own. Snow falls. They marry. The clock ticks toward tragedy. <em>—Christopher Plante</em></p>

<p id="Ph2Cko">So much of Studio Ghibli’s work is about interactions between humanity and nature, whether it’s violent and competitive, or marked by curiosity and wonder. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/26/21270255/my-neighbor-totoro-best-studio-ghibli-movies-watch-2d-animation-vs-3d-animation-disney"><em>My Neighbor Totoro</em> falls on the idyllic end</a>, as young sisters Satsuki and Mei meet and befriend the local forest spirits. After Satsuki lends the biggest one her father’s umbrella during a rainstorm, he politely offers a gift in return: a packet of seeds, which the girls plant in the garden at home. Then he and his smaller compatriots show up in the middle of the night to make the seeds grow to a house-dwarfing height, and he takes the girls on a flying trip to celebrate. </p>
<p id="F3Gt9H">Hayao Miyazaki’s films are often dark and serious, delving into the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/29/21274695/studio-ghibli-movies-magic-price-spirited-away-princess-mononoke-howls-moving-castle">transactional nature and cost of magic</a>. But here, there’s just pure childhood wonder, and a fantasy of flight come true. It’s all summed up in the moment where the little totoros and Mei cling to the biggest Totoro’s fur for their flight, but Satsuki, the older and more responsible sister, pauses. Is she really invited to take advantage of this giant teddy bear’s fluffy, flying tum? When she accepts that she is, and jumps aboard, her glee makes her seem a lot younger, and it’s a callback to every moment in our lives that makes us feel like kids again. —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="mTveTW">Toward the end of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/26/21270987/kikis-delivery-service-best-studio-ghibli-movies-hayao-miyazaki"><em>Kiki’s Delivery Service</em></a>, the Kiki finds herself struggling with her powers. But when her friend Tombo is in danger — dangling from a zeppelin’s mooring line, high above their city — she knows she has to do all she can to save him. This action-packed scene is the closest thing to a climax that<em> Kiki’s Delivery Service</em> has, and it’s made all the more triumphant because the previous segment of the movie focused on Kiki’s struggles with her powers and her loneliness. The film’s end sees her finding a new sense of purpose and realizing that she’s made a new set of connections. She’s able to fly once again. In the beginning of the movie, she took to the skies alone and landed in a city full of strangers, but at the end, she flies with all eyes on her, and lands to victorious cheers. <em>—PR </em></p>

<p id="Je2dzI">In Miyazaki’s <em>Ponyo</em>, the titular little fish-girl wriggles her way free from her wizard father and rushes to find her 5-year-old human friend Sōsuke. But when she inadvertently releases her father’s store of magic, the sea roils and rises, her fish-sisters mutate into vast beasts, and a huge storm overtakes the land. None of this fazes Ponyo, who shifts rapidly between forms as she runs along the waves, chasing Sōsuke and his mother along a flooding oceanside road, oblivious to the danger she’s putting them in. It’s a wild, expressive chase scene, with Ponyo’s excitement and joy mixing with the humans’ concern about survival. And the surging, out-of-control ocean is a particularly stunning bit of Ghibli magic, especially as it shifts back and forth between waves and giant fish, just as so many other things in the film slip seamlessly from one shape to another. <em>—TR</em></p>

<strong>5. “Country Roads” singalong, </strong><em><strong>Whisper of the Heart</strong></em>

<p id="2ysYv1">Compared to other Studio Ghibli films, there’s little fantasy in <em>Whisper of the Heart</em>, a coming-of-age story following a few months in the life of 14-year-old Shizuku as she takes final exams and figures out what she wants from her future. Navigating the deep pangs of adolescent loneliness, Shizuku is drawn to a little antiques store and a mysterious boy named Seiji, who keeps checking out the same books from the library as she does. As the two get to know each other, Seiji reveals his passion for violins, and Shizuku, an aspiring writer, tells him she’s translating John Denver’s country classic “Take Me Home, Country Roads” for their upcoming graduation. Though nervous, she shares her translation with Shizuku, who plays along with her, and the two are joined by some of his grandfather’s friends. It’s a joyful moment, the two awkward teenagers drawn together and made comfortable by music. Each of them offers the other a glimpse into their inner selves — and it’s all done with a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/28/21273717/take-me-home-country-roads-song-movies-studio-ghibli-whisper-of-the-heart">certified banger</a>. <em>—PR</em> </p>

Four-year-old Setsuko is a bundle of joy, even after her mother is killed. She finds beauty in a bomb-shelter hideout, and savors meager meals alongside her big brother Seita. The audience might hope that everything will be all right — but they know from the movie’s opening scene that it won’t be. Setsuko eventually dies from malnutrition, and as her spirit fades, director Isao Takahata cues a soft soprano elegy in her name. The music plays over scenes of Setsuko at her most innocent, crafting, pretending, and running amok in the grass. The cost of war is not just life, Takahata tells us with elegiac grace, but life that could have been. <em>—Matt Patches</em></p>

<strong>3. San vs. the settlers, </strong><em><strong>Princess Mononoke</strong></em>
</h2>

<p id="9NO4zF">Ghibli’s humanity-against-nature theme returns again in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/27/21271782/princess-mononoke-hayao-miyazaki-best-studio-ghibli-movies-themes"><em>Princess Mononoke</em></a>, but this time it’s much more literal, as a group of exiled and outcast humans build an outpost in the forest and set out to tame it, and the spirits of the forest fight back. Chief among them: San, a human girl raised by wolves, who in a daring mid-film raid, charges into the midst of the human settlement and tries to kill their leader, Lady Eboshi. It’s a thrilling action sequence, but it’s complicated by the fact that Eboshi is expecting San and isn’t remotely intimidated by her. And it’s further complicated by the cursed, dying warrior Ashitaka, who interferes in ways no one was expecting. It’s a three-way push-and-pull situation, with plenty of literal explosive power, a lot of surprises, and full of beautiful moments like the one where San pauses for a long moment between swift attacks and stands in profile atop a building, masked and confidently alone. <em>—TR</em></p>

<p id="9M1MyX">There’s a tremendously poignant journey toward the end of <em>Spirited Away</em>, and writer-director Hayao Miyazaki makes it even more powerful by placing it right after a tremendous amount of hubbub and mess. When human protagonist Chihiro invites a spirit called No Face into the yokai bathhouse where she’s working, he goes on a rampage, devouring everything in sight (including her co-workers) until she feeds him a magic healing dumpling that makes him vomit it all up again. Cue several minutes of frantic chasing, as he simultaneously dissolves into goo and pukes up voluminous waves of gunk. She takes it all in stride because she’s entirely focused on something else — a journey to meet a witch and save a friend.</p>
<p id="E7Od2D">So the crowded, rococo busyness of the bathhouse’s interior, and all the dark and grotesque miasma of No Face’s sickness abruptly gives way to pure, serene blue, as Chihiro escapes the  bathhouse, walks along flooded train tracks to a station that’s nothing more than a concrete slab in the middle of a ceaseless ocean, and boards a train full of shapeless, shadowy ghosts. Joe Hisaishi’s gentle piano score here does powerful work of setting a tone of contemplative peace after a whole lot of hullabaloo. This entire movie is a journey for Chihiro, but this sequence makes that literal, capturing both the excitement of heading into a new place and the wistfulness of leaving an old one, not to mention the peaceable state of being between spaces, with nothing to do but wait and take in the shifting scenery. <em>—TR</em> </p>

<p id="XEDrM5">The landmark sequence that gave Ghibli a lot of its most memorable iconography hasn’t lost any of its power. <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em> is a charming children’s fantasy that slips comfortably between the mundane world and the spirit world, as young sisters Satsuki and Mei encounter blobby, furry forest spirits that often seem alien, but are entirely benign. In <em>Totoro</em>’s most lyrical sequence — which is really saying something, in a movie so full of memorable moments — the sisters try to meet their father’s bus during a rainstorm, so they can hand him an umbrella as he gets home. But he’s late, and the wait drags on past a cheery late afternoon and into a tenebrous night.</p>
<p id="eJCUX3">Then a familiar giant creature shows up, waiting for its own bus. Everything about this sequence is delightful: the familiar way Mei turns from a ball of restless energy into a cranky, sleepy dead weight. The dozy look on Totoro’s face as he waits for the bus. His bearish curiosity over Satsuki’s umbrella. The sheer delight he takes in the noise of rain hitting it, and his outsized response. The gently plodding score, which conjures up the feeling of this great dozy beast operating at a different pace from the humans he meets. So much of Ghibli’s work is about encounters with magic, whether that means actual legendary creatures of power, or the simple magic of engine-powered flight or sunlight in a field. <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em> reliably mixes fantasy wonder with ordinary child wonder, and finds them both equally marvelous, but never more so than in the rain sequence. <em>—TR</em></p>

<p>Every now and then, an indie title that’s so unique comes along, and it blows us away. Stray is one such title. How many other games allow you to explore a dystopian cyberpunk city as a stray cat with a talking robot companion? I can’t think of any others. Everyone should enjoy this game, but with that in mind, is Stray on Game Pass?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-stray-on-game-pass">Can You Play Stray on Game Pass?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, Stray isn’t currently on Xbox Game Pass. There’s a chance it will come to Game Pass in the future, but it’s not there now. If you want to play the indie adventure game, you’ll have to buy a copy.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-stray-on-xbox">How Much is Stray on Xbox?</h2>



<p>If you can’t miss out on Stray, you’ll be happy to know it’s not an overly expensive adventure game. You can purchase a copy of Stray <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/stray/9NMPDQ2NRX34" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Xbox for $29.99</a>, though publisher Annapurna Interactive often hosts sales in which the title goes as low as $19.97.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-big-is-stray">How Big is Stray?</h2>



<p>Another huge plus to Stray is its relatively small file size. You can download the entire game, which only requires a little over 6GB of space on your system’s hard drive. I recommend downloading the game to an SSD on a PC for the best performance, as the city is quite detailed.</p>

<p>When discussing the MMORPG genre, one name usually gets mentioned due to its social, world, and mount mechanics. That game is Guild Wars 2. The free-to-play MMORPG continues to bring in crowds of players monthly, and those numbers will increase soon enough because of the recent Guild Wars 2 announcement. Here is what we know about the Guild Wars 2 new expansion coming later this year!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-guild-wars-2-s-new-expansion">What is Guild Wars 2’s New Expansion?</h2>



<p>The upcoming expansion to Guild Wars 2, Janthir Wilds, which<strong> launches August 20</strong>, features a whole lot of additional content to expand the MMORPG in all the right ways. Namely:</p>



<ul>
<li>A new weapon — Spears</li>



<li>Player housing (Homestead)</li>



<li>Unique, challenging encounters</li>



<li>New storylines, quests, and characters</li>
</ul>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds - Expansion Announcement" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EK3DCrUtjNU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The Guild Wars 2 announcement trailer showcases plenty of new lands we’ll explore, including a bit on the brand-new weapon and even more on Homesteads. I can’t tell you how much I adore player housing in an MMORPG. </p>



<p>I may not play Guild Wars 2 frequently, perhaps once every few months, but this feature alone will ensure I return for the upcoming expansion!</p>



<h6 id="h-related-how-to-check-new-world-server-population-and-status">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-check-new-world-server-population-and-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Check New World Server Population and Status</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-how-much-does-janthir-wilds-cost">How Much Does Janthir Wilds Cost?</h2>



<p>Like with past Guild Wars 2 expansions, <strong>Janthir Wilds costs $24.99</strong>. For a reasonable price, players receive two unique zones: Lowland Shore and Janthir Syntri, probably the most distinctive of the two with its mystical storm systems rampaging through the zone.</p>



<p>Furthermore, we can tame a new mount type: Warclaws. Like other mounts in the game, Warclaws feature unique movement and traversal mechanics that we can enhance over time. </p>



<p>Lastly, the expansion features a few significant updates the team plans to launch between August 2024 and Summer 2025.</p>

<p>"Our Hope is always the same with Destiny games, expansions, seasons, DLCs, exotic missions, secret missions, in-game events, merchandise," he said. "We genuinely Hope you enjoy the time you spend with it. Anything we've made or will make, that's the Hope."</p><p>Fans noted that he capitalized the word "hope" three times, and think that Smith is hinting at Destiny 3.

It was revealed in May 2023 and doesn't have a release window yet.

The sale on Nintendo’s fancier version of its long-in-the-tooth Switch console runs until tonight at midnight ET or once Woot sells out. And it’s possible Woot will <em>not</em> run out of stock this time around because demand for a Switch is not what it used to be. Nintendo has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150926/nintendo-expects-switch-to-become-its-best-selling-console-ever-this-year">sold so many Switch consoles</a> that it feels like everyone who wants one — and their parents — surely must own one by now.</p><div><p>It’s true that the Switch came out over <em>seven</em> years ago, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">a successor is confirmed by Nintendo to be announced by April 2025</a>. But even though the Switch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23473152/nintendo-switch-console-games-performance">feels pretty dated</a>, that doesn’t mean it’s not worth buying in 2024. There is a vast back catalog of games to pick from if you’ve never owned a Switch, and the OLED model with its excellent seven-inch screen is one of the best ways to enjoy them (if you prefer to play in portable / handheld mode). The Switch’s massive library includes games that now feel like institutions unto themselves, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23953834/thats-a-lotta-mario-kart"><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/28/23811665/masahiro-sakurai-smash-bros-without-me"><em>Super Smash Bros.

        <p>Cuts needed to ensure "a stable and sustainable future for the company"</p>

            <p>
Just Cause creators, Mad Max developers and Rage 2 co-developers Avalanche Studios have announced that they will lay off 50 developers - nine per cent of their global workforce - and close their New York, USA and Montreal, Canada studios in order to "ensure a stable and sustainable future for the company". 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/avalanche-studios-group-expands-to-montreal">announcement post</a> doesn't go into much detail about either the reasons for the layoffs or how exactly Avalanche will be supporting the departing staff, adding only that "our focus is now on supporting all Avalanchers through this challenging time" and that "we're grateful for the invaluable contributions of those leaving and remain committed to creating incredible gaming experiences for our players." 
</p>
<p>
Avalanche's Montreal studio had been open for all of eight months. The studio was founded in October 2023 after Avalanche acquired and integrated Monster Closet, who were themselves founded in 2021 by former developers of such headliners as Halo, Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed.  Avalanche's New York studio, meanwhile, dates back to 2011. 
</p>
<p>
Avalanche as a whole turned 20 in 2023. Their current projects include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-cause-developers-announce-open-world-smuggling-game-contraband">Contraband for Xbox Game Studios</a> - an open world co-op game about smugglers with a focus on vehicular battling, set in the fictional Southeast Asian region of Bayan in the 1970s.
</p>
<p>
The layoffs follow hard on the heels of a unionisation agreement for Avalanche staff in Sweden. In April, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-100-staff-at-just-cause-developers-avalanche-have-unionised">Avalanche entered into a collective bargaining agreement with Swedish labour organisations Unionen and Engineers of Sweden</a>, with a view to "[standardising] frameworks around essential areas such as salaries, benefits, employee influence and career support". The deal will take effect in 2025, and Swedish Avalanche workers are now in the process of hashing out the specifics with management. It's not clear how, if at all, this relates to the decision to shutter the New York and Montreal offices.
</p>
<p>
The studio closures fit a larger pattern of games industry mass layoffs over the past year or two that have been widely attributed to a mixture of "overambitious" expansion during the lockdown gaming boom, technological innovations/gimmicks such as NFTs not paying off, general economic upheaval, and a desire for returns on investment that are increasingly hard to square with the sheer expense of developing a blockbuster videogame.</p>
<p>That's a very compressed summary that doesn't take into account how circumstances may vary between studios - Avalanche are not Microsoft, for example, who started the year by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">laying off almost 2000 people</a> after spending $68.7 billion on the acquisition of Activision Blizzard. As Alice B wrote at the time, "shrinking headcount is often one of the first things a business does when it has eaten a smaller, weaker one."</p>
<p>You can read more about the gutting of the games industry in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-do-we-stop-the-next-round-of-games-industry-mass-layoffs">my feature from this year's GDC</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/adventure-forge-hands-on-preview-the-power-of-creation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While games like Minecraft and Roblox made user-generated content games popular, this unique type of game, which relies on the user's creativity, is not new at all. From the classic RPG Maker series to Media Molecule's Little Big Planet series and the underappreciated Dreams and Super Mario Maker, players have had the chance to try their hands at game creation countless times.</p>
<p>None of these games, however, focused specifically on narrative-driven games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/adventure-forge-qa-with-jordan-weisman-unleashing-creators-with-a-no-code-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adventure Forge</a> does. The powerful tool created by Endless Adventure promises to change the world of user-generated content games by offering users everything they need to create complex narrative games without knowing how to code.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/unnamed.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Adventure Forge platform, whose creation is led by Jordan Weissman, the man behind the Battletech and Shadowrun tabletop games, was developed to create a true game creator economy, eliminating the barriers to entry for aspiring creators. As such, it features no-code tools optimized for creating and innovating games within the narrative games genre, ranging from interactive fiction to visual novels, dating sims, and deep isometric RPGs. The tool will ship with four different Universes, which include all the assets required to create a full narrative experience, such as textures, character models, sounds, and so on. But the system is designed to allow the user to go wild with their creativity, as seen in some of the test games that will be available with the Steam Next Fest demo starting next week. Oni was developed during one of the game jams the developers held, and it features some unique visuals and different minigames that showcase the tool's versatility.</p>
<p>While the no-code tools offered by Adventure Forge streamline game development, they are still somewhat complex and require some time to understand. Thankfully, Endless Adventure will offer on the <a href="https://adventureforge.games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> some quick and to the point tutorials to get started. These tutorials only cover the basics, such as creating isometric and 2D scenes and implementing conversations with multiple outcomes using the assets belonging to a few Universes, so it is up to the user to use these basics to create more complex narrative experiences. As such, the tool is relatively easy to use, as once I followed the tutorials, I had a decent understanding of how Adventure Forge works.</p>
<p>As such, in around 40 minutes or so, I was able to create a very short dialogue sequence set in a sci-fi world, complete with some basic exploration mechanics, a 2D dialogue sequence in a visual-novel style with multiple choices and different outcomes. It isn't anything complex, but the relative ease with which I could do so with absolutely no game-creation experience proves how everyone will be able to use Adventure Forge with some time and patience to create games.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/unnamed-2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This simple sequence I created only scratched the surface of what Adventure Forge can do. Isometric scenes, for example, can be fully edited with custom-made locations, lighting, and events that can be triggered by interacting with specific tiles, such as dialogue sequences, camera changes, and so on. In 2D scenes, it is possible to control pretty much every aspect of the visual presentation, such as window placement, character states triggered by different dialogue choices, backgrounds, and so on. One amazing feature Adventure Forge comes with is the ability to test out single sequences on the fly, allowing the user to iterate their games with extreme ease. Coupled with the powerful audio and lighting tool, which grants the user more control over their creations, the possibilities are truly endless and likely even beyond what the developers thought possible.</p>
<p>During a recent presentation, the Adventure Forge development team showcased a project featuring a turn-based combat system created just using the current logic tools. While enemy AI had yet to be developed, and the interface was very basic, the development team was considerably impressed by what was achieved, which they did not think possible at the time. As such, it is clear how creativity will be the only limit when using Adventure Forge's powerful tools.</p>

<p>It is not yet known when Adventure Forge's early access version will be released, but soon enough, users will be able to try out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2466590/Adventure_Forge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo</a> during the aforementioned Steam Next Fest, which will be held from June 10th to June 17th. The demo will also feature two narrative experiences created with Adventure Forge: the sci-fi story The Icarus Experiment and the fantasy world of Oni, which do an excellent job showcasing the possibilities offered by the tool created by Endless Adventure.</p>

<p id="YUfyPb">By completing <em>The Final Shape </em>campaign on Legendary difficulty, you will receive the following rewards:</p>
<ul>
<li id="UZs7Fv">Gear set fixed at 1960 <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23375994">Power level</a> (20 above the soft cap, 30 below the Powerful gear cap)</li>
<li id="Ayjx8g">Exotic armor</li>
</ul>
<p id="IUK2cP">As well as the above, like <em>The Witch Queen </em>and <em>Lightfall</em>, it’s also <strong>you’ll receive a second chest after each major campaign encounter</strong>, which will grant you additional loot to help get you to the soft cap faster — useful if you want to break away from the campaign at any point to play other activities.</p>
<p id="Z15JsV">In summary, by completing the Legendary campaign will give you a healthy <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23375994">Power level</a> advantage, both from bonus rewards earned during each mission, and a fixed Power level set once the credits have rolled.</p>
<h2 id="H1EAMX"><strong>How difficult is the The Final Shape campaign, and can you play Legendary solo?</strong></h2>
<p id="6qmhrk">For solo players, these harder story missions are designed to <strong>scale with your Fireteam</strong> — meaning the difficulty will adjust to the number of players, allowing you to run the campaign solo if you choose.</p>
<p id="U0DCqa">The elephant in the room — whether you’re playing in a Fireteam or not — is the difficulty of the Legendary campaign for <em>Lightfall, </em>which was criticized by fans for being more difficult than <em>The Witch Queen</em>. The good news:<strong> The difficulty appears to have been scaled back </strong>— in part due to ‘raid-lite’ puzzles replacing demanding combat challenges.</p>
<p id="Bq40Dl">“I was able to solo the missions I played on the max difficulty without any real struggle, despite playing at a different mouse sensitivity than I’ve been aiming with for years,” explained service writer Ryan Gilliam in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24164318/campaign-mechanics-raid-final-shape-interview-bungie">our hands-on preview with the campaign</a> ahead of release. “I’ve soloed the other Legendary campaigns as well, but there are some spikes in a few of those missions that had me sweating a bit, even in the comfort of my own home. It feels like Bungie has taken some of that combat difficulty and injected it into the puzzles instead — which is great for non-raiders, but might disappoint some endgame players.”</p>

<p id="ylEpM5">Even with the adjusted Legendary difficulty this time, it’s worth coming prepared with a build prepared to help you survive more challenging encounters. Hunters, for example, could consider using equipment and mods focused on boosting invisibility so you can hide from enemies to recover your shields.</p>
<p id="EdlxYW">For returning <em>Destiny 2 </em>players, it’s likely you’ll also have a range of crafted or god roll weapons and high-stat gear to give you the upper hand. <strong>For new players</strong>, the challenge of Legendary will be more significant without a decent loadout. If you cannot join other players who can help “carry” you through the campaign, it’s worth considering doing a Legendary run at a later time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-diablo-4-season-4-end-date-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>If you ask anyone currently playing Diablo 4 Season 4, they’ll likely tell you this is the best season to date. This is how the ARPG should have launched last year. It took some time to reach this point, but most of us remain pretty addicted to the core gameplay loop this time around. With good reason, too! It’s fantastic leveling a character to 100, but it’ll end soon. Here is what you should know about the Diablo 4 Season 4 end date!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-diablo-4-season-4-end">When Does Diablo 4 Season 4 End?</h2>



<p>The Diablo 4 Season 4 <strong>end occurs on August 6, 2024</strong>. You still have another two months to enjoy the entirety of Season 4, and that’s enough time to level each class to level 100 multiple times over.</p>



<p>I know people who have leveled each class to max already, and now they’re just grinding The Pit for additional loot and bragging rights.</p>



<p>Personally, I’ve been playing rather casually this season due to other responsibilities, and I’m still at level 75 on my Barbarian. I cannot recommend this season enough!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-class-should-you-play-in-diablo-4-season-4">What Class Should You Play in Diablo 4 Season 4?</h2>



<p>While most classes will prove viable in Diablo 4 Season 4, a few stand a cut above the rest—namely, the <strong>Minion Necro</strong>, <strong>Dust Devil Barbarian</strong>, and <strong>Heartseeker Rogue</strong>. </p>



<p>As someone who plays Barbarian every season, I’m running a mixture of Upheaval and Charge. I’m having an absolute blast blowing through entire mobs in a mad dash forward alongside my ancestors. Follow up the initial charge with a flaming Upheaval that ignites the ground in front of you, and you will have a recipe for clearing areas quickly and spectacularly!</p>



<p>However, most people would recommend the Necromancer this season. They’ve received a significant buff to their minions, allowing players to clear dungeons while basically never lifting a finger off your movement controls.</p>

<p data-characters="240" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It looks like <em>Call of Duty</em> could reportedly be part of the the Esports World Cup. New data uncovered today indicates <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> and <em>Warzone </em>tournaments for a total prize pool worth almost $3 million may be hosted as part of the event.</p> <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="true">Dexerto’s Jacob Hale <a href="https://x.com/JakeHaleee/status/1798021527008678101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that lines of HTML were found on the tournament’s website, indicating that the Esports World Cup may host events for <em>Call of Duty</em> . According to the leaked image, the <em>Warzone </em>tournament would have a $1 million prize pool and runs from July 3 through 6. Meanwhile, the <em>MW3</em> portion would have a $1.8 million prize pool and takes place from August 15 through 18. </p>

It features at least 20 events in 19 different titles. Originally, the Esports World Cup Foundation <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/sport/esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia-spt-intl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosted a similar tournament</a> called Gamers8, but Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund stepped in and is taking over the competition for the first time this summer. 30 organizations from five different regions have already been confirmed as official participants, but the competition <a href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-lgbtqia-characters-tournament-saudi-arabia-1851411189" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has received backlash</a> because of Saudi Arabia’s involvement. </p>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false"><em>Call of Duty League </em>organizations 100 Thieves and FaZe Clan have already agreed to participate in the tournament, but it remains to be seen if other CDL teams will follow suit. As for <em>Warzone</em>, there are far fewer organizations involved, and in most cases, it will fall on individuals to decide if they want to compete or not. </p> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">Activision has not yet confirmed the dates for the latter stages of the World Series of Warzone. The qualifying stages take place from June 4 through 12. The Esports World Cup and <em>World Series of Warzone </em>are unlikely to overlap, but several teams will most likely compete in both competitions. </p>
 <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">Meanwhile, the Call of Duty League Championship weekend runs from July 18 through 21. Usually, the regular roster shuffle starts after the final tournament of the year, as contracts expire and players are free to join other organizations. However, it’s possible that some teams will stay together if there’s another prize pool to compete for.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/tactical-breach-wizards-steam-demo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s–<em>finally</em>–a demo of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043810/Tactical_Breach_Wizards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></a> on Steam, the latest game by journalist-turned-game developer Tom Francis. Francis previously made <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/206190/Gunpoint/?curator_clanid=32938364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gunpoint</em></a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/268130/Heat_Signature/?curator_clanid=32938364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Heat Signature</em></a>, two very good games that I like a whole lot, and I am excited to report that <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> is also very good.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The demo is pretty much what the title sounds like: you control a pair of wizards as they tactically breach areas and clear them of enemies. It’s got <em>XCOM</em> and <em>Invisible Inc</em> vibes in its turn-based combat and limited moves each turn, dictated by action points. Unlike those games, levels are contained to discrete series of rooms that make up campaigns, each with their own challenges and goals, as opposed to sprawling areas where you have to manage moving through a lot of space. Also unlike those games, your characters and some of the enemies are wizards, who use their magical abilities in service of somewhat mundane ends as detectives or mercenaries. In combat, this plays out in their unique abilities: in the demo, a character can chain shots together or give another character action points. These special abilities are refilled through mana that you access from intel found around the level, and which forces you to juggle multiple objectives as you make your way through a space.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Tactical Breach Wizards trailer (PC Gaming Show 2022)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vgz6xzsle0o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Before committing to a turn, you can use the “foresee” button to get a preview of how things will play out. In easier levels, I didn’t find this necessary, but it came in handy in a later encounter, where I found myself repeatedly rewinding and testing new strategies before I found the least bad one. Levels also feature optional challenges, which will earn you “confidence” that lets you change your character’s outfit.&nbsp;</p><p>Mechanically, all of this is fairly standard stuff for the turn-based genre, but <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em>’ unusual setting and humor bring something unique. The combination of real-world and magic makes for some fun dialogue and set-ups (one enemy is a “traffic warlock,” which is a delightful concept). The character design reflects these contradictions in stuff like a character wearing camo wizard robes, or another sporting a witch hat and cliche rocker star tattoos. It’s a very funny game, with quippy dialogue and the ability to knock enemies out windows, which seems to be a staple of Francis’ games and which honestly never gets old. Given that Francis once wrote <a href="https://www.pentadact.com/2014-08-08-the-formula-for-an-episode-of-murder-she-wrote/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a blog post about <em>Murder She Wrote</em></a> that I still think is one of the funniest things on the internet, none of this surprises me.</p><figure><figcaption>Suspicious Developments</figcaption></figure><p>All of Francis’ games share a focus on how actions and their consequences can change a situation, and on finding creative ways to play the hand you’ve dealt yourself. In <em>Heat Signature</em>, this plays out in real-time action where things go wrong quickly; the slower, turn-based pace of <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> is a different, slower stage for making things go wrong and then finding ways to make them go right again. Judging by the demo, it feels like everything I was excited for it to be when it was first announced in 2019, and I’m psyched to play the full game.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<p>At this point, it feels like every horror franchise of note has been made into an asymmetric multiplayer game or, at the very least, been fed to the genre-dominating beast that is <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/dead-by-daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead by Daylight</a>. Perhaps because of this, IllFonic (a studio that’s tackled the likes of Friday the 13th, Predator, and Ghostbusters in the past) has had to dig pretty deep for their latest, dredging up <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Killer Klowns from Outer Space</a>, a video store “classic” few have actually watched.</p>
<p>Killer Klowns from Outer Space may not be the hottest horror IP out there in 2024, but hey, it’s the gameplay that counts, right? Is IllFonic’s latest venture a barrel of laughs or begging for a pie to the face? Time to unpack this particular Klown car…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFkillerklowns2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you’re expecting Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game to offer up any sort of deep worldbuilding, well, I’m afraid I have to dash your dreams. This game has no story mode and everything you need to know about the franchise is summed up by its title – there are Killer Klowns, they’re from space, the end. While most folks don’t expect much of a story from this type of game, it <em>is </em>disappointing that the game is rarely, if ever, funny. The original Killer Klowns movie isn’t high art, but it at least provides a few legit chuckles.</p>
<p>Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game offers your typical asymmetric multiplayer setup, albeit with a few tweaks. Instead of pitting a single killer against a group of survivors, this title opts for a 3v7 split between Klowns and humans, with the differences between the two sides not feeling quite as dramatic as in other games of this type. Each individual Klown isn’t too terribly overpowered and humans aren’t just helpless victims in waiting.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFkillerklowns3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As a human, you’re dropped onto a map with nothing to your name, but you’ll quickly accumulate a variety of useful items, such as food and energy drinks to buff your abilities, balls and other noise makers to distract the Klowns, and even weapons like bats, knives, and guns to fight back with. Humans are also generally the more agile of the two factions, with the ability to vault through windows and over obstacles to escape their floppy-shoed pursuers.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFkillerklowns4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Klowns are pokier and more awkward, but are pinged whenever a potential human victim makes noise by moving too fast, firing off weapons, or attempting certain tasks, like breaking down the gate blocking an escape route. Keeping quiet as a human and keeping your ears open as a Klown is central to this game. Klowns come to the battle with a loadout, including one of several melee weapons and a gun that can encase humans in a cotton candy cocoon. These cocoons, which are also found lying around the map, can be hooked to generators that spawn AI Klown lackeys to patrol the area. Klowns also have a number of abilities on cooldown timers that allow the player to, say, instantly jump to a different section of the map, lure opponents in, and even summon a human-sniffing balloon dog. Ultimately, though, perhaps the Klowns’ biggest advantage is that they respawn after being killed (you can be resurrected once as a human, but go down a second time, and you’re done for good).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFkillerklowns5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Both sides have their own goals with humans having a variety of ways to escape the map (a boat, bunker, portal machine, and more) most of which only accommodate a portion of the seven survivors in a match. While it’s nice to have multiple paths to safety, most of the humans’ escape methods play out more or less the same – scavenge a couple of items (gas, spark plugs, keys, etc.) and take them to a designated location. More variety in the actual step-by-step process of escape would be appreciated.</p>
<p>On the flip side, the Klowns’ goal is simple – kill as many humans as possible before the match ends. You can do this by cocooning survivors, beating them down and performing a finishing move on them, or waiting for the Klownpocalypse to take them out. The Klownpocalypse is about what it sounds like – a big explosion that wipes out all remaining survivors when a match’s time limit expires, or Team Klown hooks enough cocoons.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFkillerklowns6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the Klownpocalypse is a big advantage for our interdimensional jesters, IllFonic has done a fairly good job of balancing the game. For instance, humans have a lot of different ways to flee the map, <em>but</em> Klowns can coat escape routes with cotton candy, making getting away harder. As powerful as the Klownpocalypse is, a last-second escape route for the humans always opens up just before it hits. Also, even if you do die as a human, you can continue to play minigames in order to earn items you can gift to still-active players to help them survive. Granted, the Klowns won the majority of the games I played, but there are tons of mechanics, both big and small, that keep things fair, and with proper teamwork, the survivors can definitely come out on top.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFkillerklowns7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>At this point in the review, Killer Klowns from Outer Space may sound like a pretty solid asymmetric multiplayer game, and in terms of base mechanics and balance, it is. That said, this is a <em>very</em> crowded sub-genre at this point, so the question has to be, is Killer Klowns as good or better than other top games of this type? I’d be hard-pressed to say yes.</p>
<p>Compared to most of its competitors, playing as a killer in this game just doesn’t feel that exciting, although due to the 3v7 split, you get to do it fairly often. So, would you rather playing as a killer be a rare and exciting thing? Or a more common, yet less unique, experience? That will largely come down to individual taste, but speaking personally, I prefer the former.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFkillerklowns8.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Beyond that question, Killer Klowns is pretty rough around the edges. Combat is unsatisfying, with ranged weapons being largely useless and melee battles just being frantic button-mashfests. The game’s visuals are ugly on both an aesthetic and technical level, and the audio is largely grating. Glitches, crashes, dropped games, and progress not being saved are all common occurrences.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iqlVMqvo0hg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Then there’s the issue of content. Killer Klowns from Outer Space serves up a sum total of five maps and a single game mode of launch. Those maps are a decent size and feature some randomization, but after only 4 or 5 hours, I felt I’d pretty much mastered them. I give IllFonic credit for not stuffing the game with microtransactions at launch, but with the lack of content on offer, $40 is a big ask, particularly given how thin the source material is. While IllFonic has vaguely promised some post-launch content is on the way, I question how many scarves they can pull out of their sleeves.</p>

<p>Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game is a solidly-conceived asymmetric multiplayer horror game, but a lack of polish and content means it’s unlikely to become a long term go-to for most fans of the genre. There’s some quick and easy fun to be had with Killer Klowns, but a $40 entry fee and an uncertain future make these cheap laughs feel a bit overpriced.</p>

  <p id="9gWjSb">The virtual versions of <em>Talisman</em>, the board game developed by Games Workshop, have expanded into an extensive library of post-launch DLC since their 2014 launch.

This $10 bundle from Humble brings together the base versions of <em>Talisman Digital Edition</em> and <em>Talisman: Origins </em>along with a comprehensive collection of their corresponding DLC <em>— </em>valued at $162 if you were to buy everything separately.</p>

<p id="ViUIYJ">The tabletop version of <em>Talisman</em> is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24159225/talisman-5th-edition-pre-orders">returning with a fifth edition later this summer</a>, with a virtual adaptation currently in development, making this a fantastic opportunity to give this legendary dungeon crawler a try.</p>
<p id="gE9LhE">This bundle features 49 individual pieces of DLC for <em>Talisman Digital Edition</em>, including expansions, legendary decks, and character packs. While Talisman Digital Edition is designed to be played against human opponents, this bundle also includes a copy of <em>Talisman Origins</em> and its three expansions, which offers a more robust single-player experience.</p>
<p id="BRcbOS">Just like other Humble Bundles, a portion of each sale will benefit a nonprofit — in this case, BuildOn, a foundation that helps fund after-school programs in the U.S. and builds schools in developing countries. Just remember you can always use the “Adjust Donation” drop-down menu to choose how much of your payment goes to the publisher, the charity in question, and Humble.</p>

Those posts are some of the most comprehensive information about the event we have thus far. A specific issue she cited was that the event organizers filmed people in the designated rest area for social media.

However, they have not removed the videos from the rest area as requested and instead took down videos of contest winners performing the Pokémon theme song.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Hi BintuRita we apologise for the oversight we are investigating the matters with the production the team.</p><p>The organisers have been very busy with post production but have said will reach out to you personally to make sure your concerns are addressed.</p><p>It’s our first event with very little time to prepare but we do agree that better that a lot of things need to be improved for another season but we appreciate your participation and will continue take your feedback to do better next time.</p><p>Please DM us privately as we did have your prize bags available on the day and was suppose to be given to you after the performance and we will have it delivered to you this week.</p><p>We have taken down the PokéSinger video as well for the time being to investigate further.</p><p>But we really appreciate you for being part of the event and we hope to excite better for another one.”</p></blockquote><p>We’ve reached out to Pokéverse for a comment on the situation and will update this story if we hear back.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PlayStation Plus Essential Games for June have arrived, here’s more details and the Days of Play benefits!</p>



<p>June has kicked off, which means a new month of free games for PlayStation Plus Essential members. According to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-announces-free-ps-plus-games-for-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a>, players can now claim SpongeBob: SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, AEW Fight Forever and Streets of Rage 4 and add them to their library. Additionally, EA Sports FC 24 will be extending its run in the monthly games category and will be available to claim until June 18, 2024. All you need to claim these games is PlayStation Plus Essential membership, which starts at <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/#subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$9.99 per month</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake is a 3D platforming adventure developed by Purple Lamp and published by THQ Nordic. The story has you playing as SpongeBob with your trusty companion, Patrick as you explore different Wishworlds. Next, we have AEW Fight Forever, a 3D wrestling game from YUKE’s and THQ Nordic. In this game, you experience nostalgic arcade wrestling with different types of fighters, game modes, weapons and more. Lastly, we have a 2D beat ‘em up by the hands of Dotemu, called Streets of Rage 4. Streets of Rage 4 is an exciting instalment to the series as it improves the classic gameplay with new mechanics, impresses visually with hand-drawn visuals and has a soundtrack that you will not forget.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-expansion-is-out-august-20-adds-new-raid-player-housing-and-land-spears/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, ArenaNet has unveiled Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds, the fifth expansion (following Secrets of the Obscure, which just <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-midnight-king-the-final-content-update-for-guild-wars-2-secrets-of-the-obscure-is-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got its final content update</a> for the MMORPG originally released in 2012.</p>
<p>Janthir Wilds will be released on August 20, priced at $24.99, with <a href="https://buy.guildwars2.com/en-us/janthir-wilds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-orders open now</a>. Bonus<br>
items include a Serpent’s Wrath weapon set, the Whispering Serpent Pauldrons shoulder armor, the Homesteader character title, a shared inventory slot, and a level 80 character boost. The Deluxe Edition is priced at $49.99 and comes with the standard edition bundle plus another batch of exclusive items: the Wayfinder’s Versatile Table, a set of Eldritch Gathering Tools, an additional character slot, and an Identity Repair Kit. Finally, the Janthir Wilds Ultimate Edition ($74.99) includes the exclusive Standard and Deluxe Edition items, plus 4,000 Gems, the premium in-game store currency.</p>
<p>Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds will add several new features and content, such as proper player housing called Homesteads, which will feature a brand new customization and decorating interface so that heroes may create and adorn their very own housing space for their friends and guild mates.</p>
<p>The expansion also adds the first new endgame PvE Raid to Guild Wars 2 since 2019, featuring challenging boss battles. On August 20, two new explorable maps will be available: the bucolic Lowland Shore and the stormy Janthir Syntri. A third will follow in future updates.</p>
<p>All professions (classes) will also finally get the chance to wield land spears. This new weapon type will be available during a limited time beta test between June 27 and 30. The Warclaw mount will also break out of PvP's World vs. World mode to join the player's mount stables as a new option for exploring the mountains and river valleys of Janthir, using its unique double-jump ability to navigate difficult terrain. Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds will also feature Titans, vaguely described as mysterious magical beings native to the land. They can channel the energy of the land itself.</p>
<p>Players looking for new legendary items to farm will find a spear and backpack item, along with a variety of new non-legendary armor and weapon sets.</p>
<p><iframe title="Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds - Expansion Announcement - UK" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/57pu8v_FPfU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Josh Davis, Guild Wars 2 Game Director, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>From the beginning we wanted to bring together many of the items that have been on both our and the community’s wishlist for years. Janthir Wilds is proof of our commitment to continue to surprise and delight while improving the Guild Wars 2 gameplay experience in unexpected ways, and to support game modes for both the cooperative and competitive communities.</em></p>
<p>ArenaNet also announced that Guild Wars 2 is coming to the Epic Games Store (after launching on Steam) later this Summer.</p>

  <p id="FCgDHc"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23603142/hogwarts-legacy-review-harry-potter-jk-rowling-transphobic-ps5-pc-xbox"><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em></a> is getting a substantial free update this week, more than a year after the game set in the wizarding world of Harry Potter debuted on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. Developer Avalanche Software will release its summer 2024 update on all platforms on June 6 — here’s what <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> owners can expect. </p>
<p id="PJ7OT3">The biggest new addition to <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> is photo mode, which will let players take customized screenshots of their gameplay. The game’s new photo mode looks like what we’ve come to expect from other games with similar features, letting players snap pics and apply various effects, including frames and filters inspired by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/hogwarts-legacy-guide/23581208/house-sorting-quiz-test-gryffindor-slytherin-ravenclaw-hufflepuff-daring-curiosity-ambition-loyalty">Hogwarts’ famous houses</a>. You can put your young wizard or witch in various poses — including <em>sitting</em> — and change time of day and seasons for photos.</p>
<p id="LmA16m">A new quality of life feature will let players easily reset talent points from the Field Guide, but at the cost of 200 in-game gold per talent point. </p>
<p id="FV03HN">And for players who want to see and do it all, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23352072/hogwarts-legacy-ps5-exclusive-mission-quest">Haunted Hogsmeade Shop quest</a> and its rewards will become available for all players of <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>. Previously, that quest was a PlayStation platform exclusive.</p>
<p id="ecri12">Avalanche Software is unlocking other exclusives as well: The onyx Hippogriff mount, previously a pre-order exclusive cosmetic item, will be available to all players, as will the Felix Felicis potion recipe, another PlayStation exclusive. The update will also give players some new cosmetics, including the Azkaban coat and prisoner’s outfit, and taped-up spectacles.</p>
<p id="5x75On"><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> is available on Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.</p>

This might lead you to try all sorts of wild maneuvers to uncover what these mysterious locations mean. Trust me, do <em>not </em>bother taking the M. Disc and trying to slot that in a recess while the ghost dog chases you.</p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>In actuality, each Circular Recess is a gate that leads to an optional area in <em>Animal Well</em>.

Each of these areas hides unique items that you’ll need in order to complete the game’s “second layer,” so you’ll want to uncover these before you try to track down the last 32 eggs in the game.</p><p>As you might expect, finding the three medals is easier said than done.

<p>As someone who genuinely enjoys lengthy role-playing games, even those with a bit of grind, I cannot wait to see more about Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. I adore Inquisition, as do many of you, and it’s high time we receive a direct sequel. But will we see Dragon Age: Dreadwolf at Summer Game Fest?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-dragon-age-dreadwolf-reveal">When is the Dragon Age: Dreadwolf Reveal?</h2>



<p>According to insider reports, which we’re working to corroborate, Dragon Age: Dreadwolf will receive a full reveal this week, likely during Summer Game Fest. Whether it happens during the Summer Game Fest Showcase, Xbox Games Showcase, or elsewhere, however, remains to be seen.</p>



<p>According to the report, the game will be unveiled in Summer 2024. It makes the most sense to showcase the open-world RPG at SGF 2024!</p>







<h2 id="h-does-dragon-age-dreadwolf-have-a-release-date">Does Dragon Age: Dreadwolf Have a Release Date?</h2>



<p>We don’t yet have a full unveiling, so there’s no official Dragon Age: Dreadwolf release date. However, Insider Gaming received reports regarding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-will-reportedly-launch-by-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch by March 2025</a>. We’ve previously heard the RPG will launch sometime this year, but an early 2025 release date seems more likely and appealing for EA to focus on.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-dragon-age-dreadwolf-a-direct-sequel">Is Dragon Age: Dreadwolf a Direct Sequel?</h2>



<p>Yes! It’s been revealed that Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, the fourth game in the long-running RPG franchise, is a direct sequel to Dragon Age: Inquisition. Players will take on the role of a hero, likely with full customization like in Inquisition, as we fight to stop Solas from ripping a hole in the Veil.</p>
