			<p>In a new report today from Bloomberg (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-and-guillemot-family-reportedly-planning-ubisoft-buyout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry.biz</a>), it's alleged that Tencent and the Guillemot family are reportedly planning on buying out Ubisoft. This comes after Ubisoft has repeatedly landed itself in hot water, not just with gamers but also with shareholders. Shareholders have been urging them to restructure the company for a long time now, but there has been no news from Ubisoft as to whether they are going to do that. Now, Tencent and Guillemot Brothers Ltd have been looking into ways to stabilize the company. With how badly Ubisoft is doing, it's possible that the companies will team up to buy out the publisher and take it private.</p>
<p>Sources that are close to the matter at hand spoke to Bloomberg, saying that the companies have spoken to advisors about how they can proceed with buying out the company. However, the talks are in the very early stages, so there is no guarantee that this will lead to a buyout of Ubisoft. This news comes after <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-small-investor-pushes-hard-for-the-companys-sale/">AJ Investments</a> called for Ubisoft to go private, as the share prices dropped to the lowest they'd ever been after the release of Star Wars Outlaws.</p>
<p>At the moment, Ubisoft's market capitalization is at a total of $1.5 billion, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-drop-another-7-shareholders-concerned/">shares dropping a total of 54%</a> so far this year. The prices of the shares even dropped to a ten-year low, as the company saw "softer than expected" sales of Star Wars Outlaws, with the director even expressing their disappointment in the game's overall reception.</p>
<p>Guillemot Brothers LTD is a family-run company where some of the members of the family are responsible for founding Ubisoft, including CEO Yves Guillemot. GBL holds 20% of the publisher's voting rights, with Tencent holding 9.2% of the rights. In 2022, Tencent <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-acquires-a-49-economic-stake-at-ubisoft-ubisofts-stock-price-increases-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased its stake</a> in GBL, which in turn increased its investment in Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Bloomberg did try to reach out to Ubisoft, GBL and Tencent for comment on the ongoing situation, with both Ubisoft and GBL declining to respond, with Tencent likely to follow in their footsteps.</p>
<p>Overall, it's been a troubling year for Ubisoft, as Star Wars Outlaws didn't perform how they hoped, and XDefiant is also in hot water. Additionally, Ubisoft announced the delay of <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, after many members of the developer team called for it to be pushed back to work on the accuracy of the history, as well as trying to polish the game to a playable standard.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hasbro-board-games-coming-to-fortnite-starting-with-clue.1000866/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hasbro-board-games-fortnite-clue<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>UGC studio Look North World has announced it's teaming up with board game giant Hasbro in order to bring some of the company's most iconic board games to&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>via the UEFN creative tool.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/look-north-world-recreates-hasbro-titles-in-fortnite-starting-with-clue/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VentureBeat report</a>, the first board game to get a Look North World adaptation is&nbsp;<em>Clue</em>, which is being released today as a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>island by the name of&nbsp;<em>Murder Mystery: Clue</em>. You can <a href="https://looknorth.world/games/clue-cludeo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">download and check out that island here</a>.</p>
<p>Two more Hasbro board games are due to arrive in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>throughout the rest of this year. The first is&nbsp;<em>Guess Who</em>, which is getting an island sometime later this month, while the second,&nbsp;<em>Connect Four</em>, will get a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em> island in December.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clue-cluedo-game-fortnite-map.jpg?itok=Xrrd8atq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clue-cluedo-game-fortnite-map.jpg?itok=0XHoJbbw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Have you ever wanted to play&nbsp;<em>Clue</em>-slash-<em>Cluedo&nbsp;</em>in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>? Well, now you can.</figcaption></figure><p>According to VentureBeat's report, the&nbsp;<em>Clue</em>&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>island uses&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>elements and assets to recreate the board game, allowing players to play as either Killers, Detectives, or Guests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like the island is an asymmetrical multiplayer experience, so each role has a different objective and win condition, although I'm not entirely clear on what role the Guests might play. Perhaps they just watch the whole thing unfold!</p>
<p>Hasbro digital strategy SVP Eugene Evans says the goal with bringing the company's board games to&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is to "grow [Hasbro's] digital games portfolio through both licensing and internal development".</p>
<p>Evans goes on to say that Look North Games understands "the essence of what makes these games resonate with players", and that the best candidates for adaptations are "games that have attracted fans for decades".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hasbro-guess-who-fortnite-announcement.jpg?itok=R5CVddy9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hasbro-guess-who-fortnite-announcement.jpg?itok=BAWt6r3I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll never guess who else is getting a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>island.</figcaption></figure><p>An increasing number of developers and companies are using&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>islands to explore creative opportunities outside their usual games.</p>
<p><em>The Cycle&nbsp;</em>developer Yager, for instance, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-cycle-fortnite-map-yager">recently revived its ill-fated shooter</a> via a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>UEFN island, and&nbsp;<em>Deliver Us the Moon&nbsp;</em>studio Keoken Interactive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deliver-us-the-moon-fortnite-map">also created a UEFN island</a> themed around its sci-fi adventure.</p>
<p>Look North World's&nbsp;<em>Clue&nbsp;</em><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>island is available to enjoy today; its island code is 0783-3570-5073, if you want to give it a try. The&nbsp;<em>Guess Who&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Connect Four&nbsp;</em>islands are coming later this year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262033/roblox-the-bear-cave-child-abuse<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A popular financial newsletter is accusing Roblox of allowing large-scale child sexual exploitation and inappropriate content on its platform, drawing on years of media reports. The allegations are <a href="https://thebearcave.substack.com/p/problems-at-roblox-rblx-4">detailed in <em>The Bear Cave</em></a>, a short selling newsletter — but Roblox says <em>The Bear Cave’s</em> founder is highlighting rare instances of abuse to profit by making the service look bad.</p><p>“This article contains misleading, irresponsible and in many cases false accusations about Roblox to further the author’s motives as a short seller,” Eric Porterfield, Roblox’s senior director of policy communications, told <em>The Verge</em>. “We reject the claim that child endangerment is a widespread or systemic problem on Roblox, and millions of people have a safe and positive experience on the platform every day.”&nbsp;</p><p><em>The Bear Cave</em>’s report lists 16 instances since 2020 in which adults were arrested or indicted for sexually exploiting children they met on Roblox, one of which involved a man who “groomed 150 children to engage in sexual activity” on the platform.<strong> </strong>It also discusses so-called “condo games” in which users simulate sex, as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60314572">previously reported by the BBC</a>. To be sure, these documented instances involve a small fraction of Roblox’s massive user base: the platform has more than 79 million daily active users, 42 percent of which are aged 13 or younger, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/game-development/roblox/">according to <em>VentureBeat</em></a>.</p><p>Porterfield told <em>The Verge</em> that Roblox continuously updates its safety practices to “catch and prevent malicious activity” on the platform, including by blocking inappropriate words and phrases in chat and not allowing image-to-image sharing. Roblox says the condo games are typically removed quickly — within minutes — and are hard for average users to find.</p><p><em>The Bear Cave</em>’s report also claims that Roblox hosts nonsexual inappropriate content, including games in which players reenact school shootings or the Holocaust. <em>The Verge</em> has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628624/roblox-moderation-trust-and-safety-terrorist-content-christchurch">previously reported</a> reenactments of mass shootings, including the attack on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on Roblox, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/roblox-online-games-irl-fascism-roman-empire/"><em>Wired</em> reporters have seen</a> Nazi role-plays on the platform. In August 2023, two California families <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/3/24120358/roblox-robux-illegal-gambling-online-casinos-lawsuit-section-230">sued Roblox</a> for allegedly allowing illegal gambling rings to prey on children on the platform. Roblox has unsuccessfully tried to get the charges dismissed.&nbsp;</p><p>Reports of inappropriate content on Roblox — sexual or otherwise — aren’t a new problem for the service, and they’re not necessarily surprising given its tens of millions of users. Still, it’s a particularly heated issue for Roblox at a time when legislators and advocates are debating just how much responsibility platforms have for child protection.</p><p>Roblox has been <a href="https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2024/05/16/roblox-kids-safety-legislation-ai">involved in lobbying</a> to shape <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24205393/kids-online-safety-act-minors-age-verification-kosa">the Kids Online Safety Act</a>, and its CEO, David Baszucki, traveled to Capitol Hill earlier this year to meet with legislators. “One of the things specifically with KOSA is that we want to make sure that when young people are learning to create and sharing their creations, for example, that doesn’t get turned off,” Baszucki said in an April interview with <em>Command Line</em>’s Alex Heath. “Or when there is organic learning on our platform or positive communication in some way, we don’t restrict it.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Keep in mind that you can expand down the line, so focus on covering as many nodes as possible with a single District.</li><li>You’ll want to plop down a Logistics District to explore Frostland, where you can find additional resources and manpower. To do that, start Frostbreaking toward the edge of the map, where you’ll spot a Logistics node.</li></ol><h2 id="h154520"><a id=""></a><strong>Research to prioritize on Captain difficulty</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="9753113044ccb0981de29342afb887a0" data-recommend-id="image://9753113044ccb0981de29342afb887a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It seems like it would be better to build a settlement somewhere a bit sunnier." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="It seems like it would be better to build a settlement somewhere a bit sunnier." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->11 Bit Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9753113044ccb0981de29342afb887a0" data-recommend-id="image://9753113044ccb0981de29342afb887a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It seems like it would be better to build a settlement somewhere a bit sunnier." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While the buildings you choose are crucial to your everyday survival, the research projects you select are equally important.

But with a Sawmill upgrade, specifically a Mechanized Sawmill, you can increase materials production for a single slot, allowing a single District to act as two.</li><li><strong>Hothouses</strong>: Without food, you have no workforce. Without a workforce, you have no settlement. It’s a never-ending circle that requires sustenance, and Hothouses help feed the population by increasing food production at your Food Districts. While they require additional workforce and heat to operate, the expense is worthwhile.</li></ol><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li><strong>Scouts’ Headquarters</strong>: Eventually, resources will run dry on your starting map, and despite exponential growth, you must continue pushing outward to survive. You’ll want to send teams out into the Frostland to seek resources and citizens to bring back via the Logistics District.</li></ol><p>With the right build order and technology, along with a careful, calculated approach, you’ll find that surviving <em>Frostpunk 2</em>’s most challenging difficulty setting is not only doable but approachable, too.

Scenes we want to be longer are not. Scenes we want to be short are long.

Justin Clark at <em>Slant Magazine</em> dings the movie for “cinematic centrism.” “On the one hand, it’s obsessed with the non-controversy that making Arthur too relatable might create a real-life incel killer,” he writes. “On the other, it plays out as if making either Joker or Lee too funny, or their musical sequences too lavish, might make it too close to the comics and cartoons that Phillips has no real fealty toward.”</p><p>And the hits just keep coming. “’Joker: Folie à Deux’ is such a dour, unpleasant slog that it is hard to know why it was made or for whom,” begins Manohla Dargis <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/movies/joker-folie-a-deux-review.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/movies/joker-folie-a-deux-review.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at <em>The New York Times</em></a></span>.

That’s all well and good for a meta-sequel that isn’t afraid to alienate its target audience, the problem is that Phillips doesn’t give the people anything else instead.

<p>4J Studios, the developers behind the console version of Minecraft, have released a first look at gameplay for their upcoming game Reforj. </p>



<p>The gameplay comes from a pre-alpha build of the open-world survival sandbox game. In it, players get a look at what they’ll be able to do, and how they can build and explore. </p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Reforj-Pre-Alpha-Gameplay-October-2024.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>“In&nbsp;Reforj, players will explore, build and survive as they establish settlements in hostile conditions, and uncover the secrets of a lost civilization that spans multiple worlds,” 4J Studios said.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-reforj-s-gameplay">What To Expect From Reforj’s Gameplay?</h2>



<p>According to the studio, the worlds of the game will be procedurally generated, and include “exotic creatures and strange new elements.” Players will also be able to sculpt blocks into different shapes, including curves, using tools in the game. Lastly, there will also be “ever-changing environments” as you play.</p>



<p>Reforj is being developed using the studio’s Elements Engine. There’s currently know set release date, but Reforj will be available for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3202730/Reforj/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, Xbox, and PlayStation when it launches. There will also be playtest opportunities for the game. That information will come at a later date.</p>



<p>What do you think of the first-look gameplay for Reforj? Let us know in the comments and join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>. </p>

Having <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-museum-direct-reveals-giant-wiimotes-and-other-treasures-along-with-prices-and-opening-date">followed coverage of the museum closely</a>, he was surprised to discover a brand-new exhibit featuring several Nintendo platforms in the early part of their development.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Nintendo Museum Slideshow</h3></div></output><p>"So apparently very late in the development of the museum, we’re talking *days* before it opened, Nintendo put in a 'Storage' exhibit on the 2nd floor; and this corner is dedicated to prototype Nintendo hardware. Literally gasped when I saw this exhibit and what was on display," McClain wrote on X/Twitter. </p><p>In a separate message, McClain told IGN that he received a tip about the addition of the prototype corner on September 24. He says that Nintendo Museum employee separately confirmed to him that the exhibit had been opened at the last minute. IGN has reached out to Nintendo to confirm.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One prototype was shaped exactly like a fidget spinner with a D-Pad and buttons. Another looked like a giant D-Pad with buttons all over it. (excuse my rough drawings). <a href="https://t.co/gsktpfNIt1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/gsktpfNIt1</a></p>— Kyle McLain (@FarmboyinJapan) <a href="https://twitter.com/FarmboyinJapan/status/1841826954053615873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 3, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>While photography was forbidden in the section with the prototypes, McLain put together a lengthy X/Twitter thread using previously-released images and hand-drawn sketches of what he saw. Some of the most interesting artifacts include a handful of prototype Wii remotes, of which he claims looks something like a fidget spinner, and an N64 controller without the extra grips.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There was also a prototype of a controller that *only* had a center grip. I created this pic in photoshop to give you an idea of what it looks like. <a href="https://t.co/HXnzcOBkHC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/HXnzcOBkHC</a></p>— Kyle McLain (@FarmboyinJapan) <a href="https://twitter.com/FarmboyinJapan/status/1841826928132817204?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 3, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Particularly amazing is what appears to be a glimpse at a very early version of the Game Boy, which McClain says "was black with red buttons, and the layout was similar to the original GBA." McClain included a rough sketch of this prototype as well.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Prototype Game Boys. I gasped. The earliest model was black with red buttons, and the layout was similar to the original GBA. And while the final Game Boy release has the phrase “Dot Matrix With Stereo Sound”, this prototype has the phrase “Dot Matrix Game” above the screen. <a href="https://t.co/k7RBblurC0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/k7RBblurC0</a></p>— Kyle McLain (@FarmboyinJapan) <a href="https://twitter.com/FarmboyinJapan/status/1841826978367995970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 3, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The prototype corner may also dispel some long-held rumors. Asked if the exhibit included Project Atlantis, a Game Boy rumored to be in development in 1996, McClain said, "When I saw the prototype exhibit, I was hoping the infamous Project Atlantis prototype would be on display. Sadly Project Atlantis was nowhere to be found."</p><p>Ultimately, the entire thread is worth reading, since it offers an intriguing look at early Nintendo history. McClain also separately details the rest of his trip in an <a href="https://x.com/FarmboyinJapan/status/1841809980271558954" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exhaustive thread filled with photos and other observations</a>.  </p><p>We took our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-museum-in-person-preview">own trip to the Nintendo Museum back in September</a>, which we described as "light on history, big on fun." In a separate interview, Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto called it the "<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shigeru-miyamoto-this-is-the-most-un-nintendo-like-thing-nintendo-has-ever-made">most un-Nintendo-like thing we've ever done.</a>" The Nintendo Museum is now open in Kyoto, with <a href="https://museum-tickets.nintendo.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tickets available via a lottery system</a>.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

Already a visually impressive game on the base model PS5--which itself was a big upgrade from the original PS4 version--The Last of Us Part 2 on PS5 Pro is aiming for a consistent 4K 60fps experience. As shown by Digital Foundry, it looks like Naughty Dog is hitting this target.</p><p>In a tech breakdown, the channel showed off new footage of TLOU2 on PS5 Pro. Using the PS5 Pro hardware in conjunction with Sony's PSSR upscaling software, TLOU2 is upsampled from a 1440p internal resolution at 60fps to reach its 4K goal, ultimately creating a sharper-looking and smoother game in comparison to the softer graphics seen on base PS5 consoles.</p><p>Some of the highlights here included more realistic hair effects, improved environment details, and a deeper depth of field, alongside other improvements. While watching a YouTube video isn't indicative of the final quality when compared to seeing the enhanced game up close and personal on a proper gaming TV or monitor, the differences are nonetheless very apparent.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoQi6FE-7W8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LoQi6FE-7W8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Overall, I'd say the PS5 Pro's rendition of The Last of Us Part 2 seems successful, even in this pre-release state. It delivers a credible-looking 4K image with excellent detail and pretty good image stability, at a virtually flawless 60fps update," Digital Foundry's Oliver Mackenzie explained.</p><p>There are still some technical issues in this build as Digital Foundry noted, although these will likely escape the attention of all but the most eagle-eyed of players. Interestingly, this version of the game will also include the old PS5 fidelity and performance modes, as well as an option to unlock the frame rate entirely on VRR panels.</p><p>If you're looking for a different game to experience with enhanced graphics, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/" data-ref-id="2900-5758">there'll be plenty to choose from</a> when the PS5 Pro launches.

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-our-first-look-at-the-nintendo-museum/1100-6526006/" data-ref-id="1100-6526006">Nintendo Museum</a> in Kyoto, Japan has only been open to the public for two days, but there are already scalpers who have put up the museum's exclusive merchandise for sale online at greatly inflated prices. That's why the Nintendo Museum has limited a number of its gift-store items to one per customer.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24260570/nintendo-museum-kyoto-gift-shop-limit" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, the Nintendo Museum <a href="https://x.com/Museum_Nintendo/status/1841468114489454668" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared a message on social media</a> that announced the limits on merch including controller-shaped cushions, miniature controller keychain collections, and more. That's not too surprising after items like the Nintendo Museum Kyoto Wii Controller cushion have <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/146073159106" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shown up on eBay for nearly $500</a>. There's no guarantee that the scalpers will get their asking price, but the merch limits will hopefully cut down on those kind of listings from the same sellers.</p><p>Given Nintendo's generation-spanning popularity, the demand for the museum's merchandise may even increase after the new restrictions. The Nintendo Museum has already had to limit the number of people it can admit, and tickets have reportedly been claimed through the end of this year.</p><p>Giant Bomb's Dan Ryckert recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-visit-to-the-nintendo-museum-made-my-life-flash-before-my-eyes/1100-6526764/" data-ref-id="1100-6526764">his advance look at the Nintendo Museum</a>, and he described it as a deeply personal experience that touched upon all of the gaming milestones in his life. The Nintendo Museum isn't just limited to video games, as it also reflects on the company's history that dates back almost a century before Donkey Kong and Mario came along. But it's the games that will bring people in from all over the world.</p>

            <p>Motion Twin's Windblown finally has an early access release date, and it's soon, too: 24th October, 2024.</p>
<p>Announcing the news on its social media accounts, the Dead Cell developer also confirmed that from 14th October, you can try before you buy courtesy of a single-player demo that's debuting as part of this year's Steam Next Fest.</p>

<p>Anyone who participates in the demo will get an exclusive Guinea Pig skin, "a fitting appearance for all of those willing to help us develop Windblown in its early access journey".</p>
<p>A couple of weeks back, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-15-glorious-minutes-of-dead-cells-creators-next-game-windblown">Motion Twin gifted us a 15-minute peek</a> at the follow-up to its hugely acclaimed action-platformer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a>, Windblown. It took us through the basics and offered a mostly spoiler-free insight into "what it's like to step into the shoes of a Leaper for the very first time".</p>
<p>This new teaser isn't as long, sadly, but we do get to see much more action, as well as get the chance to bop to an exceedingly brilliant theme, too – check it out above (or below!).</p> <div>

<p>And last but certainly not least, Motion Twin said it's currently hosting its very own publisher event, La Motion, which include updates about its upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-the-rogue-lite-board-game-smashed-its-crowdfunder-target-in-just-13-minutes">rogue-lite board game</a>.

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-developers-next-game-is-lightning-fast-combat-roguelite-windblown">Motion Twin's Windblown was announced at the end of last year</a>.

			<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered is an excellent showcase of what the PlayStation 5 Pro and the AI-powered PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler are capable of doing, according to a new early analysis.</p>
<p>The new analysis from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-ps5-pro-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-pssr-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a>, based on pre-release footage, confirms the remaster of the second entry in the series by Naughty Dog targets 4K resolution, 60 FPS on the upcoming console, using PSSR to upscale to 4K resolution from 1440p. This delivers a considerable visual leap over the base model's Performance mode, as the upscaler improves texture detail and reduces blurriness and aliasing, especially in fine textures like foliage. On PlayStation 5 Pro, the game also shows noticeable improvements in geometric edges. Additionally, performance is extremely solid, as the game runs at a constant 60 FPS, with the exception of a few scenarios.</p>
<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered's usage of PSSR also allowed Digital Foundry to highlight how the upscaler delivers better image stability than the more widely used AMD FSR. As the game has yet to be released on PC, a direct comparison is not possible, but using its predecessor, it's still clear how the upscaler lags behind NVIDIA DLSS in some regards, such as with fine edge details.</p>
<p><iframe title="Exclusive - The Last Of Us Part 2 - PS5 Pro PSSR Upgrades Tested" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LoQi6FE-7W8?start=2&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered was hardly in need of improvements, unlike other games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-vast-improvement-playstation-5-pro/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, but still, it is great to hear that even games that look and run fine on the base model can take advantage of the PlayStation 5 Pro's features to offer even better experiences. As such, the remaster will become even more the ultimate way to enjoy Naughty Dog's games, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/">review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-bosses-and-tencent-reportedly-consider-taking-company-private.1000815/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which suggests Ubisoft's founders, the Guillemots, and investor Tencent are potentially considering a private buyout of the company to fend off investor challenges.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-04/tencent-guillemot-family-are-said-to-consider-buyout-of-ubisoft" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> (note: report behind paywall), which cites the usual "people familiar with the matter", Tencent and the Guillemots have been discussing "ways to stabilize Ubisoft and bolster its value" with financial advisors (that's Bloomberg's wording).</p>
<p>One of the possibilities being discussed by the Guillemots and Tencent is a teamup to enact a private buyout of the company, which would take it off the market, theoretically putting an end to the demands of public shareholders and companies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-buyout-report.jpg?itok=5ODErayv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-buyout-report.jpg?itok=CNbFkhaZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The poor performance of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>is one factor that's led Ubisoft shareholders to express dissatisfaction.</figcaption></figure><p>Recently, Ubisoft has come under fire from some shareholders, particularly activist investment company AJ Investments, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change">publicly criticized</a> Ubisoft recently over its "current performance and strategic direction".</p>
<p>AJ Investments' suggestions for improvement included a private buyout, changing management and ousting the Guillemots, and others, but whatever the outcome, the shareholder clearly wants fundamental structural change.</p>
<p>In late September, AJ Investments <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter">claimed it had the support</a> of around 10% of Ubisoft's shareholders in its demands, and that, combined with French union STJV threatening strike action over return-to-work policies and purportedly low salaries, has likely been a thorn in the Guillemots' sides.</p>
<p>All of this also comes alongside a delay to&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>; the game was originally intended to come out in November, but it'll <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">now launch in February</a>, although said delay doesn't appear to have anything to do with the ongoing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy">controversy surrounding the game's co-protagonist Yasuke</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-ubisoft-stealth.jpg?itok=Vzh7OzYi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-ubisoft-stealth.jpg?itok=MFMJHK_p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has been pushed back to February, and Ubisoft investors probably aren't happy.</figcaption></figure><p>As Bloomberg points out, Ubisoft stocks <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ubisoft-shares-sink-decade-low-083010524.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sunk to their lowest in over ten years</a> after the delay was announced, although it's worth noting that alongside the delay, Ubisoft also revealed sales of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>hadn't been particularly strong.</p>
<p>If there is a buyout, it's likely the majority of the cash will come from Ubisoft investor Tencent, especially since the company also has an almost 50% stake in the Guillemots' holding company.</p>
<p>Of course, no official announcement has been made yet, and Bloomberg points out that its sources say Tencent and the Guillemots "are also considering other options". We'll bring you more on this as soon as we get it.</p>

            <p>I’m usually a little suspicious of anything that winkingly describes itself as “very normal”. It’s got Mental Baz energy to me. You’ve met mental Baz, right? He’s mental, he is! Has half a lemonade shandy with lunch sometimes, and wears one of those t-shirts that look like a tuxedo. Absolute mentalist! Anyway, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grunn-review">reviewing</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grunn">Grunn</a> last week it’s thankfully far more interesting and creative than poor old Baz, who’s honestly just a bit shy and actually really nice when you get past the facade. Grunn just released today, and my high level tempter is that it’s a little bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a>, just with all the touching wonder replaced by spooky whimsy. Here’s a trailer:</p>

<p>“A gardener gets hired for maintenance work over the weekend. A simple task, but strangely some tools are missing,” reads Grunn’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2720950/Grunn/">Steam page</a>. “The owner of the garden isn't around, and their house is off-limits. Perhaps new tools can be found in the mysterious town, or maybe some of the reserved townsfolk have seen them?”</p>
<p>Grunn is from Tom van den Boogaart Sokpop collective, who’ve done all sorts of wonderful bits, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stacklands-is-a-gentle-village-building-game-played-with-cards">Stacklands</a>, which is just one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sokpop-collective-are-releasing-their-100th-game-and-aiming-for-100-more">100 games they’d made as of 2022</a>. It’s really one of those less-you-know-the-better cases, but here’s a non-spoilery summary from my review:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is Grunn for you? Well, do you like the feeling of doing things that took you a long time before, again, but really fast? Do you like weird and delightful discoveries? Do you like going ‘ah!’ really loudly when a mystery clicks together? Do you like dying in various ways and unlocking new endings and knowing to do things a little differently next time around?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think I’ve ever used one of those quote box things for my own words before. It feels opulent. Dangerous, even. Anyway, Grunn is great. Do check it out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-rise-30-amid-buyout-reports/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-rise-30-amid-buyout-reports/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>After reaching <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-falls-to-11-year-low-after-assassins-creed-delay/">11-year lows</a> last week, Ubisoft stock prices have soared amid rumors of a potential buyout involving Tencent.</p>



<p>Almost immediately after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-considering-buyout-with-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the report on the talks</a> broke, Ubisoft shares rose from €10.77 to €14.07 within an hour. As of writing, the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UBI.PA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shares sit</a> at €13.70, a 28.9% increase for the day. </p>



<p>In the United States, the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UBSFY/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">jump was about</a> the same percentage wise. It rose from $2.32 to $3.09 within 45 minutes. It has since fallen back to $2.98, a 28.8% increase, as of writing.</p>



<p>Overall, shares are still down 11% and 14% in France and the United States this month, respectively. They also remain down 42% year to date. So, while the increase is good for shareholders, it’s still a far cry — pun intended — from where it was earlier this year.</p>



<p>Inside the company, Ubisoft is continuing to look for answers after a number of recent struggles.

<p>In the wake of those legal efforts against other Switch emulator developers, the Ryujinx developers posted an automated message on their Discord server in response to any questions about Ryujinx's ultimate fate. "Nothing is happening to Ryujinx," the message read. "We know nothing more than you do. No dooming."</p>

<p>Riperiperi reports that development will now stop on "a working Android port" of the emulator, which was not yet ready for release, as well as a tech demo iOS version that would likely have remained a "novelty" due to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/apples-restrictions-hold-back-the-first-pc-emulator-on-the-ios-app-store/">Apple's just-in-time compilation restrictions</a>. Developers were also working on updates that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz6k7wURlPo">would have allowed local wired multiplayer gameplay connections between Ryujinx and real Switch hardware</a>.</p>
<p>"While I won't be remaining in the switch scene either, I still believe in emulation as a whole, and hope that other developers aren't dissuaded by this," riperiperi writes on the project's Discord. "The future of game preservation does depend on individuals, and maybe one day it'll be properly recognized."</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240929032104/https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx?tab=readme-ov-file">According to the developers</a>, "as of May 2024, Ryujinx [had] been tested on approximately 4,300 titles; over 4,100 boot[ed] past menus and into gameplay, with roughly 3,550 of those being considered playable."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-lawsuit-says-samsung-%E2%80%9Ccoordinated%E2%80%9D-with-google-to-get-around-trial-verdict.1000788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/epic-lawsuit-says-samsung-coordinated-with-google-to-get-around-trial-verdict/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>The new suit makes heavy reference to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/at-trial-epic-argues-google-bribed-its-way-to-an-android-app-monopoly/">arguments from the <em>Epic v. Google</em> case</a> alleging that an informal agreement between Samsung and Google has prevented the Samsung Galaxy Store from becoming a true competitor to the Google Play store. The suit notes that, while the Samsung Store is available on 40 percent of all Android phones, it represents only about 1 percent of all Android app downloads.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also calls attention to the timing of Samsung's decision to turn on Auto Blocker by default just as Epic and other third-party App Stores were launching on Android. That timing is especially suspicious, according to the lawsuit, in light of Samsung's initial Auto Blocker announcement last year, which left the feature off by default because, as Samsung put it, "[t]here are many benefits to intentional sideloading, such as enhanced customization and control over a device’s functionality."</p>
<p>This fact pattern forms the core of Samsung's argument that implementing Auto Blocker by default must have been "a coordinated decision by Google and Samsung to circumvent" the results of the <em>Epic v. Google</em> lawsuit. While the suit doesn't provide any concrete evidence that such an agreement exists, it argues that "absent an agreement between Samsung and Google, it would be irrational for Samsung (or any company in its position) to entrench the Play Store monopoly."</p>
<p>In a statement, Samsung said it planned to "vigorously contest Epic Games' baseless claims... The features integrated into its devices are designed in accordance with Samsung’s core principles of security, privacy, and user control, and we remain fully committed to safeguarding users' personal data."</p>

      Phil Spencer's Tokyo Game Show update.

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>Beloved real-time strategy classics <em>StarCraft</em> and <em>StarCraft II</em> will soon be available in Microsoft's Game Pass subscription for PC, the company <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/26/starcraft-game-pass/">announced</a> during the Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>It's already free to play both <em>StarCraft</em> and <em>StarCraft II</em>'s multiplayer modes on PC. This move to Game Pass will make the equally excellent single-player campaigns available to anyone with a subscription, though. Game Pass will also offer all the expansions for both games.</p>
<p>The subscription will provide access to <em>StarCraft Remastered</em>, a revamped version of the original 1998 game that came out in 2017, as well as the <em>StarCraft II Campaign Collection</em>, which includes all 70-plus single-player missions from <em>StarCraft II</em>'s <em>Wings of Liberty</em>, <em>Heart of the Swarm</em>, <em>Legacy of the Void</em>, and <em>Nova Covert Ops</em>.</p>
<p>The announcement was the lone bit of new information in a brief video by Xbox boss Phil Spencer. He appeared in the video wearing a <em>StarCraft</em> T-shirt, which might have gotten <em>StarCraft</em> fans' hopes up that the franchise would be getting a new game for the first time in over a decade.</p>
<p>That didn't happen, of course, but the games' addition to Game Pass will likely expose them to many new players who may have been too young to play the influential strategy titles when they debuted in 1998 and 2010.</p>
<p>These aren't the first Blizzard games to be added to Game Pass since Microsoft acquired Activision-Blizzard. First came <em>Diablo IV</em>, then <em>Overwatch 2</em>—the latter was free-to-play already by the time it came to Game Pass, but Microsoft included it in the Game Pass distribution platform and offered cosmetics and goodies to Game Pass subscribers.</p>
<p>The <em>StarCraft</em> games will launch for PC Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate subscribers on November 5.</p>

          <p>In the last few years, large swaths of the game industry have embraced generative AI, both <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/game-developer-survey-50-work-at-a-studio-already-using-generative-ai-tools/">on the development side</a> and for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/are-robloxs-new-ai-coding-and-art-tools-the-future-of-game-development/">new user-generated content tools</a>. But <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/12/nintendos-miyamoto-stepping-down-working-on-smaller-games/">legendary Nintendo game designer Shigeru Miyamoto</a> says his company "would rather go in a different direction" when it comes to AI technology.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/arts/design/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-nintendo-museum.html">a recent interview with The New York Times</a>, Miyamoto said this wasn't just contrarianism on Nintendo's part. “It might seem like we are just going the opposite direction for the sake of going in the opposite direction, but it really is trying to find what makes Nintendo special,” Miyamoto said. “There is a lot of talk about AI, for example. When that happens, everyone starts to go in the same direction, but that is where Nintendo would rather go in a different direction.”</p>
<p>Miyamoto's statement comes a few months after a more noncommittal position Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa took <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406e.pdf">in a July investor Q&amp;A</a>. "Generative AI, which is becoming a big topic recently, can be used in creative ways, but we recognize that it may also raise issues with intellectual property rights," Furukawa said at the time.</p>

<p>Thus far, Meta's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/meta-continues-to-shovel-money-into-the-growing-vr-gaming-segment/">heavily money-losing Reality Labs division</a> has been primarily focused on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-version-0-5/">bulky virtual reality headsets</a> (and some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/even-people-who-bought-metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-dont-want-to-use-them/">odd, display-free Ray-Ban branded sunglasses</a>). So when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg pulled out a 100 g pair of see-through, augmented-reality glasses <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MetaforDevelopers/videos/449444780818091">at this year's Meta Connect keynote</a>, it represented a bit of a new direction for the company.</p>
<p>The prototype Orion AR glasses Zuckerberg showed off today don't mean Meta will be ready to release a pair of consumer AR glasses anytime soon. But the demo represents a new vision for lightweight, wide-ranging, see-through smartglasses that Zuckerberg calls "a glimpse of the future" and "the dream of Reality Labs."</p>
<h2>Not your average screen</h2>
<p>The core challenge of building a pair of comfortable augmented-reality glasses, Zuckerberg said, is that "they have to be glasses." That means no bulky headset (a la Quest), no wires (a la Apple Vision Pro), and a weight of less than 100 grams (compared to a full 515 g for the Meta Quest 3). While there's a tiny battery and "custom silicon" in those lightweight glasses, Zuckerberg admitted that some processing is done in a "small puck" that connects wirelessly to the glasses themselves.</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>Orion is a little thicker than actual glasses, but a whole lot smaller than VR headsets.</span>
                    <span>
                      <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MetaforDevelopers/videos/449444780818091" target="_blank">Meta</a>
                  </span>
          </p>
  </div>

<p>To achieve true augmented reality, Zuckerberg said Orion uses a screen that "is not actually a screen." Instead, the glasses use tiny projectors embedded in the arms, which shoot light into specially designed waveguides. From there, the light hits "nanoscale 3D structures etched into the lenses" to show holographic images that can be layered at various depths and sizes on top of a natural view of the real world as seen through transparent lenses.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Zuckerberg said it has been a challenge making sure those images are sharp enough to capture fine details and bright enough to be seen in all sorts of lighting conditions. "This isn't passthrough," Zuckerberg stressed during the keynote. "This is the physical world with holograms displayed on it."</p>
<p>Orion's microprojection technology allows for a field of view that Meta says is "the largest... in the smallest AR glasses form to date." <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/i-wore-metas-orion-ar-glasses-a-wireless-taste-of-a-neural-future/">In live demos</a> to press, Meta said that the field of view reaches 70 degrees, compared to just <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/hololens-2-field-of-view/">52 degrees for Microsoft's older Hololens 2</a> or <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/report-magic-leap-ones-field-view-detailed-developer-documentation/">50 degrees for the Magic Leap One</a>, to cite some more limited examples of consumer AR.</p>
<p>To control these holograms, Orion users can use voice commands or hand- and eye-tracking like that already seen on Quest VR headsets. But Zuckerberg also talked up a "neural interface" wristband—which the company has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/metas-hardware-plans-include-thinner-quest-this-year-ad-supported-ar-in-2027/">teased previously</a>—that can read tiny wrist and finger movements even without line of sight to the glasses themselves. That will let you interact with what's on your glasses without having to awkwardly speak out loud or hold your hands in front of you like a zombie, Zuckerberg said.</p>

<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>"Holographic Ping-Pong" is one of the early prototype uses for the Orion glasses prototype.</span>
                    <span>
                      <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MetaforDevelopers/videos/449444780818091" target="_blank">Meta</a>
                  </span>
          </p>
  </div>

<p>So far, Meta seems to have a pretty limited vision of what can be done with this new kind of display. Zuckerberg mentioned answering a text without having to pull out your phone, playing "holographic Ping-Pong" with others in the room, or talking to "life-sized holograms of people" who&nbsp;appear in the same space with you (which looked pretty lumpy and odd in the on-stage demo). A <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/introducing-orion-our-first-true-augmented-reality-glasses/">Meta blog post about Orion</a> suggested "multitasking windows" of floating translucent screens, hands-free video calls "while you wash the dishes," or glancing at a pantry full of food and letting AI craft you a recipe.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
        
        
        
        <div>
          
          
<p>As with smartphones, it will probably take a while for developers to really figure out what to do with this new mode of computer interaction. But unlike bulky VR headsets or "passthrough" mixed-reality experiences, truly lightweight AR glasses like these seem like they could be much easier to integrate into everyday tasks without awkwardness or discomfort.</p>
<h2>Still years away</h2>
<p>Meta's interest in augmented reality isn't exactly new—the company announced plans for a device like this publicly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/oculus-announces-plans-to-build-augmented-reality-glasses/">in 2019</a>. Now that we're at the public prototype phase, though, the finish line of an actual consumer AR product seems more within sight for Meta.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/introducing-orion-our-first-true-augmented-reality-glasses/">a blog post discussing Orion</a>, Meta says it is "one of the most polished product prototypes we’ve ever developed, and is truly representative of something that could ship to consumers." But <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253908/meta-orion-ar-glasses-demo-mark-zuckerberg-interview">The Verge notes</a> that constructing that prototype currently runs Meta a whopping $10,000 per unit, which is far from a consumer-friendly price point.</p>
<p>At Connect, Zuckerberg said the team is working to scale things up on the manufacturing side to make things more affordable, as well as aiming for a sharper display and sleeker, more fashionable design. That effort could culminate in products based on this prototype "in the next few years," according to Meta's blog post. That would align with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/metas-hardware-plans-include-thinner-quest-this-year-ad-supported-ar-in-2027/">a leaked 2023 Meta hardware roadmap</a> that projected its first AR glasses to launch in 2027.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Zuckerberg said Orion would be used as an internal prototype for Meta to build its AR operating system and loaned to "a handful of external partners" to start working on software. "This is where we are going," Zuckerberg said. "These glasses exist, they are awesome, and they are... a glimpse of a future that I think is going to be pretty exciting."</p>

      Sony's <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>&nbsp;trailer.

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>If you've been sleeping on the Akira Kurosawa-inspired, <em>Assassin's Creed</em>-esque samurai game <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, you've been missing out. Given that it recently got a PC release, this is a great time to catch up on it—but now there's even more reason to do so, as Sony just announced a sequel titled <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>.</p>
<p>Slated for a 2025 release, the game bears similarities to its predecessor. It follows a wandering samurai who rides horses across picturesque, wind-swept fields, befriends animals, and defeats enemies in katana duels.</p>
<p>Whereas <em>Ghost of Tsushima </em>was set on Tsushima Island during the time of the Mongol invasion, <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is (fittingly) set around the foot of Mount Yōtei, one of Japan's most picturesque locales—the area is called Hokkaido today.</p>
<p>Most fans of the first game expected a new location in <em>Tsushima</em>'s sequel, but they may not have expected the other big change: there appears to be a new protagonist. The woman who appears in the trailers is not Jin Sakai, the main character of <em>Tsushima</em>. This suggests the franchise will move forward with something like an anthology format instead of direct sequels. A <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-in-2025/">blog post from Sony</a> says the new character is named Atsu.</p>
<p>The blog post also says that <em>Yōtei</em> takes place in 1603, 300 years after the events of <em>Tsushima</em>.</p>
<p>Developer Sucker Punch hasn't revealed anything about the gameplay, though, beyond what we see in the trailer. So far, what we see looks almost identical to what we've played before. There are surely going to be more announcements to come, though.</p>

<p>As someone who has been following the growth of generative AI for a while now, I know that the technology <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/gmails-ai-powered-email-summaries-can-dig-through-your-inbox-for-you/">can be pretty good</a> (if <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/australian-government-trial-finds-ai-is-much-worse-than-humans-at-summarizing/">not quite human-level</a>) at quickly summarizing complex documents into a more digestible form. But I still wasn't prepared for how disarmingly compelling it would be to listen to <a href="https://notebooklm.google/">Google's NotebookLM</a> condense <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/how-bill-gates-minesweeper-addiction-helped-lead-to-the-xbox/">my recent book about <em>Minesweeper</em></a> into a tight, 12.5-minute, podcast-style conversation between two people who don't exist.</p>
<p>There are still enough notable issues with NotebookLM's audio output to prevent it from fully replacing professional podcasters any time soon. Even so, the podcast-like format is an incredibly engaging and endearing way to take in complex information and points to a much more personable future for generative AI than the dry back-and-forth of a text-based chatbot.</p>
<h2>Hey! Listen!</h2>
<p><em>Listen to NotebookLM's 12.5-minute summary of my <em>Minesweeper</em> book using the player above.</em></p>
<p>Google's NotebookLM <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/googles-new-notebooklm-app-builds-a-custom-ai-based-on-a-source-document/">launched over a year ago</a> as "a virtual research assistant that can summarize facts, explain complex ideas, and brainstorm new connections—all based on the sources you select." Just last week, though, Google <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/notebooklm-audio-overviews/">added the new "Audio Overview" feature</a> that it's selling as "a new way to turn your documents into engaging audio discussions."</p>
<p>Google doesn't use the word "podcast" anywhere in that announcement, instead talking up audio creations that "summarize your material, make connections between topics, and banter back and forth." But Wharton AI professor Ethan Mollick correctly referred to the style as a "podcast" in <a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1836480689081913572">a recent social media post</a> sharing a NotebookLM Audio Overview of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/059371671X?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_AKD9E3789QQDK1S0240N">his book</a>. Mollick called these Audio Summaries "the current best 'wow this is amazing &amp; useful' demo of AI" and <a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1836482214386671943">"unnerving, too,"</a> and we agree on both counts.</p>
<p>Inspired by Mollick's post, I decided to feed <a href="https://bossfightbooks.com/products/minesweeper-by-kyle-orland">my own book</a> into NotebookLM to see what its virtual "podcasters" would make of 30,000 or so words about '90s Windows gaming classic <em>Minesweeper</em> (believe it or not, I could have written much more). Just a few minutes later, I was experiencing a reasonable facsimile of what it would be like if I was featured on <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510282/pop-culture-happy-hour">NPR's Pop Culture Happy Hour</a> or a similar banter-filled podcast.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<h2>Just the facts?</h2>
<p>NotebookLM's summary hits on all the book's major sections: the pre-history of the games that inspired <em>Minesweeper</em>; the uphill battle for the Windows Entertainment Pack at a business-focused Microsoft of the '90s; the moral panic over the game's pre-installation on millions of business and government computers; and the surprising cheating controversies that surrounded the game's competitive scene.</p>

Sure, I could quibble about which specific bits the summary decided to focus on and/or leave out (maybe feeding different chapters individually would have led to more detail in the collected summaries). But anyone listening to this "podcast" would get the same general overview of my book that they would listening to <a href="https://codexhistoryofvideogames.libsyn.com/episode-262-minesweeper-with-kyle-orland">one</a> of the <a href="https://retronauts.com/article/2079/retronauts-episode-539-minesweeper-shareware">many</a> actual <a href="https://gamehistory.org/ep-110-minesweeper/">podcasts</a> that <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-70840107/ep327-kyle-orland">I did</a> after the book launched.</p>
<p>While there weren't any full-blown, whole-cloth hallucinations in NotebookLM's summary "podcast," there were a few points where it got small details wrong or made assumptions that weren't supported in the text. Discussing <em>Minesweeper</em> predecessor <em>Mined-Out</em>, for instance, NotebookLM's audio summary says, "So this is where those squares and flags start to come into play..." even though <em>Mined-Out</em> had neither feature.</p>
<p>Then there's the portion where the summary-cast mentions a senator who called <em>Minesweeper</em> "a menace to the republic," repeating the quote for emphasis. That definitely captures the spirit of Senator Lauch Faircloth's tirade against <em>Minesweeper</em> and other games being pre-installed on government computers. In the "podcast" context, though, it sounds like the voices are putting words in Faircloth's mouth by sharing a direct quote.</p>
<p>Small, overzealous errors like these—and a few key bits of the book left out of the podcast entirely—would give me pause if I were trying to use a NotebookLM summary as the basis for a scholarly article or piece of journalism. But I could see using a summary like this to get some quick Cliff's Notes-style grounding on a thick tome I didn't have the time or inclination to read fully. And, unlike poring through Cliff's Notes, the pithy, podcast-style format would actually make for enjoyable background noise while out on a walk or running errands.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          

<h2>It’s all in the delivery</h2>
<p>It's that naturalistic, bantering presentation that makes NotebookLM's new feature stand out from other AI products that generate capable text summaries. I felt like I was eavesdropping on two people who just happened to be discussing my book in a cafe, except those people don't actually exist (and were probably algorithmically designed to praise the book).</p>

<p>Right from the start, I was tickled by the way one "podcast host" described the book as a tale from "the land of floppy disks and dial-up modems" (a phrase I did not use in the book). That same voice goes on to tease "a bit of Bill Gates sneaking around the Microsoft office," up front, hinting at my absolute favorite anecdote from the book before fully exploring it later in the summary.</p>
<p>When they do get to that anecdote, the fake podcast hosts segue in with what feels like a natural conversational structure:</p>
<blockquote><p>Voice 1: It's hard to deny the impact of something when your own CEO is secretly hooked.<br>
Voice 2: Wait, are we talking about Bill Gates?</p></blockquote>
<p>The back-and-forth style of the two-person "podcast" format allows for some entertaining digressions from the main point of the book, too. When discussing the wormy movie-star damsel-in-distress featured in <em>Minesweeper</em> predecessor <em>Mined-Out</em>, for instance, the AI summarizers seem to get a little distracted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Voice 1: I have to ask, what kind of movies does a worm even star in?<br>
Voice 2: I'm afraid that detail has been lost to the sands of gaming history.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then there's the casual way the two "hosts" bring up the improved versions of <em>Minesweeper</em> that were crafted to fix problems with Microsoft's original:</p>
<blockquote><p>Voice 1: So eventually the community came up with a more elegant solution.<br>
Voice 2: Let me guess. They created a new version of <em>Minesweeper</em>.<br>
Voice 1: Exactly.<br>
Voice 2: Called it a day on the old one.</p></blockquote>
<p>The two-person format helps foster a gentle, easy rhythm to the presentation of dense information, with natural-sounding pauses and repetition that help emphasize key points. When one ersatz podcaster talks about the phenomenon of "this incredibly addictive puzzle game [being] pre-installed on practically every computer," for instance, the other voice can answer back with the phrase "on every computer" with just the right amount of probing interest. Or when one AI voice intones that "it was discovered that the original <em>Minesweeper</em> had a flaw in how it generated random boards," the other voice jumps in and exclaims "A flaw!" with pitch-perfect timing and a sense of surprise.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
        
        
        
        <div>
          
          
<blockquote><p>Wait, are we talking about Bill&nbsp;Gates?</p><p><span>NotebookLM podcast voice</span></p></blockquote>
<p>There are some problems with this back-and-forth style, though. For one, both voices seem to alternate between the "I read the book" role and the "I'm surprised at these book facts you're sharing" role, making it hard to feel like either one is genuine. For another, the sheer volume of surprised reactions (a partial sample: "What? No! Wooooow! You're kidding! No way! You're blowing my mind here!") can get a little grating. And then there are the sentences that pause at the wrong points or the bits of laughter that feel like an editor chopped them off prematurely.</p>
<p>Still, when one fake podcast voice cooed, "Oh, do tell!" in response to the idea of controversy in competitive <em>Minesweeper</em>, it set off the same <a href="https://www.findapsychologist.org/parasocial-relationships-the-nature-of-celebrity-fascinations/">parasocial relationship</a> buttons that a good, authentic podcast can (while also effectively flattering my sense of authorial ego).</p>
<p>After listening to NotebookLM's summary of my own book, I can easily envision a near future where these "fake" podcasts become a part of my real podcast diet, especially for books or topics that are unlikely to get professional interest from human podcasters. By repackaging generative AI text into a "just two people chatting" format, Google has put a much more amiable face on what can sometimes seem like a dehumanizing technology.</p>

    <p><span>The PS5 Pro version of the 30th anniversary bundle comes with both varieties of DualSense controller, a plate for an (optional) optical drive, and other accessories.</span>

<p>Sony launched the original PlayStation console in Japan on December 3, 1994, and Sony isn't letting the 30th anniversary pass by quietly. Today the company has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/19/celebrating-30-years-of-playstation-with-a-nostalgic-look/">announced</a> limited-edition versions of both the PS5 and PS5 Pro with gray plastic shells and multicolored PlayStation logos, inspired by the gray plastic shells of the original. The retro-inspired modern consoles will be released on November 21 and will be available for preorder starting September 26 from <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/">Sony's direct.playstation.com</a> site.</p>

<p>Sony is also releasing DualSense and DualSense Edge controllers with gray shells and colorful PS logo buttons and a gray version of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/sonys-200-handheld-portal-can-stream-games-from-your-ps5-and-uh-thats-it/">Switch-esque PlayStation Portal streaming console</a>. Sony says that the limited-edition PS5 Pro will be limited to 12,300 units—a reference to the December 3 launch date—but didn't mention any specific manufacturing numbers for the regular PS5, either DualSense controller design, or the PlayStation Portal.</p>
<p>Both console bundles also come with a handful of other accessories: a PS logo sticker, a PS logo paperclip, cable ties, and (my personal favorite) a regular USB-C cable with a giant, chunky PS1-style controller connector on one end.</p>
<p>Though they're inspired by the original PlayStation, neither limited edition console comes with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/the-ps5-pro-brings-the-game-consoles-disc-drive-era-to-an-end/">a built-in optical drive</a>; however, they do include the gray plastic enclosure for anyone who chooses to add an $80 optical drive after the fact.</p>

<p>Sony has, notably, announced no pricing information for either console or any of the controllers or other accessories, though it almost doesn't matter—the nature of limited-edition gaming-related collectibles is such that enthusiasts and scalpers will snap these consoles up shortly after launch, regardless of whether Sony sells them at the usual MSRP or not.</p>
<p>Sony <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/12/limited-edition-original-grey-ps4-pays-homage-to-first-playstation/">released a similar PS1-inspired version of the PlayStation 4</a> for the PlayStation's 20th anniversary in 2014, and it <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_nkw=20th+anniversary+ps4&amp;_sacat=0&amp;rt=nc&amp;LH_Complete=1">still fetches a high price</a>—upward of $1,000 on eBay for used versions in good condition and between $1,500 and $2,000 for mint-in-box consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/gta-online-is-broken-on-steam-deck-following-anti-cheat-update/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Last week, Rockstar added <a href="https://www.battleye.com/">BattlEye</a> support to <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>, offering some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/gta-online-publisher-goes-after-paid-cheating-services/">much-needed</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/fortnite-gta-v-hackers-face-legal-action-for-online-cheating/">anti-cheat</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/rockstar-clears-out-illegitimately-gained-gta-online-cash/">protection</a> for the game's highly successful <em>GTA Online</em> multiplayer mode. That anti-cheat support wasn't welcome news for Steam Deck players, though, who now get confronted with an error when trying to log in to <em>GTA Online</em>.</p>
<p>According to Valve, though, Rockstar could solve this minor technical issue with a single email.</p>
<p>In both <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/271590/announcements/detail/6356356787200715685?snr=2___">a Steam Community update</a> and <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/33490543992467/Grand-Theft-Auto-Online-BattlEye-FAQ">a Rockstar Support FAQ</a>, the developer notes that "Steam Deck does not support BattlEye for <em>GTA Online</em>. You will be able to play <em>GTAV</em> Story Mode but unable to play <em>GTA Online</em>." As such, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/271590/Grand_Theft_Auto_V/"><em>GTA V</em>'s Steam page</a> now lists the game as "Unsupported" for Steam Deck users, because "the game's anti-cheat is not configured to support Steam Deck."</p>
<p>But BattlEye support on the Linux-based Steam Deck hasn't presented a technical problem to developers for years now. Back in late 2021, shortly before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/steam-deck-the-comprehensive-ars-technica-review/">the Steam Deck's launch</a>, Valve <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3104663180636096966">wrote</a> that "BattlEye on Proton [and thus Steam Deck] integration has reached a point where all a developer needs to do is reach out [to] BattlEye to enable it for their title. No additional work is required by the developer besides that communication."</p>
<p>Shortly after that announcement, popular games including <em>ARK: Survival Evolved</em>, <em>DayZ</em>, and <em>Arma 3</em> all took advantage of that opportunity to support both BattlEye anti-cheat and Steam Deck compatibility at the same time. But many <a href="https://steamdb.info/tech/AntiCheat/BattlEye/">other BattlEye titles on Steam</a>—including <em>Destiny 2</em>, <em>The Crew 2</em>, <em>The Day Before</em>, and <em>Riders Republic</em>—have apparently not bothered to "reach out to BattlEye" to enable the same Steam Deck support.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/nintendo-the-pokemon-company-sue-palworld-maker-pocketpair/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Nintendo and The Pokemon Company <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2024/240919.html">announced</a> they have filed a patent-infringement lawsuit against Pocketpair, the makers of the heavily Pokémon-inspired <em>Palworld</em>. The Tokyo District Court lawsuit seeks an injunction and damages "on the grounds that <em>Palworld</em> infringes multiple patent rights," according to the announcement.</p>
<p>"Nintendo will continue to take necessary actions against any infringement of its intellectual property rights including the Nintendo brand itself, to protect the intellectual properties it has worked hard to establish over the years," the company writes.</p>
<p>The many surface similarities between <em>Pokémon</em> and <em>Palworld</em> are readily apparent, even though Pocketpair's game adds many new features over Nintendo's (such as, uh, guns). But making legal hay over even heavy common ground between games <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/02/game-makers-face-uphill-battle-proving-copyright-infringement-in-court/">can be an uphill battle</a>. That's because copyright law (at least in the US) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/06/defining-tetris-how-courts-judge-gaming-clones">generally doesn't apply to a game's mere design elements</a>, and only extends to "expressive elements" such as art, character design, and music.</p>
<p>Generally, even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/03/attacking-the-clones-indie-game-devs-fight-blatant-rip-offs/">blatant rip-offs of successful games</a> are able to make just enough changes to those "expressive" portions to avoid any legal trouble. But <em>Palworld</em> might clear the high legal bar for infringement if the game's 3D character models were indeed lifted almost wholesale from actual <em>Pokémon</em> game files, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/palworld-pokemon-plagiarism-accusations-pile-up-as-ceo-responds/">some observers</a> have been alleging since January.</p>
<h2>What patent are we talking about?</h2>
<p>Beyond mere copyright concerns, though, Nintendo's lawsuit announcement specifically alleges <em>patent</em> infringement on the part of <em>Palworld</em> (though this difference could come down to vagaries of translation from <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/2024/240919.html">the original Japanese</a>). A lawsuit over patents would seemingly require <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/03/patents-on-video-game-mechanics-may-strangle-innovation/">some unique game mechanic</a> or feature that has been specifically granted stronger protections by the patent office. While the Pokémon Company <a href="https://patents.justia.com/assignee/the-pokemon-company">does hold a number of (US) patents</a>, most of them seem to deal with various server communications methods or the sleep monitoring capabilities of <a href="https://www.pokemonsleep.net/en/">Pokémon Sleep</a>.</p>
