            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/throne-and-libertys-beta-is-fun-but-doesnt-do-enough-to-stand-out<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I’ve done my time in major MMOs like Final Fantasy 14 and World of Warcraft, but outside of that I’ve only dabbled in the various other  forms this subgenre can take. So when I say that Throne and Liberty isn’t quite rising to my past experiences with massively multiplayer dungeon-diving, loot-grinding, and boss-slaying, it’s an opinion coming largely from a “normie.” That said, both FF14 and WoW have big expansions launching the same year as this, NCSOFTs Guild Wars 2 follow up, and though its world is beautiful and its combat grows into a compelling and active ballet of skill interactions, the largely boring story and repetitive quest design I experienced in my 10 or so hours with the Open Beta makes me worried for Throne and Liberty’s chances at unseating the kings of the genre.</p><p>It is a great-looking game, though. The character creator lets you customize your avatar with some commendable levels of detail. And no matter what you put together, the end result will look fantastic, and shows no signs of the sort of player character uncanny valley that some games suffer from, where the overall quality of your PC is lower than the handcrafted NPCs from the developers. The world is pretty stunning, too. Once you see the huge flying whale for the first time, you’ll go quite a few hours before you see something that majestic again, but the environments you’ll travel through on your journey are rich in color and detail. I really loved the swampy forest overrun by spiders and the colorful plains with giant wild birds that are Definitely Not Chocobos. Even better, all of this runs remarkably smoothly. Becoming your own mount and morphing into a wild cat to sprint through cities or fast traveling from location to location loads lightning fast and in real time no matter how many people are on screen.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Throne and Liberty Early Images</h3></div></output><p>You’re going to do quite a lot of traveling from place to place, guided around by a completely unremarkable story about magically blessed youngsters growing into warriors of destiny, and the various factions in the world of Solisium that want to use them for their own gain. I didn’t get too far into it – only around chapter 5, which is halfway through the available content at the time – but none of it stood out as compelling. Thanks to a reliable narrator that recaps important parts of the story I did soon after doing them, I found myself skipping through much of the bland dialogue in non-cinematic exchanges. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The bulk of the quests both on the main path and side missions are pretty run-of-the-mill MMO fare. </p></div><p>The bulk of the quests both on the main path and side missions are pretty run-of-the-mill MMO fare. You’re gonna be collecting pieces of the local wildlife to make a potion, find missing people, do a stint as a mail carrier, etc. There’s a steady pace of new things to learn and do as you go along, but Throne and Liberty treating the main story as an elongated tutorial gave me a bit of anxiety about how to use all of the random stuff I was getting as rewards, to the point where I was very conservative with how I spent any loot because I didn’t what to spend it on upgrading something if I was only going to learn that I could have spent it on something else in the next couple of quest phases. Every region of the map has its own specific side tasks, which are worth completing for their rewards even if you aren’t usually the type to make sure all of their boxes get checked. These are more likely to feature more interesting missions or puzzles to solve than the main quest, but there’s plenty of “kill X of Y” here, too. I didn’t get to see too many of these myself, but I chatted with a few folks in my travels who described some more complex platforming missions in instances that I definitely wanted to try out myself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>You’ll do a great deal of fighting on your journey, of course, and its active combat is Throne and Liberty’s standout feature. Players aren’t restricted by classes. The pair of weapons they choose to wield determines what abilities are available to them. Similar to NCSOFT’s other big MMO, Guild Wars 2, fights require lots of positional awareness, and skills have lots of synergies with one another both within and across weapon types, and encourage lots of trial and error to figure out the best combinations for getting the most out of them. Every weapon has an auto attack pattern and can parry enemies' big attacks so long as you hit the button prompt just right, and each weapon has their own set of follow-up attacks that take great advantage of the opening you made. This mechanic seems ancillary against smaller foes, but against bosses and other strong enemies, defense is a must if you’re going to make it out of their clutches alive. Mastery of it was an absolute must in the Bloody Palace-style boss rush mode where you face off one-on-one with tough foes that have lots of power and small margins for error.</p><p>I used the greatsword and the staff, giving me lots of power and health in melee and also some escape tools and long-range magical options. I used them mostly to charge into close combat, blast all of my abilities, then use a magical freezing cloud to leap me away from enemies and blast them with fire and lighting bolts until they closed the distance. These abilities have more direct synergies, too. Greatsword players have access to a skill that can stun targets, and can follow it up with another skill that does bonus damage to stunned foes. The staff can put burning conditions on your opponents, and a second bigger fire spell will do more damage to enemies with burning stacks on them. Late in the beta I experimented with some cross weapon synergy with other weapon options like the wand, which focuses on debuffing and healing, with some promising results.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Most of the stuff I got up to like big world events where I had to race other players to collect the most macguffins from orcs, or smaller, more simple fetch quests, rewarded me mostly in money and gear upgrade materials. . It’s a double-edged sword, because though much of the source of your ever-growing power outside of your characters leveling up also comes through leveling up your gear, but a lot of that gear is bland and boring through much of your climb. I was around the mid-to-late 20s in level when I logged off for the last time from the beta, and I had only picked up two different swords – neither particularly impressive in looks or stats. Armor was a bit more dynamic, but I had almost no connection to the loot I was grabbing at all outside of making the numbers go up. I can’t speak to how that shakes out towards the higher levels, where one would expect equipment to get more exotic, but trudging there means that the only things you're slaying are bad guys.</p><p>Overall, I certainly enjoyed most of my time with Throne and Liberty. There are big, late-game things that I want to come back and participate in, like large-scale PVP battles between guilds and raid dungeons. The story and quests won’t upend any long-standing MMO conventions. The inner voice that usually commands me to make sure every task that can be done must be done very quietly let me skip through slow dialogue and turn a blind eye to many menial side tasks. I never skipped an opportunity to fight, though. The parry system mixed with the joy of discovering sick skill combos across the various weapons available to you was by and large the most fun I could find in my time with it, and might be enough for me to come back to test my mettle against the cream of the crop when Throne and Liberty finally launches in September.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/29/24208741/super-nintendo-upgrade-voultar-edge-enhancer-mod<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo sold over 49 million Super Nintendo consoles, but not all of them were created equal. A later hardware revision improved the quality of the SNES’s video output, and over three decades later, one modder has come up with a way to bring those same improvements to nearly every Super Nintendo ever released.</p><p>Zach Henson, a console modder <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23630417/wii-u-system-error-160-0103-bricking-nand-memory">who also goes by the name Voultar</a>, has created a DIY modification kit for older Super Nintendo consoles called the Edge Enhancer. Expected to sell for around $60, the mod kit upgrades the console’s video output, making graphics appear much sharper and colors more saturated.</p><p>Although Nintendo made many revisions to the Super Nintendo’s hardware during the console’s production run, for retro gamers, there are essentially two versions of the SNES that matter. The original, which is now referred to as the SHVC or two-chip model, and an upgraded version that came later, known as the 1CHIP model based on how Nintendo labeled its motherboard.</p><p>The two-chip SNES featured a video digital to analog converter in its picture processing unit (PPU) that gamers have since discovered wasn’t able to quickly transition between different colors. This resulted in video output that tended to look soft or blurred because the graphics appeared to have a halo or shadow around them.</p><p>The problem wasn’t as noticeable in the ’90s when everyone played on CRT TVs, but with a Super Nintendo connected to a modern display, the differences are more prominent.</p><div><figcaption><em>A comparison between the quality of the video output on the two-chip Super Nintendo (left) and one-chip model (right).</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: Macho Nacho Productions</cite></p></div><p>For the later 1CHIP version of the Super Nintendo, the company merged the original’s two video chips and CPU into a single chip. It was a cost-cutting move to make it cheaper to manufacture the console, but the new components also resulted in video output that was much sharper with noticeably improved colors.</p><p>For retro gamers who prefer to play on original hardware, the 1CHIP Super Nintendo consoles are now very much sought after and can sell for well over $200. But demand could soon be waning, thanks to this new upgrade kit.</p><p>Installing Voultar’s Edge Enhancer mod isn’t for beginners, as Tito Perez from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%40MachoNachoProductions">YouTube’s Macho Nacho Productions</a> recently demonstrated in a video. Not only does the SNES have to be completely dismantled, but there’s quite a bit of soldering required, and you have to remove the original transistors, capacitors, and resistors from the console’s motherboard.</p><div><figcaption><em>Onscreen text looks incredibly crisp on a two-chip Super Nintendo with Voultar’s Edge Enhancer installed.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: Macho Nacho Productions</cite></p></div><p>A lot could go wrong when installing the various components needed for the mod. So while <a href="https://voultar.com/">Voultar</a> plans to eventually sell a DIY Edge Enhancer kit once the documentation and tutorials are finalized, it will initially only be available as part of a more expensive installation service that will ensure the upgrades are done correctly.</p><p>Pricing hasn’t been revealed just yet, but given that 1CHIP Super Nintendo consoles are becoming increasingly rare, the Edge Enhancer mod could still be much cheaper, even with the cost of shipping a Super Nintendo’s motherboard off to be upgraded.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, Plaion (formerly <a href="https://wccftech.com/koch-media-changes-name-to-plaion-decision-made-independently-from-embracer-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">known</a> as Koch Media) and Skydance announced a global publishing deal for the single player action/adventure game Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra.</p>
<p>Klemens Kundratitz, CEO of PLAION, stated:</p>
<p><em>We are proud to partner with Skydance Games and industry legend Amy Hennig on what is one of the most anticipated AAA games currently in development. This partnership between two ambitious independent companies is a testament to PLAION’s ongoing mission to become a global force in videogame publishing.</em></p>
<p>Julian Break, Co-President at Skydance Games, said:</p>
<p><em>We believe PLAION is the perfect publishing partner for the multiplatform, worldwide release of MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra. For our studio’s debut title, we’re crafting an original Marvel story directed by Amy Hennig. We’re thrilled to have found a global publisher that shares our ambitious vision for the project.</em></p>
<p>Haluk Mentes, Head of Marvel Games, added:</p>
<p><em>MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra is an exquisite and bold take on some of our most beloved and timeless characters. The world-class development talent of Skydance Games and global publishing capabilities of PLAION are an excellent team-up to ensure we deliver on the massive promise this game has. We’re excited to collaborate and bring MARVEL 1943 to players around the world.</em></p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/1943-rise-of-hydra-amy-hennig-2025-unreal-engine-5-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled </a>in March, at GDC 2024, with a stunning trailer that showed its impressive Unreal Engine 5-powered visuals. Players will control an ensemble of four characters: Steve Rogers (Captain America), Azzuri (Black Panther), Gabriel Jones (a member of the Howling Commandos), and Nanali (a leader of the Wakandan spies).</p>
<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is slated to launch at some point next year. Platforms haven't been announced, but PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X are a safe bet.</p>

<p>But just because the marketplace is gone, that doesn’t mean playing on the 360 is gone with it.</p>



<p>You’ll no longer be able to buy games, DLC, or other content for the system any more via the store nor will the Microsoft Movies &amp; TV app&nbsp;no longer works. However, if you happen to own and play games on the console, you can still play them as you’d like. Online services such as multiplayer will also continue to function. You’ll also be able to download any content previously purchased and installed on your system.</p>



<p>So at least that all still exists. But for how long?</p>



<p>The Xbox 360 launched in November 2005. Almost 20 years for a console that many refuse to admit is retro at this point. It’s only a matter of time before servers for the system are taken offline. Whether it’s a year or five years from now, that day is coming.</p>



<p>It’s pretty sad to think about.</p>

But we do know that Plaion, which counts Deep Silver as one of its brands, will publish it.</p><p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra hit the headlines earlier this year after an eye-catching trailer revealed as part of Epic Games’ State of Unreal event at GDC. It’s in development at the Skydance Games team, which is led by Hennig (Uncharted) and co-president Julian Beak.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Plaion boss Klemens Kundratitz commented: “We are proud to partner with Skydance Games and industry legend Amy Hennig on what is one of the most anticipated AAA games currently in development. This partnership between two ambitious independent companies is a testament to Plaion’s ongoing mission to become a global force in video game publishing.”</p><p>Beak said Skydance believes Plaion to be “the perfect publishing partner” for the game. “For our studio’s debut title, we’re crafting an original Marvel story directed by Amy Hennig,” Beak said. “We’re thrilled to have found a global publisher that shares our ambitious vision for the project.”</p><p>Hennig’s Skydance team is also working on an <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-amy-hennig-skydance-new-media-project">untitled Star Wars game</a>, which has yet to be fully revealed.</p><p>Embracer has endured a torrid time of it recently, with thousands of staff laid off, multiple studios closed or sold off, and various video game flops, such as Starbreeze’s co-op shooter Payday 3. In June, Embracer shut down <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/alone-in-the-dark"><u>Alone in the Dark</u></a> developer Pieces Interactive after the game failed to meet expectations. It <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-buys-gearbox-from-embracer-confirms-development-on-new-borderlands-game"><u>sold the likes of Borderlands developer Gearbox Software</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saber-interactive-splits-from-embracer-taking-38-video-game-projects-with-it"><u>Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic remake studio Saber Interactive</u></a> ahead of announcing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embracer-splitting-into-three-companies-middle-earth-enterprises-friends-coffee-stain-friends-and-asmodee-group"><u>a split into three separate companies</u></a>. Specifically on Plaion, it reportedly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embracer-studio-was-working-on-a-brand-new-red-faction-game-before-layoffs">rejected a Red Faction sequel pitch</a> from the Embracer-owned developer of Galaxy On Fire and Chorus before it was hit by layoffs.</p><p>However, Plaion, via sub-brand Deep Silver, has published some successful video games in recent years, such as Dead Island 2. It is also set to publish <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> later in 2024.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>By now you've probably heard that Robert Downey Jr. is returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, not as Iron Man, but as masked <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/robert-downey-jr-returns-to-the-mcu-in-avengers/1100-6525361/" data-ref-id="1100-6525361">villain Doctor Doom</a>. This is not the first time he's been tapped for the role, as he was considered to play the menacing physician before Iron Man even entered pre-production.</p><p>This information was first revealed a little over a year ago, when Marvel Studios released promotional material celebrating the first Iron Man movie's 15th anniversary. In a conversation between director Jon Favreau and producer Kevin Feige, Favreau recalled, "You had all met with him already for like Doctor Doom or something, on another project... so everybody sort of knew who he was." Feige apparently confirmed with a simple "right." Model and actor Julian McMahon played Doctor Doom in the original two Fantastic Four films, both released before Iron Man.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bx4O7Ub1GY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="278">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-bx4O7Ub1GY?start=278" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Robert Downey Jr. won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, as well as a Golden Globe and a BAFTA, for his portrayal of Lewis Strauss in Oppenheimer. At San Diego Comic Con, Marvel announced the titles of the next <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/san-diego-comic-con-2024-biggest-news-announcements-trailers/2900-5626/" data-ref-id="2900-5626">two Avengers movies</a>: Doomsday and Secret Wars.

		<p>Last month, Nightdive Studios confirmed it was working on The Thing: Remastered, a remake of the 2002 game that was based on the 1982 classic sci-fi horror film. While details are scant on the release date for The Thing: Remastered, Nightdive Studios has released a new developer diary which focuses on the game’s artwork and design, showing some of the differences from the 2002 game.</p>
<p><iframe title="How Is The Art Progressing on The Thing: Remastered? Full Deep Dive Interview with Joel Welsh" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kzvs7EXgCxw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Thing: Remastered deep dive on the artwork is conducted by Locke Vincent and he is joined by Joel Welsh, the studio’s art lead, who explains some of the decisions being made. For example, in the screenshots of the The Thing: Remastered we are shown that there is more detail, like tiles on the floor and additional signage compared to the original game. Joel also confirms that some of the development team of the original had been able to supply information for Nightdive Studios to use and work with, allowing for a smoother development process for this remaster. A lot of the assets remain the same, but in a higher resolution. Each change is being done on a case by case basis, with care being made that any changes fit with the scenes of the game and the film.</p>
<p>It has to be said that all of the work shown by Nightdive Studios is still a work in progress, and that there will be further changes to the visual design of the remaster. As said, we do not yet know when The Thing: Remastered will be released though we do know it is expected for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/21/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-announced-features-captain-america-and-black-panther/">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra&nbsp;</a>was announced back in March by Marvel and Skydance, offering a new story for Marvel in videogames, with the focus being on Captain America and Black Panther during World War II. Today, it has been confirmed that Skydance has partnered with PLAION, which will handle the global distribution rights of Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra | Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lb2wwEx6DVw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“We are proud to partner with Skydance Games and industry legend Amy Hennig on what is one of the most anticipated AAA games currently in development,”</em> said Klemens Kundratitz, CEO, PLAION.<em> “This partnership between two ambitious independent companies is a testament to PLAION’s ongoing mission to become a global force in videogame publishing.”</em></p>
<p><em>“We believe PLAION is the perfect publishing partner for the multiplatform, worldwide release of&nbsp;MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra”</em> said Julian Beak, Co-President at Skydance Games. <em>“For our studio’s debut title, we’re crafting an original Marvel story directed by Amy Hennig. We’re thrilled to have found a global publisher that shares our ambitious vision for the project.”</em></p>
<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will have four playable characters with the perspectives switching between Captain America, Black Panther, Nanali, and Gabriel Jones. This will give different gameplay aspects too, with Nanali likely having much more sneaking and spying compared to the other characters. The cast for the game will be Khary Payton as Azzuri, T’Challa’s grandfather and the Black Panther in this game’s timeline, Drew Moerlein taking on the role of Steve Rogers/Captain America, Megalyn Echikunwoke portraying Nanali, a Wakandan spy, Marque Richardson lending his voice to Gabriel Jones, a member of the Howling Commandos, Lyne Renée voicing Julie, a member of the French Resistance, and Howard Stark, Tony Stark’s father, is being voiced by Joel Johnstone.</p>

<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is set to release in 2025, with PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S being the likely platforms.</p>

<p><em>Megapicker&nbsp;</em>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jackbox-megapicker-july">announced last month</a>, but we've now got a release date, and it turns out that release date is, well, today. The tool itself is free, but naturally, you're going to need your own Jackbox games if you want to use it.</p>
<p>If you do have Jackbox games in your library, though, you'll be able to sift through them and choose whichever one you want to play without having to load up the relevant game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-jackbox-megapicker-game-view.jpg?itok=3OiWHuC8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-jackbox-megapicker-game-view.jpg?itok=QDk3BsxX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Jackbox Megapicker&nbsp;</em>lets you choose whichever Jackbox game you like.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as a library for your Jackbox games,&nbsp;<em>Megapicker&nbsp;</em>also acts as a news platform for Jackbox games; Jackbox says it'll put players "in the know about any announcements, sales opportunities, and upcoming releases".</p>
<p>Naturally, you'll also be able to organize your library and sort it according to your preferences, so if there are Jackbox games you don't like, you can leave them out of your&nbsp;<em>Megapicker&nbsp;</em>if you prefer.</p>
<p>If you're lacking Jackbox games, then the studio's got some rather enticing offers for you to take advantage of, including a free game to get your collection started, as well as a sale.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you like your time with&nbsp;<em>Drawful 2&nbsp;</em>and you want to pick up new games - or if you've yet to embark on your Jackbox journey, full stop - then&nbsp;<em>The Jackbox Party Pack</em>, the first game in the series, is available at a 90% discount for a month starting from today.</p>
<p>Various other sales will also be available on&nbsp;<em>Jackbox Party Pack&nbsp;</em>games, so make sure to keep an eye on the Steam pages for the games so you don't miss out.</p>
<p><em>The Jackbox Megapicker&nbsp;</em>is available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2828500/The_Jackbox_Megapicker/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">right now for free on Steam</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-motorways-devs-canceled-magic-school-game-looks-enchanting.939660/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mini-motorways-dev-canceled-magic-school<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mini Motorways&nbsp;</em>developer Dinosaur Polo Club has released details about a canceled project called&nbsp;<em>Magic School</em>, calling the release of the information a chance to "celebrate what we learned along the way and the incredible work from our team".</p>
<p>In a press release, Dinosaur Polo Club says that telling its fans about&nbsp;<em>Magic School&nbsp;</em>could serve as a chance to "transparently discuss learnings" from the project, which hasn't resulted in any changes to the studio's staff numbers (something that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netherrealm-mobile-shut-down-rumor-layoffs">becoming increasingly rare</a> in the games industry).</p>
<p>As Dinosaur Polo Club tells it,&nbsp;<em>Magic School&nbsp;</em>would have been a chance to break out of the "minimalist simulation games" for which the studio is known and try something different.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-school-canceled-mini-motorways-courtyard.jpg?itok=Mvo25Lvw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-school-canceled-mini-motorways-courtyard.jpg?itok=Exh5gEBb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Magic School&nbsp;</em>would have been a break from tradition for&nbsp;<em>Mini Motorways&nbsp;</em>developer Dinosaur Polo Club.</figcaption></figure><p>Designer Zala Habib says the Dinosaur Polo Club team was "an absolutely incredible" and "driven" group of people, and that collaborating with the "talented" staff working on the game was a "joy".</p>
<p>Over time, Dinosaur Polo Club says that its work on <i>Magic School&nbsp;</i>made it clear that the vision for the game was leading the studio towards a project that required "a far larger team size than the studio could sustainably support".</p>
<p>The studio says that although its staff were excited by the "breadth of visual exploration and specific game systems",&nbsp;<em>Magic School</em>'s complexity was "at odds with the intuitive, quick-to-learn gameplay" for which Dinosaur Polo Club has become known.</p>
<p>CEO Amie Wolken says that the studio "simply did not see a path forward for <em>Magic School</em>", but that studios shouldn't be "shy" about sharing information regarding projects that didn't end up working for whatever reason.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-school-canceled-mini-motorways-art.jpg?itok=GpFk5y3L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-school-canceled-mini-motorways-art.jpg?itok=iSQv-TXP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dinosaur Polo Club wants the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Magic School&nbsp;</em>to be a learning experience.</figcaption></figure><p>Instead of working on&nbsp;<em>Magic School</em>, Dinosaur Polo Club says it'll redirect the staff who were working on the game to a new project "within their celebrated Mini series".</p>
<p>Looks like if you're a fan of games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mini-motorways-launches-september-19th-for-apple-arcade-pc-to-follow"><em>Mini Motorways</em></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Mini Metro</em>, then you're in luck. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>PlayStation and Team Asobi are gearing up for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-preorder-guide/1100-6523846/" data-ref-id="1100-6523846">Astro Bot's release on September 6</a>, which will give the quirky robot more planets to explore, more enemies to overcome, and a whole new set of skills to master. Considering Astro's Playroom served as a brilliant (and free!) demonstration of the DualSense Controller's unique features, it feels rather fitting that PlayStation has unveiled the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/29/first-look-astro-bot-limited-edition-dualsense-wireless-controller/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Astro Bot Limited Edition DualSense Controller</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Thank Goodness You’re Here Is A Hilarious Game About Being Helpful]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/thank-goodness-youre-here-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/thank-goodness-you%E2%80%99re-here-is-a-hilarious-game-about-being-helpful.939645/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/thank-goodness-youre-here-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many video game stories basically boil down to being forced to do chores for strangers: all that world-saving, enemy-farming, <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/A_Frying_Pan,_Spick_and_Span" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">please-find-my-pan stuff</a> is pretty weird when you think about it. <a href="https://thankgoodness.game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em></a>, out August 1 on PC, Switch, and PlayStation, highlights this absurdity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You play as a little salesman–small enough to fit down sink drains and chimneys–who comes to the Northern England town of Barnsworth to meet with the mayor. You immediately wander off into town, which is full of strange folks who all need a hand with something. They ask you to find their missing tools, fetch them meat for their pies, water their gardens, deal with their rat problems, help them with their shopping, and more.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Thank Goodness You're Here! – Release Date Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W-Vyg4J6RBU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This is all done through light puzzles and basic platforming, which is appropriate since you only have two buttons: one to jump, and one to slap. Most things in the world are reactive to your slaps in some way, and it never got old to just stroll the town hitting things and people to see what would happen. Solving puzzles moves the story ahead and opens up new areas, and it was never too tough to figure out where I had to go next or to wander into a task’s solution.</p><p>This lets the game’s setting shine. Barnsworth is a ton of fun to explore, and each quest you’re sent on teaches you more about the town and the relationships between its people. You discover crushes and petty conflicts, fears and dreams, and a bunch of delightful weirdos who, in addition to being people, can also be flowers, rats, or worms. The town itself is full of texture and fun details, from commercials for local brands to funny signs and graffiti. Many seemingly offhand jokes recur and develop–an argument over a trash bin that blossoms into a relationship, a student driver moving around town–and situations change as you solve puzzles as well. All this makes Barnsworth feel active and lived-in, while still being grounded in the day-to-day of small town life.</p><p><em>Thank Goodness</em> is a comedy game, and while my only reference for the genres it’s drawing on is watching <em>Monty Python</em> as a kid, I admired how its absurdity never veered too far into nonsense. It’s also able to poke fun at its characters and their provincial ways without devolving into meanness or using them as punchlines. There’s a lot of love for its setting and inspirations, from the clever use of live-action stock footage of England to the ability to set the language to Northern English dialect. (There’s also a musical number, which I think should be a feature of… well, literally everything.)&nbsp;</p><p><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em> took me about two hours to complete, though locked Steam achievements and some new tasks I discovered poking back into it this morning suggest there’s more stuff to find off the beaten path. I love the quirky, big-hearted vibe of the game, and I'm excited for my friends better versed in its setting to explain all the very English jokes that went over my head. If you'd like to get a taste of the game before its release later this week, there's a demo available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366980/Thank_Goodness_Youre_Here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/29/24208726/astro-bot-limited-edition-ps5-dual-sense-controller<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Sony Interactive Entertainment and Team Asobi — the developers behind the forthcoming <em>Astro Bot</em> — have teamed up to design and release <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/29/first-look-astro-bot-limited-edition-dualsense-wireless-controller/">a limited edition<em> Astro Bot</em> DualSense controller</a>.</p></div><p>Just look at it. I <em>need</em> it.</p><p>The <em>Astro Bot </em>limited edition controller adds blue controller grips and sci-fi accents and features Astro’s signature pair of bright blue eyes on the touchpad that, based on the adorable trailer, appear to blink at you. (They better blink at you — what’s the point of the eyes if they don’t blink at you?)</p><p>Team Asobi has added a bunch of new interactions between DualSense controllers and the <em>Astro Bot</em> game, some of which I got to experience during <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24180304/summer-game-fest-2024-best-games">my demo of the game at Summer Game Fest</a>. The team has increased the number of textures you can feel through the controller like sand, glass, or metal. All of Astro’s new power-ups will have a distinct feel to them thanks to haptic feedback and the adaptive triggers. In the demo, there are little spark plugs you frequently have to pull out of the ground. The sound effects coming out of the controller combined with the slowly increasing resistance on the triggers made it actually feel like yanking on stubborn wires.</p><p>The controller will be available for preorder on August 9th in select countries, retailing for $79.99. Or you can try your luck buying it from select retailers worldwide on September 6th — the same day as <em>Astro Bot’s</em> launch. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
