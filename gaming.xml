			<p>Aspyr Media has <a href="https://x.com/AspyrMedia/status/1999170679116087572">announced</a> that its upcoming Deus Ex Remastered, a remaster of the original June 2000 game, has been delayed indefinitely. It will no longer release on its previously announced February 5, 2026, date, and Aspyr has refunded all pre-orders of the game.</p>



<p>The decision to delay the game came after feedback from Deus Ex fans based on the <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/deus-ex-remastered-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-switch-and-pc">game's initial reveal this past September</a>, which failed to impress players with its changes to the game's visuals. How a remaster changes the visuals in a retro game is almost always a point of controversy among that game's fan base, and this remaster of Deus Ex is no different.</p>



<p>This time, it seems, that the backlash has been too loud for Aspyr to ignore, as its statement thanks players for their feedback and that this delay is to ensure the studio is able to meet players expectations.</p>



<p>"<em>Thank you to the community for your feedback following the reveal of Deus Ex Remastered,</em>" the statement begins. "<em>We've listened to what you had to say, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players, Deus Ex Remastered will no longer launch on February 5, 2026. We look forward to sharing more updates with you when the time comes. All existing pre-orders will be fully refunded. Thank you again for your patience and support</em>."</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Unfortunately for Aspyr, this is yet another disappointing result for them after a string of disappointing results. In the last few years, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-launch-mess-3-servers/">Star Wars Battlefront Collection was an absolute mess of a release</a>, Aspyr <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-kotor-remake-is-still-being-worked-on-jason-schreier-says-to-have-heard/">was pulled off the Knights of the Old Republic Remake</a>, and now this.</p>



<p>Hopefully, the studio can rally and come back with a version of Deus Ex Remastered that gets fans excited to dive into the stealth game that set the blueprint for so many after it. Deus Ex is one of gaming's more important titles when it comes to how influential it was on everything that came after and the immersive sim genre, so it would be incredibly disappointing for a remaster of the title to be anything less than a complete show of respect and love for the original work.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Lords of the Fallen debuted in 2023, emerging as a reboot of sorts of the 2014 game of the same name. It was a considerable success, surfacing as a solid entry into the ever-growing lineup of Soulslike games that have dominated the market in recent years.</p>



<p>At Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony, CI Games unveiled Lords of the Fallen II, slated for a 2026 release window. However, the team isn’t <strong>quite finished </strong>with Lords of the Fallen (2023), as a surprise, final update was revealed for the game, featuring stacks of extra content.</p>







<h2 id="h-lords-of-the-fallen-is-still-standing">Lords of the Fallen is Still Standing</h2>



<p>In an unexpected reveal, CI Games uncovered a final update for 2023’s Lords of the Fallen, a world-bending Soulslike title with some incredible combat sequences.</p>



<p>It was back in April 2024 that Lords of the Fallen’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-final-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘final update’</a> was released, dubbed ‘Master of Fate’, and the team thereafter pivoted to work on Lords of the Fallen II, which was then revealed a year and a half later.</p>



<p><strong>But then</strong>, in April 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-update-friend-pass-co-op-improvements-explained/">‘Lords of the Fallen 2.0’</a> went live, with CI Games introducing several game-changing features such as a ‘Friend Pass’ system, new co-op challenges, and better multiplayer mechanics. It seems that, once again, final didn’t mean final, as <strong>yet another </strong>update has been lined up for Lords of the Fallen.</p>



<p>Now, the team at CI Games has confirmed that Lords of the Fallen ‘2.5’ is being released, including all of the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Deadlier boss battles</li>



<li>Faster, smarter enemies</li>



<li>All-new Veteran Mode</li>



<li>New boss weapon animations</li>



<li>Veteran of the Veil Armour Set</li>



<li>And more…</li>
</ul>

                <p>Fallout fans have been understandably curious about the future of the franchise, especially since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Fallout 5</a> isn't expected to arrive before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, and Bethesda hasn't been very forthcoming about when that game is coming either. For now, Bethesda's Todd Howard is keeping the company's plans close to his vest, but he has indicated there's more happening with Fallout than any other Bethesda property at the moment.</p><p>"We've had a long-term plan for Fallout, and so I wish I could talk about all those today," Howard told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-chief-todd-howard-says-fallout-is-the-franchise-that-were-doing-the-most-in-right-now-coy-on-potential-return-to-new-vegas-or-a-fallout-3-remaster-while-fans-wait-for-fallout-5?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "I'll just say this, it's the franchise that we're doing the most in right now."</p><p>Howard also indicated that the success of Prime Video's Fallout TV series hasn't altered those plans or caused Bethesda to move up its timetable.</p><p>"We had a plan for the games we were going to make," said Howard. "The TV show was part obviously of our Fallout plan as far as a franchise. And in a lot of ways, I view it as an entry, as a game entry. Games are one lens into the world, the TV show is another lens into the world."</p><p>The show and the game world recently intersected in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-burning-springs-update-adds-new-map-region-and-walton-goggins-the-ghoul/1100-6536654/" data-ref-id="1100-6536654">Fallout 76's Burning Springs update</a>, which added Walton Goggins' The Ghoul as an important character. Howard praised the new update, but refused to directly answer questions about the rumored remaster of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-3/" data-ref-id="5000-19700">Fallout 3</a>. However, he did reiterate how pleased he was with the release of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remaster, and hinted that future titles like that may also be given shadow drops.</p><p>Earlier this fall, Bethesda released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-4-and-fallout-new-vegas-are-getting-anniversary-editions/1100-6535649/" data-ref-id="1100-6535649">Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition</a>, but the rollout has been marred by numerous bugs and other issues that sparked a backlash. Bethesda <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-4-gets-new-update-following-anniversary-edition-backlash/1100-6536446/" data-ref-id="1100-6536446">released an update</a> last month to deal with some of those problems, with a second bug-fix update slated to arrive this month as well.</p><p>Fallout Season 2 will premiere on Prime Video on December 17. In the meantime, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-fallout-pip-boy-controller-is-now-available-to-preorder/1100-6536863/" data-ref-id="1100-6536863">Fallout Pip-Boy Xbox Wireless Controller is now available for preorders</a>.</p>

In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1RdKezTYNk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the comments of the official trailer</a> on PlayStation's YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/everyone-thinks-the-deus-ex-remaster-looks-awful-and-theyre-right-they-really-turned-those-1999-graphics-into-2003-graphics/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">netizens decried the game's new visuals</a>. Others couldn't believe this was coming when no one asked for it. Some simply said it was a shame. Up and down the comments, people were confounded by the supposed visual improvements Aspyr touted.</p><p>This feedback is likely why Aspyr has delayed the game. Now, Deus Ex Remastered doesn't have a firm release date.</p>

              <p>The previously announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musks-favorite-game-is-getting-remastered-25-years-later-2000628283"><em>Deus Ex Remastered</em></a> from Aspyr was set to launch in February of next year. It’s now been indefinitely delayed following a flood of complaints that the new version of the classic PC game looked ugly.</p> <p>During <a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-play-playstation-5-sony-stream-youtube-twitch-2000628258#:~:text=One%20of%20the,on%20February%205.">Sony’s State of Play event in September</a>, Aspyr revealed <em>Deus Ex Remastered</em>, an “improved” and “better” looking version of the original, a beloved sci-fi immersive sim developed by Ion Storm and released in 2000. Almost immediately, the reaction online turned negative. <a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-remastered-trailer-ugly-bad-comparison-ps5-pc-mods-nightdive-2000628799">People, myself included, weren’t happy about all the textures being replaced</a> with newer, higher-resolution assets. These didn’t mesh well with the old models and geometry that was still left in the game, creating a bizarre effect where it looked even worse than the chunky but charming visuals of the original game.</p> <p>Now, the remaster has been delayed, likely in an attempt to improve how it looks. On December 11, Aspyr announced that it wouldn’t move ahead with releasing <em>Deus Ex Remastered</em> in early 2026, <a href="https://x.com/AspyrMedia/status/1999170679116087572?">posting on X</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>Thank you to the community for your feedback following the reveal of <em>Deus Ex Remastered. </em>We’ve listened to what you said, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players,<em> Deus Ex Remastered</em> will no longer launch on Feb. 5, 2026.</p></blockquote> <p>Asypry didn’t provide a new release date or window. The studio behind other remasters, <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-bounty-hunter-remaster-review-is-it-good-ps5-1851610382">like 2024’s </a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-bounty-hunter-remaster-review-is-it-good-ps5-1851610382">Star Wars Bounty Hunter</a>,</em> confirmed all pre-orders would be refunded, which seems to imply the delay won’t be a short one.&nbsp; Aspyr says it looks “forward to sharing more updates” with fans “when the time comes.”</p> <p>Based on how many people didn’t like the trailer and were disappointed with <em>Deus Ex Remastered</em>‘s visuals, I think very few people are going to be upset about this delay. Hopefully, when/if <em>Deus Ex Remastered</em> sees the light of day again, it looks more like the original and less like a bad fan-created Unreal demo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent update, Aspyr has confirmed that the upcoming Deus Ex Remastered has been delayed. Originally scheduled to launch on February 6, 2026, the highly anticipated remaster has now been pushed back indefinitely.</p>



<p>The original <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-deus-ex-game-pitched-by-eidos-montreal/">Deus Ex</a>, released in 2000, is widely regarded as an incredibly important title in gaming history. Its blend of action, espionage, and non-linear level design helped define the immersive sim genre—and fans were eager to experience the revamped version. Now, it seems they’ll have to wait a while longer.</p>







<h2 id="h-aspyr-announces-deus-ex-remastered-has-been-delayed">Aspyr Announces Deus Ex Remastered Has Been Delayed</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you to the community for your feedback following the reveal of Deus Ex Remastered. We've listened to what you said, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players, Deus Ex Remastered will no longer launch on Feb. 5, 2026. <a href="https://t.co/NhalyPLm8q">pic.twitter.com/NhalyPLm8q</a></p>— Aspyr (@AspyrMedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/AspyrMedia/status/1999170679116087572?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In the public statement shown above, Aspyr officially confirmed the delay. According to the studio, the decision was made in response to community feedback, with the team wanting additional time to “better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players.”</p>







<p>The announcement didn’t include a revised release date, offering only that the studio will “share more updates when the time comes.” With the original launch only months away, players will be hoping the project isn’t set for an extended setback.</p>



<p>Adding to the uncertainty, though, Aspyr also revealed that all existing preorders will be fully refunded. It’s a move that has left some fans questioning the remaster’s current state, as well as what the long-term future of the project might look like. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-cancels-deus-ex-game-lays-off-eidos-montreal-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deus Ex as a franchise can’t seem to catch a break</a>, and the misery doesn’t seem to be stopping any time soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Creature collecting games are becoming more and more common, but while many of them follow a similar format, Aethermancer aims to be a bit different by adding a roguelite element to it. There is no permanent party you can fall back on, with the game built to make you experiment with what is to hand.</p>
<p><iframe title="Aethermancer | Official Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mw47bWzgjCI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Aethermancer casts you in the role of an aethermancer named Siriux, who has taken it upon himself to dive into the Void, a vast growing disaster that is swallowing the world. Within the Void are different biomes in which various creatures roam, creatures that you can use to help navigate the dangers of this world. In the early access build of Aethermancer there are three biomes to discover, with each one having different paths you can choose to follow and native creatures that you can add to your collection. Within each zone of a biome you will find battles to win, allies that will provide assistance, and various points of interest that can provide boosts and boons at a cost.</p>


<p>Aethermancer’s gameplay has you start a run with one starter creature, and you can gather a maximum of two other creatures to create your battle party. If you lose a creature in battle, that specific creature is gone for that run, and losing if all of your creatures are defeated the run ends. However the start of each zone features a rebirth station where you can bring back the souls of fallen creatures from the dead to help you, letting you change up your party at the same time.&nbsp;What I like about this system is that you are not punished for trying to experiment. A creature that is swapped in is levelled up to match the rest of your party, allowing you to unlock moves and traits that could complement the whole group.</p>


<p>Each creature has moves and traits that can help buff or heal the whole party, or cast debuffs on enemy groups like poisoning or burning them. As you battle, you start figuring out which creature traits work well together, along with moves and items that can be equipped. For example, on one run I managed to create a group that could deal and trigger poison damage each turn while also providing heal and regeneration through each battle round. This party was nigh unstoppable and only fell at the final hurdle of the boss after the end of the third biome.</p>
<p>Aethermancer’s battle system is really fun to experiment with, though I have only tried a few different combos due to which creatures I have had at my disposal. As you make progress through the game you do unlock more, but there is a limit to how often you can swap out creatures or which ones you can use. Earlier I mentioned costs for bonuses and boons. One of those costs can be a monster soul, and if you spend that soul you will not be able to rebirth it on your run to add to your party. You will have no idea which soul has been spent until the next time you choose to change your party. </p>

<p>Finding a great party parity is essential for survival. As you battle and venture through the void, your creatures are at risk of getting Corrupted. The value of Corruption is taken away from a creature’s starting health, so being able to heal that damage at the start of a battle is essential. It seems that Aethermancer will let you build a solid team, but still make sure you do not get too powerful so that there is never a challenge.</p>
<p>When a run ends, you will find yourself in Pilgrim’s Rest which is a location so far untouched by the Void. Here you will find different people that can offer permanent bonuses and upgrades to use on future runs. That can include starting a run with more gold, or soulbonding with a creature so you can use it as a starter. It also a place where you can learn a bit more about the characters you end up rescuing from the Void, and I do wonder what else Pilgrim’s Rest will have to offer when Aethermancer exits early access.</p>

<p>So far, Aethermancer is proving to be a fun roguelike that seems to have a lot of potential depth to it, essentially forcing you to experiment with different party members to find different ways in which they can support each other in battle. I am looking forward to what will come next for the game, and anyone who enjoys roguelikes, creature collecting and battling should be keeping an eye on Aethermancer too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">The Game Awards enters its 12th year</a>, it’s worth looking back on some of the highs and lows from TGAs past. Out of the ashes of the Spike VGAs, creator and host Geoff Keighley created an annual gaming staple that highlights some of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-geoff-keighley-tickets-trailers-clair-obscur-2000652243">biggest and best games for millions watching from home</a>. It honors creators and brands, seeking to elevate the craft and art of games while also leaving room for giant walking razor blade sponsorships. Here are 17 of the best and worst Game Awards moments going back to 2014.</p> <h2>“Fuck The Oscars!” – The Game Awards 2017</h2>  <p>Any list of iconic or famous Game Awards moments must legally include what is arguably the show’s most well-known clip: That time <em>Split Ficition</em> and<em> It Takes Two</em> director Josef Fares took control of the show for a few minutes and yelled “Fuck the Oscars!” in front of a visibly confused Geoff. Great stuff. – Zack Zwiezen</p>

 <h2><em>Ark 2</em> starring Vin Diesel is announced – The Game Awards 2020</h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/vin-diesel-is-fighting-dinosaurs-in-ark-2-1845856293">It was funny when Wildcard Studios announced an <em>Ark</em> sequel</a> despite many fans at the time feeling the original game needed more updates. It was even funnier when Vin Diesel appeared in the trailer. And it’s really, really funny that five years later, the game appears to be vaporware and has yet to launch. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/almost-5-years-since-its-reveal-ark-2-devs-admit-the-survival-sequel-was-put-on-hold-a-couple-of-years-ago-but-theyre-hopeful-it-could-release-in-early-access-within-the-next-2-years/">But it might finally see the light of day in 2027.</a> – Zack Zwiezen</p>

 <h2>The leaders of the three console companies share a stage – The Game Awards 2018</h2>  <p>The Game Awards foreshadowed the end of the console wars when Nintendo’s Reggie Fils-Aimé, Xbox’s Phil Spencer, and PlayStation’s Shawn Layden took the stage together at the 2018 ceremony to look beyond old marketing rivalries, exclusivity deals, and platform competition and praise gaming as a medium that transcends studio borders and corporate branding. Two of them are now retired and only Spencer remains at his post, currently overseeing the implementation of a similar philosophy as Microsoft goes multiplatform. – Ethan Gach</p>

 <h2>DrDisrespect wins the Trending Gamer award – The Game Awards 2017</h2>  <p>Herschel “Dr Disrespect” Beahm was crowned the biggest gamer of 2017 back when the Game Awards and the traditional gaming industry was still much more intertwined with the growing creator economy on YouTube and Twitch. Little did we all know that this was the same year in which Beahm would later <a href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-sexting-twitch-ban-youtube-elden-ring-1851556854">admit to having had</a> “casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate” with a female minor. He was later banned from Twitch over it, even though the full incident wouldn’t come to light until 2024. Presciently, the Game Awards never did another Trending Gamer prize again. – Ethan Gach</p>

 <h2>Ken &amp; Roberta Williams win the first Industry Icons Award – The Game Awards 2014</h2>  <p>The very first Game Awards in 2014 was an overly long and very boring show. But even I had to smile when Ken and Roberta Williams, two very important video game pioneers, were given the Industry Icon award. This show should have tons of these kinds of moments; alas, these segments that truly celebrate creators and games are still far too rare. – Zack Zwiezen</p>

 <h2>Ninja showing up – The Game Awards 2018</h2>  <p>In an attempt to professionalize the category, the Game Awards shifted from 2017’s Trending Gamer to “Content Creator of the Year.” While Richard “Ninja” Blevins would go on to win it in 2018, he also just appeared during the show at the height of his electric-blue-haired popularity for a bit with a Muppet that may have been one of the least funny bits to ever appear during the show’s decade-plus run. Ninja may have had the charisma of a plastic “forkknife” but the writers did him no favors here. – Ethan Gach</p>

 <h2>Flute Guy – The Game Awards 2022</h2>  <p>Live concerts have always been a staple of the Game Awards, but they’ve gotten much better with the move away from <em>Rock Band</em>-like cameos and toward orchestral arrangements of actual video game music. No one embodies that more than Venezuelan flautist Pedro Eustache, who became a viral sensation for his passionate and expressive performances across a variety of different instruments at the 2022 show, especially during the <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em> segment. He’s so good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sb27LA2n8w">they keep bringing him back</a>. – Ethan Gach</p> <h2><em>Rock Band VR</em> announcement trailer – The Game Awards 2015</h2>  <p>I’m not sure why <em>Rock Band VR</em> was even created or why it was given such a lengthy spotlight at the Game Awards. And perhaps the worst part is that if you watched the show live or were there in person, you had to look at Palmer Luckey’s feet. The VR wunderkind is now a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/tech-ceo-shares-how-he-early-supporter-trump-running-president-before-his-2016-campaign">right-wing</a> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/palmer-luckey-ai-powered-autonomous-weapons-future-of-warfare-60-minutes-transcript/">AI weapons dealer</a>, and it makes this already hard-to-watch segment even more unbearable. – Zack Zwiezen</p> <h2>Waldorf and Statler dunk on the event – The Game Awards 2024</h2>  <p>Yes, it’s a bit odd how often Geoff invites Muppets to the Game Awards. But whatever, I don’t care because it means Statler and Waldorf got to occasionally appear and make fun of the show, Geoff, and everything else. It was wonderful. Truly inspired. – Zack Zwiezen</p>

 <h2>Schick Hyrdobot takes it to the next level – The Game Awards 2016</h2>  <p>The early days of the Game Awards are filled with some truly bizarre sponsorship moments and deals. Geoff needed help funding this thing and seemed willing to take any deal he was offered. That is likely how we ended up with Schick Hyrdobot, a horrific razor-robot-man hybrid that appeared periodically throughout the&nbsp; 2016 event. – Zack Zwiezen</p> <h2>Fans boo Konami – The Game Awards 2015</h2>  <p>Number one Keighley best friend Hideo Kojima was not allowed to attend the 2015 show. In an uncharacteristically candid segment, Geoff outlined that Konami’s lawyers were specifically prohibiting the <em>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</em> director from attending despite the game being nominated. “It’s unfathomable to me,” the host said. As the audience booed the publisher, the show commemorated the absence with a special performance of “Quiet Steam” from the game. – Ethan Gach</p>

 <h2>Cutting the GOTY speech short – The Game Awards 2023</h2>  <p>Larian Studios took home the top prize for <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>at the 2023 show but director Swen Vincke only had 60 seconds to speedrun through the team’s acceptance speech. Things were made even worse by a “<a href="https://twitter.com/javierabegazo/status/1732975428237934964?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1732975428237934964%7Ctwgr%5Ef68fd0afd04e064cfcb2ee0dbe53a48fa90d90b0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fbaldur-s-gate-3-game-awards-2023-goty-speech-1851099039">wrap it up</a>” sign that happened to flash right when he was mentioning the colleagues that had been lost along the way during development. Fortunately, the studio head shared <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-game-awards-2023-goty-speech-1851099039">his full speech online</a> after the show, and went on to have one of the best monologues at the following year’s show, in which he predicted <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-awards-goty-larian-1851780699">potentially sweeping this year’s awards</a>. – Ethan Gach</p> <h2>Nintendo’s Reggie Fils-Aime remembers Iwata – The Game Awards 2015</h2>  <p>As mentioned already, it’s rare that the Game Awards takes a moment to truly slow down and let someone be human. That makes this moment in 2015 when Geoff and then-Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aimé eulogized and honored the recently passed Satuoru Iwata, all the more special. Geoff literally says that for the next few minutes he’s putting away the trailers, the awards, and the marketing, and seems truly affected by Iwata’s death. Turns out you don’t need big flashy trailers to create a memorable moment. Just some heart. – Zack Zwiezen</p> <h2>Michelle Rodriguez and Vin Diesel end the show awkwardly – The Game Awards 2019</h2>  <p>I think the 2019 Game Awards have the worst and strangest ending in the show’s history. It starts with Michelle Rodriguez revealing the last game of the show, a crappy <em>Fast and Furious</em> game that looked terrible, and evolves into an awkward back-and-forth between her and Vin Diesel about the next <em>F&amp;F</em> movie and video games. It’s rough stuff. Worse, the two were then involved in <a href="https://youtu.be/UOmdhofNzDM">handing out the final award of the night to the Game of the Year winner.</a> Yikes! – Zack Zwiezen</p>

 <h2>Christopher Judge wins and gives a nine-minute speech – The Game Awards 2022</h2>  <p>There’s no <em>God of War</em> reboot without Christopher Judge, and the <em>Stargate</em> veteran went on to win “Best Performance” for <em>Ragnarök</em> in 2022. He gave what must be the longest speech in Game Awards history. It was personal, emotional, and so drawn out that Keighley spent the next few years rushing winners off the stage after 30 seconds to stop the show from going too late into the night. But he earned it after punctuating the 2018 show with the best three words anyone spoke onstage that night: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxgaD_0LboI">Read it, boy</a>.” – Ethan Gach</p> <h2>Bill Clinton kid crashes the stage – The Game Awards 2022</h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2022-bill-clinton-infowars-blizzcon-troll-1849877331">Small-time online troll</a> Matan Even snuck on stage at the end of the 2022 ceremony when <em>Elden Ring</em> was crowned Game of the Year. It was confusing and absurd. “I want to nominate this award to my reformed Orthodox Rabbi Bill Clinton,” he said after speeches from the actual developers. The incident’s legacy as the most “this thing is happening live” moment in TGA history was only trumped by just how dumb it turned out to be. Keighley has tightened security in the years since. – Ethan Gach</p> <h2><em>Alan Wake 2</em> dance – The Game Awards 2023</h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-ii-2-herald-of-darkness-music-video-musical-1851024833">Recreating the best moment from </a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-ii-2-herald-of-darkness-music-video-musical-1851024833">Alan Wake 2</a>,</em> one of the best games of 2023, live on stage was such a brilliant and fun idea that I almost believe Geoff wasn’t involved in that meeting. However this came about, I don’t care, because the end result is <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-game-awards-alan-wake-2-herald-of-darkness-1851085691">arguably the most joyful moment in the history of the Game Awards</a>. More of this and honoring creators, and less random celebrities and bad jokes, please! – Zack Zwiezen</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/time-person-of-the-year-ai-musk-altman-kalshi-bet-lost-millions-angry-2000652622</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Time Magazine</em> revealed its Person of the Year for 2025. It wasn’t one person, but many different people who are all at the helm of pushing AI technology. This has caused some prediction market gamblers who had bet on AI itself earning the distinction to start yelling a lot online. It’s very funny, but also a horrible glimpse at our bet-on-everything future.</p> <p>On December 11, <a href="https://time.com/7339685/person-of-the-year-2025-ai-architects/"><em>Time Magazine</em> revealed its annual Person of the Year cover</a>. The long-running magazine, whose readership at this point is made up mostly of bored people in waiting rooms, revealed that there wasn’t just one person of the year in 2025, but seven different individuals. <em>Time Magazine</em> refers to these people as the “Architects of AI,” and they include names like Elon Musk, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, and OpenAI boss Sam Altman. Normally, I’d think about who <em>Time</em> picked as the Person of the Year for about 10 seconds and then move on with my life. But this time, who they picked, and the <a href="https://time.com/7339703/ai-architects-person-of-the-year-2025/">use of two different covers,</a> have caused chaos among people who love to bet on everything.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">2025 was the year when artificial intelligence’s full potential roared into view, and when it became clear that there will be no turning back.</p> <p>For delivering the age of thinking machines, for wowing and worrying humanity, for transforming the present and transcending the… <a href="https://t.co/mEIKRiZfLo">pic.twitter.com/mEIKRiZfLo</a></p> <p>— TIME (@TIME) <a href="https://twitter.com/TIME/status/1999097617633189955?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On the prediction market website Kalshi, <a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxtime/times-person-of-the-year/kxtime-25">nearly $20 million worth of betting</a> happened over who would be <em>Time</em>‘s Person of the Year. One popular option that many bet on was AI. So when Kalshi called the bet and listed the specific people the magazine had named as the “Architects of AI” as the winners, but not AI itself, a lot of people were angry. They believed that AI was also the winner as it was named directly. Making things more confusing, <em>Time Magazine</em> ran two covers for the Person of the Year issue this year, one featuring the architects, with the other featuring “AI” in massive letters, though the words “The Architects of AI” are still present in the cover’s corner. Still, this cover is more evidence, according to those who bet on AI, that it, too, should be considered a winning outcome in one of the site’s biggest bets of the year.</p>

 <p>“ITS THE ARCHITECTS OF AI THISNIS LITTERALY THE BET FUCK KALSHI,” <a href="https://kalshi.com/ideas/posts/9914a9da-54dc-4447-b104-825713e9dff4">posted one angry gambler</a> who bet on AI and lost. “This is actually so freaking stupid,” said <a href="https://kalshi.com/ideas/posts/0deb1354-478d-4bca-8538-c6e4ce282413">another user</a>.</p> <p>“This pretty clearly should’ve resolved to yes,” <a href="https://kalshi.com/ideas/posts/601174f7-f82e-484a-8955-e3e68fd75032">said another upset AI better</a>. “If you bought AI, reach out to Kalshi support because ‘AI’ is literally on the cover and in the title, ‘Architects of AI.’ They’re not going to change anything unless they hear from people.”</p>

 <p>“The cover literally says ‘AI” right on the front. This is insane,” <a href="https://kalshi.com/ideas/posts/151a0fb2-e8ef-4964-96ed-5627f7cf1820">said another upset gambler.</a> “fr bro we got screwed,” replied someone else.</p> <p>While I am definitely laughing at how many people lost money betting on <em>Time</em>‘s Person of the Year, I’m also aware that this is our future. This bet-on-everything shit is growing quickly. Sites like Kalshi and Polymarket are letting people gamble on literally anything. And this is just the start. <a href="https://kotaku.com/finance-bro-thinks-it-would-be-cool-to-turn-your-entire-life-into-the-stock-market-2000650201">The CEO of Kalshi recently explained</a> that he wants to “financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference of opinion.” In other words, every part of our humanity<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->what we love, believe in, cherish, hope for, fear, etc.<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->in the near future will be something to bet on. That’s only going to make it easier for the <a href="https://pausebeforeyouplay.org/2025/06/online-gambling-is-likely-on-the-rise-at-a-high-school-near-you/">growing number of young people addicted to online gambling</a> to lose even more money. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/volodymyr-zelensky-suit-polymarket-rebellion/">And the arbiters of how these bets are settled and who wins will be tech bros</a>.</p> <p>Good luck, everyone. I place our odds of making it through the AI-powered online gambling future ahead of us pretty low. I’m not taking that bet.</p>

A <a href="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown/status/1999140552722280655" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">line of text that was discovered</a> references a voice line for the character Jimmy, the son of main character Michael, that says he is "moving out of state." Another line, from his mother Amanda, says, "Our son is finally moving away from home." People are taking this to suggest that Jimmy may have moved to Leonida, the stand-in for GTA 6's setting of Florida, but that's just conjecture for now.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA Online: A Safehouse In The Hills - Update Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Dataminers also discovered that the <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/KnoWay" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">KnoWay</a> autonomous driving company that was added to GTA Online in the new update was formerly known as <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Sahara" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sahara</a>. That is the name of a delivery and logistics company for GTA 6, as seen in previously released GTA 6 screenshots. The dataminer, Tex2, theorized that Rockstar might have at one point planned a Part 2 for the A Safehouse in the Hills expansion to be timed with GTA 6's previous release date of May 2026 prior to the game's delay to November 2026.</p><p>With Rockstar providing so little concrete information about GTA 6, people have been hunting for years for any morsels of possible clues about GTA 6, and this is just the latest example. The game's first trailer was released two years ago this month. A second trailer arrived in May 2025, but the company has said said anything more about the game since then, apart from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">confirming the delay to November 2026 in early November.</a></p><p>Rockstar said it delayed GTA 6 yet again as part of an effort to ensure the game is up to the company's high quality standards.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said, "When we set a date, we really do believe in it. We said when we set the last date, if a game requires more polish to be the best possible version of itself, then we will give that game more time. And that's exactly what happened."</p><p>He added: "We feel really good about this release date. It's in the same fiscal year, it happens to be a great release window, and naturally we're really supportive of Rockstar's approach."</p><p>GTA 6 is coming to market with an enormous amount of hype behind it. One expert has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-most-important-game-release-in-industrys-history-analyst-says/1100-6521839/" data-ref-id="1100-6521839">GTA 6 is the single most important game release in history.</a> It's the first new entry in the series since 2013's GTA 5 and is predicted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">sell more than 40 million units in its first year alone.</a></p><p>Another talking point regarding GTA 6 has been what its price point could be. One industry observer has said there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">"hope"</a> from some that GTA 6 would come to market at $100 to help give other publishers a reason to raise prices as well. A GTA 5 actor recently said GTA 6 would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-warrants-a-100-price-tag-gta-5-actor-says/1100-6535876/" data-ref-id="1100-6535876">well worth $100 given the game's size and scope.</a></p><p>Developer Rockstar has found itself embroiled in controversy, as the studio recently fired dozens of employees for what it called "gross misconduct." Rockstar said employees were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-dev-says-it-fired-workers-for-leaking-secrets-not-for-trying-to-unionize/1100-6535987/" data-ref-id="1100-6535987">leaking company secrets</a>, but a labor union says this is baloney and that the affected staffers were fired for attempting to unionize. The UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said he will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/united-kingdoms-ministers-will-look-into-rockstars-dev-firings-says-prime-minister/1100-6536840/" data-ref-id="1100-6536840">"look into" the firings.</a></p><p>For more on GTA Online's new update, you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-onlines-big-new-update-with-michael-dlc-mission-is-out-now-see-the-full-patch-notes/1100-6536845/" data-ref-id="1100-6536845">see the full patch notes</a> and read about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-start-the-michael-mission-in-gta-online-safehouse-in-the-hills-update/1100-6536842/" data-ref-id="1100-6536842">how to start the new mission starring Michael.</a></p>

<p>The next expansion heading for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> has been revealed, and it has some very familiar faces front and centre.</p>
<p>The Crimson Blaze set launches on <strong>17th December</strong>, and sees Mega Charizard Y plastered across the packet cover. Naturally, new cards for Mega Venusaur and Mega Blastoise are included too, alongside new art for the Kanto starters and fresh card covers/backdrops.</p>
<p>The above trailer gives us a pretty good idea of what the set will have in store, but here's a closer look at a handful of the new cards:</p>


<p>The last set to arrive in the app was October's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lands-new-expansion-as-app-surpasses-150-million-downloads">Mega Rising expansion</a>, which ushered a new range of risky Mega Evolutions into the card battler. It'll be interesting to see how long these Mega cards stay in play as new sets keep rolling out in 2026.</p>

<p>Time is ticking down until Geoff Keighley once again emerges from his fleshy cocoon, brushes the Garibaldi crumbs from his suit, and strides onto the stage to bellow his customary challenge of "Who wants some?". We assume he means games, but one day he will nut a developer in the front row and we won't be able to say he didn't warn us.</p>
<p>We're pulling together a quick rundown of everything announced at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/the-game-awards-2025">The Game Awards 2025</a> so you don't need to risk life and limb by straying too close to Geoff's grasping fingers.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you're planning on staying up for the night, then a fine time shall be had by all who pull up a stool at James's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2025-livestream">The Game Awards 2025 liveblog</a>. If, however you'd rather not trade a good night's sleep for an early look at trailers, then head back here tomorrow morning for a full list of everything announced at the show.</p>
<p>For the games we find most intriguing, we will be writing fuller stories which I'll link out to below.</p>
<p>What's that? The Game Awards haven't started yet? You could have fooled me, what with all the…</p>
<h2>Confirmed games at The Game Awards 2025</h2>
<h3>Total War: Mystery</h3>
<p>Those cheeky so and sos over at Creative Assembly held a livestream last week, a right poke in the eye for ol' Geoff. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creative-assembly-reveal-total-war-medieval-3-while-teasing-a-huge-game-reveal-to-follow">It's where they announced Total War: Medieval 3</a> (while also puncturing the excitement by saying it was still years from release). However, to salve Geoff's bloodshot eye, they also teased a big announcement for The Game Awards.</p><p>There have long been rumours of a Total War take on either Star Wars or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-40000-reveal-likely-after-telltale-words-40k-spotted-in-creative-assembly-video">Warhammer 40k</a>. That could well live up to Creative Assembly's promise that "this title will be Total War's next major release and represents one of the most ambitious projects in the franchise's history, marking the beginning of an exciting new era."</p>
<h3>Resident Evil Requiem</h3>
<p>First revealed at Summer Game Fest in June, Resident Evil Requiem is the ninth main game in the series. Capcom had insisted that it wouldn't star Leon and would instead focus on new character technical analyst Grace Ashcroft. However, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/leon-kennedys-in-resident-evil-requiem-playstation-store-cover-art-leak-confirms">a leaked cover from earlier this week</a> certainly appeared to show everyone's favourite cop-turned-super-soldier, suggesting that Capcom's pants are a-blazing.</p>
<h3>New Tomb Raider</h3>
<p>Like a Roman emperor tossing another prisoner to the lions in the colosseum, <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1998093056692895923">on Monday Geoff threw out a tweet teasing "a look at the future" for Tomb Raider</a>. Out in the world with all that hungry attention on it, someone quickly found the box art and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-is-the-next-tomb-raider-reboot-project-going-by-alleged-trailer-leak">reveal trailer for Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a>. The trailer was taken down, but reports from those that saw it say it looks like a reboot for the series.</p>
<p>Confirmed game news is all well and good, but what about the more salacious stuff? The grimy things no one wants to stand by ahead of the night? You know what I mean…</p>
<h2>The Game Awards 2025 rumours</h2>
<p>Well, one of the worst-kept secrets in gaming is the Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag remake. It looks like it may be ready to eagle dive from the crow's nest with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-rated-by-pegi-as-the-siren-song-of-remake-sea-shanties-grows-deafening">a PEGI rating for Assassins's Creed Black Flag Resynced</a> spotted just the other day. Presumably it's too late to rename the project? Something a little less of a mouthful would be lovely.</p><p>Being a Keighley show, Hideo Kojima is often lurking in the wings. With a recent ESRB rating for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach PC release, tonight could be the moment for an on-stage reveal. Maybe with some added director's cut gubbins thrown in?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is likely to win big at the awards tonight, so it would also be the perfect time for the team to reveal their next project. Be it details of an expansion of a tease of something more.</p>
<p>Now, finally, as long as I've been a games journalist, I've been hearing rumours of the imminent reveal of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-3">Half-Life 3</a>. Once again, with the advent of the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and new Steam Controller, there's been more buzz about Gordon Freeman once again picking up his crowbar. I want it to be true, but I have no reason to believe it is true. Nor that Valve would announce it anywhere other than their own show. That said, I'm not going to say I'll eat my hat if it's announced, because under everything I remain an optimist.</p>
<p>I'll be updating this post throughout the night and, if all goes to plan, when you wake up tomorrow it will be chock full of trailers and game reveals. If not, well, let us salute my attempt.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonys-budget-wireless-headphones-just-got-even-cheaper-with-a-nearly-50-priced-like-no-brand-wired-earbuds-2000652308</link>
            <guid>1379911</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The market is overflowing with headphones, but does that mean every other option out there is worth your money? Not at all. Those on a budget looking to grab a solid pair – we come bearing good news.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/">Amazon just slashed the Sony WH-CH520 wireless headphones by 46%, bringing the price down to just $38</a>. You’re saving $32 on a pair that not only gets you premium, high-quality sound but also offers an incredible battery life. All color options are discounted, so there’s plenty to choose from. Prefer your audio gear minimal? Go for the stunning blue version. Those who want their headphones to have a bit of a personality can consider the pink or yellow options! The retailer is also throwing in a two-month trial to Audible with your purchase to sweeten the deal even more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Custom Sound Experience</h2>
<p>There’s nothing too crazy going on looks-wise, which is a good thing. The lightweight build features an adjustable headband, paired with swivel earcups that slip on and off gently. The ear pads are soft, plus they come with an additional head cushion and silent joints, making it easy to wear these headphones for an extended period of time. You’ll be able to survive those never-ending commutes, plus boring tasks that otherwise feel unbearable.</p>
<p>Everyone has different sound preferences, and this pair takes care of that. It pushes high-quality, rich audio, but you can further customize the listening experience by tailoring it according to your taste using the EQ Custom feature on the Sony Headphones Connect app. The platform lets you pick from a wide range of presets to match the quality of the sound to what’s playing. Go for a deeper bass for energy-filled tracks, and tone it down when something a bit calmer plays. DSEE support makes it easy to enhance the quality of compressed music files just as well. There’s even a built-in microphone for easy hands-free calling on the go, without having to pull your phone out; great for catching up with friends while travelling, and hopping onto work meetings while sitting in a cafe.</p>



<p>Pairing these Bluetooth headphones with up to two devices at the same time is made possible with Multipoint connection. For instance, if you have them connected to your phone and laptop, you can stream music on the former and quickly switch to the latter when it’s time for a Zoom session. Those losing track of their essentials often will appreciate how you can check the last known location of the headphones in Google’s Find My Device app on your smartphone.</p>
<p>Battery life is significantly better than most other options in this range. You’re looking at around 50 hours of continuous listening on a single charge. That’s more than enough to get through at least a few days without worrying about running out. Running low but don’t have the time to juice them up fully? No sweat. A quick 3-minute top-up gets you an additional 90 minutes of playback!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/">There’s a lot more to like about these headphones, especially now at their current price.</a> These offer exceptional battery life and impressive sound, plus let you customize your listening experience according to your preferences. All six colors are discounted, so you can pick the one that fits your aesthetics the best.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/high-on-life-2-devs-on-the-art-of-making-a-comedy-game-sequel-ign-first</link>
            <guid>1379908</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of our ongoing month-long exclusive coverage of High on Life 2, the upcoming first-person shooter, I sat down with Squanch Games Chief Creative Officer Mikey Spano and Chief Design Officer Erich Meyr to discuss the art of making a comedy game sequel. Is it any easier to pull off than the comedy movie sequel, which doesn't have a great overall track record. All that and more are covered in the interview you can watch in the video above or read in the transcript below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">High on Life 2 will be released on February 13, 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S – including launching on day one into Xbox Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: I've got a hundred questions here, not literally 100, but there's a lot I want to ask you guys. And I thought I'd kind of start here. And that is, I don't know if you'd agree, but in my opinion, comedy sequels, at least in the movie side of entertainment, don't have an awesome track record, so how do you approach doing a comedy game sequel to avoid some of the same pitfalls that comedy movie sequels seem to fall into?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: I feel like a lot of movie sequels in general aren't better than the first, right? But game sequels are usually like a refined version of the first game. And yeah, we definitely took a lot of great ideas that we couldn't do in the first game and put them in this one, so hopefully we'll overcome that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah, with the first one, I don't think we really knew what it was until it was in the hands of reviewers and we were like, "Oh, this actually turned out pretty cool." We were just so heads down on it, it was a new IP for us. So I think for this one, we had a good place to start, so we're really hoping that it's a plus up of the original. I mean, there's definitely more jank in the original than this one, which is a lot of fun and keeps things funny, but I think we'll still have plenty of just fun, weird, unexpected stuff, so I'm hoping people like it just as much as the first, if not more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Mikey, can you speak a little more to that? Because I've never made a game, I don't have the talent or skills for that, but I've talked to a million developers, reviewed, covered a million games. And I've heard that a lot where games are such a unique art form where often, they don't really come together until the very end and then suddenly you've got a game. So can you kind of talk me through not the development of the first game, but more kind of the very end that you're referencing there when it does come together, and then when it comes out and you start getting feedback from players and from reviewers? Did anything hit differently with players in the public than you thought it would, or did things surprise you versus what you'd intended or planned?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah, definitely. I mean, there's a lot of angles we can look at for High On Life in particular. We're pretty open with our team about letting them put in stuff that they're interested in. And then usually they'll just reach out and say, "Hey, is this cool or does this work?" But towards the end, we have people we trust a lot that just can go in and do stuff if they want. So from a perspective of even just the dev that was working on directing the game, we saw stuff, or at least I can say I saw stuff that I didn't even know was in the game, and I am in there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I saw things in some streams where I'm like, "Where did that even come from? Oh my God, that's awesome." That kind of stuff was really surprising and fun and that was intentional on our part. And then there's just a bunch of stuff that kind of breaks in funny ways or things that somebody approaches it a different way than I would've approached it or someone here would've approached it. And so you get this sort of emergent comedy that's based on the players' actions and not necessarily what we intended the players' actions to be.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah, in the first game, there was a bug where people were getting stuck in Applebee's and that became an internet joke for a while. And we're like, "Sure, we'll own it. Yeah, you get stuck in Applebee's forever."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah, the other thing we struggle with is, we call it dev eyes, where it's like you've just been looking at the game for so long. All the jokes you've heard a thousand times, they might've been funny the first time. And so you never really know at the end, what's going to land with people because for you, you're so numb to this stuff. So you sort of give it to a friend to play or we'll get some people in and we'll watch them play and evaluate, "Oh, that's surprising, this was their favorite part." And it's something we've seen so much, we weren't even thinking about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah. That happened with us with our demo, where we put in so many good jokes throughout it. And then the thing that resonated the most was taking Sheath and turning him into a gun and that whole bit, the whole joke of that bit. And I don't think any of us expected that to be the biggest hit. We were like, "Oh no, it's going to be this part or this part." But I mean, the internet doesn't lie, right? That was the part people watched the most.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: What ultimately then, were the lessons that you took out of the first game when you're talking about kind of more hitting the ground running here with High On Life 2? What are those lessons that you took from the first one that are helping this one?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: I mean, we definitely knew the formula we wanted to do. We knew how a lot of jokes worked. We knew how we did an interactive gameplay with them, and we could take that and be like, "Let's do that kind of thing here, that kind of thing here," or, "Let's one up that one." So it gave us a really good platform to stand on as far as figuring out what all of our different moments would be, what our jokes would be, so that was really great. That helped us tremendously at the beginning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then also just, there was a whole can of worms around how do you handle having all these different guns and each one can be out and each one can have its own little comedy layer to a mission? And so we learned a lot of lessons from that and we're able to just like every mission now, we're like, "Yeah, we can focus on this gun here and we can do this here." It really helped us understand how to just build our game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah, for sure. We had the foundation. I mean, in the first game, we kind of take for granted that we were figuring out the gameplay, too. It's a first person shooter, but outside of knowing that it was a first person shooter, we had to figure out everything from the ground up, which is a lot harder than you would think. Starting with that foundation helped us game play-wise to really focus on the things that were working, try not to change those too much. And then the things that weren't working, building on them, and then also just bringing in some new stuff that we wouldn't have been able to bring into the first game because we were just figuring out the basics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that goes across comedy, too. I mean, we are always trying jokes that don't land. We're trying ways to tell the jokes that don't always work. And we end up with the best, but a lot of that stuff didn't work for one reason or another. And so we have that stuff left over for the next game that we can try again. And we're never really starting from zero per se, with this sequel. I mean, conceptually, there's a lot of stuff that's from zero, but in terms of our systems and everything, we had a good starting point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: A lot of developers I know these days just pull a ton of telemetry from players when they're playing. So when it's out there in the wild, kind of building on what you guys are saying, did any particular telemetry jump out at you guys, like people watching a surprisingly high amount of the in-game TV or barely looking at it at all, then maybe you take that and you either double down on something or scale back on something for the sequel?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah. I mean, this is a little bit anecdotal from just hearing it everywhere, not necessarily a more qualitative thing, but just the many people who love Tammy and the T-Rex from that. You especially go through Steam reviews or whatever and yeah, there's certain things like that, that we did not expect to hit so strongly. And then yeah, I mean, just like any other game too, you kind of see where people fell off, like how many people played at the beginning. And for us, we were on Game Pass, so a lot of people tried the game, which was great. And we could see how far... Like any game, you have the curve of a lot of people get through the beginning and then you don't have as many people who actually finish it, but even people who didn't finish it still really enjoyed it. So it's cool to see that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah, we kind of had a unique situation where we had so many players. We were not anticipating that, but I think we're over 20 million players at this point on the game, which is insane. So pretty much every little area of the game was poked at in a way we didn't expect and it was really fun to watch that happen. I mean, you're stressed about, "Oh man, somebody found this bug," or, "Somebody exploited this thing," and you get stressed about it. But then you realize most people are out there just kind of having fun and laughing at it. And with 20 million people, there was quite a few variations of things people were hyper focused on or laughing about. I mean, some of my favorite stuff that came out of it is just the weird Hentai fan art of the guns, there's just so much. We hit every facet of weird internet culture and I love it, I couldn't be happier about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: That's awesome. I mean, on that note, I wanted to ask you guys about Game Pass because I think Game Pass has been in the news lately for at least maybe not players' favorite reasons recently, but I think more broadly than that, and I even would say this from where I sit as somebody that covers Xbox and talks about Xbox on an Xbox podcast all the time, there's a lot of confusion, I think, from players about the business side of how Game Pass works. Now, I'm not asking you guys to share the terms of your deal with Microsoft or anything like that.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But clearly the first game, as you're talking about, Mikey, that was a huge success for you guys on the back of launching straight into Game Pass. So can you talk about what worked for you with that deal, what you got out of it, basically? Obviously, you mentioned 20 million players, but do you see Steam sales spike when it hits Game Pass or stuff like that? I don't know if, again, without maybe opening up the company's books or anything, which, I know you're not going to do that, but can you kind of speak to the fallout, if you will, of being on Game Pass?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah. I mean, I look at Game Pass as a way to get people who are curious about your game. It's almost like a way to just demo games that are on Game Pass, where it reminds me of those old PlayStation Underground CDs you used to get in the mail. Game Pass to me is sort of that feeling. There's so many games that I'm interested in, but it's unlikely I'm going to buy every single one for a variety of reasons. So with Game Pass, it's like I'll check this game out. And typically I fall off. I have really bad ADD, so I'll fall off after an hour or something. And I think with High On Life, we had a lot of people that love Rick and Morty or hated Rick and Morty, but either way they knew about the game for that reason and maybe they wanted to hate play it. And then they ended up actually liking it. And then you kind of build this buzz around, "Have you guys heard of this crazy game," where somebody might not have taken the plunge and bought the full price game, so the online sentiment wouldn't have been as big. It wouldn't have been such a big conversation around the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think that really helped us with marketing the game, especially as a new studio with a new IP and everything. Without Game Pass, we would've had very little visibility, so it was beneficial in that way. And I think there's some ways now that Game Pass has evolved a little where they're allowing people to come out simultaneously day one on PlayStation or come out on Steam. And that kind of stuff, we have no idea how that's going to work out, but based on what happened with the first game, I'm thinking it's going to be really big for us because we still get that conversation around the game from people playing Game Pass. But then people on PlayStation, they don't have to wait a year and then kind of forget about it and then restart the conversation. I think Game Pass is going to be even better for us this time than it was for the first game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah, it's hard. I mean, these days, there's a lot of good games coming out all the time. I'm constantly shocked when I'm like, "Wait, what is this game that looks like everything I want from the game, but it came out two years ago?" And I follow news and everything, so getting a good amount of attention to your game is critical.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: A big new feature of High On Life 2 is skateboarding. I'm a big first person shooter fan and I've played a million of them over the years, and I'm trying to think if I've ever played a first person shooter that has skateboarding in it. Where does the idea come from for that? How does that kind of come up and then hone in as a key new feature of the sequel?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah, this is a really interesting one because this is something both Eric and I really wanted on the first game. We had a concept artist, Sean McNally, who, amazing concept artist. You can use his name in here if you want. He's great, love the guy, very talented. We were kind of coming up, "What are some other things you can do with aliens and alien life forms?" And he had drawn this sort of pill bug that unfolded into a skateboard and we were like, "Ah, God, we got to get this-"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah, it was so cool. We were like, "We could just throw this in as a thing you could temporarily have for a moment in a level or something."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah. And then in my head, it was like the boot in Mario 3 or something, where an enemy and you use it temporarily. And so when we started High On Life 2, we started kicking the conversation around again, "What if we had a power up that let you kind of skateboard?" And so it was meant to just be a little thing. And we started playing with it and the fun was there, but there was so much complexity that I got to the point as like... I grew up skateboarding, I love skateboarding, but I got to the point where I was like, "It's just too risky, we can't do it." And then Eric was like, "I'm not letting go of this." </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: In the first game when we were figuring out a traversal kit, at one point we had this sort of omnidirectional boost thing and it was kind of cool. It helped the momentum of the game, but it just didn't have anything grounding it. We converted it into sort of a power slide, which was really fun the first game. It's my favorite thing to do in that game. And then really, we talked about the skateboard in our creative meetings and we're like, "Yeah, let's do it. Let's figure out some cool thing with a skateboard." And at first I was like, "Well, it'll just be power slide plus. You can slide now, but you can go for longer because you're on a skateboard." And then we did a whole bunch of refactoring our traversal kit.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We kind of really improved all of our movement and a lot of things, me and Carl Glave, who's our programmer for all the traversal stuff. And then we were tagging the skateboard and as we kept going with it, we're like, "Well, yeah, you should be able to go up a vert ramp. Yeah, of course. You should be able to do this, all the skateboarding things." And we were looking at Tony Hawk and a bunch of different games like Session and Skate and stuff that are really technical skating games. And we were like, "Well, we can't do all that technical stuff." There's not enough buttons. You got to shoot as well, you can't just not do all that. But we started just refining and refining and reducing things, but also making it just a really smooth experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I really just wanted you to feel like you're on a skateboard, it's doing what you want to do while you're shooting at guys, while you're doing all these other things that are taking up most of your mental space, but you still get that feeling like you're on a board and you can jump off ramps and go and wall ride and do all kinds of cool stuff with it. So we just kept kind of refining it and making it smoother and just more intuitive, and not super technical because that competed too much with the shooter aspect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think the hardest thing for a new mechanic like that is it's risky, it's unknown. We looked at a lot of different comps and a lot of other games had been doing kind of similar stuff to try to get some ideas and it really was just an accumulation of just hammering on it and iterating on it continuously and making some really good calls at different points to make it. There was a whole group effort deciding exactly what this needs to do and what it should not do. And that got us to a really good spot.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: And a sequel's boring if it's not taking any creative risks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Exactly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah. And I keep thinking, "Did we take enough creative risks on this game?" And I'm like, "Oh wait, we completely changed-"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah, yeah. I mean, to me it's like the Terminator 2, right? Everyone can agree Terminator 2 is a great sequel. Terminator one is great too, but 2, they're like, "Well, we're going to make a quicksilver Terminator," which could have totally failed. Could have been like, "No, I want Arnold Schwarzenegger." But they put something new in with what you already had and made an awesome new experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah, for sure. The funny little anecdote, Eric mentioned Carl, Carl's an amazing programmer that we have and he is very motion sick sensitive. I don't know exactly the right phrasing for it, but he gets motion sick very easily. And so putting him on the skateboard is so cool, but he did such a good job with it. And I think a lot of the smoothness that you get from it comes from him just being like, "Oh, these numbers make me want to puke. Let me tweak that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah, yeah. No, he made sure it's motion sick friendly, which, in first person is insane.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah, it's crazy. I honestly thought it'd be a fun little power up. There's no way I would want to play a whole game where I'm riding a skateboard and shooting. And I was so wrong, it's so cool. It's my favorite part of the game for sure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Mikey, you said you grew up skating and there's such... I mean, the artwork for both games, just High On Life in general has such great artwork.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Thank you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: A custom skate deck for High On Life 2 – maybe like a collector's edition thing, limited. Are we going to do that?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: I will say that we have our biz dev guy, Benny Moore, he comes from Limited Run, so he knows that space really well. And then we just hired somebody, I believe it's merchandising director. I don't know his name, but it's another one that we know from Limited Run, Shaddy, and he's amazing, too. And so he's taking on a lot of really cool merchandising stuff for us. I can say I love skateboards, I love physical stuff. As you can see, my office is full of collectible stuff, so it's a pretty safe bet that there'll be some of my own life decks out there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: The hardest thing is going to be choosing which ones to use, because we have a bunch of decks in the game with awesome art on them and there's a lot of ones that, I can't pick a favorite. There's a lot of really, really cool decks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah. For this game, I have a big group of weird, low brow art friends and I wanted to bring them on to do graffiti and signs and stuff like that for us. And it worked out really well that they were able to all do deck designs for us, too. So we have so many cool, weird, unexpected decks in the game that I want to see all of them turn into a physical deck at some point. And I love the idea of a voting system of, "All right, for this next run, here's three. Which one do you guys want to see next?" And keep pitting them against each other. That could be really fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Pivoting back to the video game itself, the weapons, clearly the stars of High On Life and justifiably so. When you're looking at adding new ones for the sequel, I'm curious, where do you start? Do you start with weapon function like, "Well, do we want a rocket launcher type? Do we want this chain gun, this kind of that?" Or do you start with a personality type and then figure out what gun function it should be? Or do you start with an actor in mind and then kind of build a gun around that? I'm really curious to the process because the guns are such a unique aspect of High On Life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah. Typically, I mentioned earlier, I'm super ADD, so I'm always doodling. Even in meetings and stuff, I'll be doodling. So Eric and I will be talking about, "What's a gun archetype we want that we don't have yet?" And so while we're talking, I'll start usually just doodling a few things and I'll show it to Eric and say, "What do you think about this functionality? Does this functionality seem cool?" And then he'll give me some notes and maybe he'll do a sketch and we just kind of go back and forth, honing in on a shotgun archetype. Gus is our shotgun archetype and=</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah, that's how we figured out a lot of the first game's guns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah, we're a very visual based studio, we let the vibes lead our design. And then Eric and Nick, who is our technical director, but also our combat director for this game, he gets really into the weeds about how the functionality works and, "Let's tune this number and let's try this." And all of that kind of goes back and forth and informs the general look of the gun. And usually when I'm sketching these guns up, I'm thinking about an actor like Sheath from the very beginning, I wanted to be Ralph Ineson. He's been my white whale for years and we finally got him. And so that whole time, I knew that's what I wanted him to look like. And for the caps from the first game, a lot of that look came from just Jim Henson.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you look at the really old, fat, weird Kermit the Frog, that's Creature. There's just a bunch. I have all this reference from the game where, believe it or not, Knifey is basically Elmo without a nose or hair. And that's kind of where I started because I thought it would be a fun nod. I love leaning on cultural stuff that exists already, so I'm always putting little nods to everything. And trying to find more Muppets for this game didn't really work out right away, so I just kind of went with what felt right. And luckily, Eric and Nick and I were able to come up with some archetypes that felt really good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah. When we kicked this game off, we locked ourselves in this rental office for a week. Me and Mikey and Alec Robbins, our native director, Nick, and Maddie, our producer, our EP, to just oversee everything. And we just broke down a bunch of stuff from the game. I just remember one of the things we did was we had a big whiteboard of just every gun archetype imaginable and then being like, "Okay, what would fit? What's going to be the next things that would fit into our mix?" And then started playing with those and sort of integrating some of them into the story as we were talking about story as well. I don't remember all the details.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yeah. And on the first game, like I was saying earlier, we didn't really know what it was, so I drew a million guns. So this game, before I even did anything, I was like, "What about this sheet that we had? Is there anything on here that's a good starting point?" But I don't think we ended up bringing any of that on. The bow and arrow was a new concept, I don't think anything existed for that and Sheath was all new. Travis and Jan were pretty much all new. So even though we started with some of the older sketches, they changed enough that it was just pretty much from scratch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Well, speaking of the voice actors for the weapons in High On Life, when you're writing now the sequel, obviously, do you really even write lines for JB Smoove, or do you just give him some ideas and outlines and then just hit record in the VO booth?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: I wish the latter was possible, but it's just wrangling somebody who's really good at ad-libbing when we have such a tight story. Especially in this game, we focused a lot more on a tight narrative. Alec and his team, Alec Robbins, our Narrative Director and effectively our head writer, him and his team just wrote so much amazing stuff that getting the actor into the booth and getting all of it read out, you've played the game so you interact with someone, they're not just saying one thing, they're saying a bunch of things. And each of those things has multiple permutations. And so there's just really no way to get an actor in and say, "Go crazy."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the first game, it happened just out of necessity, given the structure of the game, but for this one, we wanted to do a better job and tighten things up. And so we do start pretty much everything written and then we'll have them read the line the way it's written and then, "All right, well, how would you say this line?" And then some of those are the ones that are the funniest and sometimes just reading it as is works better. But it's very taxing on the voice actors to ask for ad lib, especially in that setting, so it can be really tricky. Sometimes it just happens on its own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah, we like to encourage it. And this time, I mean, this game has so much more dialogue than the first game that some of those record sessions were like, "We got to move. We can't ad lib for an hour on this guy." So yeah, it was a lot to get, especially with the guns. And Gus and Sweezy in particular, they're around for the whole game, so they're a lot of dialogue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: JB is such a master improviser, I just was curious. It's interesting to hear that you almost had to just keep him on script.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah, a lot of people go crazy in moments for sure, but you're getting through so many lines, yeah, we kind of had to just let it go off the script first and foremost and then mess around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: You mentioned the whiteboard of weapon archetypes, that you lock yourself in a WeWork space for a week at the beginning of the project to start to hash out. Did you have any weapons or weapon ideas that had hit the cutting room floor? You're talking about stuff that got cut from the first game. Was anything from the first game that made its way into this one in terms of the weapons?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: I'm trying to remember. The first game, well, one thing we had in the first game, Sweezy, there was going to be two Sweezys at one point, right, Mikey? One of them died and became a ghost?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: You had this ghost gun that you could summon, but it never really got traction. We've been wanting to do the dual pistols. I really wanted initially, Eric Andre and Hannibal Burris, just one gun that was overly confident and kind of funny, and then one that just talked to the other gun the whole time. And that was sort of the archetype we were talking about. And then as we got closer, I don't remember who pitched it, but we were like, "It would just be funny if it was just a couple in a relationship and that you had-"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: I think we were all watching Righteous Gemstones at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: I think that's probably what it was.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: And we were like, "Oh yeah, that relationship is like the..." I forget the character's names, but it's so funny. And so we're like, "We should hone in on that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah. And so then we kind of started with that as sort of the archetype. And then we had different actors in mind for the guns initially, and then we kind of just kept swapping actors around based on availability and what the game needed. And we ended up with Ken Marino, who's amazing, so-</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: So good, such a good performance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah, he's just so pro. He gets it, he just nails it. And Gabourey Sidibe, who, she played Mucks in our DLC, but now she plays Jan. And those two together are so funny, it's fantastic. Those two guns, at first, I thought would be a fun little joke for a mission or something, but they're probably the most memorable narrative-wise from the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: I think so too, yeah. Because it's two guns and they span over a couple missions, you get a lot of... Their story becomes actually a pretty prominent story in the whole game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Was replacing Kenny in the game from the DLC and now in the sequel, easier than recasting Kenny? Because I mean, you've got the two new voice actors for Rick and Morty now who are just dead on perfect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah, we actually didn't want to bring Kenny over for this game. We're not done with Kenny in the universe, but he's just not part of the story of this game. We will be recasting Kenny, of course, but assuming we continue to make High On Life, which I will fight tooth and nail to keep doing, we still want Kenny to be a part of this universe and he's got a lot more to his story than what we saw in the first game and in DLC. I think our narrative wrapper was that Kenny just got dropped or something in the DLC, but I think that there's more to that story than we let players know, and so we'll be hopefully talking a little bit more about that in future game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah, this game takes place five years after the original, so we kind of alluded some of the things that happened in that time span, but that's definitely an area that we'll explore more in this game and in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: The last question I have for you guys is, you touched on it already with talking about how much more dialogue there is in this one, but scope-wise, for me, I really thought the first game was just the perfect... It didn't overstay its welcome, but it wasn't like a four-hour game by any stretch either. I just thought it really hit its mark super well. So are you aiming for a similar scope to the first game with this one or we go and... What's the thought process there?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: We're a little bit larger for sure. We wanted to give a little more. This game especially has a much more kind of, I'd just say mature narrative. There's more going on with it. We actually hit our themes a lot stronger at the end and everything, so we wanted to give it more time to feel like a good sequel. And then we actually have quite a bit more sort of side content you can do in this one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the first game we sort of have, you could go back to areas, you could bring in some more bases for a little fun vignettes. In this one, you kind of have these regions in the hub that you can actually go around and find cool stuff in and kind of dig into more and just skate, you can just skate over the whole place. So we definitely have a little more extra time for folks who want to mess around as well. We're definitely shooting for a bit of a longer game than the first one, but by no means, this isn't an RPG length game. We're trying to keep it a nice narrative you can play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: For the first game, we didn't really know how long it was going to be. And then it came out and we were like, "Okay, good. It was enough." For me, as an older gamer, 10 hours is my favorite amount of time to put into a game. Past that, I get stressed. And so we didn't want to get too far from 10 hours, but then at the same time, we had so much we wanted to do that things just kept growing. And honestly, I don't know how long the game is. It could be 1,000 hours, it could be 11 hours. I really don't know at this point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll know the day before it comes out, how long it really is. But I think it's safe to say it's a decent bit longer than the first game. Our initial desire was 25% more, but I actually think we've probably exceeded that by a bit. And then that's not even thinking about all the new side content and just skating around, doing challenges and stuff like that, so there's a lot there. And it's not all narrative comedy. There's a lot of the side stuff that's just pure gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah, just fun gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: It hopefully doesn't overstay its welcome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: On this one in particular, we try to make every level very unique. And you're still using all your core mechanics, but there's a lot of levels we're not going to talk about until they release because they're awesome surprises. And so hopefully that keeps. Especially, I know some games midway through, you're kind of like, "All right," I get it. So hopefully we can keep that pacing going for everyone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Each act, if not each mission, could be its own game. All the guns, each time you get a new gun, everything changes. Each time you get to a new location, it's a surprise. And we didn't do a ton of retread this time other than sidetracking or side missions, I guess. It's a lot, and I think people won't get too exhausted with it just because the variety is so broad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Not in Kansas anymore.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">World of Warcraft's new housing feature has been available for those who pre-purchased the upcoming Midnight expansion for over a week now, which naturally means folks have had plenty of time to get really, <em>really</em> creative with their new library of decor. One of the wildest player discoveries early on was finding a trick that would make houses float in the air, which a number of people have used to make wild flying creations. Better yet, instead of patching it out, Blizzard has surprisingly given its blessing for airborne abodes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lofting one's house was discovered almost immediately after the housing feature dropped, with players initially using it simply to raise their homes in the air as a fun gimmick.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apparently, flying houses are surprisingly easy to do. If you're just using the base creation tools, you're never going to be able to do this on accident, as the most you can do is move the house around on the ground within your lot. However, players using Advanced Mode can raise a house by moving any decor object inside or attached to exterior of the house, and then lifting that object up in the air. The house goes with it!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As time has gone on, players have gotten even wackier with their flying houses, using them to create elaborate constructions such as airships:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mechanical wonders:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And other assorted creations:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since this discovery was made, players have been understandably concerned that Blizzard would patch it out, as it didn't seem to be intended behavior from houses. However, Blizzard has taken a surprising step in sanctioning the hovering homes, and even actively trying to make it easier to create them. A recent post on the forums from community manager Kaivax reads as follows:</p><blockquote>Almost immediately after the 11.2.7 patch went live, we saw players using keybinds to elevate houses off the ground, even though there weren’t UI controls for that. We quickly began work to enable the controls so that it would be easier to move a house upward.</blockquote><blockquote>We have two concerns, of course:</blockquote><blockquote>The underside of houses aren’t modeled or textured. Players who lift their houses may decide to hide that part behind other things.</blockquote><blockquote>If you lift your house up, clicking on the door could become difficult. You might want to consider building a ramp or a jumping puzzle or a mount landing spot, etc.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Honestly, totally fair PSAs from Blizzard there, though it does lead one to wonder if long-term we might see some decor aimed at flying homes specifically if they get popular enough. Now if only we could have an entire floating city-wait, we what? Uh, scratch that. I'm going back home.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

            <p>A leaked trailer for 007 First Light - the Bond origin game from Hitman developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> - has shined a light on one the villains set to appear in the upcoming release. And, they are played by a name you will likely recognise, but perhaps not expect.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of potential 007 First Light spoilers below. </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-twitter-account-jumps-the-gun-and-posts-trailer-announcing-first-light-villain.1379350/#post-148736176">leaked trailer for 007: First Light</a> reveals that American rock musician and Hunger Games actor Lenny Kravitz will star in the upcoming release as Bawma, who shares Kravitz's likeness. The footage, which evidently went live earlier than intended, shows Bawma sitting in a rather plush armchair, monologuing a bit as many Bond villains seem to find themselves doing.</p>
<p>"I am sometimes asked 'Bawma, how is it that you hear every whisper, of every corner of Aleph'," Bawma says. "And I answer, I have built Aleph with my will, my blood, my whole self. This city is an extension of my being. My body. And today, it became infected."</p>
<p>Bawma then gets his cronies to launch Bond into a pit of crocs. "Easy girls," the villain coos.</p>
<p>It is fair to assume Kravitz's inclusion in the upcoming game was meant to be revealed at The Game Awards later this evening, where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">007 First Light is nominated for Most Anticipated Game</a>. So, stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>007 First Light will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and PC on 27th March next year.</p>
<p>For more on IOI and Bond, our Alex recently got a closer look at 007 First Light, stating it's "so much more than Hitman", and thanks to "its 'breathing' structure", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">it looks like "the ultimate composite video game"</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/tencent-reached-record-sales-generating-10-billion-in-revenue/</link>
            <guid>1379878</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>For years now, Tencent has been placing investments across the video game industry, acquiring stakes in a variety of companies and, in some cases, acquiring them entirely. It's been a slow-burning strategy that has undoubtedly paid off, as exemplified in a new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-09/tencent-goes-hands-on-to-reshape-10-billion-global-games-empire?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTM3MzA1NywiZXhwIjoxNzY1OTc3ODU3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNjdZOFdLR0NURlEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI2RjZBMkE0Njg3MjI0Q0I1ODNBQkMwQTNDRDI0RDM5OCJ9.uRCAYv2eub16WLwH8iuw-3CIHjLxG2B4hP4gOF4G9AU">Bloomberg</a> report where chief executive officer Michelle Liu discusses her methodology that helped Tencent generate <strong>$10 billion in revenue</strong> over the past year.</p>



<p>Not only did the report include the gargantuan sales record, but it also included a few notable bits of information on how Tencent treats its relationships with the studios it acquires. Dune: Awakening developer Funcom and Dying Light: The Beast developer Techland are mentioned specifically as having benefitted from Liu and Tencent's guidance.</p>



<p>"<em>If they could already achieve everything on their own, what would they need me for?</em>" Liu said. "Tencent has a lot of experience with data analysis, benchmarks, and criteria." Experience that has clearly benefitted its partners and the studios it acquired.</p>



<p>The chart below shows just how much bigger Tencent is than other major game publishers and platforms like Roblox, <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sets-record-concurrent-users-gaming-platform/">even as Roblox smashes concurrent player count records</a>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Tencent-Global-Gaming-Business-Chart-Bloomberg.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Bloomberg</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>We can always count on an extra point of view that helps us to improve the game</em>," said Techland founder Pawel Marchewka regarding Tencent's guidance in an interview at Gamescom 2025. Funcom chief executive officer Rui Casais added, at a separate Gamescom interview, "<em>When Tencent came in, they said, 'Look, you're spreading your attention.' You have a great IP that you've secured, you should really focus on that and drop the other things</em>."</p>



<p>While Funcom has not been able to avoid layoffs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-announces-layoffs-despite-dune-awakening-being-biggest-release-in-32-year-history/">Dune: Awakening was the studio's biggest launch in its entire history</a>. Techland was able to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-sells-over-1-million-steam/">sell over a million copies of Dying Light: The Beast at launch on Steam alone,</a> not including those players who got it for free as part of the Dying Light 2: Stay Human bundle they had purchased.</p>



<p>Of course, it's the teams that worked on those games that deserve the credit for their successes, but Liu's earlier point still stands, and it's becoming clear that Tencent is capable of directing teams to success. We'll see if that continues to be the case <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">with its new venture with Ubisoft and Vantage Studios</a>, but $10 billion in revenue is nothing to shake your stick at.</p>
