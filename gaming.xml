		<p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will launch across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC on 19th September 2024, Capcom has confirmed with a new trailer that dives into all the improvements and changes being made.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIAiUWhxmrs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a> is closer to a remake than a quick upscaling effort, as the game has been rebuilt within Capcom’s excellent RE Engine. On the latest generation consoles, the game will run with an “up to” 4K resolution and at 60FPS, while also featuring updated character models for Franke West, all the psychopaths, NPCs like Brad, Jessie and Madonna, and all those zombies you’ll be bashing about. You can really see the difference in the trailer above, with some dramatically overhauled lighting effects, West having a face that looks like it’s already been in a fight or seventeen, and plenty more.</p>
<p>Capcom also detailed further quality of life improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Frank West now has the ability to move while aiming!</li>
<li>Aspiring photojournalists can customize action shots with filters to get the best glam shot of their favorite zombies!</li>
<li>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster now has auto-save functionality! Need a bathroom break? Don’t worry…manual saves are still available when you need a breather.</li>
<li>All NPC and survivor interactions are now fully voiced!</li>
<li>New and improved NPC behaviors!</li>
<li>Real-time lighting and shadow effects!</li>
<li>More intuitive and user-friendly controls!</li>
<li>New fine-tuned user interface!</li>
<li>Fully voice overs for nine languages (English, Latin American Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese, French, Italian, German, Castilian Spanish, and Russian), and subtitles for fourteen (the aforementioned plus Korean, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Polish, and Arabic).</li>
</ul>
<p>Dead Rising was a classic from the early Xbox 360 days, using the then powerful new system to stuff a shopping mall with undead and have you clatter your way through them using all manner of ridiculous items as weapons. It introduced photojournalist Frank West as the protagonist, and gave you just 72 hours in-game to figure out the truth behind the outbreak – this time limit was perhaps the most contentious part of the game, which Capcom dropped for the third and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/02/dead-rising-4-franks-big-package-review/">fourth</a> games in the series. It sounds like it’s back here in full force, though with auto-saves and other tweaks it should be easier to live with.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-is-official-director-it-was-difficult-to-figure-out-what-to-do-after-7-but-i-found-it-and-it-is-substantial/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the CAPCOM NEXT Showcase, after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-is-out-on-september-19-powered-by-re-engine-and-enhanced-in-many-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveal of Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster's pricing and key features</a>, the studio also dropped a little bomb about Resident Evil 9. Yes, the next mainline installment in the revered survival horror franchise is officially in development.</p>
<p>The announcement was tied to the showcase of Resident Evil 7, which is out now on Apple's iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and every iPad and Mac with the M1 chip or later. The main game is bundled with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-7-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Not A Hero story DLC</a>, starring franchise veteran Chris Redfield, while the optional Gold Edition upgrade allows fans to get all of the content from the other DLCs, including additional story content and game modes. The package also supports universal purchase and cross-progression, so Apple gamers can play across iPhone, iPad, and Mac and continue their save games at home or on the go. Resident Evil 7 Biohazard runs natively on Apple devices. This version also features newly optimized controls for iPhone and iPad, including an auto-fire option and fully touch-compatible menus.</p>
<p>The reason the announcement of Resident Evil 9 was tied to this Resident Evil 7 showcase is fairly straightforward: the new chapter in CAPCOM's IP is being led by Koshi Nakanishi, who directed the first game in the series to switch from third-person view to first-person view. Nakanishi said:</p>
<p><em>We're making a new Resident Evil. It was really difficult to figure out what to do after 7, but I found it, and to be honest, it feels substantial. I can't share any details just yet, but I hope you're excited for the day that I can.</em></p>
<p>Needless to say, speculation will now run rampant as to when exactly CAPCOM will finally show Resident Evil 9. A good option could be the upcoming Tokyo Game Show, scheduled to take place at the usual venue of Makuhari Messe between September 26 and 29. Of course, it's also possible the game will be reserved for later shows, such as The Game Awards.</p>
<p>However, that would clash with rumors from CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem that the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may be targeting early 2025</a> for the launch of Resident Evil 9. If that's the case, then TGS seems the only real option. Dusk Golem also previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-monster-hunter-wilds-rumored-to-be-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the game would go open world, just like Monster Hunter Wilds, and he turned out to be right about CAPCOM's other tentpole franchise.</p>
<p>Are you excited about getting a new Resident Evil? Who do you want to see as protagonists?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-is-out-on-september-19-powered-by-re-engine-and-enhanced-in-many-ways/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-is-out-on-september-19-powered-by-re-engine-and-enhanced-in-many-ways/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the CAPCOM Next Showcase, the Japanese studio revealed that Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is slated to launch on September 19 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2527390/Dead_Rising_Deluxe_Remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, with pre-orders now open on all platforms.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-gets-surprise-announcement-2024-release-and-controversial-frank-west-redesign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teaser trailer</a>, we immediately noticed the noticeable visual upgrade. Indeed, CAPCOM has now confirmed the game is powered by RE Engine, whereas the original ran on the old MT Framework.</p>
<p>The game is now targeting 4K resolution and 60 FPS frame rate, and much higher quality character models have been made for Frank West, the unhinged Psychopaths, NPCs like Brad, Jessie, Isabela, Madonna, the survivors of the outbreak, and the seemingly endless waves of zombies. In the original game, CAPCOM focused on quantity over quality to pack a large number of zombies in the mall, but with the power of new hardware, they have been able to greatly improve the look of individual zombies, too. Real-time lighting and shadow effects have been introduced as well, which means the locations take a different look depending on the time of day.</p>
<p>The improvements of Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster go well beyond the visuals. The user interface (UI) has been refined, the controls have been made more accessible and use-friendly, the NPC behaviors have been expanded, and all NPC and survivor interactions have been fully voiced. Moreover, there's now auto-saving functionality (a popular demand from fans) on top of manual saving.</p>
<p>Combat-wise, the biggest change is that protagonist Frank West can now move while aiming, bringing the feel more in line with modern games. The language support is much bigger, too, as there are full voiceovers in nine different languages (English, Latin American Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese, French, Italian, German, Castilian Spanish, and Russian), plus subtitles for 14 languages (the aforementioned nine plus Korean, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Polish, and Arabic. Lastly, action shots with Frank's camera can now be customized with various filters to get the best possible shots.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ed-kfsJnhdU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is priced at $49.99, though there's a Digital Deluxe Edition priced at $59.99 that adds 17 costumes for Frank and 17 BGM tracks playable in the mall. All pre-orders will include the following three costumes and BGMs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costume: Frank West 2006 (Dead Rising); BGM: "Dreams of Yore (Mall Music 2 arranged)"</li>
<li>Costume: Chuck Greene (Dead Rising 2); BGM: "Super Shopper" (Dead Rising 2)</li>
<li>Costume: Willamette Parkview Mall Bee (Dead Rising); BGM: "Happy Flight! (Mall Music 6 arranged)"</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wepEXU"><strong>What is the shiny rate for Pikachu in Pokémon Go?</strong></h2>
<p id="NElmhN">As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230423103325/https://thesilphroad.com/shiny-pokemon">Wayback Machine</a>), the shiny rate for Pokémon on a regular day is approximately one in 500. Pikachu is not a confirmed Pokémon that gets a “permaboost” (meaning that it’s a rare spawn and thus gets a boosted shiny rate).</p>
<h3 id="TZ4GJv"><strong>What can I do to attract more shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="r3MqkW">Not much, unfortunately. It appears to be random chance. Shiny Pokémon catch rates are set by developer Niantic, and they are typically only boosted during special events like Community Days or Safari Zones, or in Legendary Raids. There are no consumable items that boost shiny Pokémon rates.</p>
<h3 id="thj8sX"><strong>Where can I find a list of available shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="WRj9xa">LeekDuck keeps <a href="https://leekduck.com/shiny/">a list of currently available shiny Pokémon</a>. It’s a helpful visual guide that illustrates what all of the existing shiny Pokémon look like.</p>

<p>Recently, Capcom announced the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, a full refresh of the 2006 title that redefined the concept of a zombie apocalypse. Now, the team has confirmed that the game will be released worldwide on September 18 – as well as outlining several key details about the development of the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-next-generation-zombie-slaying">Next Generation Zombie Slaying</h2>



<p>Capcom has suggested that this remaster is more like a full remake, given that it has been built to run in 4K at 60 FPS and has been constructed using the RE Engine. This is the engine that has been used to bring to life games like Resident Evil Village, Monster Hunter Wilds, Dragon’s Dogma 2, and Street Fighter 6.</p>



<p>In creating the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, Capcom has amended the original interface and introduced an autosave feature, which means you won’t need to track down a specific location to save your game anymore. Not only that but there is some post-launch content scheduled that’ll bring users and fans of the franchise fresh costumes and music to enjoy as they explore the Willamette Mall, fighting to survive a zombie outbreak.</p>



<p>It wasn’t expected that Capcom would reveal the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster – fans of the franchise have been holding out hope for a new original game for years. It has been almost a decade since Dead Rising 4 was released, and the series is hurting for an update.</p>

<p>During the recent Capcom Next program, it was revealed by Koshi Nakanishi, a director at the firm, that a new Resident Evil game is in development – and it’s ‘substantial’. This news comes following months of discussion, debate, and discourse about the existence of a new Resident Evil title. It’s worth highlighting that this isn’t a remake but an original concept that’s being headed up by the man who directed Resident Evil 7.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-kept-you-waiting-huh">Kept You Waiting, Huh?</h2>



<p>Speaking at the end of the Capcom Next: Summer 2024 program, <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/1807905937216491570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nakanishi addressed the project</a> he’s working on at Capcom:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re making a new&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>. It was really difficult to figure out what to do after Resident Evil 7, but I found it, and to be honest, it feels substantial. I can’t share any details just yet, but I hope you’re excited for the day I can.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nakanishi is a veteran at Capcom, having worked on the Resident Evil franchise since 2009’s Resident Evil 5 hit the market. Resident Evil 7 is often considered one of the best games in the series, and it marks the point when the franchise pivoted considerably, picking up a first-person perspective and adopting more horror-based themes than ever before. For some, it left behind the core principles of Resident Evil, but as a <strong>game</strong>, it was stellar.</p>



<p>The last original Resident Evil game was Resident Evil Village, released in Q2 of 2021. As a much freer and more open RE title, Village presented players with a larger map to explore – Nakanishi’s comments on the next game being more substantial might point to an even broader environment being introduced in whatever game comes next.</p>

            <p>
Parkitect is an absolute treat, a theme park management sim in the classic Rollercoaster Tycoon mould, but with more than a few fresh ideas of its own. It was a joy on PC, and it's finally console-bound, heading to Xbox and PlayStation this Wednesday, 3rd July.
</p>
<p>
Parkitect is the work of developer Texel Raptor, and originally launched into Steam early access back in 2016. Two years later, it got a wonderfully finessed 1.0 release, and nearly six years on from that, it's been refreshed for consoles, incorporating the likes of an updated UI and a new control scheme built specifically for controllers.
</p>
<p>
And, honestly, Parkitect's an easy recommend if you're a tycoon game fan, expanding on the classic theme park management sim formula (in which you strive to build a park so ceaselessly delightful, your guests can't help but throw cash at you) with some smart modernisation, all while still maintaining that heady whiff of nostalgia. 
</p>

<p>
Sure, it might not have the gloss of Frontier Development's Planet Coaster (although I'm personally a big fan of Parkitect's adorably low-poly isometric look), but what it lacks in presentational pizzazz, it makes up for in other areas. It's got a rich management core, surprisingly powerful construction tools, a rock-solid campaign mode, and some smart strategic wrinkles - including the need to build and maintain an efficient intra-park delivery infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
Parkitect's imminent console release, officially titled Parkitect: Deluxe Edition, includes the acclaimed base game - which I slapped with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/parkitect-review-the-finest-theme-park-sim-for-years">Recommended badge</a> back in 2018 - alongside its two DLC expansions, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theme-park-sim-parkitects-second-paid-expansion-booms-and-blooms-is-out-this-week">Booms &amp; Blooms</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/superb-theme-park-sim-parkitects-taste-of-adventure-dlc-out-next-week">A Taste of Adventure</a>. Those added the likes of fireworks display sequencing, new themed scenery sets, new rides, and more.
</p>
<p>
Parkitect: Deluxe Edition arrives for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4 this Wednesday, 3rd July. Texel Raptor also recently announced its second game - frog-themed town building and management game Croakwood - which is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2261380/Croakwood/">coming to PC</a> eventually.

            <p>
Following last week's briskest of teases, Capcom has properly unveiled Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster - which is bringing its spruced up zombies-in-a-mall action to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC on 19th September, with a physical release to follow.
</p>
<p>
Capcom's Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster revisits the original 2006 game - in which players, as photojournalist Frank West, have three in-game days to investigate Colorado's sprawling, zombie-infested Willamette Parkview Mall - giving its slapstick action a new lick of paint.
</p>
<p>
It retains the same maximalist approach to zombie hordes and the same anything-goes approach to weaponry, but features upgraded visuals, quality of life improvements, and more. On the graphics front, Capcom's Deluxe Remaster adds enhanced character models and "evolved" mall designs featuring real-time lighting and shadow effects - giving locations a different appearance depending on the time of days. It also supports 4K resolutions at 60fps.
</p>

<p>
As far as other improvements go, there are adjustments to make controlling Frank more intuitive - players can now move while aiming, for instance - plus enhanced NPC behaviour, an auto-save feature, and a 'fine tuned' interface. Capcom says its goal with the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is to keep the core "unchanged" but improve on the user experience.
</p>
<p>
And if that's got you salivating at the prospect of chaotic zombie carnage, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will be available in two digital editions when it launches for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam on 19th September. There's the £39.99 Standard Edition, plus a £49.99 Digital Deluxe edition (yes, Capcom is releasing a Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Deluxe Edition), which includes 17 costumes for Frank and 17 additional mall music tracks.
</p>
<p>
Capcom has also announced a pre-order bonus, with those willing to cough up for the game ahead of release getting the Dead Rising Original Pack, adding three costumes for Frank - Frank West 2006, Dead Rising 2's Chuck Green, and the Willamette Parkview Mall Bee - plus three mall tunes. A Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster physical edition arrives in November.

In early February, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-asks-players-if-they-want-sequels-to-okami-dead-rising-mega-man-and-more">Capcom posted a "Super Elections" survey</a> on its website, asking players if they would like a sequel or spin-off to its dormant franchises, such as Dead Rising, Okami, and Dino Crisis. </p><p>Dead Rising was originally released in 2006 and quickly became among the more desirable games available exclusively on the Xbox 360. The franchise ushered in a new franchise for Capcom during the late 2000s and 2010s, including three sequels. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster - Gameplay Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The most recent entry in the franchise before the announcement of Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster was <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-rising-4">Dead Rising 4</a>, released in 2016 for Xbox One and PC before <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/01/dead-rising-4-announced-for-ps4">a PS4 port</a> titled Frank's Big Package was released a year later. Dead Rising 4 was met with mixed reception and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-sales-top-3-5m-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported to have underperformed</a> sales-wise. </p><p>The poor sales performance of Dead Rising 4 led to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/18/capcom-expects-to-lose-40-million-after-cancelling-dead-rising-studios-games">the cancellation of a new Dead Rising game</a>, in addition to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/capcom-closes-vancouver-studio-loses-40-million">closing of Capcom Vancouver</a> (formerly Blue Castle Games), which developed Dead Rising games, starting in 2010 with the Dead Rising 2 prequel <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-rising-2-case-0">Case Zero</a>. </p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/08/07/dead-rising-review-2">our review of Dead Rising</a>, IGN wrote: "Though Dead Rising may seem like a simple, mindless game when you first pick it up, it eventually reveals itself as a deeper experience. Tons of extras are packed into Willamette's shops, there are magazine power-ups and special drink mixes to be brewed, lots of clothing combinations, countless pictures to be taken and plenty of NPCs to be saved." </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

                <p>Capcom has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2527390/Dead_Rising_Deluxe_Remaster/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that Dead Rising Deluxe Remastered will launch on September 19 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>A faithful remaster of the first game, Dead Rising Deluxe Remastered will cost $50 and boasts a major graphical overhaul made possible using Capcom's proprietary RE Engine. Though its original gameplay mechanics remain intact, the company has confirmed that certain modern features--such as autosaves, revamped controls, and improved UI--have been added to improve the game's quality of life. It's also fully voiced, but it doesn't seem like the original voice actor, TJ Rotolo, will be reprising his role as protagonist Frank West.</p><p>Those who preorder the game will receive various costumes for Frank and some background music. They include Frank's original outfit and the Willamette Parkview Mall bee costume from the 2006 game, as well as the Chuck Greene outfit from Dead Rising 2. There will also be a physical release of the game coming in November.</p><p>The original Dead Rising game was released in 2006 for Xbox 360. It was then remastered for its tenth anniversary in 2016 for PC, PS4, and Xbox One. The series has been quite successful and spawned three additonal titles: Dead Rising 2 in 2010, Dead Rising 3 in 2013, and Dead Rising 4 in 2016.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-rising-review/1900-6155398/" data-ref-id="1900-6155398">Dead Rising review</a>, we said, "Dead Rising's gory, ridiculous, and entertaining action, coupled with its real-time structure and campy stylistic touches, make it one of the most unique games currently available for the Xbox 360."</p>

It focused on providing updates for only three titles: Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, and the iOS/Mac port of Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. Here's a brief summary of each announcement, which includes the smallest of teases for the next Resident Evil title.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</h2>

<p>Ahead of its launch on July 19, the fantastical action-strategy hybrid is getting a demo later today on all platforms the game is available on. The demo will also feature crossover content with Okami in the form of themed weapons and costumes for the main character and the maiden. Interestingly, the Okami stuff will only appear in the demo, but Capcom states that if enough people play it, these items will become available in the full game at launch via an update.</p>

<p>The remaster of the 2006 zombie romp is coming on September 19 (a physical version arrives in November). We got our first look at gameplay and several graphical “before/after” comparison shots showcasing how dramatic the presentational improvements really are. The game will run at 4K 60FPS and features real-time lighting that changes with the time of day. Gameplay improvements include the ability to move while aiming, an autosave feature, a better UI, and improved NPC behavior. Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p>

</article><h2>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard on iOS and Mac</h2>

<p>The latest RE mobile port features improved touched controls and a new auto-aim/auto-fire feature for those who desire extra assistance. Menu and inventory is now touch compatible. Capcom reveals the first section of the game is free-to-play, allowing players to give it a try before committing to a purchase.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, Capcom confirms what was likely already obvious: a new Resident Evil is in development. RE7 director Koshi Nakanishi is apparently back at the helm and stated, "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after 7.&nbsp;But I found it, and to be honest, it feels substantial. I can't share any details just yet, but I hope you're excited for the day I can."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/1/24190280/atar-400-mini-retro-console-deal-sale<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s always worth revisiting the classics, and there’s no shortage of retro consoles and emulators to enable that. The <strong>Atari 400 Mini </strong>is more niche than we’re used to, however, and that’s what makes it so intriguing. The 8-bit retro replica console has dropped to $102 ($18 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CS3VD9TJ/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> in a limited-quantity opportunity that’s nearly halfway claimed.</p><div><p>The Atari 400 Mini is a replica of the retro brand’s first home gaming console. It comes with 25 classic titles with the ability to add more, and with 720p resolution via HDMI, you don’t need to salvage an old CRT from the junkyard for your nostalgic kick.</p></div><p>The Atari 400 was one of the brand’s first home consoles and computers, noted for the inclusion of a keyboard alongside its iconic joystick. It launched in 1979, which probably explains why I haven’t heard of most of the games in the lineup (my feet touched the planet in 1988). <em>Asteroids</em>, <em>Star Raiders II</em>, <em>Centipede</em>, and <em>Berzerk</em> ring a bell for me, and I’ve even played a few of them over the years, but there are more in the list of 25 that I was simply too late for (you can find a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24113699/atari-400-mini-hands-on">full lineup in our hands-on here</a>). </p><p>It supports not just Atari 400 games but also emulates titles that launched afterward up to the Atari 5200. If you want more games, you can use one of the console’s five USB ports to sideload extras using a flash drive, provided you have digital copies of them. That port is also where you plug in the classic joystick that comes with it or keyboards, controllers, and other supported peripherals.</p><p>You can play in 720p over HDMI, either in the classic 4:3 aspect ratio that CRT sets of the era were confined to or a “pixel perfect” mode that does a fine job of scaling it for modern displays. There’s even an option to overlay your games with digital scanlines to really sell the effect. You can also rewind gameplay up to 30 seconds, and it supports snapshot saves with up to four slots per game so you never have to lose your progress.</p><p><em>The Verge</em>’s<em> </em>Andrew Webster<em> </em>felt many of the games have aged about as well as they could. Atari’s had plenty of examples to get it right, after all, with so many other retro consoles to reference such as a clone of its own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23841336/atari-2600-plus-compatible-with-7800-cartridges">2600</a> and similar options from long-time rivals like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23439097/sega-genesis-mini-2-astro-city-mini-v-retro-consoles">Sega</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17642236/nes-classic-npd-sales-data-june-2018">Nintendo</a>. You could probably pass if you’re already flush with 8-bit treasure, but it’s a reasonable purchase if you’re looking for something unique and obscure for your collection.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="t9z2VJ">With <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/22381941/beginners-job-subscription-teleport-mount-shadowbringers-endwalker"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a>’s <em>Dawntrail</em> expansion comes more <strong>aether currents</strong> for players to find. These elusive collectables are scattered around the map and you’ll need to find all of them to unlock flying in their respective zones.</p>
<p id="JAnubJ">With 60 total aether currents to find, it can be a daunting task, but we’re here to help you out.</p>
<p id="I9iMPl">[<strong>Ed. note</strong>: We have tried to be considerate of <strong>spoilers </strong>in our guide. Our maps are complete so they do have the <strong>names of the zones and locations of dungeons and trials</strong>. We’ve also separated the fifth and sixth areas with a large image, as the sixth zone had not been revealed in any form (unlike the other areas, which were shown in patch notes). Don’t scroll below that image unless you’re ready to see the final area.]</p>
<hr id="gGAlDU">
<h2 id="1WIPvw"><strong>Aether currents in FFXIV, explained</strong></h2>
<p id="wmqH3c">As usual, in order to unlock <strong>flying </strong>in each new zone, you’ll need to find and<strong> interact with</strong> <strong>10 aether currents, as well as complete five quests</strong>. The four side quests required for aether currents are marked with the usual blue plus sign quest marker and the fifth quest current is a reward for finishing one of the main scenario quests in the area (usually towards the end of your stint in said area).</p>
<p id="930cyC">Usually you can use your Aether Compass in your key items to tell you how many yalms away the closest current is. If you don’t want to deal with that, you can just use our maps for an easy peasy hunt. Your Aether Compass can still be found in your “collections” menu, under the “duty” tab, if you want to find currents as Yoshi-P intended.</p>
<p id="QGthtu">We list the <em>Dawntrail </em>zones in order you encounter them, though since there are diverging paths to take, some of them, like Kozama’uka and Urqopacha, are interchangable.</p>
<p id="jRV1iN">Below we list our aether currents<strong> in the order they appear in the aether current menu from left to right</strong>, that way if you’re missing one, you’ll know which one you need without having to use your Aether Compass. That being said, we don’t recommend grabbing these in the order they’re numbered, but rather just grabbing whatever is closest to you as you adventure through these new maps.</p>
<hr id="dSU53t">
<h2 id="T47JZN"><strong>Kozama’uka aether current locations</strong></h2>
<p id="cDPub5">Note that you’ll only be able to get half of these currents on your first visit to Kozama’uka. You’ll get the other five when you return here to the southern half of the map later.</p>

The new remaster is set to update some of the textures, improve the lighting, and even add a new flashlight option, too. That all sounds good, and I’m excited to see yet another old <em>Star Wars</em> game brought to more modern platforms. However, seeing <em>Bounty Hunter </em>get the remaster treatment made me think about <em>Obi-Wan</em> on Xbox, a game that launched just a year before<em> Bounty Hunter </em>that’s still trapped on the original Xbox console over 20 years after its release. </p><p>In 2001, two years after the release of <em>Star Wars: The Phantom Menace</em>, Lucasarts released <em>Star Wars: Obi-Wan</em> as an exclusive game for the Xbox. This third-person action game starred, you guessed it, Obi-Wan Kenobi and was both a prequel to and retelling of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-episode-1-phantom-menace-25th-anniversary-1851489367&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-episode-1-phantom-menace-25th-anniversary-1851489367"><em>Phantom Menace</em> film</a></span>. </p><p>It’s not a great game, to be clear. But it featured some interesting ideas—like using the right stick for lightsaber combat—and offered a fun way to experience the first <em>Star Wars</em> prequel before<em> Attack of the Clones</em> hit theaters in 2002. Besides, it’s not like<em> Bounty Hunter</em> is an incredible video game, either. Yet it’s getting a new remaster (after being released on PS4 as a PS2 classic already), while <em>Obi-Wan </em>on Xbox is left behind. </p><h2 id="h96972"><a id=""></a>How to play Star Wars: Obi-Wan in 2024</h2><p><em>Star Wars: Obi-Wan</em> never got a PC port, was never released on PS2, and has never been updated to support backward compatibility on Xbox One or Series X/S. If you want to play Obi-Wan you have one good option and one bad option. </p><p>The good option: You go buy an OG Xbox and a copy of <em>Obi-Wan</em>. Set it up and there you go, you’re playing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Obi-Wan&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Obi-Wan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Star Wars: Obi-Wan</em></a></span>. Well, that’s assuming the Xbox you bought works properly and the copy of the game you got isn’t too damaged. (Luckily pre-owned copies of the game aren’t very expensive, so if you have to buy two of them it won’t break the bank.)</p><p>The bad option is emulation. I love emulating games! I’m not against it at all and I think fan-developed emulators are an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/so-called-pirates-are-doing-the-work-when-publishers-fa-1846533244&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/so-called-pirates-are-doing-the-work-when-publishers-fa-1846533244">important part of game preservation</a></span>. So when I say emulating <em>Obi-Wan</em> is bad, I want to be clear that it’s not because I’m against playing old games using third-party software. No, playing <em>Obi-Wan </em>on an Xbox emulator is bad because it sucks and is (as of this writing) not a great experience. </p><p>If you play on CXBX-Reloaded, a fan-made Xbox emulator, you might be able to make it through the game, but many players have reported crashes, graphical bugs, and other problems that spoil the experience. I’ve also tried to play Obi-Wan on XEMU, a different Xbox emulator, and had even worse luck—I couldn’t get past the second level. While some players have been able to tinker enough to get <em>Obi-Wan </em>running well on CXBX, it’s still not an ideal way to play the game. </p><h2 id="h96973"><a id=""></a>Help me Lucasfilm Games, you’re my only hope</h2><p>So now, here’s my plea: Someone at Lucasfilm Games, please contact Nightdive Studios, Aspyr, or another developer that’s good at reviving old games and pay them the money to bring <em>Star Wars: Obi-Wan </em>to more platforms. </p><p>Cleaned up and running at 60FPS, <em>Obi-Wan </em>would be a solid hit on consoles like the Switch. Plus the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-anakin-skywalker-hayden-christensen-ahsoka-1850403820&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-anakin-skywalker-hayden-christensen-ahsoka-1850403820"><em>Star Wars</em> prequels are currently experiencing a renaissance</a></span> among fans who grew up watching the films. Excitement for prequel-era content is at an all-time high in 2024 and I think a well-done <em>Obi-Wan</em> port or remaster would be a slam dunk. </p><p>And if that’s not possible, at the very least it would be nice to get the game ported to PC so fans can keep updating it and modding it easily for years to come. Or someone at Xbox flip the switch and make this thing backwards compatible on Xbox One and Series X/S consoles. I’d take that at this point! </p><p>But what I really want is a nice remaster. It would save a part of video game history and rescue a <em>Star Wars</em> game from being forgotten. It’s really a win-win situation and it’s about time Obi-Wan gets the remaster he deserves. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/developers-of-digital-ttrpg-fablecraft-announce-homebrew-tools</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/developers-of-digital-ttrpg-fablecraft-announce-homebrew-tools.916539/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/developers-of-digital-ttrpg-fablecraft-announce-homebrew-tools<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last year, developer Riftweaver announced <em>Fablecraft</em> will be coming to Early Access on Steam. It is sold as a virtual tabletop TTRPG set in an original fantasy world built into a VTT platform. Now, the developer has announced that <em>Fablecraft</em> homebrew tools are in development.</p>
<h2>The <em>Fablecraft</em> Homebrew Tool Announcement</h2>
<p>The announcement of <em>Fablecraft</em> homebrew tools came in an update post on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2176900/view/4254294498781880878">Steam page</a>. In the post, Riftweaver discussed the tools currently in development alongside quality-of-life improvements to the overall game experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fablecraft-homebrew-music-preview.jpg?itok=-8OSCZs0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fablecraft-homebrew-music-preview.jpg?itok=YjHzWmS9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lot of bases being covered with this.</figcaption></figure><p>The post confirms the first of the <em>Fablecraft</em> homebrew tools will be homebrew music and soundscapes. As the name implies, this feature will allow GMs to upload custom music and sound effects to their game. This custom audio must be in MP3 format and can be up to 20 MB in size. Once uploaded, the tracks can be played from the Jukebox alongside official material.</p>
<p>Riftweaver also confirmed that homebrew battlemap support is coming. The post does mention this feature may not be available during <em>Fablecraft's</em> initial Early Access release, but it will be in active development. The tools will allow the upload of images, as well as walls, terrain, and measurement tools.</p>
<p>The post also hints the developers are working on tools to import battlemaps from third-party applications.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fablecraft-homebrew-battlemap-preview.jpg?itok=fArYvi3a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fablecraft-homebrew-battlemap-preview.jpg?itok=CI9163kz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Needs more gelatinous cubes, but its progress.</figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, the post discusses quality-of-life improvements coming to <em>Fablecraft's</em> Turn Tracker. It's a minor UX change for combat. When it's your turn and you don't immediately act, the tracker and your player token will flash; letting you know it is your turn to move. The tracker will also flash if the GM has paused combat.</p>
<p>Finally, the new update lets players scroll through the initiative order in the Turn Tracker. Just use your mouse wheel to see where you stand each round.</p>
<p><em>Fablecraft</em> will be available on Steam Early Access sometime this summer.</p>

But where will these new characters fall in the pantheon of the series?<br></p><p><em>Dragon Age</em>’s companions are arguably the most well-regarded thing about the franchise, as is pretty standard for BioWare games. It’s got us thinking, who are the best characters in each <em>Dragon Age</em> game? Rather than creating an unwieldy list of 30+ characters spanning the entire series thus far, we decided to break them up between games. If you missed it, we already <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-inquisition-best-characters-dorian-solas-1851559486&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-inquisition-best-characters-dorian-solas-1851559486">ranked <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>’s party</a></span>.

One will die in the opening with almost no ceremony, The other will get sidelined around ten hours in. Bethany, Hawke’s mage sister, easily gets the worst hand out of the two. She gets dragged away by the Circle in one route, becomes a Grey Warden in another, or she dies. Carver, Hawke’s warrior brother, has a similar setup, but he at least has some autonomy and drama in his branching paths. Bethany, meanwhile, is pretty much dragged through the story, with BioWare separating or killing every member of a family in a game ostensibly about familial ties. Bethany is comparatively sweet and understanding whereas her brother is decidedly neither of those things, but BioWare gave her nothing to work with.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b1cbfef99fcb56bd35dcedfcf5db9ba0" data-recommend-id="image://b1cbfef99fcb56bd35dcedfcf5db9ba0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sebastian stares at something off-camera with with the bluest eyes you've ever seen.

Sure, he’s got his own storyline, struggling between whether or not he wants to be the ruler of Starkhaven as the brutal murder of his family has left him  the only living heir. But beyond that, he mostly sways in the background of the main plot, being unwaveringly devout to the church and casting judgment upon others. His biggest contributions are his companion quest, which gives returning companion Leliana a chance to appear, and when he threatens to level the entirety of the city of Kirkwall if you don’t kill a terrorist. Which like, good for standing on your principles, king. But I barely know you. You’re the tagalong friend who awkwardly weighs in from the outskirts of the circle as everyone else is chatting. Go away!<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7e3980cbab0068453bec41315ed4c647" data-recommend-id="image://7e3980cbab0068453bec41315ed4c647" data-format="jpg" data-width="1360" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Carver stands next to Meredith." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Carver stands next to Meredith." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7e3980cbab0068453bec41315ed4c647" data-recommend-id="image://7e3980cbab0068453bec41315ed4c647" data-format="jpg" data-width="1360" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Carver stands next to Meredith." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Carver suffers from most of the same problems Bethany does, but his equivalent to her Circle route is what gives him the upper hand. If you choose to leave him behind on the Deep Roads expedition in <em>Dragon Age 2</em>’s first act, he will choose to join the church’s mage-oppressive military outfit, the Templars. He does this as an act of defiance against his older sibling and it plays into the tension developed throughout the first chunk of the game. After that, he is gone for most of the game much like Bethany, only showing up during climactic moments like a glorified cameo. It’s a shame.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7c3a5a26abd413efa5d3a0c6e71edb03" data-recommend-id="image://7c3a5a26abd413efa5d3a0c6e71edb03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anders stands in front of Karl with his eyes glowing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Anders stands in front of Karl with his eyes glowing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c3a5a26abd413efa5d3a0c6e71edb03" data-recommend-id="image://7c3a5a26abd413efa5d3a0c6e71edb03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anders stands in front of Karl with his eyes glowing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The only returning companion from <em>Dragon Age: Origins </em>is inarguably the most impactful in <em>Dragon Age 2</em>. Anders is a far cry from the wisecracking apostate we met in the <em>Awakening </em>expansion—he’s now a tortured radical after being possessed by the spirit of Justice. He becomes a healer in the city of Kirkwall, growing more and more fanatical as the game goes on and he watches injustice unfold against the mages. Eventually, whether by his own fanaticism or the spirit’s influence, Anders blows up the Kirkwall Chantry, sparking a mage rebellion that changes the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe forever.</p><p>All of that makes him a compelling but divisive character. People love Anders for his tragic angst as much as others hate him for being a terrorist. In most versions of his story, I fall into the former camp. But Anders’ rivalry path, in which you can convince him to turn on and murder the mages he just sought to free, remains one of the most baffling and cowardly decisions BioWare has ever made with the <em>Dragon Age </em>franchise. It technically works within the game’s friendship and rivalry system, in which you can have a friendly or adversarial relationship with your party that can challenge their worldview, but it’s also such an irresponsible moment that is, sadly, par for the course with how <em>Dragon Age </em>tends to “both sides” issues of oppression. As the face of this conflict in <em>Dragon Age</em>, Anders inevitably has to bear the baggage of a series that has never wanted to take a side and failed to make a case for both arguments. And it undermines him and the story of <em>Dragon Age 2</em> in the end.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d367db14a335aad6455a598f6fac6a51" data-recommend-id="image://d367db14a335aad6455a598f6fac6a51" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Varric stands with his titties out in the Hanged Man." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Varric stands with his titties out in the Hanged Man." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d367db14a335aad6455a598f6fac6a51" data-recommend-id="image://d367db14a335aad6455a598f6fac6a51" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Varric stands with his titties out in the Hanged Man." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Good ol’ Varric Tethras’ debut established him as a fan favorite and acted as a springboard for him to be one of the longest-running characters in BioWare’s fantasy series. The dwarven storyteller starts out as a humble businessman looking for a business partner only to get dragged into unprecedented times as the city of Kirkwall becomes a center point for worldwide change. Varric’s ties to the city run deep, but as he becomes estranged with his family, he finds a new one in Hawke and the others. In the end, he’s left alone as the others flee the city, and he stays behind to tell their story to anyone who will listen. It’s funny to think about how what he has to deal with here is like child’s play compared to the places he would go in <em>Inquisition </em>and will go in <em>The Veilguard</em>. But his greatness has small beginnings, and he’s only become greater since we met him as Hawke in <em>Dragon Age 2</em>.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="08bfbe9dcfcd9b923ffc599d1ae301e8" data-recommend-id="image://08bfbe9dcfcd9b923ffc599d1ae301e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="900" data-height="506" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fenris strikes an enemy down with his sword.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Fenris, the lyrium-infused elven ex-slave from the land of the Tevinter Imperium, approaches <em>Dragon Age</em> <em>2</em>’s mage problem as someone who has been the victim of the worst crimes magic can cause in this world. He’s been made into a living weapon at the behest of his mage master, and lost his family, memory, and almost all of his sense of self before escaping to Kirkwall. It’s only natural he’s dismissive and untrusting of mages. If you press him on this, he comes to see the issues with lumping every mage into the same pile as the slavers he knew in Tevinter. Fenris is one of the best examples of how <em>Dragon Age 2</em>’s friendships and rivalries can diverge in life-altering ways, and the delicious angst that comes with romancing him as rival mage Hawke is unmatched. He operates on an extreme in a game that sometimes has trouble dealing with the nuances of the conflict it centers on, but his relationship is most rewarding when you try to help him see the gray in between the black and white.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ca570dcd0d3638367c8443472bdf1472" data-recommend-id="image://ca570dcd0d3638367c8443472bdf1472" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aveline holds her sword with a distressed expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aveline holds her sword with a distressed expression." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ca570dcd0d3638367c8443472bdf1472" data-recommend-id="image://ca570dcd0d3638367c8443472bdf1472" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aveline holds her sword with a distressed expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Kirkwall’s Captain of the Guard is probably the most grounded of <em>Dragon Age 2</em>’s companions. She’s not a radical mage, a swash-buckling pirate on the lookout for her next adventure, or a blood mage consorting with a demon. Aveline’s just a woman trying to get by and comfortably sleep at night. She starts as a member of the City Guard before her sense of honesty kicks in and she uncovers corruption in her ranks, leading to her ascending to the role of Captain. But even as she climbs the ladder of city defense, her story doesn’t escalate in scale, instead staying endearing and lowkey. Some of the most memorable moments in <em>Dragon Age 2</em> are the quiet ones away from all the political strife, and Aveline’s painfully awkward attempt at courting her husband-to-be remains an incredible sequence that perfectly pulls off how even the strongest among us can be as vulnerable and clumsy as anyone else. She is a woman of multitudes, the beating heart of Hawke’s team, and a shining beacon for the idea of using what time you have in this life to do right by others.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e068ed121e2d35cfc97f1ee9fa14b562" data-recommend-id="image://e068ed121e2d35cfc97f1ee9fa14b562" data-format="jpg" data-width="3200" data-height="1800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Isabela holds a dagger in bed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Isabela holds a dagger in bed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e068ed121e2d35cfc97f1ee9fa14b562" data-recommend-id="image://e068ed121e2d35cfc97f1ee9fa14b562" data-format="jpg" data-width="3200" data-height="1800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Isabela holds a dagger in bed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Conversely, Isabela starts out as a scheming pirate who is so cool you want to be like her when you grow up. The rogue is cunning, promiscuous, and a bit brash, but she is also one of the series’ best-written companions. Isabela is always found at the Hanged Man bar, tossing back drinks&nbsp;and ready to read anyone around her to filth, but she is nurturing, wise, and loyal to a fault…if you help her get there.</p><p>Isabela can leave the party if she and Hawke aren’t close enough by the end of Act 2, but if you’ve either shown that you’re just as much a free spirit as she is or have berated her for the errors of her disloyal ways, she shows back up in a big damn hero moment ready to save the day. Then you have to fight for her life (or give her up, if you’re a bastard) and it’s all very romantic. While Isabela is technically an optional companion in <em>Dragon Age 2</em>, her actions play a big part in the setup for the political turmoil happening in Kirkwall. When she’s not there, her absence is felt, and when she is there, she makes sure everyone knows she’s the star of the show. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="91fa709745775ff1d0e3dfaebb5cae32" data-recommend-id="image://91fa709745775ff1d0e3dfaebb5cae32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Merrill sits at a table with candles lit and a book in front of her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Merrill sits at a table with candles lit and a book in front of her." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="91fa709745775ff1d0e3dfaebb5cae32" data-recommend-id="image://91fa709745775ff1d0e3dfaebb5cae32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Merrill sits at a table with candles lit and a book in front of her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Across BioWare’s catalog, there probably isn’t a character with more emotional range than Merrill, the Dalish blood mage. When Hawke first meets her, she seems young and innocent, but it becomes clear she’s viewed in contempt by her elven clan. It becomes clear shortly after that she has been working with a demon and using the much-reviled blood magic. Even as she casts spells that would be taboo elsewhere in the world, she is still somehow one of the most light-hearted and humorous characters in the entire series. Merrill is the sweetest character in Hawke’s crew, even as she is berated by just about everyone else for her “crimes” of using blood magic. Though it would be easy to make her come off like an abused puppy, she is steadfast in her decisions, as she believes she can use this magic for the good of the Dalish people by restoring a piece of their history.</p><p>Merrill’s conviction leads her and those around her down devastating paths, and her story is one of the most frustratingly complex situations Hawke deals with in their story because every decision and outcome feels painful for everyone involved. Ultimately there is no happy ending for someone who consorts with demons, nor for people who distrusted her so much that they couldn’t let her face the consequences. But Merrill is subversive, tragic, and somehow, still a joy to know.</p><hr><p><em>Dragon Age 2</em> was always the most divisive game in BioWare’s fantasy series, but <em>The Veilguard </em>seems to draw pretty heavily from it. It has an action-oriented approach, brings back <em>DA2</em>’s three-route dialogue system, and slims down the party. Overall, it looks like it’s learning some of the right lessons from the 2011 RPG. We’ll see if its characters live up to this merry band of misfits when <em>The Veilguard </em>launches this fall.<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you’re a fan of eSports, there’s nothing quite like the frantic, chaotic gameplay witnessed during a Call of Duty League Championship. A handful of top-tier teams go head-to-head for the crown, but only one can win the championship. Here are what teams we’ll see at the Call of Duty League Championship 2024!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-teams-are-playing-in-the-call-of-duty-league-championship">What Teams Are Playing in the Call of Duty League Championship?</h2>



<p>Currently, there are eight pro eSports teams participating in the Call of Duty League Championship 2024, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Faze</li>



<li>Heretics</li>



<li>Subliners</li>



<li>Surge</li>



<li>Ultra</li>



<li>Thieves</li>



<li>Optic</li>



<li>Guerrillas</li>
</ul>

<p>We should note that Subliners, hailing from New York, previously won the Call of Duty League 2024 Major 4, making them a top contender and leading choice for this recent Championship tournament.</p>

<h2 id="h-where-to-watch-call-of-duty-league-championships">Where to Watch Call of Duty League Championships</h2>



<p>Being eSports, of course, this is a rather exclusive event. You can’t just watch the entire match live on YouTube or Twitch—at least not straight away. If you want to see the action live as it unfolds, you must first the <a href="https://callofdutyleague.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty League website</a>, where you can purchase tickets to watch the Championship Weekend 2024 as it happens.</p>



<p>From the official tournament website, you can purchase tickets to watch the entire match live from the Credit Union of Texas Events Center in Allen, Texas. There will also be a number of watch parties where you can watch the event live from the comfort of your home.</p>



<p>Of course, the official Call of Duty YouTube channel often co-streams the entire event. It’s much easier and more accessible that way!</p>

<p>While you watch eSports on one screen, why not play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-the-first-descendant-multiplayer-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Descendant multiplayer</a> on the other?

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree DLC Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">When Shadow of the Erdtree launched last month, the mod wasn't available because much of the game had changed. Yui needed to ensure that the mod would be the latest build of the game. Now, co-op saves made with the mod can be taken into the expansion, and for the first time ever, it now supports invasions. Players can even fight the Evergaol bosses together now.</p><p dir="ltr">The same moderator shared another message on behalf of Yui on how the new Scadutree Fragment won't affect those using the mod.</p><p dir="ltr">"The DLC has added many new mechanics, interesting edge cases and underlying code changes⁠--some of which would seem mundane to the player⁠--but have required new solutions for them to work correctly," The moderator said. "Fortunately, the Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ashes are very much localized and do not require any special synchronization."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510" rel="nofollow ">Click here</a> to download the seamless co-op mod. However, it is worth mentioning that even though the mod is live, it still has some issues, including not carrying important files. If that happens, users may have to redownload it from<a href="https://github.com/LukeYui/EldenRingSeamlessCoopRelease/releases/tag/v1.7.2" rel="nofollow "> Yui's Github page</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For more Elden Ring news, check out<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/george-r-r-martin-offers-cheeky-response-to-elden-ring-film-rumors/1100-6524609/"> our story detailing George R.R.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grab-3-months-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-for-under-35-at-woot.916500/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/deals/2024/7/1/24190165/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-pc-deal-sale-woot<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="pIwII5">For existing <a href="https://www.polygon.com/best-games/22372750/best-game-pass-games-xbox">Xbox Game Pass subscribers</a> and newcomers alike, Woot has a deal that will get you over 20% off the usual price. Now through the end of the month — or “until sold out,” per Woot’s page — you can pick up <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836599-13142092?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fdigital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836599-13142092?sid=___pl__p_23954206__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026url=https://electronics.woot.com/offers/digital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-1&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:64,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;sid&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;sid&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23954206__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://electronics.woot.com/offers/digital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-1&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> for $34.49 (23% off the $44.99 list price) or one month for $11.79 (saving 21% off the usual $14.99 price). </p>
<p id="iF5O14">If you wanted to stock up for a full year (ie. buying four three-month codes) that’d set you back around $138, which in turns saves around $42 from the usual price. Put another way, that’s buying 12 months of Game Pass Ultimate for the cost of nine months. Note that there’s a limit of 24 codes per customer, so for those that want to go <em>all out</em>, you can enjoy a discounted Game Pass membership from now until July 2030. Maybe that’s overkill, but we’re not ones to judge.</p>

<p id="a9LhQf">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is the top tier of Microsoft’s games subscription service, which allows you unlimited access to a very, very large catalog of games on both Xbox and Windows PC, as well as discounts on titles you want to add to your permanent collection. The Ultimate tier also offers EA Play membership for a selection of that publishers’ catalog, including trials of select games for up to 10 hours each, and access to Xbox Cloud Gaming — perfect for when you’d rather just jump into a game without waiting for a download. Also great if you’d rather play on a not-Xbox device, including mobile and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24187316/xbox-amazon-fire-tv-partnership">(soon) a Fire TV stick</a>.</p>

Looking ahead, you can also check out our recap of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24172090/microsoft-xbox-showcase-june-2024-announcement-reveal">everything announced at the Xbox showcase at Summer Game Fest 2024</a> (Spoiler: Lots of “day one on Game Pass” titles, including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24174798/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-cod-direct"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24171213/doom-dark-ages-microsoft-xbox-games-showcase-sequel"><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></a>).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/let-me-solo-her-beats-erdtree-final-boss<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Holy crap, my fingers are actually trembling"</h2></div><section><p>The Elden Ring community's favorite folk hero, Let Me Solo Her, has finally completed the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, after a streaming marathon spanning multiple days during which he struggled repeatedly against the DLC's final boss.</p><p><strong>Warning: Spoilers for the ending of Shadow of the Erdtree follow below!</strong></p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Final boss is kicking my butt rn <a href="https://t.co/nf4htyip9T" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/nf4htyip9T</a></p>— Let me solo her (@TsuboiKlein) <a href="https://twitter.com/TsuboiKlein/status/1806845328932454784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Tsuboi Klein, also known as Let Me Solo Her, has been steadily working his way through the new Elden Ring DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree with the rest of us. Just yesterday, he finally crossed the finish line, defeating Promised Consort Radahn <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHhR8K2g3No" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live on stream</a> after something in the vicinity of 74 attempts. Despite being thought of as something of an Elden Ring expert, Let Me Solo Her really struggled with the second coming of Radahn, only defeating him after several hours of attempts spaced out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsn2dDyfVUA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over two days</a>. </p><p>"Holy crap, my fingers are actually trembling right now," he said upon victory. "I'm shaking."</p><p>Let Me Solo Her rose to notoriety by offering his summon sign to players struggling to beat the most difficult boss in the base game, Malenia. Wearing nothing more than a pot on his head, Let Me Solo Her has defeated Malenia hundreds of times now on behalf of others. While it might be natural to expect him to breeze through the DLC with skills like that, it's worth noting that Let Me Solo Her got so good at Malenia by practicing her fight <em>a lot</em>. It took him over 200 attempts just to beat her the first time. So it's only natural he'd get good at Radahn with practice, too. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>So is Let Me Solo Her going to master Radahn and help others defeat him now? Probably not just yet. Let Me Solo Her acknowledged at the end of his stream that he had somewhat beelined his way to Radahn and hadn't finished a lot of the other DLC boss fights, so he wants to go back and wrap things up first. He also wants to enjoy the DLC a bit off-stream, too, just for himself. Additionally, he's already been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-rings-let-me-solo-her-is-now-let-me-solo-him-with-dire-consequences-for-messmer-the-impaler">spending his time helping others beat Messmer</a>, another story-required boss fight that many are struggling with. He's even technically rebranded as "Let Me Solo Him" just for that fight. Let Me Solo Her will continue to assist other players with Messmer for a bit longer, he says, before moving on to helping people with Radahn.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I BEAT THE FINAL BOSS LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO <a href="https://t.co/XUxVmAUitB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/XUxVmAUitB</a></p>— Let me solo her (@TsuboiKlein) <a href="https://twitter.com/TsuboiKlein/status/1807193376594534652?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>We <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/let-me-solo-her-elden-ring-community-hero">interviewed Let Me Solo Her</a> two years ago during the height of his fame, and can confirm that he's delightful not just in battle against Malenia and Radahn, but also to speak with. And we <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-hero-let-me-solo-erdtree-dlc-reaction-malenia">caught up with him again</a> ahead of the release of Shadow of the Erdtree to hear his plans for exploring the Land of Shadow. Sounds like that's going great for him.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip? Send it to rvalentine@ign.com.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

From 2-5 PM local time, Tynamo will appear in the wild more frequently than usual, and you'll have a greater chance of encountering a Shiny Tynamo.</p><p>In addition to the increased spawns, a few bonuses will be available during July's Community Day. Lure Modules and Incense will last for three hours rather than their usual durations, and players will earn double the usual amount of candy for catching Pokemon. On top of that, any eggs that are placed into an incubator during the event will hatch at a quarter of the distance they typically require.</p><p>Finally, Tynamo's final form, Eelektross, will be able to learn a special event-exclusive attack during July's Community Day. Any Eelektrik that you evolve until 10 PM local time will learn the electric-type Fast Attack Volt Switch upon evolving.</p>
