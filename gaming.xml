When there's as big a brand as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/the-walt-disney-company">Disney</a>, that has enough money to just kind of throw whatever at the wall and see what sticks, eventually you wind up with something that might make you scratch your head a bit. Today, that thing is Disney Villains Cursed Café, a visual novel where you serve a bevy of potions to various Disney baddies, announced earlier today as part of the final Nintendo Direct for the OG Switch (but yes, it is on PC too - in fact it's already out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2439220/Disney_Villains_Cursed_Caf/">Steam</a>).

<p>
The concept is pretty simple: you are a Potionista, someone that, uh, brews potions, and you run a café frequented by Disney villains from a range of its films. That includes folks like Jafar from Aladdin, Ursula from The Little Mermaid, Gaston from Beauty and the Beast, all of them wearing not exactly casual outfits, but clothing you could see them wearing on the weekend at the very least.

<p>
For the most part gameplay looks simple. Brew a potion, serve them to the villain, listen to their stories. As mentioned it's a visual novel, and the emphasis more seems to be about chatting with Disney villains than anything particularly more complex (not to say that visual novel can't be complex, it's just this one doesn't seem to be).
</p>
<p>
There's just one thing I find a bit icky about it, as has been pointed out by several other people across social media, that being that it kind of seems to be ripping off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/coffee-talk">Coffee Talk</a>. I don't exactly love a giant like the House of Mouse trying to corporate-wash a beloved indie game like that in all honesty. Anyway, Maleficent getting an iPhone is kind of funny I guess.

During one point in the Direct, Nintendo announced that it is changing how digital games work on Switch. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-digital-games-virtual-game-cards-vgc-switch-2-1851772706&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-digital-games-virtual-game-cards-vgc-switch-2-1851772706">Now players will buy Virtual Game Cards</a></span> that can be digitally shared between consoles and other players with some restrictions. This new system will go live in late April and will be compatible with Switch 2 at launch. And on a new website Nintendo created explaining Virtual Game Cards, there’s some fine print hinting at enhanced Switch 2 ports of past games. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lles54qmv527&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lles54qmv527" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by video game deals and news sharer Wario64</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/virtual-game-cards/#:~:text=*Available%20on%20Nintendo,title%20is%20ejected.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/virtual-game-cards/#:~:text=*Available%20on%20Nintendo,title%20is%20ejected." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some fine print at the bottom of this webpage</a></span> mentions something we’ve not heard about before: “Switch 2 Edition” games. These will only be playable on Switch 2 and will likely be enhanced native ports of older titles. </p><p>Here’s the full text with the important bits bolded: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Compatible systems must be linked to a Nintendo Account to use virtual game cards. Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games and<strong> Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games</strong> can only be loaded on a Nintendo Switch 2 system. To move virtual game cards between two systems, you must pair the systems via local wireless and an internet connection, but only when pairing the systems for the first time. Up to two systems total can be linked per Nintendo Account.</p></blockquote><p>Interesting! While we’ve known for a while now that Switch games will be mostly backward compatible with Switch 2, this is the first official mention of the possibility that some older games might get native ports to Switch 2. This will likely work similarly to PS4 games on PS5: most of them play just fine (or even better) on the more powerful hardware, but there are some titles that have received separate, native PS5 ports. For example, <em>Death Stranding</em> on PS4 plays great on PS5.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/234585/#:~:text=If%20you%20already,the%20discounted%20price.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/234585/#:~:text=If%20you%20already,the%20discounted%20price." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> But you can spend $10 to upgrade to the PS5 version which unlocks new visual features and options</a></span>.</p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has contacted Nintendo about this fine print and what it means. </p><p>For now, we can only speculate as to what “Switch 2 Edition” means. One possibility is that some of these Switch 2 Edition games will run at a higher framerate. Recently, dataminers discovered unused 60FPS code in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/544485/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-60-fps-switch-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/544485/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-60-fps-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em></a></span>. Many are theorizing that the game will run at a higher FPS on Switch 2. And that might be true, but perhaps only while playing a theoretical Switch 2 Edition of it. </p><p>Will you have to pay for these native ports? Maybe. Will they support cross-save and crossplay with older versions? Possibly. We don’t know yet, but hopefully we’ll learn more on April 2 during the announced Switch 2-focused Direct. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Earlier today, Ubisoft and Tencent announced a new subsidiary valued at approximately €4 billion ($4.3 billion). Insider Gaming has received Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot’s internal memo on the announcement.</p>



<div><p>It reads,</p><p>“Hello everyone,</p><p>I’m pleased to share an important announcement that will mark a milestone in Ubisoft’s history.</p><p>Following a process to review different strategic options for Ubisoft’s future, we have just signed an exceptional agreement with one of our trusted shareholders, Tencent, with whom we have a solid relationship.</p><p>Their €1.16 billion investment will benefit all of Ubisoft. We will be able to firmly take back control of our future and renew with the serenity needed to create the best games.</p><p>The terms of this partnership are straightforward: we will establish a dedicated subsidiary within Ubisoft that will bring together our three most powerful franchises: Assassin’s Creed, Rainbow Six and Far Cry. This subsidiary will gather the teams working on these brands, primarily in the studios of Montreal, Quebec City, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. Tencent will be a 25% shareholder of this new subsidiary, with the aim of boosting these franchises so they become undisputed global icons.</p><p>This historic agreement is above all a recognition of the extraordinary work you have been doing for years: the value of these three brands directly reflects your individual and collective talent and efforts, which have allowed us to create these beloved franchises.</p><p>This investment will also give us the means to accelerate the changes we’ve been discussing for several months across the group – changes that many of you have been longing for, as revealed by the Ubisoft XP survey. These changes are in line with the initiatives that Marie-Sophie has been sharing recently, which aim to put the creation of unique games and player satisfaction back at the heart of our daily work. This is what will enable us to return to a higher level of profitability.</p><p>This announcement comes at a pivotal time, after the very positive reception of Assassin’s Creed Shadows and the excitement sparked by the announcement of Rainbow 6 Siege X, of which we can be very proud.</p><p>I want to express my deepest gratitude for your resilience, tenacity, courage, and creativity – all the qualities that make Ubisoft a truly unique company and that helped us overcome a challenging period over the last few years.</p></div>



<div><p>The coming months will be dedicated to shaping our next chapter. Of course, this new step in our transformation will raise many questions, including on an individual level. We are committed to keeping you regularly informed, answering your questions, and providing visibility on the next steps.</p><p>I hope you can join the global livestream that will be held tomorrow at 3:30 p.m. CET during which I will share a few words with you. You’ll receive an invitation shortly.</p><p>See you tomorrow, and thank you again,</p><p>Yves”</p></div>



<hr>



<div><p>Understandably, employee’s are now nervous. In a follow-up email, Marie-Sophie de Waubert (Chief Studios &amp; Portfolio Officer) said,</p><p>“Hello everyone,</p><p>I wanted to follow up immediately with all of you in Montreal, Quebec City, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia after Yves’ email regarding the new Business Unit that is being created.</p><p>First and foremost, I want to emphasize that the agreement we announced is a powerful enabler and an exciting opportunity for Ubisoft. It will help us accelerate our evolution and improve how we make games with greater focus and agility.</p><p>Tencent’s investment is a strong testament to their trust in our ability to grow Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. This is a direct result of the incredible work you’ve done in making these franchises iconic, as a lead or major codev studio.</p><p>I also want to be clear: if you’re not currently working on these brands, it doesn’t mean your work matters any less. This agreement will benefit all of Ubisoft, giving us the means to spark more innovation and creativity across the board. This marks the beginning of a new chapter, and you play a vital role in shaping it.</p><p>In the coming weeks and months, we will work hard to build the best organization possible – for Ubisoft, for our teams, and for our players.</p><p>Of course, this brings some uncertainty and questions. Right now, we may not have all the detailed answers, but we are committed to communicating with you transparently and regularly. Supporting you through this transition is the top priority for your local and your global leadership teams. Don’t hesitate to reach out to them and stay tuned locally; usual or dedicated “studio times” will be also good forums to keep you updated and answer your questions.”</p></div>

<p>In an internal email to staff that has been acquired by Insider Gaming, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said that the move will “mark a milestone in Ubisoft’s history”.</p>



<p>“This historic agreement is above all a recognition of the extraordinary work you have been doing for years: the value of these three brands directly reflects your individual and collective talent and efforts, which have allowed us to create these beloved franchises,” Guillemot said.</p>

<p>De Waubert did admit that the news will bring “some uncertainty and questions” for many within Ubisoft. Despite not having all of the answers “right now”, she said in the email that management is “committed to communicating with [employees] transparently and regularly.”</p>

For now, we’re only sharing a small glimpse into a vast game, and I can’t wait for the community to see what’s coming over the next few months.”</p><p>Producer Rosie Ball added, “Embracing a four-day work week and a firm no-crunch policy has been a huge part of realizing our approach to game development – that the team feels valued, rested and supported. We know creativity flourishes in a healthy work environment, and we’re confident that the mindful and deliberate pace of <em>Witchbrook</em> delivers this experience to the players.”</p><p>Art director Steph Caskenette said, “<em>Witchbrook</em> is our love letter to thoughtful living, the quiet magic of slow moments, and the connections we share with each other and the world around us. Whether players are exploring solo or sharing in the adventure, we hope Witchbrook becomes a space to relax and make lasting memories.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Chucklefish:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1uPFqvuRRej3UoemTIgVLH/18f1d055777e1b39a3f79a951452b9e1/2025.03.27_-_Press_Release_vfinal.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced a major change</a> to its organization as it looks to the future, as the company has created a new "dedicated subsidiary" focused on three main franchises: Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. Tencent is investing €1.16 billion ($1.25 billion USD) to take a minority stake (about 25%) in this new subsidiary.</p><p>Ubisoft said the parts of its business that are not included in this new entity, including The Division and Ghost Recon, along with development of certain new IP, will continue in parallel. However, it's unknown to what extent these changes could result in potential layoffs or studio closures.</p><p>"This new subsidiary will focus on building game ecosystems designed to become truly evergreen and multi-platform. Backed by greater investment and boosted creative capacities, it will drive further increases in quality of narrative solo experiences, expand multiplayer offerings with increased frequency of content release, introduce free-to-play touchpoints, and integrate more social features," Ubisoft said.</p><p>Tencent emerged as the winner following a "competitive process" under which Ubisoft considered different "strategic options." It was previously reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-horribly-managed-investor-says-report-claims-ea-and-microsoft-might-buy-franchises/1100-6530071/" data-ref-id="1100-6530071">Microsoft and EA were in the mix in some capacity.</a></p><p>Alongside the announcement of this new business entity, Ubisoft said it will "focus on nurturing" some of its other franchises, including Ghost Recon and The Division, while also continuing to make new IP and building out its game engine technologies and online services. Ubisoft said it will share more information "at a later stage."</p><p>Ubisoft co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot said this marks a "new chapter" in Ubisoft's history, calling this a "foundational step in changing Ubisoft's operating model."</p><p>"With the creation of a dedicated subsidiary that will spearhead development for three of our largest franchises and the onboarding of Tencent as a minority investor, we are crystalizing the value of our assets, strengthening our balance sheet, and creating the best conditions for these franchises' long-term growth and success," Guillemot said.</p><p>Tencent president Martin Lau said, "We see the immense potential for these franchises to evolve into long-term evergreen game platforms and create engaging new experiences for gamers."</p><p>In terms of further specifics, the new subsidiary includes the development teams working on Rainbow Six, Assassin's Creed, and Far Cry in Montreal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. Ubisoft said it also includes any new games in those places under development currently or that are made in the future, along with back catalog titles from those teams. This new subsidiary is getting rights to the Rainbow Six, Assassin's Creed, and Far Cry franchises in exchange for an unspecified royalty payment.</p><p>It's been a tumultuous past year for Ubisoft even prior to this, as the company's cost-cutting efforts have included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">mass layoffs and studio closures</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210">shutdown of XDefiant.</a></p><p>Ubisoft's latest big release was Assassin's Creed Shadows, which debuted on March 20, quickly reaching 3 million players and collecting strong reviews from critics.</p>

            <p>
Naughty Dog's Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet won't launch before 2027, according to one of gaming's more credible distributors of gossip and speculation. That's fine, because they haven't announced the sci-fi action-adventure for PC yet. Here's the reveal trailer again, in case you missed it.

<p>
The aforesaid "credible distributor of gossip and speculation" is Jason Schreier, author of whole entire books of insider journalism - he's been <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot45-game-of-the-year-edition.1093518/page-284#post-137487981">spilling the beans on Resetera</a>. I have recently become aware of this "book" phenomenon. My understanding is that a "book" is a jailbroken iPad consisting of pounded cobwebs that must be physically gripped and "turned" using Wiimote-style gyroscopic finger inputs.</p>
<p>Journalism contained by books tends to undergo more stringent fact-checking and, as such, enjoys a higher status than the traditional video game information vehicle of a salacious username on Reddit that was accidentally right about one of 12 "leaks" three years ago, and has been duly promoted to internet Cassandra. What I am laboriously saying is that I trust Schreier the Bookman rather more than user TurboJackoff69 who once correctly predicted the coming of rightward-sloping laptop vents. Oh yeah, and Schreier also writes for Bloomberg. They're pretty credible too.
</p>
<p>
Intergalactic is set thousands of years in the future, and casts you as a bounty hunter stranded on a forgotten planet full of ancient religion and blade-o-bots. It's been in development since 2020, and apparently takes inspiration from Akira and Cowboy Bebop, which are a bit "chalk and cheese" as anime influences go. I mean, Bebop has darker moments, but it's not quite doing experiments on psychic children, is it.  
</p>
<p>
Anyway, a key goal of Intergalactic is making the player feel lost and alone, which is great news for those of us who feared that Naughty Dog might pivot back to Drakish quipfire after all the sexy heartache of The Last Of Us.</p>
<p>"I really want you to be lost in a place that you're really confused about what happened here, [about] who are the people here, what was their history," Neil Druckmann <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA">told</a> 28 Days Later director Alex Garland earlier this month (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-hate-directed-at-the-last-of-us-part-2-naughty-dog-boss-says-next-game-about-the-entirely-uncontroversial-topics-of-faith-and-religion">Eurogamer</a>). Player character Jordan A. Mun doesn't even have any friends to banter with, though I personally wouldn't rule out Naughty Dog introducing a robot pal. Perhaps you'll talk to it about matters of faith. In my experience, it's harder to do top bantz when there's religion involved. 
</p>
<p>
It has taken Naughty Dog five long years to bring The Last Of Us: Part 2 to PC - look out for it on 3rd April. It seems likely that Intergalactic will be a key PS6 launch game - as such, I wouldn't be surprised if it takes even longer to escape consoledom. Still, Sony launched <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> on PC and PS5 simultaneously and that made a heck of a lot of money. Perhaps when 2027 swings around they'll be more open to the idea of a same-day release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you’re an anime enthusiast as well, you may have had your eye on <em>AI Limit</em>, which costs only $35. This may leave you wondering how long of a journey the game offers and whether it’s worth investing in.

Yes, this is partially because it poses a hell of a challenge (meaning you’ll die a lot), but it’s also packed with just as many locations and bosses as many far more expensive games in the soulslike genre. </p><p>Because of the difficulty, especially in regards to the many bosses you’ll encounter, how long it takes you to finish the game will be somewhat skill-dependent. However, <strong>an average playthrough is likely to take around 20 hours</strong>. This includes reaching the final boss without completing every side-quest or searching every nook and cranny.</p><p>But completionists can certainly get more from the game, especially those looking to score every achievement it has to offer. You’ll need to complete a rather large selection of cryptic NPC quests, including some that interweave and are dependent on one another.

By doing this, you’ll be able to go back through and grab any missed weapons, spells, NPC quests, and so on. More importantly, you’ll be able to set yourself up for different endings. <strong>Doing all of this can easily net you upwards of 40 hours worth of gameplay in <em>AI Limit</em></strong>. </p><p>Again, how much time you ultimately get out of <em>AI Limit</em> will depend at least partially on your skill level and whether you reference any guides for helping you find any particularly well-hidden secrets. But either way, there’s quite a lot of soulslike goodness to enjoy in this anime-infused adventure!</p><hr><p><br><em>AI Limit</em> is available now for PS5 and PC.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Megamix featured 70 returning games and 30 brand new games, and until now was the best and most comprehensive place to play Rhythm Heaven. The series itself has long been beloved for its fun, intuitive rhythm mini-games and delightful original music by Japanese singer Tsunku and Nintendo composer Masami Yone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, Tsunku was listed on the Rhythm Heaven Groove splash screen as returning to compose once again.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/pillars-of-eternity-is-getting-turn-based-combat-all-but-demanding-replays/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<h2>More than just rolling for initiative</h2>
<p>Obsidian <a href="https://fextralife.com/pillars-of-eternity-2-deadfire-turn-based-combat-mechanics-explained/">added a turn-based mode</a> to&nbsp;<em>Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</em> in patch 4.1, roughly eight months after the game's initial release. Designer Josh Sawyer, who worked on&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate II&nbsp;</em>and directed&nbsp;both&nbsp;<em>PoE</em> games, said in a 2023<a href="https://toucharcade.com/2023/10/18/pentiment-anniversary-interview-josh-sawyer-on-hi%5B%E2%80%A6%5Ding-a-potential-pillars-of-eternity-3-rpg-mechanics-and-more/"> interview with Touch Arcade</a> that the real-time systems in the <em>PoE</em>&nbsp;games were largely a concession to the old-school CRPG fans that crowdfunded both games.</p>
<p>Turn-based was Sawyer's stated preference, and he thinks <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> largely put an end to the debate in modern times:</p>
<blockquote><p>I just think it’s easier to design more intricate combats. I like games with a lot of stats, obviously. (He laughs). But the problem with real time with pause is that it’s honestly very difficult for people to actually parse all of that information, and one of the things I’ve heard a lot from people who’ve played <em>Deadfire</em> in turn based, is that there were things about the game like the affliction and inspiration system that they didn’t really understand very clearly until they played it in turn based.</p></blockquote>
<p>But both&nbsp;<em>Pillars&nbsp;</em>games were designed with real-time combat in mind, such that, even with his appreciation for the turn-based addition to&nbsp;<em>PoE 2</em>, Sawyer knows "the game wasn't designed for it," he told Touch Arcade. This is almost certainly going to be the case, too, for the original&nbsp;<em>PoE</em>, but there could be lessons learned from&nbsp;<em>PoE 2</em>'s transformation to apply. Other games from that era might also lure folks like me back, though perhaps they, too, have a density of encounters and maps that just can't cut it for turn-based.</p>
<p>Beyond this notably big "patch" coming to the original&nbsp;<em>PoE</em>, the 10th anniversary patch should make it easier for Mac and Linux (through Proton) users to stay up to date on bug fixes, and for players on GOG and Epic to get Kickstarter rewards and achievements. Lots of audio and visual effects were fixed up, along with a whole heap of mechanical and combat fixes.</p>

                <p>Despite everything, Undertale is now 10 years old. To celebrate the momentous occasion, a one-night-only orchestral concert, The Determination Symphony, has been announced. Those looking to <a href="http://www.eventimapollo.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">purchase tickets</a> for the exclusive event--which will take place at London's Eventim Apollo on June 22, 2025--can do so starting tomorrow, March 28, at 6 AM ET.</p><p>According to the event's press release, the concert will run for approximately two hours and will encompass Undertale's 10-year history, taking fans on a journey from "the initial fall at Mount Ebott, and leading them through Froggit Village, the Snowdin Temple, Temmie Village, and so much more." Accompanying this adventure is a 25-piece orchestra that will be performing developer Toby Fox's original music, which has received unending praise and critical-acclaim throughout the past decade. This praise includes that given in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/undertale-review-nintendo-switch-update/1900-6416315/" data-ref-id="1900-6416315">Undertale review</a>, in which we wrote, "Undertale's soundtrack has timeless appeal and is great at evoking emotions."</p><p>Lambert Jackson Productions, the London-based studio behind the Oliver award-nominated play Cruise, will be heading production for The Determination Symphony. The event is scheduled to take place at the Eventim Apollo (formerly the Hammersmith Apollo), one of London's premiere theaters.</p><p>In other Undertale news, the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/undertale-sees-new-peak-for-steam-concurrent-players-nearly-a-decade-after-launching/1100-6530156/" data-ref-id="1100-6530156">recently broke its own Steam record</a> for concurrent players.

Last October, Fox confirmed that Undertale follow-up Deltarune's next chapters will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-will-definitely-be-released-in-2025-toby-fox-says/1100-6527507/" data-ref-id="1100-6527507">released some time in 2025</a>. The first two chapters of Deltarune are currently available for free on PC, PS4, and Switch.</p>

		<p>Nintendo revealed the return of two of their oddball game series, with Rhythm Heaven Groove and Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream both coming to Nintendo Switch in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rhythm Heaven Groove – Nintendo Direct 3.27.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkgjFacpnLE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new entry in the Rhythm Heaven series is sticking to some very familiar ideas for the series. This is all about pressing buttons at just the right time, matching the specific beat that the game is giving you with some quirkily animated scenes as you get things right (or a little bit wrong).</p>
<p>The first new game since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/10/28/rhythm-paradise-megamix-review/">Rhythm Heaven Megamix</a> in 2015 (which was a bit of a best of collection for 3DS), Rhythm Heaven Groove will continue the series’ traditional partnerships with Nintendo and TNX co-developing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream – Nintendo Direct 3.27.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dvo1V7DWYsA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And then there’s Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, bringing your Mii out of semi-retirement and sending them off to an idyllic seaside town to go about their lives, hanging out with other Miis and completing certain tasks to earn rewards. There’s also some thoroughly weird moments, like the dream sequence with a giant Mii running along to interrupt a dream – it looks like we’ll still get to experience Mii dreams here, and it’s a neat tie in with the game’s subtitle.</p>

<p>After the original game on DS, Tomodachi Life was an off-beat hit for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013. There were other Mii-based spin-offs like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/miitomo">Miitomo</a> on mobile and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/miitopia">Miitopia</a>, but the main Tomodachi Life experience is now being revived after well over a decade.<sup id="cite_ref-65"></sup></p>
<p>I guess Miis are still going to be relevant for a few more years, as well…</p>

            <p>
A few months on from releasing into early access, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/greedfall-2">Greedfall 2: The Dying World</a> has received its first major update, and it certainly seems like a fairly big one. First up, there's a whole new region to explore called "Olima, City of Stars", and I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume that it has nothing to do with that guy from Pikmin. Its name actually comes from the fact there's a big ole observatory to be found there, though what that entails, you'll have to find out for yourself.
</p>

<p>
There's also a new companion arriving with this update, Safia, an "anti-imperialist… seasoned explorer". Not played any <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/greedfall">Greedfall</a> myself, but I'm always down for taking down empires. Rifles seem to be her whole shtick, assisting you in battle with them, and there's an implication that you can learn how to use them yourself from her.

<p>
This update also comes with a place called the Hub, located on your own ship ("not a boat" developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/spiders">Spiders</a> makes sure to point out, for some reason), once you've acquired one anyway. While on the Hub you can get ready for your next journey, have a natter with companions, and there's also plans to allow you to buy materials from merchants, view romance scenes (wink wink), and more further down the line.
</p>
<p>
Combat has supposedly seen some improvements now too, in a few different ways overall it's looking smoother, faster, and a bit cleaner too. Spiders offered a more detailed look at how combat has changed <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1997660/announcements/detail/543352686106378873?snr=1_5_9_">earlier this week</a>.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of that there's a new disguise system, more regional quests, newly introduced companion quests, a higher level cap, a respec consumable, refreshed UI, and just a whole bunch of bug fixes. Happy Greedfalling!

The latest entry in the fighting game franchise that eventually spun off <em>King of Fighters</em> is out April 24 on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC, and can count having the weirdest crossover fighter of all time among its distinctions. </p><p>But the funniest part about Ronaldo being in the next <em>Fatal Fury</em> is that it only vaguely looks like him and seems to be voiced by someone else entirely. At least it doesn’t look as bad as his bronze statue: </p><p>Ronaldo was previously <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-58528893&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-58528893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accused of rape in 2009</a></span> but reached a settlement with the alleged victim and claimed he was innocent, even though she later came out publicly about the allegations following the 2019 #metoo movement. Why is he now in, of all things, a deep cut 2D fighter from Japanese arcade gaming’s past? It’s probably not just because the developers one day saw players in the <em>Fatal Fury </em>community having fun and decided to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PsychoSWeasel/status/1837901224298889454&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PsychoSWeasel/status/1837901224298889454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turn those meme dreams into reality</a></span>. </p><p>Ronaldo plays for Al Nassr FC  after agreeing to take leave of Europe and help sportswash Saudi Arabia’s bad human rights record in exchange for over $200 million. Al Nassr FC is 75 percent owned by the Saudi royal investment fund which also happens to have a 96 percent controlling stake in<em> Fatal Fury</em> makers SNK. <br></p><p>“We’re not a political company or anything like that, so it doesn’t affect us in any way,” SNK designer and producer  Yasuyuki Oda said of the Saudi investment when questioned&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/snk-lead-insists-saudi-arabia-sale-will-have-no-effect-on-the-games-we-make/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/snk-lead-insists-saudi-arabia-sale-will-have-no-effect-on-the-games-we-make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by<em> VGC</em></a></span> back in 2022. “It has no–<em>no</em>–effect on our creative output. We have full freedom on what we want to create.” Hmmm.</p><p>I had the chance to play <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> at Summer Game Fest last year and it was shaping up nicely, with a cool comic book art style and a new combat system to give players more offensive options from the start of each match. I can’t say I’m looking forward to playing as Ronaldo, but him being in the game also means getting to beat up on anyone who main’s him. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
