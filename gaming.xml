                <p dir="ltr"><a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ready-or-not/news/">Ready or Not</a> developer VOID Interactive faced backlash in June for "censoring" the game to comply with the console certification process. The developer has defended its choices as not fundamentally altering Ready or Not's violence or its grim tone, but instead making minimal alterations to <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ready-or-not-censoring-content-to-get-certified-for-console-release-upsetting-fans/1100-6532917/">ensure compliance with the requirements of other platforms</a>. In the wake of the backlash, VOID Interactive has released a new statement that clarifies exactly what content has been altered, going as far as to include "before" and "after" images to illustrate changes.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/526472884483263337?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> emphasizes that no major changes have come to Ready or Not's shootouts. Players can still sever the limbs of foes with gunfire and it still includes plenty of blood and guts. However, players can no longer dismember the dead bodies of enemies. Elsewhere, the update removes nudity, softens an allusion to child sexual-abuse material, and replaces a convulsing NPC with a sleeping one. The statement elaborates, "The effects of gore and violence -- key to the game’s immersive realism -- have not been toned down...we’ve only made changes where absolutely required, and only to the letter of the regulations -- no further."</p><p dir="ltr">The statement has not halted the backlash. Portions of the game's community has continued to review bomb Ready or Not. While the overall rating is steady at "very positive," recent reviews have plummeted to "mostly negative." Multiple reviewers claim the changes have had a dramatic effect on the game's tone. One says, "It now feels like just another generic tactical shooter, weighed down by clunky AI and stripped of the atmosphere that set it apart." Other reviews find the controversy incredibly silly, with one reviewer advising the aggrieved to "touch grass."</p><p dir="ltr"><a dir="ltr" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">Ready or Not</a> is still on discount as part of the Steam Summer Sale. The base game is available for $25 and a bundle including DLC is $39. The game comes to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on July 15.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/islanders-new-shores-review-desire-lines</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/islanders-new-shores-review-desire-lines.1238532/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Islanders</em>! Very much an underseen gem of a game when you consider the amount of cozy, pastel, pseudo-wholesome games you can come across in one sitting. Still, its addictive, albeit temperamental gameplay loop is enough to feast on for a while, and that’s in spite of its sneaky scoring mechanics. Seems like UK-based developers Coatsink think so as well, which is why <em>Islanders: New Shores</em> is here to build bridges to new worlds.</p>

<p>In tandem with Thunderful Publishing, <em>Islanders: New Shores</em> ups the ante with new islands and reinforced mechanics. It’s still the same minimalist city builder that became a hit to begin with, but Coatsink and new developer The Station have paid attention to how it all fares in magnification, as opposed to the quick bursts that the original <em>Islanders </em>relished in so thoroughly. The result is a game looking to the future, as <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/islanders-new-shores-launches-july-10" rel="nofollow">a hefty roadmap was published pre-release to show what's in store for <em>New Shores</em>.</a></p>

<p>Gameplay is as follows: you are presented with small, deserted islands, and a choice between what is essentially two booster packs. Pick one, and you’re given a handful of resources and buildings you can place around the island, ranging from houses and facilities to nature generation and manipulation. If you’re able to reach a score threshold before you exhaust the booster pack, you unlock another pack, and if you do it enough times on one island, you’re able to travel to the next island to do it over again.</p>



<p>Despite the game saying you can travel to the next island as soon as you reach said threshold, there’s no worthwhile reason to do so. The main objective of the game is to accrue as many points as possible, and there’s no bonus for simply dipping – on the contrary, in fact, as those numbers add up into fairly hefty chunks in the aftermath. It’s also where most of <em>Islanders</em>’ magic is shown off, and in <em>New Shores</em>, that’s only been exemplified even more.</p>

<p>Once the final possible piece is laid down, there’s a chance for the HUD to remove itself, and the game simply orbits around your current island, lights coming on as the day dims, and it soothes. Compared to the original <em>Islanders</em>, <em>New Shores</em> is much warmer and moodier, bringing with it a photo mode which, while heavily restrictive in opportunities present at time of writing, extracts enough of what’s possible in-game.</p>

<p>It’s quite an achievement to let macrocosms hit so thoroughly, but <em>New Shores</em> manages to do it every time, even as the islands get bigger and more robust. While citing inspirations like <em>SimCity </em>and <em>Bad North</em> for the original <em>Islanders </em>release in 2019, part of me believes that 2021’s <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/loop-hero" rel="nofollow"><em>Loop Hero</em></a> may have played a hand in how <em>New Shores</em> presents itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early on in your adventure, you’ll have to unlearn the possibility of letting aesthetics and efficiency share the limelight, a harsh lesson that may make or break how you perceive the game’s flow sometimes. Despite many of the pieces in <em>New Shores</em> having the potential to stack into each other like it’s <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tetris-effect" rel="nofollow"><em>Tetris</em></a>, a lot of the time, the game will not allow it without wasting precious space.</p>

<p>The other trick you’ll have to learn is how houses and mansions differentiate from each other, as in what is incidentally an ingenious little nugget of class commentary, the two do not intermix well at all. The mansions yearn for diamonds, markets, and monuments, while the houses need distractions, taverns, and circuses. You’ll need to frame this into muscle memory, as in a rather horrific oversight, the game doesn’t present a glossary or index of items and bonuses you can come across.</p>

<p>One could argue that it would impede on <em>Islanders</em>’ minimalist nature as a whole, but <em>New Shores</em> clearly wants to strike bigger and bolder strokes, especially as time goes on in its “Endless” mode. Each new island brings a new biome, that new biome bringing a new building alongside it, as well as potential bonuses to build around. These can range from ancient rocks, which provide hefty point bonuses when broken, to the biome literally rising from the ground with each new point threshold.</p>



<p>With that said, that last prospect of the biome rising from the ground? That has a chance to just kill your run completely. It's a very,&nbsp;<em>very&nbsp;</em>rare occurrence, but it's possible for the game to simply not give you the space or choice of resources to move on to the next threshold, which is utterly deflating. Despite the rarity of this anomaly, it's worth keeping in mind how little&nbsp;<em>Islanders&nbsp;</em>focuses on the next step, instead how it all stands. It's like the&nbsp;<em>Wallace &amp; Gromit&nbsp;</em>sketch with the train-tracks, only I'm not laughing.</p>

<p>It’s a mechanically mesmerizing experience, even if its pacing and progression lets it down by awkwardly heaving it in front of you. The amount of time you can spend on some of these islands trying fruitlessly to slam buildings into tricky spots like groceries in bags, and knowing that the next island presented is going to double that time in one go. Endless mode, despite those bursts of magic, is an endurance test that will turn your God-given powers into sloppy slaps of building placement that are ruined by fatigue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other big miss is the sound design, lacking a real aural achievement to go alongside its little touches. The music never felt like it fit in with whatever you were planning to create, the plodding and plonking of fake glockenspiel and kalimba sticking out like a sore thumb, when the ambience does so much more to add to the aesthetic than it ever could. Plop a few houses down and listen to the bustle, how it dances with the wind, and that’s <em>New Shores</em> right there.</p>

<h2><em>Islanders: New Shores&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>It’s easy to call <em>Islanders </em>addictive, and <em>New Shores</em> even more so. Coatsink and The Station clearly have what’s necessary to make its mechanics a lock-on for long stretches of mucking about, but this exercise of expertise is hamstrung by the extra weight. As it stands, <em>New Shores</em> is going to move to fresh lands, as the roadmap promises, and honestly, given what’s shown so far? It’s worth it to jump on the boat now. The future's a bonus.</p>

The mode takes Abby and Ellie’s stories and interleaves them in chronological order rather than the nonlinear story of the original version of the game, which used timeskips and flashbacks. </p><p>In addition to Chronological Mode, the patch also includes new achievements and skins to use in <em>Part II Remastered’s</em> roguelike game mode No Return. Now you can dress up Joel and his brother Tommy like Naughty Dog’s other pair of visually indistinct, emotionally constipated brothers; Nathan and Sam Drake. Naughty Dog does still recommend that first timers play <em>TLOU Part II</em> normally before tackling Chronological Mode but that, “the team’s hard work has paid off with a fascinating new way to enjoy this chapter.” Chronological Mode will give players a new reason to pick up the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645923/the-last-of-us-renewed-for-season-3-just-ahead-of-hbo-return">while awaiting the next season of the show</a> which will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hbo/673868/the-last-of-us-season-2-finale-hbo">dive into events from Abby’s perspective</a>. Season 3 though, will proceed without Neil Druckmann as co-lead. Druckmann, co-director of both <em>The Last of Us</em> games and creative director at Naughty Dog, recently announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696939/the-last-of-us-co-creator-neil-druckmann-is-stepping-back">that he’s taking a break from the show</a> to focus efforts on the studio’s games including the recently announced, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24320197/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-trailer-game-awards-2024"><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/701060/the-last-of-us-part-ii-chronological-mode-season-three-hbo]]></content:encoded>

But what’s got me the most jazzed about the second season isn’t just watching my adopted anime children <em>Scooby-Doo</em> their way out of an <em>X-Files</em> jam; it's poring over its animator’s rough draft key animations on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>While it isn’t rare for animators for shows like <a href="https://aftermath.site/gquuuuuux-finale-gundam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</em></a> to <a href="https://x.com/gojooni/status/1937541488973643806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post illustrations on social media</a> following the release of a new episode to drum up excitement (and marketing) for their anime and <a href="https://x.com/HideMatsubara/status/1937543228494102568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bid farewell to their co-workers</a>, the folks at Science Saru have made it a tradition to have its animators post snippets of the production materials they worked on in new episodes.&nbsp;</p><p>These key animation production materials—whose rough versions are called <a href="https://sakuga.fandom.com/wiki/Genga" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genga </a>and cleaned-up versions are called <a href="https://sakuga.fandom.com/wiki/Nigen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nigen</a>—are essentially a behind-the-scenes look at how the anime sausage is made. It’s similar to looking at the version history Google Doc of a stellar review with all the <a href="https://x.com/SHUTOENOMOTO/status/1857189960685949072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strikethroughs, moved graphs, and editor comments</a>. Only with ningen do you get to see what the chiseled granite of animation looked like in its final stages before <a href="https://gizmodo.com/netflix-animation-anime-interview-power-house-sam-deats-adam-deats-david-how-2000517324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">color shading and compositing</a> come into play making the fluid animation (<a href="https://sakuga.fandom.com/wiki/Sakuga_Wiki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sakuga</a>) of anime episode what it looks like upon release.</p><p>What’s interesting about Science Saru animators posting various keyframes—whether they’re simple running cycles, head turns, <a href="https://x.com/dancing_stew/status/1940847223060983966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">character acting</a>, or action scenes—is that many of them last no longer than four to eight seconds. Still, each keyframe plays a crucial role in making every part of <em>Dan Da Dan</em>’s animation shine—whether it's in its opening theme or within the episodes. Essentially, looking at Science Saru’s team's piecemeal work on new episodes is like watching a street artist sign their name on a giant mural. Plus, by checking out their keyframes in isolation, I get to geek out over small animation details I might not notice in the chaos of the final episodes, like when Momo (my favorite character) makes a goofy face in the middle of a fight.&nbsp;</p><p>While I’ve meticulously set my Twitter algorithm to show me posts from Science Saru animators whenever a new episode drops, folks who also love behind-the-scenes animation details can visit websites like <a href="https://sakugabooru.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sakugabooru.</a> This site not only functions as a database for a wide range of anime shows, tagging various techniques and styles, but also links back to the animator’s Twitter accounts if people want to follow a creator’s work. I find this especially helpful in avoiding the trend where anime fans credit streaming platforms like Netflix and Crunchyroll for the animation quality, rather than recognizing the studios and animators who put in the effort to give those shows their shine and just desserts.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-vested-unvested-shares-stocks"><h3>Xbox’s ‘Golden Handcuffs’ Are Screwing Over Laid Off Workers</h3></a><p>'Unvested shares' are something I didn't even understand last week but this week have been floored by</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hideaki-anno-is-animes-ultimate-wife-guy"><h3>Hideaki Anno Is Anime’s Ultimate Wife Guy</h3></a><p>Moyoco and Hideaki Anno might dethrone Sailor Moon and Hunter X Hunter’s creators as anime’s it couple.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game"><h3>Sid Meier’s Colonization Is The American Video Game</h3></a><p>No game has told the American story better, whether intentionally or not</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/dandadan-anime-sakuga-science-saru]]></content:encoded>

                <p>One of the most annoying parts of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4's</a> endgame may soon see changes, as Blizzard has said it's looking to "fix" boss fight immunity phases.</p><p dir="ltr">In a response to a fan on <a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1938722534490546603" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a> (via <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/diablo-4s-boss-immunity-phases-might-soon-be-a-thing-of-the-past-377626?utm_source=bsky&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=250807&amp;utm_content=d4_immunity" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>) asking for Blizzard to remove the immunity phases from endgame bosses like Duriel, Andariel, and the Harbinger of Hatred, Diablo director of content and social marketing Adam Fletcher had a short-and-to-the-point answer.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1938722534490546603" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">There are plans to fix this up.</p>  — Adam Fletcher (@PezRadar) <a href="https://twitter.com/PezRadar/status/1938722534490546603?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 27, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">"There are plans to fix this up," Fletcher said.</p><p dir="ltr">Long immunity phases where bosses become invulnerable are currently a pain point in Diablo 4's endgame post-Season 8, which made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-season-8-is-making-endgame-bosses-stronger-simpler-to-access-and-more-rewarding/1100-6530970/" data-ref-id="1100-6530970">bosses harder but also more rewarding</a>. Even though a player may be capable of dealing enough damage to kill a Tormented boss in just a few blows, there are instead multiple periods where players are forced to endure various mechanics while the boss becomes invincible for a set amount of time.</p><p dir="ltr">The immunity phases are especially annoying (and have been basically since the game's launch) for the Echo of Lilith boss fight due to her attacks causing a stacking debuff that will eventually one-shot players. Add on the fact that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-8-players-are-fed-up-with-its-bugged-lilith-boss-fight/1100-6532596/" data-ref-id="1100-6532596">Lilith fight has been bugged</a> recently so that she sometimes never leaves her invulnerability phase, and players are largely fed up with having to wait to deal damage despite being strong enough to kill bosses outright.</p><p dir="ltr">What specific changes to Diablo 4's endgame bosses, or when they may arrive, are still a mystery, as Fletcher didn't elaborate further. However, Fletcher recently had this to say on social media following Blizzard's recent Diablo 4 Season 9 Campfire Chat livestream.</p><p dir="ltr">"Just know, your warcries of wanting more change aren't going unnoticed," Fletcher <a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1938720086338216264" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>. "The team has been cooking on some of the biggest changes that really hit home on things people have been asking for and more. We will share more as we get closer."</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 9 started July 1 and will run through September 23. Blizzard has not yet outlined more concrete plans for Season 10, but players can hope that some of the bigger changes Fletcher is alluding to will arrive around then.</p><p dir="ltr">In the meantime, players have recently discovered an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-now-has-a-very-easy-to-replicate-infinite-damage-bug/1100-6533026/" data-ref-id="1100-6533026">easy Diablo 4 infinite-damagebug</a> for the Sorcerer that will likely be fixed soon. In addition to changes for Diablo 4, Blizzard has also teased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cryptic-diablo-2-anniversary-tweet-is-giving-fans-hope-for-new-content/1100-6532876/" data-ref-id="1100-6532876">Diablo 2 news</a>, which fans are hoping is new content for the classic ARPG.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Time Flies has a simple and humorous premise. Players control a fly and must complete a long bucket list over a short life span. The game has been buzzing around since its reveal in 2022, but it’s finally landing later this month.</p><p>Developed by Playables designers Michael Frei and Raphaël Munoz, creators of similarly sparse abstract games such as <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/kids/standing-out-by-blending-in">Kids</a> and Plug &amp; Play, this hand-drawn black-and-white adventure tasks players with buzzing around a house to complete a checklist. This includes learning an instrument, becoming wealthy, or getting drunk. Goals are both explicit and obscure, and the challenge comes in figuring out how to accomplish them as a tiny fly before its brief life expires.</p><p url="https://youtu.be/FzAwgAIXn28?si=njDmdSiVMyocZEPZ" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FzAwgAIXn28" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The fly's average life expectancy ranges around 60 seconds, though this varies based on your physical location (which you’ll enter at the game’s start). Dying means starting the whole game anew, though your progress hastens as you learn how to complete tasks more quickly. Time Flies’ description succinctly sums up the thematic core of the experience: “Make the best of the time you have left, because we’re all going to die.”</p><p>“Flies are pretty annoying, and we’ve been listening to one every day for the past four years of game development,” says Michael Frei in a press release. “Please do your part and Wishlist the game now, I really need therapy.”</p><p>We played Time Flies during Summer Game Fest 2022, and were amused and engrossed during our short time with it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s a new update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a>, which adds a new way to play through the game’s story with the chronological mode.</p>
<p>The new feature is added today in patch 2.1.0 for PS5 and patch 1.5 for the game on PC via Steam and Epic.</p>


<p>The Last of Us Part 2 was released with a story that plays out non-linearly, showing Ellie and Abby’s stories in a jumbled up order that also blends in flashbacks alongside the present-day story.</p>
<p>“Through the new Chronological mode,” Naughty Dog’s Jonathan Dornbush writes, “we believe players will gain even deeper insight into Part II’s narrative. Players will be able to see how Ellie being gifted a guitar flows so neatly into her learning to play, for example, while the journey through Seattle will showcase the fascinating parallels between Ellie and Abby’s crisscrossing journeys. You’ll see just how close they come into running into each other, how their actions impact each other, and more.”</p>
<p>The studio still recommends playing the game as it was originally put together, but this gives a potentially fresh perspective. If you do play this way, however, you will be able to unlock two new skins that dress Joel up as Nathan Drake and Tommy up as Sam Drake, made available for the No Return roguelike survival mode.</p>

<p>That this update even exists is an unusual one, coming half a decade after the game’s original launch on PS4, and in some ways it feels like this echoes <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/12/04/going-back-to-beyond-two-souls-on-ps4/">the chronological story mode added to Beyond: Two Souls</a> for its PS4 remaster. It’s also strangely timed to release this after Season 2 of HBO’s The Last of Us adaptation, which inherited the non-linear story of the game. Surely if there was a time to reconsider how the tale was to be unspooled, it would have been through the TV series? Certainly, this could have helped with some of the most…. disliked narrative points in both game and TV show.</p>

<p>Looking back at The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered’s release for PS5, Gamoc said, “The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered refines and improves a much misunderstood masterpiece. It’s hard not to be amazed at how good this game still looks, and it comes with a new mode and some behind the scenes stuff to enjoy. It’s not as big a step from the original release as TLOU Part 1 was, and so feels like a less noteworthy release, but the price for upgrading from PS4 is reasonable for what you get. For those who haven’t played it, this will be the best version to play, even if it’s just for No Return to add some more longevity without all the incredibly intense emotional stress of the main story.”</p>

<p>Say hello to 'Ninsight'</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Ninsight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/602666d8c3dbf/ninsight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ninty Media</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ninty Media, the team behind magazines such as The Vita Lounge, Switch Player, and Ninty Fresh, has launched a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nintymedia/ninsight-the-new-nintendo-switch-2-magazine">Kickstarter campaign</a> for a new venture called 'Ninsight'.</p>
<p>With the first issue shipping globally in August, Ninsight aims to provide the latest Nintendo-themed news, reviews, and talking points in a premium, 80-100 page magazine with zero adverts. At the time of writing, over half of the Kickstarter's £5,000 goal has been achieved with 16 days remaining.</p>
<p>According to the overview, the move over to Ninsight was due to rising costs in maintaining production for Switch Player. Moving over to a new model which focuses on fewer releases and higher-quality content will hopefully result in a more viable business long-term.</p>

<p>You can offer up a pledge right now if you wish, with digital copies of the magazine costing £4 and physical versions costing £7. A premium edition at £20 will also include an art print of the cover art and a poster. Backers of the premium edition will also get an enamel pin badge and their names in the mag.</p>
<p>So if you miss the days of NGamer and ONM, then this might well be worth a punt. We'll certainly be keeping a close eye on it!</p>

			<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-digital-showcase-returns-on-august-1st/">THQ Nordic Showcase</a> that will take place at the beginning of next month, developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-qa-alkimia-talks-about-expanding-the-classic-rpg/">Alkimia Interactive</a> has published its latest 'Making Of' video going behind the scenes on the development of the Gothic Remake, this time focusing on the studio's approach to the game's art style.</p>



<p>"<em>We also decided very early on, we are not making an HD version of the art style of the original, that's not our goal</em>," says the game director and studio head at Alkimia Interactive, Reinhard Pollice, at the top of the video. Pollice and the studio's art director, Daniel Candil, continue to elaborate on how they were working with opposing forces in developing this remake, as they wanted to make it look grounded and realistic, while also properly displaying the more fantastical and magical elements of Gothic.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Gothic 1 Remake was first announced all the way back in 2019 with a surprise teaser demo being released for players to check out. It wasn't until <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-gothic-remake-is-happening-after-all-and-itll-be-grittier-than-the-demo/">2020, however,</a> that we knew for sure that the remake was in development, and it has been in the works ever since. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-killing-floor-3-and-titan-quest-ii-to-launch-by-march-2025-alongside-three-unannounced-games/">May 2024</a>, we learned that the remake was meant to be out by March 2025, though all we've received so far this year is a new demo that debuted during the year's first Steam Next Fest event in February 2025. Alkimia Interactive has even taken <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-gets-demo-update-following-communitys-feedback/">feedback from players who checked out the demo</a> and committed to making several significant changes. </p>



<p>Currently, there's still no proper release date set for the Gothic Remake, though it's entirely possible that we'll finally learn of when it'll be on store shelves during the upcoming THQ Nordic Showcase in August.</p>

Doing so will complete a challenge. </p><p>Next, hop over to the challenge menu and look for an exclamation mark indicating a completed challenge.

That could have meant it was tricky to add him to the full roster, so they added him as a secret character, but they really wanted people to be able to play as him. It’s been nearly two decades since Bam was in a <em>Tony Hawk </em>game! So the devs set his price to something pretty low and made it easy to unlock him within minutes of booting the game, effectively making him a playable character right from the moment you start.<br></p><p>Regardless, you’ve probably stopped reading this blog ages ago because you went to unlock him<em>.</em> So I’ll just keep thinking about this grand conspiracy alone. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-bam-margera-how-to-unlock-easy-fast-tip-guide-1851785804]]></content:encoded>

That doesn’t detract from the original experience, nor does it make it any less the ‘canonical’ version of the story.” Sure, disembodied voice. Devoid of all other context surrounding this game and franchise, it just sounds like a neat way to experience a story the second time around. If it were an unlockable mode that becomes available after you finish the game for the first time, maybe I could buy into that.

This is why the flashback-heavy format is so crucial to the story it tells, and is one of the many reasons HBO’s show feels like a fundamental misunderstanding of the story it’s adapting. Denying the player cathartic, easy answers is a core part of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, and laying out its story in the most straightforward, literal way feels like capitulating to an audience that already didn’t like the story you told in the first place, whether they knew why Abby killed Joel early on or not. There are plenty of criticisms to be thrown at <em>Part II</em>, but you can’t say it wasn’t deliberate in the experience it was trying to convey.

            <p>
Activision has pulled the PC Game Pass version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-ww2">Call of Duty: WW2</a> offline while it investigates an unspecified "issue" some reports claim is a remote code execution exploit that's left some players grappling with app pop-ups, PC shut downs, and even screens full of pornography.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty: WW2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-games-list-this-month-price-6400">made its PC Game Pass debut at the end of June</a>, but the celebrations were short-lived. The shooter has now been taken offline, affecting both the Game Pass and the PC Microsoft Store release, but not those available elsewhere, including Steam and Battle.net.
</p>
<p>
As to why this has happened, Activision's <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085">official response</a> is vague, only saying the game was "brought offline while we investigate reports of an issue". However, there's evidence from the community that the newly released version of Call of Duty: WW2 may be vulnerable to remote code execution exploits, enabling an attacker to run malicious code on a player's PC.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty streamer Wrioh, for instance, posted to social media with claims of being "hacked". An <a href="https://x.com/wrioh75753/status/1940597447467979053">accompanying video</a> showed their gaming session being interrupted by a pop-up text window proclaiming to have "just RCE'd your ass", before it's revealed Wrioh's desktop wallpaper has been changed to an image of a <a href="https://labusinessjournal.com/advertorials/most-influential-intellectual-property-attorney-mm/">beaming lawyer</a>.
</p>
<p>
In <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1940639088576811516">another post</a>, the VX-Underground malware and cybersecurity research collective (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-ww2-pulled-from-pc-following-reports-of-remote-code-exploit-trolling-players-with-notepad-pop-ups-pc-shutdowns-and-desktop-wallpaper-of-a-lawyer/">PC Gamer</a>) shared additional images of a purported CoD: WW2 RCE attack, including an in-game error message featuring the phrase, "Your PC is now mine". In an accompanying message, VX-Underground referenced an "unpatched RCE exploit" and claimed, "Someone is trolling gamers with Notepad pop ups, PC shutdowns, and gay pornography."
</p>
<p>
VX-Underground member Smelly then <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1940889734269501446">provided an "educated guess"</a> as to what's happening in Wrioh's video. "The concern in this particular case," they summarised, "is that this means an attacker is capable of deploying information stealer malware, a RAT (remote administration tool), or ransomware. Thankfully, it appears this attacker is primarily interested in memeing and fucking with people." There's a little more technical detail in the full post.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty: WW2 for PC Game Pass and the Microsoft Store has now been offline since the weekend, with no sign of its imminent return and no update from Activision. While RCE vulnerabilities have been associated with numerous other games in recent years, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-patches-a-security-vulnerability-that-could-give-hackers-full-console-takeover">Nintendo's Mario Kart 8</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-fixes-cs-go-exploit-that-could-give-hackers-control-of-pcs">Valve's Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</a>, perhaps the most notable example is FromSoftware's Dark Souls series. It took over ten months for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-souls-remastered-finally-gets-its-online-features-back-on-pc">Dark Souls Remastered's online support to be restored</a> after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-souls-online-servers-are-down-following-reports-of-a-security-issue">being pulled in 2022</a>, so Call of Duty: WW2 fans will likely be hoping for a speedier resolution. We've asked Activision for comment.

<p>In Time Trial mode, Rainbow Road is broken up into four sections, with each section taking over a minute on average for your garden variety Mario Kart World player. Yet Technical has managed to complete the entire course in 3:39:987, and he's currently on top.</p>
<p>The world record has been in flux ever since the game's release, with the leader changing 34 times over the course of the past month. Technical is the very first person to break the four-minute barrier, which means the game is well and truly on at this point. Have a watch below.</p>

<p>This <em>should</em><em>n't</em> be a huge surprise, however; Technical is also the world record holder for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mario_kart_8">Mario Kart 8</a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">8 Deluxe</a>'s Rainbow Road (<a href="https://mkwrs.com/mk8dx/display.php?track=Rainbow+Road&amp;m=200">on 200cc</a>). So you could say he's a bit of an expert at the multicoloured course.</p>
<p>Many thought hitting the sub-four minute mark would take a lot longer than it has, but many players have been extremely close to breaking that barrier, but a combination of track length and a late-race trick have proven difficult.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping an eye on this over the coming months — and likely years. Perhaps 3:55 is the next milestone?</p>
<p><em>What do you think of the new Rainbow Road? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>

		<p>The last things you want to hear from one of your friends and colleagues is "hey, I'm in the ER." This happened to <em>me</em> a few weeks back when my five-year-old broke her arm—which, thank <em>god</em>, we're nearly over with—and then today, as Rob informed Chia and I that he had, quoting a Discord message, "tripped on a fucking ottoman." Simultaneously, Chia said they had<em> sun sickness.</em> (It's been extremely hot in many places over the past few weeks.) So, we're a little battered and bruised at <em>Remap</em> this week. So, look: thanks for the patience.</p><p>-pk, who is trying to decide whether to take his kids to <em>Superman</em> this weekend, a movie they claim they want to see but may be too scary</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Hotline</em> – I had to sit this one out, because a weekend family reunion in Minnesota became a friend reunion in Wisconsin, which also lead into...well, it was a lot. I had a good time, but I also really enjoy these question bucket episodes, so my thanks to Rob and Chia for holding it down.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Peak</em> – This was supposed to be Chia, Janet, and I, but now it's going to be me playing <em>and</em> producing, so wish me luck. The setup looks right, but I won't know for sure until we're hitting the big red button, you know?</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Remap Recommends</em> – This will probably just be me and Rob this week, as Chia continues to recover. </li><li><strong>STREAM</strong>: <em>TBD</em> – This kinda depends on how everyone feels in the next 24 hours lol</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – We missed the Xbox news. Time to dive in. I might have to track down a breakfast burrito before we record, though.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series </em>– Often, these prompts are driven by what Rob and I are talking bout privately. In this case, we were talking about the fanciful delight of a 2nd bed, aka the bed you go to when you're having a bad night sleeping and don't want to disturb your partner. Suddenly, we had a prompt.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Blue Prince </em>is one of the most acclaimed puzzle games ever made, yet I almost put it down for good within ten hours of playing. Don’t get me wrong, I love puzzle games and roguelikes. I just quickly felt overwhelmed as I tried to gather clues and contend with the ever-changing Mt. Holly manor every in-game day. I started to think that this acclaimed mystery just wasn’t for me…until my girlfriend sat beside me on my couch and started to enjoy it with me.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195891" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="156" data-playlist="195891,196013,195301" data-current="195891"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21406.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>No disrespect to Hazelight Studios’ stellar <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470"><em>Split Fiction</em></a></span>, but <em>Blue Prince</em> is one of my favorite co-op games of 2025. The <em>House of Leaves</em>-esque premise is reminiscent of tabletop puzzle games, and the roguelike structure is somehow perfect for two or more people to enjoy together. Here’s what a second set of eyes brings to this otherwise single player experience.</p><h2 id="h75881"><a id="1"></a>The notebook is a controller</h2><p>To solve every riddle in <em>Blue Prince </em>yourself, you’ll need pen and paper by your side. That’s not an exaggeration: The game <em>literally </em>tells you to take notes, as the clues you find in one room might become relevant several in-game days later in a totally different location. If you’re flying solo, this can feel overwhelming to manage. There’s just so much to take in that constantly stopping to jot down notes can seriously slow your progression.</p><p>This is where a second person helps a lot! Not only does it help to talk through certain puzzles (looking at you, Parlor Room), a pair of hands dedicated to note taking means you don’t have to constantly stop to record observations. Additionally, when a second person can focus on reviewing notes during downtime, you’re both more likely to find that one missing link you need to overcome any especially baffling puzzles.</p><h2 id="h75882"><a id="2"></a>The roguelike structure makes it easy to take turns</h2><p>Lest you think I’m encouraging player two to take on all the stuff you don’t want to do, the design of <em>Blue Prince</em> makes it easy to alternate who’s in the hot seat. Since this is a roguelike, the end of a run marks a convenient time to hand off the controller to your partner so you can become the notetaker for the next run. You’ll (probably) feel ready for a break after an hour-long run anyway, and your partner can start with a mostly clean slate as they get their bearings with the game.</p><figure id="" data-id="50f3305a824df27c317471c8a19ad070" data-recommend-id="image://50f3305a824df27c317471c8a19ad070" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Blue Prince.

A dartboard is shown with certain sections lit up in either purple, blue, or red." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This approach directly helps with puzzle solving too! It’s easy to get caught in a loop of exploring the same rooms repeatedly because you rely on certain items or resources. Watching someone else play lets you see rooms or details you wouldn’t normally notice yourself, or you might notice a clue that you want to pursue during your next run. <em>Blue Prince</em> is all about information gathering, and a different perspective makes that pursuit much easier.</p><h2 id="h75883"><a id="3"></a>All the action is cerebral</h2><p>This technically applies to all puzzle games, and it’s doubly true of <em>Blue Prince</em>. No challenge in this game is a test of reflexes or memorizing complex combos; you’re here to read books, gather clues, and solve riddles. For this reason, you don’t need to be in literal control of <em>Blue Prince </em>to <em>play</em> <em>Blue Prince</em>. Two or more people can easily contribute to looking around a room, pointing out details that might be relevant later, or dissecting a vague note that might be helpful later.</p><figure id="" data-id="a32879cb00a6193b9f465304cdbbfbe3" data-recommend-id="image://a32879cb00a6193b9f465304cdbbfbe3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Blue Prince.

Notes and pictures are pinned to a board." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Dogubomb / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a32879cb00a6193b9f465304cdbbfbe3" data-recommend-id="image://a32879cb00a6193b9f465304cdbbfbe3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Blue Prince. Notes and pictures are pinned to a board." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>More importantly, <em>Blue Prince</em> expects you to crack these granular puzzles while you simultaneously manage your stock of keys, gems, and steps to make the most out of your in-game day. This can feel stressful, especially in the early game. However, with two or more people, you can divide up the cognitive load to make the game more digestible. For example, I typically handled the resource management and house layout, while my girlfriend specialized in room exploration and picking out details that’d become helpful later. </p><p><br>You don’t have to follow this formula to a tee, of course. For best results, chat with your unofficial <em>Blue Prince</em> co-op partner about your strengths and weaknesses when it comes to puzzle solving, and come up with a game plan that works for you. Regardless of what you come up with, just exchanging notes and hints with another person is one of the most fun parts of <em>Blue Prince</em>. It’s an experience well worth sharing, and if it still doesn’t turn out to be your cup of tea, well, maybe you can give <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470"><em>Split Fiction</em></a></span> the respect I’ve so wrongfully snubbed it of instead.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/blue-prince-puzzle-co-op-players-puzzles-roguelike-1851785805]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> Season 9 launched July 1, and it hasn't taken long for players to discover an infinite-damage bug for the Sorcerer class that is trivializing the ARPG's hardest content. Even worse, it's not hard to replicate.</p><p dir="ltr">As broken down by Diablo content creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6FLFrumkg0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mekuna</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/infinite-damage-strikes-again-as-diablo-4-players-overthrow-the-tyranny-of-mathematics-with-an-exploit-that-grants-sorcerers-the-power-of-the-gods-no-way-that-they-leave-that-in-the-game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), the bug revolves around the Sorcerer's Enlightenment Key Passive, which can be activated by casting skills of a different element to generate Enlightenment stacks. At 100 stacks, the Sorcerer becomes Enlightened and benefits from increased damage, mana regeneration, and attack speed for a limited time.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6FLFrumkg0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c6FLFrumkg0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That's simple enough, but the passive is currently interacting with a new seasonal power, Smoldering Embers, that for some reason causes the damage bonus from Enlightenment to go through the roof when entering portals to a new area. By proccing Enlightenment right before going to a portal, the Sorcerer's elemental damage multipliers start to go up exponentially, with Mekuna's video showing how at one point, after going through several portals using the bug, his Sorcerer had plus 581,000,000,000% more Lightning damage.</p><p dir="ltr">With such absurd numbers, any enemy in Diablo 4 becomes child's play. Pit 150, the current hardest challenge in Diablo 4, can be cleared in under a minute, as everything instantly melts around a Sorcerer taking advantage of the bug.</p><p dir="ltr">"Hopefully that's going to be fixed quickly," Mekuna said in his video explaining the bugged build. "We don't need that in the game."</p><p dir="ltr">Just a few days ago, players <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk6SW_yOZIg&amp;t=217s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> another bugged Sorcerer build that also took advantage of the interaction between Enlightenment and Smoldering Embers. That build, however, was much more difficult to replicate, as it required cycling Enlightenment with another modifier that, while possible, required far more precision.</p><p dir="ltr">This new version of the bugged build doesn't require any careful stacking of modifiers and is so easy that basically anyone can do it. For that reason it's almost certainly now on Blizzard's radar, but there hasn't been any official word on when a fix might be coming, though one would hope it's soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 9 is scheduled to run until September 23.

            <p>If you have already played The Last of Us Part 2 on its initial PS4 release, plus again thanks to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-tech-analysis">souped-up PlayStation 5 Part 2 Remastered release</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-finally-gets-itself-a-pc-release-date">then once more on PC</a>, but still want to play through the game <em>yet again</em> but with another new twist, well now you can.</p>
<p>Developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> has today announced a free update for Part 2 Remastered across PS5 and PC, which will let you play through Ellie and Abby's stories chronologically. <strong>Please be aware of potential spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2 below. </strong></p>

<p>"Those who have already played will know its story is told non-linearly, as Ellie and Abby's motivations, realisations, and emotional stakes unfold across myriad flashbacks and present-day storylines," Naughty Dog wrote in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/introducing-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-experience-out-today/">blog post detailing this Part 2 update</a>.</p>
<p>"While this structure is very intentional and core to how our studio wanted Part 2's themes and narrative beats to impact players, we always wondered what it would be like to experience this story chronologically. And now finally, we can answer that question."</p>
<p>Naughty Dog hopes that replaying Part 2 with Ellie and Abby's stories more interwoven like this will give players a deeper understanding and insight into the game's narrative. It noted now, players will see Ellie receive her guitar from Joel and then her learning to play in a more fluid manner.</p>
<p>Then, when it comes to Seattle, players will see just how close Ellie and Abby actually come to crossing paths as they each make their way through the city on their own journeys of revenge and grief.</p>
<p>"It was no small feat to bring The Last of Us Part 2's story chronologically together, given that Part 2's story is so meticulously put together," Naughty Dog said, adding new trophies have also been added as part of this update for those who complete the game in chronological order.</p>
<p>In addition to base game tweaks, this update will also include two new skins for The Last of Us Part 2's roguelike mode No Return. In a Naughty Dog crossover, players who complete The Last of Us Part 2's narrative chronologically will be able to adorn Joel in Nathan Drake of Uncharted fame's garb. Tommy, meanwhile, has got himself a Sam Drake skin.</p>

<p>"We here at Naughty Dog are so grateful for all the love and support we've seen from The Last of Us fans these last few months," Naughty Dog closed. "From the launch of The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered on PC, to The Last of Us Complete on PlayStation 5, to seeing your weekly reactions to season two of the television series, it's been such a pleasure to celebrate this moment with you."</p>
<p>As for the TV series, The Last of Us season two wrapped earlier this year, with subsequent seasons still to conclude Part 2's narrative. Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">Naughty Dog studio head Neil Druckmann announced he was stepping away from the adaptation</a>. Soon after, Halley Gross - who co-wrote The Last of Us Part 2 with Druckmann, before also working on the show - announced she was also taking a step back from the HBO series to focus on other projects.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-now-play-the-last-of-us-part-2-in-yet-another-way-as-naughty-dog-releases-chronological-mode]]></content:encoded>
