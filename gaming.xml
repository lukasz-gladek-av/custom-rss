			<p>EA Sports FC 26 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-release-date-gameplay-reveal/">due out at the end of the week</a> at the time of this writing, and its incoming arrival had former professional footballer Wayne Rooney talking on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0lwvsnc">his 'The Wayne Rooney Show' podcast</a> about the series and his experiences with EA's football series and videogames in general, which came with an interesting revelation. Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-big-part-of-our-success-was-playing-the-psp-wayne-rooney-credits-sonys-handheld-for-man-uniteds-performances/">VGC</a>, Rooney credits part of the success he and his Manchester United club enjoyed during his time with the squad to game sessions he and teammates would have playing SOCOM on their PSP consoles.</p>



<p>The PlayStation Portable (PSP) featured four SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs titles: SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs: Fireteam Bravo, SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs: Fireteam Bravo 2, SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs: Tactical Strike, and SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs: Fireteam Bravo 3. All four were released over the course of Rooney's tenure with Manchester United, which lasted between 2004 and 2017, during which he and Man United won five Premier League titles, the Champions League, the Europa League, the FA Cup, four Community Shields, and three League Cups.</p>



<p>After a fun conversation about what Rooney's rating in EA Sports FC 26 is now that he's moved on to being part of the Legends roster of players, Kelly Somers asks Rooney about his own gaming history, to which he begins by saying, "<em>I used to play a lot of FIFA and Call of Duty. Of late, I've not played much obviously,</em>" say for the odd time he says he's played with YouTubers and influencers, and of course his own kids.</p>



<p>When Somers asks what else, beyond FIFA, he used to play, Rooney says, "<em>Do you know what we used to play, not FIFA. True story, this, at Man United, I really believe</em> <em>a big part of our success was playing the PSP. Honestly, it got us communicating more; we used to play on the plane, on the team bus. We'd play 5v5 on a game on called SOCOM on the PSP, army game. You have to talk, you have to tactically be right, go revive people when they got killed. It was a massive part of our success I believe. You can ask any of the players who played at the same time, it was brilliant.</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Another example of how games can bring people together and have real-world impact on how you interact with others in your life. It's also another example of the impact of SOCOM, a series that many PlayStation fans, and likely some Manchester United fans, would love to see make a comeback.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I see so much slop on my </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tiktok-us-ban-supreme-court-date-bytedance-china-1851715772"><span>TikTok</span></a><span> feed these days that most of it doesn’t faze me. However, for the past week or so, I’ve seen ads promoting what are very clearly AI-generated Christmas ornaments featuring famous characters in situations that their respective IP holders would probably never approve of. I can’t unsee these horrors, so now, I’m making it your problem. You ever seen Belle from </span><i><span>Beauty and the Beast</span></i><span> making an ahegao face as she gets spanked over Beast’s knee? Do you know what the Grinch looks like on his knees, worshipping a mystery Grinch lady’s uncomfortably caked-up rear-end? Well, it’s too late to turn back now. Look at it:</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000627642" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627642"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627642">©Homacus</figcaption></figure> <p><span>These monstrosities come courtesy of </span><a href="https://homacus.com/collections/couple-ornaments"><span>Homacus</span></a><span>, a personalized gift shop that lets you print the names of yourself and your significant other on a “naughty” Christmas ornament featuring beloved characters like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-4-screenshots-mickey-sora-release-date-1851780809"><span>Mickey and Minnie Mouse</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/shrek-5-first-teaser-cast-zendaya-myers-diaz-trailer-1851766800"><span>Shrek and Fiona</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-dark-knight-arkham-new-game-2000618481"><span>Batman and Catwoman</span></a><span>, and many more that I doubt Disney, DC, and the numerous other rights holders signed off on. But hey, I’m open to being wrong, so I did reach out to Homacus for comment on the matter and will update the story if we hear back. Whatever the case, the company is very boldly paying for ads to make innocent bystanders like me very, very aware these ornaments exist. Think of all the poor bastards trying to scroll TikTok in peace who saw Jack Skellington tossing Sally’s salad. We already get enough psychic damage on the internet, and now we’re dealing with this?</span></p>   <p><span>The whole thing reeks of Facebook ad core shit that sites sell to boomers who think referencing anything sexual outside the bedroom is scandalous. It’s the type of pent-up sexual frustration that reminds you there are couples out there who rarely see each other naked, so having things like this hanging off their Christmas tree is as raunchy as it gets. I don’t care what debauchery is happening behind closed doors; just don’t make me look at </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-lava-chicken-jockey-easter-egg-game-1851786345"><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>creepers</span></a><span> smacking each other’s dumpies.&nbsp;</span></p>

He joined in 2018, and after a stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Steam Autumn Sale starts next Monday, but Valve dropped an early treat in the form of a rare <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamdeck" rel="sponsored">Steam Deck LCD discount</a>. The 256GB model that normally sells for $399.99 is $319.20 through October 6th at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. I, for one, thank Valve for dropping this deal now instead of when the servers inevitably hiccup at the start of the game sale.</p><p>For anyone out there deciding between the Steam Deck LCD, the pricier OLED, and perhaps other handhelds, it’s tough to beat the value of this discounted model. The Deck will be four years old in February, but it’s still a contender when it comes to good, reliable performance in PC games, especially considering how power-efficient it is. Another perk: it runs SteamOS, not Windows 11.</p><p>Also, game compatibility across Steam is generally great (more and more developers are building games with the Steam Deck’s specs in mind ahead of launch), and Valve has patched the Steam Deck frequently throughout the years with new features. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review">It didn’t start out great</a>, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">it eventually got there</a>.</p><p>Sure, the $549 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> boasts some nice perks that some will be willing to pay extra for, like a bigger battery, a 90Hz refresh rate OLED, faster Wi-Fi 6E. But at just over $200 less, you’re getting a pretty similar gaming experience in the Steam Deck LCD.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->319</span></p><div><p>The Steam Deck is a portable handheld console you can use to play PC games.</p></div></div><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/782737/the-steam-deck-lcd-is-20-percent-off-through-october-6th#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/782737/the-steam-deck-lcd-is-20-percent-off-through-october-6th]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-steam-deck-just-went-on-sale-and-is-killing-the-competition-on-price.1304721/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Despite a trade war and rising inflation, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507">three-year-old Steam Deck</a> hasn’t gone up in price yet. In fact, it just got a pretty major discount. The $400 LCD model will be 20 percent off for the 2025 fall Steam sale. That makes it significantly cheaper than just about every other current-gen gaming device on the market right now, including the 8-year-old Nintendo Switch. It also puts some needed pressure on new PC gaming handhelds launching this holiday.</p> <p>The Steam Deck 256GB LCD model will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">$320 starting September 22</a>. That’s essentially what the refurbished model, currently out of stock, usually costs. The 512GB OLED model is still $550 and the 1TB OLED is still $650 (they come with slightly bigger screens, a higher refresh rate, and better battery life). This week-long discount leads into the Steam Autumn Sale which will kick off next week on September 29 and run until October 6.</p> <p>It’s not a bad deal at all for one of the most versatile gaming handhelds around. It might just be Valve clearing out old inventory as it phases out the older LCD models entirely, but it comes as every other platform squeezes players more and more at the checkout line. The Xbox Series X/S just got its second price hike this year, the PS5 all-digital is now $100 more than it was at launch, and even the original Switch recently went from $300 to $330. At this rate, it’s hard not to feel like the $450 Switch 2 might not be far behind.</p> <p>Then there’s the Steam Deck’s competition in the PC gaming handheld race. We still don’t know how much the new <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-price-pc-gaming-handheld-asus-pre-order-2000622751">Xbox Ally Rog</a> will be, even though it’s less than a month away from launch. And the Legion Go 2, which costs <a href="https://kotaku.com/legion-go-2-price-specs-madden-curse-eagles-2000623447">up to $1350 at the high end</a> ($1,479 for the 2TB model), is both incredibly expensive and incredibly hard-to-get. Lenovo took so many pre-orders <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegionGo/comments/1nl3vxj/now_there_cancelling_preorders/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">it’s already canceling some</a>. That all might be great for “<a href="https://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/2045631.html">enthusiast gamers</a>” but it’s not likely to actually help grow the overall market for PC gaming or handhelds. There’s only an estimated <a href="https://substack.com/redirect/d49e77d2-93bb-48ce-b01b-168e092a9257?j=eyJ1IjoiN293Z2UifQ.yUVZMKoNk2BqBF9tq3iEKEd7X3capQ_E9zpEziCzGhc">5 to 7 million Steam Decks</a> out there in the world right now, and it’s by far the best-selling portable not made by Nintendo.</p>

As detailed in a Fatshark <a href="https://www.playdarktide.com/news/bound-by-duty-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog</a>, the bulk of the new content is for Mortis Trials, Darktide's wave-based roguelike mode. There will be a new arena, the Theatre of Rectitude, where players can test their mettle, as well as new Indulgence archetypes that will offer new combat styles for players to experiment with. Additional Memory Echoes added to the mode will expand on NPC backstories to reveal more about the game's cast of characters and the history of the ship that serves as the game's hub, the Mourningstar.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpOvbThhZe0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GpOvbThhZe0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">While the Mortis Trial additions make up a large chunk of the update, there's plenty new for players who prefer the game's mission-based gameplay. A new weapon for the Veteran, the Power Falchion, will work similarly to the Zealot's Relic Blade, allowing players to empower the weapon until it overheats. There will also be new Mark variants of the Bolt Pistol and Boltgun, both of which emphasize explosive damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Those new weapons will be put to the test against a new enemy type, the Scab Plasma Gunner. Wielding a powerful Plasma weapon that deals high damage, players will want to focus on these enemies whenever possible.</p><p dir="ltr">Fatshark completely <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-darktide-getting-revamped-class-system-with-skill-trees-and-new-abilities/1100-6517003/" data-ref-id="1100-6517003">revamped Darktide's classes in 2023</a>, adding greatly expanded talent trees and new abilities for each of the game's four (now five with the addition of the DLC Arbites) classes. In Bound by Duty, Fatshark takes another swing at balancing the talent trees. The Veteran, Zealot, and Psyker trees have been reworked to be more open and allow for "more flexibility and player agency," according to Fatshark, while the Ogryn and Arbites talents have also seen a "light touch-up."</p><p dir="ltr">Rounding out the update is the addition of a dodge counter that informs players of how many dodge charges they have remaining, as well as a new event called Smuggled Munitions that will see players taking on squads of the game's new Plasma Gun enemies while in low visibility conditions. For those looking to snag some free cosmetics, Twitch Drops for Darktide will be live from September 23 through October 13.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Warhammer 40K game news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-is-getting-a-new-long-awaited-class-next-year/1100-6534355/" data-ref-id="1100-6534355">Space Marine 2 will receive a long-awaited class next year</a> in a free update.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new battleforce box has been announced for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>. Games Workshop is putting the spotlight on the enforcers of the Imperium of Man, the Space Marines, in their new <em>Warhammer 40,000 Crux Terminatus Battleforce</em> box, bringing new takes on a certain brutal unit.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/wr9feecy/assault-terminators-are-an-unstoppable-force-and-an-immovable-object-in-one-indomitable-package/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop provided a sneak peek at what the <em>Warhammer 40,000 Crux Terminatus</em> Battleforce box contains. The post opens by discussing the direct power of the Assault Terminators units of the Space Marines. Bolters and Melta guns are great, but sometimes just crushing the enemies of the God Emperor with thunder hammers and shields works just as well.</p>

Units either sport devastating thunder hammers and a shield, providing them with an additional Wound. Alternatively, other units sport a pair of lightning claws, helping them cut through waves or Orks, Tyranids, or Chaos Daemons.</p>

<p>The <em>Warhammer 40,000 Crux Terminatus</em> Battleforce box contains custom options for your miniatures. Each squad of five minatures includes six unhelmeted heads, five helmets, five tilting plates, and 15 different accessories. In addition, the box will contain 500 decals representing the Ultramarines, Imperial Fists, Salamanders, White Scars, and Raven Guard chapters, respectively.</p>

<p>The battlebox will contain the following units:</p>

<ul><li>10 Assault Terminators</li>
	<li>5 Regular Terminators</li>
	<li>1 Ancient in Terminator Armor</li>
	<li>1 Chaplain in Terminator Armor</li>
	<li>1 Captain in Terminator Armor</li>
</ul><p>Overall, this Battleforce box appears to be a solid start for anyone's First Company or for veteran Space Marine players who want to get up close and personal against xenos and heretics alike. Given the Drukhari's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-warhammer-40000-drukhari-codex-brings-long-awaited-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">long-awaited codex</a> is on the horizon, this extra firepower may be warranted.</p>

<p>The <em>Warhammer 40,000 Crux Terminatus Battleforce</em> box will be available for pre-orders soon. Individual new kit releases will arrive shortly afterwards.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Sometimes, in this line of work, a game’s name will pass over your feeds multiple times before you ever actually see a frame of footage from it. That is what happened to me with </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace</span></i><span>, Papergames’ 2024 dating sim, which apparently has over </span><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/life/virtual-romance-real-money-why-some-sporeans-spend-up-to-4-figures-to-find-love-in-deepspace"><span>50 million players worldwide</span></a><span>. The otome game has always been a massive success, but with each update, another wave of buckwild clips starts spreading around the internet. Finally, this morning, I had my first run-in with </span><a href="https://x.com/micheogyal21/status/1969965447274717448"><span>a </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace </span></i><span>scene</span></a><span> so confounding and horny that I had to look into it further.</span></p> <p><i><span>Love and Deepspace</span></i><span> has a surprisingly complex science fiction story in which the main character, a woman named and customized by the player, is a “deepspace hunter” who fights creatures called Wanderers, but she also, unbeknownst to her, has been reincarnated multiple times. In all these previous lives, she has met the game’s five love interests, and unlocking memories from those past iterations is one of the biggest draws of the game because they not only delve into the game’s broader mysteries, but they’re also, well, interactive.</span></p>  <p><span>Just taking a cursory look at some of the romance scenes, it’s easy to see why </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace </span></i><span>has taken off the way it has. It’s angsty, sexy (if a bit awkward), and it has the same tendency toward melodrama that you might find in a soap opera or a romance novel. People love to date digital men who fulfill an otherworldly fantasy that real men can’t. It’s why </span><i><span>Twilight </span></i><span>still has the cultural cache it does, despite having been out of the limelight for over a decade. That being said, even as a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-romance-sex-scene-bear-shadowheart-gale-1850771533"><span>well-documented lover of digital men</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-sex-romance-scene-neve-taash-1851696476"><span>romance</span></a><span>, I don’t think I have the patience for some of </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace</span></i><span>’s gacha nonsense, which seems even more convoluted than that in your average gacha game. But even if I’m not playing it, I can still go snooping around YouTube and TikTok to see what all 50 million people who are playing this game are fawning over. Specifically, I needed to find out what the hell was up with this sex scene in which one of the lover boys, Zayne, says, “Feel this and remember what I’m giving you” as he’s on top of the player character.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">FEEL THIS POWER OF ANNIHILATION HE SAID, ANNIHILATE MA KITTY [zayne new myth god of annihilation] <a href="https://t.co/ATSKlGpwaY">pic.twitter.com/ATSKlGpwaY</a></p> <p>— 𝒔𝒖𝒛𝒖 (@pinkcrispss) <a href="https://twitter.com/pinkcrispss/status/1969964067986268598?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The scene is from a new trailer for the “Edge of Continuum” event that will begin on September 25. Edge of Continuum features new scenes with a “God of Annihilation” version of Zayne, depicting one of the protagonist’s many lives alongside him. And damn, the trailer is enough to get someone hot and bothered.</span></p>  <p><span>I’m surprised at how much story the trailer gives away, but nobody in the comments seems to be that mad about it, considering what they also get to see, which is basically the beginnings of a fantasy-themed softcore porn starring Zayne. Happy for y’all, and I have nothing but respect for those of you who can fight your way through the gacha nonsense to reach these scenes. Hopefully, I’ve done enough research for writing this that the algorithm starts showing me more of this shit so I can enjoy the fruits of your labor.</span></p>

Ogg has, he says, never been a fan of video games. Still, while speaking to YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TY9FVFeOgKk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HarrisonShippp</a>, it is surprising to see the actor speak quite so bluntly about the franchise that has earned him worldwide adoration. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I feel nothing inside. I'm not a gamer," Ogg said, standing in front of GTA 5 artwork at a recent convention where he appeared alongside fellow GTA 5 co-stars Ned Luke (Michael) and Shawn "Solo" Fonteno (Franklin) to meet fans. "I've never played a video game, so I feel absolutely nothing," he continued.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think someone said yesterday at one point, 'You should play GTA 5,'" Ogg continued. "I said, 'Why?' They said, 'Because it's so great.' And I said, 'Well one day you should read Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment' and he went completely blank."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Do you know Dostoevsky? [Who] Fyodor Dostoevsky is?" Ogg continued, turning from interviewee to interviewer, as he attempted to discover HarrisonShippp's knowledge of world literature. (Alas, HarrisonShippp did not know who Dostoevsky was.) "So there you go," Ogg continued, pressing the alleged equivalence. "'Why don't you read that? Are you excited about that book coming out?' See? It's the same thing. Books are my thing."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Celebrity in GTA 5 and GTA Online</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While not a gamer himself, Ogg has previously discussed his work on GTA in detail — including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-5-had-trevor-dlc-before-rockstar-scrapped-it-voice-actor-steven-ogg-says">Rockstar's canceled Trevor-centric story DLC</a> that was ditched in favor of more GTA Online content.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-looter-shooter-games-ranked.1304655/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being one of the more recognisable sub-genres in gaming, you may be surprised by just how precious few looter shooters there actually are. Putting together a list of the best of them revealed how rare a truly brilliant one is, presumably a result of how incredibly hard they are to make,  and their unfortunate tendency to go the way of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/anthem">Anthem</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</a> – cut short after failing to grab an audience. But what they lack in quantity, they more than make up for in just how many hours you can lose to them, and over the past nearly two decades I’ve spent more time with this genre than I’d care to admit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what qualifies as a looter shooter for the purposes of this list? Well, as the name implies they’ve got to have shooting (either first or third-person) as the primary way you interact with the world, and all those shell casings and/or laser bolts need to reward loot (almost always including randomized drops) that keeps you playing and lures you into a hard-to-resist endgame. Ongoing games like Destiny and more traditional, non-live-service games like Outriders are both eligible, so long as there’s some kind of ongoing endgame or hook to keep you playing. In essence, we’re looking for games that, one way or another, adhere to the original premise of the looter shooter genre: what if we took an ARPG like Diablo and turned it into a shooter?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If, like me, you can’t seem to get enough of shooting monsters in the face to claim glorious gear, here are our top 14 looter shooter recommendations.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">14. Crab Champions</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/crab-champions-1756909970204.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the weirder looter shooters you can play right now is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crab-champions">Crab Champions</a>, a roguelike where you play as a gun-toting crab facing off against fellow crustaceans and mean-looking floating heads, claiming badass loot in the process. The fast-paced, over-the-top combat might not be as technically advanced as its peers, but what it lacks in bells and whistles it more than makes up for in pure dopey charm. Plus, it's missing the usual add-ons and microtransactions you often find in other looter shooters, and thus comes as a complete package with no hidden costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This one is still in active development and currently available through Steam’s early access program, but at just $10 it’s absolutely worth checking out, especially since it’s such an obvious breath of fresh air from the usual looter shooter aesthetic. I’m a sucker for goofy takes on genres I love and you’d be hard-pressed to find a sillier option out there than this one. It’s also developed by a single person, which is pretty impressive given how much fun I’ve managed to squeeze out of this one in the past year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">13. Shadow Warrior 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/shadow-warrior-2-1756910027001.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the more underrated shooters I’ve played is the Shadow Warrior series, specifically the reboot that kicked off in 2013, which continues to experiment and reinvent itself (for better or worse) with each iteration. While the first and third games are linear, story-focused adventures, the second game in the trilogy took a detour into the world of looter shooters, with semi-open-world, procedurally generated areas and an emphasis on randomized loot that puts it squarely in the same category as Borderlands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/shadow-warrior-2">Shadow Warrior 2</a> is very tongue-in-cheek, despite the fact that you spend most of your time tearing demons into pink chunks like something out of Doom, and my friends and I spent over a hundred hours giggling as we grinded for loot and enjoyed the series’ unique brand of lowbrow humor. Gunplay is nothing to write home about and the buildcrafting is definitely on the more simplistic side that makes it feel like less of an RPG than many of its peers, but it’s still quite a good time, and one of my favorite turn-you-brain-off games when I just want to whale on some ugly looking monsters.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">12. Borderlands 3</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/borderlands-3-1756910090091.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> did a whole lot to improve the Borderlands series’ gunplay and graphics when it launched in 2019, it also exists in a very weird spot in the franchise’s history, where it felt like developer Gearbox had allowed itself to be left in the dust in a genre it itself pioneered. The gunplay was solid, but easily outclassed by games like Destiny, and the loot was awesome, but buildcrafting among its peers had already evolved beyond Borderlands 3’s somewhat shallow options. Throw in some pretty questionable decisions where comedy writing and antagonists are concerned, and you’ve got what I consider to be the weakest entry in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, this is still a Borderlands game and that means even on a bad day it’s damn fun to play. With a really neat interplanetary campaign and an irresponsible number of weapons to hunt, I spent quite a few evenings playing this one. And thanks to that improved gunplay, if you’re looking for the Borderlands game that feels better than most of the others (excepting Borderlands 4), then this is your port of call.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">11. Outriders</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/outriders-1756910151315.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">People Can Fly’s foray into the looter shooter space may not have been the most original iteration, notably taking quite a few queues from the likes of The Division, but it remains one of the more memorable looter shooters on this list. As supernaturally powered warriors, you’ll run around turning raiders into gobs of meat while claiming loads of loot. One thing that sets <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/outriders">Outriders</a> apart from the rest of the pack is just how great its buildcrafting is, especially with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/outriders-worldslayer-review">Worldslayer expansion</a> upping its game pretty significantly. I spent a ton of time optimizing my various characters’ builds for the procedurally generated raid activity, and geeking out over various stat numbers. Looter shooters aren’t always the best at embracing the RPG side of their mechanics, but Outriders really excels in this area – it rules.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also a big fan of the fact that the developers decided not to make Outriders a live-service game, instead supporting it with a single (and pretty awesome) expansion. Don’t get me wrong: I’m quite a big fan of games-as-a-service projects, but not every looter shooter needs to go down that path, and Outriders never made me feel the pressure to play more than I ever wanted to play – I got in, had a great time, and then moved on to the next game. I really appreciated that. For that reason, this is an excellent option to play with your friend group if you’re looking for more good times in the genre, but you don’t want to get wrapped up in hundreds of hours of content that threatens to devour your life.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/borderlands-the-pre-sequel-1756910207457.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Sure, Borderlands’ detour to the moon after the phenomenal Borderlands 2 was mostly an excuse to secure more screentime for everyone’s favorite baddie, Handsome Jack, and keep the franchise warm while we waited for a proper sequel, but it’s also a very solid shooter with a surprising amount of meat on its bones where story is concerned. The unique setting of Pandora’s moon and the low-gravity, oxygen-juggling implications of that choice are certainly controversial, but I for one never stopped loving those glorious buttslams.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Really, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-the-pre-sequel">The Pre-Sequel</a>’s biggest sin is that it does almost nothing to evolve the series, instead feeling more like an elaborate expansion of Borderlands 2 with low-gravity environments. But more Borderlands 2 really isn’t such a bad thing, and this one still holds up to this day.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-1756910264733.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A spinoff of the Borderlands series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tiny-tinas-wonderlands">Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</a> is the only (sorta, kinda) fantasy game on a list that’s dominated by sci-fi games. Taking place within a D&amp;D-like tabletop RPG called Bunkers &amp; Badasses (which has since become <a href="https://tinytinagames.com/products/bunkers-badasses-science-fantasy-role-playing-game-system-sourcebook" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an actual tabletop RPG</a>,) this deeply inappropriate shooter is basically Borderlands dressed in wizard robes, featuring many of the iconic characters and mechanics for which Gearbox’s looter shooter series is known. It takes a few risks here and there with things like the overworld map that helps your journey feel a bit more like a proper tabletop adventure, but otherwise plays it extremely close to the blueprint established by the mainline series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-review-pc-xbox-playstation">I really enjoyed my time with Tiny Tina’s Wonderland</a>, but it ultimately sits quite a bit below the best entries of the original series just based on how much it borrows, as well as the fact that it fails to live up to the comedy chops of the likes of Borderlands 2 (more on that later). Still, if you’re looking to sink a ton of time into a wonderfully silly shooter that sets itself apart from the rest of the pack with a unique fantasy skin, this one’s very easy to enthusiastically recommend.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Destiny</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/destiny-1756910382690.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Say what you want about the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny">Destiny</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/fireteamchat" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">God knows I have</a>), but it changed the looter shooter genre in too many ways to count. That might irk those who aren’t a fan of live-service games, but the idea that looter shooters were going to be big-budget, ongoing adventures that spanned years was a massive step forward for the genre. With beautiful worlds to explore, one of the best game soundtracks of all time, and first-person action that still eclipses most of its peers this one deserves its kudos, even if it’s no longer receiving new content. It also introduced World of Warcraft-like raids that have since become the gold standard for its peers, inspiring those that followed, like The Division or Outriders, to do the same. On top of all that, it’s got some fantastic PvP modes that I’ve lost thousands of hours to over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yeah, you’ve got to deal with one of the most convoluted, almost nonsensical stories in the world, plus some really questionable grinds that nearly drove me to madness of more than one occasion, but Bungie makes all that worth it with some of the best gunplay looter shooters have ever had.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Borderlands</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/borderlands-1756910461839.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As the progenitor for many of the ideas that came after, the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands">Borderlands</a> game deserves its roses for being the first of its kind (or at least the first massively successful one). Now over 15 years old, it definitely has its rough edges where gameplay, environment diversity, and other bells and whistles are concerned, but Gearbox managed to pull off what no one had before: turning a first-person shooter into a Diablo-like ARPG that was actually fun to play. The four vault hunters are iconic (having passed into legend at this point) and are a lot of fun to build into, and their quaint adventure through the deserts of Pandora is one I’ll always remember fondly despite its hilariously bad ending.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And though Borderlands definitely felt like a prototype of better games to come, it also had some surprisingly good comedy writing and DLC support that kept me playing with friends years after its debut. In 2009, when expansions of this kind were rare and the looter shooter genre didn’t exist, Borderlands paved the way for everything that came after.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Tom Clancy's The Division 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/the-division-2-1756910519899.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we’re getting to the real heavy hitters, starting off with one of the greats of the live-service shooter. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-2">The Division 2</a> is one of the best experiences to be had in this space. With tons of great loot, some of the toughest raid activities ever devised, awesome buildcrafting, and the absolutely stellar “dark zone” mechanics that add a mini extraction shooter right in the middle of your co-op game, The Division 2 built on just about everything its predecessor did well and then some.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also fills a niche of more realistic looter shooters with its dark, post-apocalyptic world where you’re fighting other humans instead of aliens or monsters. Sometimes this results in odd things, like a guy in a hoodie surviving a dozen shotgun blasts to the head, but if you’re able to put aside just how weird that is, you’re in for a good time. Best of all, both the games in this series have a whole lot of content to dive into, much of which still has an active playerbase to engage with.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Destiny 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/destiny-2-1756910584724.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After its predecessor pioneered the live-service model, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> expanded on those ideas and is fast approaching a decade of content. It hasn’t always been consistent in being a fun game to play, and swings wildly from incredibly compelling expansions to absolute duds that make me want to put my head through a stained glass window. That’s bound to happen when you’re developing a game for this long and putting out thousands upon thousands of hours of content though, and when Destiny 2 pulls it off it’s without question one of the best looter shooters out there by a country mile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s due in no small part to its absolutely fantastic gunplay, which has kept me playing even through the numerous dark times and content droughts. Campaigns like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-witch-queen-review">The Witch Queen</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review">The Final Shape</a> are some of the better stories looter shooters have told, the abilities and buildcrafting options have been built up over the course of years to the point where they feel quite good and have a ton of options to choose from. Best of all, it just has so much dang content that you could play every day for a year straight and still not run out of compelling things to do. It hasn’t always excelled in its loot, is often painfully grindy (including with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-review">its most recent expansion</a>), and is incredibly inconsistent in the quality of its storytelling, but man, you’ve gotta hand it to Bungie for keeping this game relevant for as long as they have. The industry simply wouldn’t be the same without it!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Warframe</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/warframe-1756910633727.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, okay, technically <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a> is more of a looter slasher than a shooter, but it would feel downright weird to not include it in this list given its influence on the genre and incredible amount of overlap. Taking on the role of a space ninja that’s absolutely dripping with swagger, Warframe has eaten up a ton of my time over the years with its never-ending grind and good times with friends. It also manages to pull off the free-to-play model quite well (or at least has a fairly consistent record), which makes it a pretty easy sell to your frugal co-op teammates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also impressive just how long this thing has been going on – it actually predates even Destiny –  with the caveat that to this very day Warframe’s developers still claim the game remains in open beta (yes, really). I don’t play Warframe consistently, but every time I’ve logged on in the past decade it’s had mechanics added to it that make it feel like a completely different animal, including space combat, roguelike zones, and even a time-traveling DLC with motorcycle riding and romance mechanics. I dunno, man. This game is just…insanely good.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Borderlands 4</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/borderlands-4-1756910697289.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you haven’t yet heard the news, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> is out now and is one of my favorite looter shooters of all time. Even this early into its lifespan, with plenty of bugs, performance issues, and general wonkiness going on, this massive, open-world reimagining of the series represents a massive leap forward from Borderlands 3 that takes some interesting risks that overwhelmingly pay off, like a more grounded story and an entirely new setting in Kairos that steps quite far away from the familiarity and nostalgia of Pandora. It also makes some pretty stellar improvements to gunplay, specifically where mobility is concerned, and gliding and grapple hooking around with friends as you blow things up with the most ridiculous arsenal imaginable has been (and likely will continue to be) one of my favorite experiences in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 might very well go on to be even higher on this list, possibly even taking the top slot once various patches and content drops address some of my nitpicks with it, but even now it’s already stolen my heart and over 60 hours of my time. The future for the Borderlands series is looking quite bright – especially considering there’s already a whole roadmap charting out the next six months of content, which includes a new playable vault hunter.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Remnant 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/remnant-2-1756910761610.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Often described as “Dark Souls with guns,” the Remnant series has an incredibly unique take by combining a smattering of soulslike mechanics and roguelike features with looter shooter goodness, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/remnant-ii">Remnant 2</a> absolutely nails combining the ideas of all three. I should caveat this by saying that me categorizing Remnant 2 as a looter shooter will be controversial, primarily because this is the only game on this list that doesn’t have randomized loot or a grind that requires completing the same activities a bunch of times – both hallmarks of what makes the genre what it is. Instead, you take on significantly challenging activities and once you manage to beat them once, you get guaranteed loot that removes any need to replay it again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it takes so many other cues from looter shooters, from gameplay, to buildcrafting, to working together with a co-op team to take down some horrifying boss to get that piece of equipment or weapon you’ve been dying to add to your build, plus has plenty of reasons to keep playing long after you’ve beaten the campaign. The fact that it bucks some of the trends found in most other looter shooters, specifically the need to grind, might actually be one of the reasons this one ranks so highly for me (Remnant 2 was one of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remnant-2-review">my favorite games of 2023</a>, after all). If you haven’t played it yet and you’re a fan of looter shooters, I cannot recommend it enough.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Borderlands 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/borderlands-2-1756910828347.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As much as I adore the hot, newness of Borderlands 4, it’s quite hard to contend with the series’ magnum opus: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-2">Borderlands 2</a>. It is still hands down the best looter shooter we’ve got. With an almost unbelievable number of weapons, some of the best comedy writing in gaming history (tip of the hat to good ol’ Handsome Jack), and a story that’s surprisingly emotional right when you expect it to be silly and shallow, I spent more than a thousand hours in Borderlands 2 back when that wasn’t really a thing people ever did with games that didn’t have competitive multiplayer matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obviously this game is over a decade old and so doesn’t quite hold up in certain areas like gunplay, movement, or buildcrafting, but after replaying it fairly recently I was shocked to see how well it still holds up. And where the original Borderlands game was the one that spawned all the looter shooters to come, Borderlands 2 was arguably even more influential in its impact on the genre, refining the concepts from the original and implementing new ideas that would later be iterated on by its peers, like how its endgame treadmill went on to inspire Destiny, Warframe, Outriders, and others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there you have it! Those are our top 14 looter shooters you can play right now. Which is your favorite? Any good ones we missed?

                <p>This past weekend saw the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s new battle royale mode, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-chaotic-delulu-mode-what-you-need-to-know-about-proximity-chat-battle-royale/1100-6534895/" data-ref-id="1100-6534895">Delulu</a>. A take on Fortnite's familiar formula, the catch here is that you can talk to anyone--whether squaded up or not--thanks to the new proximity chat. While this adds a nice layer of sociality to the game, it's also resulted in an increase in discrimination and harassment, which led to developer Epic Games banning "thousands" of accounts before the weekend closed out.</p><p>Delulu is exactly what you think it would be if you're familiar with both Fortnite and internet slang. Cutesy shorthand for "delusional," this new mode sees you potentially team up with--and likely betray, as there can only be one winner--anyone you see thanks to proximity chat. As you near another player, you can form a sort of temporary group chat to strategize as you play. This seems like it could be a fabulous idea, particularly for players who tend to play solo but still want to coordinate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox Game Pass has been a hot topic since its launch in 2017, sometimes for positive reasons, though increasingly for negative or, at the very least, mixed reasons. Through all its trials and tribulations, though, Microsoft and Xbox put itself on the Game Pass path, and have shown no signs of wanting to pivot. In fact, according to ID@Xbox, in 2025, Microsoft and Xbox are putting more behind Game Pass than ever before.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation">Eurogamer</a>, head of Xbox's ID@Xbox program, Chris Charla, spoke about how Xbox is investing more in Game Pass in 2025 than it ever has.</p>



<p>"<em>The majority of partners who've had a game in Game Pass want to bring their future titles to the service,</em>" Charla said. "<em>As a result, we've signed deals with more than 150 partners to expand the catalogue. We continue to engage with hundreds of partners each year to review upcoming titles.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Last year, we worked with over 50 teams to sign their first Game Pass deal. This year marks our largest investment in Game Pass to date, and we remain focused on delivering the most exciting and diverse catalogue in gaming.</em>"</p>



<p>All things considered, it's not surprising to see Microsoft continuing to double down on Xbox Game Pass. Despite numerous comments from <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-unsustainable-harmful-industry-arkane-founder/">multiple</a> former<a href="https://wccftech.com/subscription-services-arent-rewarding-content-makers/"> Xbox Studios developers</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/">analyst reports</a>, and examples we've seen of just <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-spends-50k-50m-to-get-games-onto-xbox-game-pass/">how much Xbox is putting into every game it brings to the service</a>, the latest financial reports from Microsoft show that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenue-grew-13-percent-this-quarter/">Xbox revenue is growing</a>. Game Pass brings in $5 billion a year, according to Microsoft.</p>



<p>It may have deeper ramifications for the industry and the games on the service, as has <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-games-lose-80-sales/">been pointed out several times</a>, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a time when Microsoft was more concerned with the deeper cultural ramifications of an area of its business than how well that business was performing on its bank sheet.</p>



<p>The future of the Xbox platform has been tied to Xbox Game Pass since 2017, and at least in the near future, it doesn't look like that's going to change.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Embark Studios announced the release date of its third-person extraction shooter game ARC Raiders. The game will be available on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/arc-raiders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on October 30. To prepare for the full launch, the studio will conduct a final public test titled 'Server Slam' between Friday, October 17, and Sunday, October 19. The featured map will be Dam Battlegrounds; participants in the event will receive an exclusive Backpack cosmetic reward, unlocked at launch with a full game purchase.</p>



<p>Aleksander Grøndal, Executive Producer at Embark Studios, said:</p>



<p><em>We’re excited to welcome Raiders to the Server Slam — this is where we’ll really put ARC Raiders through its paces ahead of full launch. Our goal is simple: make sure that on October 30, when the servers go live, every player experiences the game exactly as we’ve intended — polished, balanced, and ready for action. Thanks for joining us — let's prepare to go topside.</em></p>

<p>ARC Raiders is also available for pre-order now. The Standard Edition is priced $39.99 and comes with the Lucky Duck Bundle pre-order bonus (Backpack: Hatchling, Backpack Charm: Golden Rubber Duck). The Deluxe Edition is priced $59.99 and adds an extra pre-order bonus, the Astro Bundle, which comes with a Legendary Outfit (G-Suit + color variants), a Backpack (Salvager), and a Backpack Attachment (Spaceship Souvenir). It also includes the following exclusive content:</p>



<ul>
<li>Legendary Outfit: Valente Legendary + color variants</li>



<li>Backpack: Pathfinder</li>



<li>Backpack Attachment: Blanket Roll</li>



<li>Face Cosmetic: Lip Scar</li>



<li>Skin: Cowboy Scrappy</li>



<li>Emote: Finger Gun: Rapid Fire</li>



<li>2,400 Raider Tokens</li>
</ul>



<p>ARC Raiders was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2021 as a free-to-play cooperative shooter. It was also meant to be their debut title, but the arena shooter The Finals passed it in that regard. Meanwhile, ARC Raiders was delayed and <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repurposed into a PvPvE extraction shooter</a>. It'll face stiff competition in a very saturated genre, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-tech-test-hands-on-promising-extractions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our early test</a> suggests it may just have the right cards to succeed.</p>
