<p>Achievements for Switch and much more</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Argonaut Games has announced its Croc remaster is getting a major update. It's officially titled <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/croc_legend_of_the_gobbos">Croc Legend of the Gobbos Platinum Edition</a></strong>.</p>
<p>This free update will be applied to the console versions of the game (including Switch) on <strong>16th October 2025</strong> and promises to deliver the "best possible Croc gaming experience".</p>
<p>The 'Platinum Edition' of the game will include a new Time Attack mode, 25+ additions to the Crocipedia, the ability to swap between Croc Main Theme mixes in the main menu, bug fixes, and a bunch of quality-of-life features and improvements.</p>
<p>The team also explains how the name change is tied to PlayStation's Trophies. This update adds a new trophy set and will also bring these same achievements to the Switch with its own "in-game Achievement tracking screen".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"So why the new name? Great question! When we initially launched the <em>Croc Legend of the Gobbos</em> remaster<em>,</em> we didn’t include enough trophies to qualify for the Platinum trophy on PlayStation. And it’s not permitted to simply fix this with a patch. So we had to come up with a smarter solution: release a new version of the game with a comprehensive trophy set, including 16 new Trophies and the highly coveted Platinum Trophy."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 review embargo date is quickly approaching, giving everyone a first glimpse at what you can expect from the upcoming game from your favorite critic or content creator.</p>



<p>This sequel is easily <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-the-outer-worlds-2-pre-order-bonuses-editions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the more anticipated games of 2025</a>, with many RPG fans ready to jump back into this galactic universe full of flawed people and chaos.</p>



<p>Here is when you can expect The Outer Worlds 2 review embargo to lift.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2-review-embargo-date-explained">The Outer Worlds 2 Review Embargo Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No need to rush, the reviews are coming soon. Image by Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Outer Worlds 2 review embargo is set for October 23 at 9 AM ET.</strong></p>



<p>When the clock strikes 9 in the morning along the East Coast, you can expect plenty of sites and YouTube channels to start dropping their reviews for the game. If you are curious if one of your favorite critics or content creators is covering the game, you should consider checking their social media accounts. Many have already posted that they are playing the game early and will be working on a review when the time comes.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2-review-scores-prediction">The Outer Worlds 2 Review Scores Prediction</h2>



<p><strong>Given that the game is a direct sequel and will do many of the same things that the original did, but expanded, you can probably expect The Outer Worlds 2 to have a similar review score to the first game. Somewhere between 83-87 makes sense for this kind of game.</strong></p>



<p>The first Outer Worlds game sits at 85 on MetaCritic, with the remastered Spacer’s Choice at 72 because of performance issues and not really bettering the experience in any way. Unless the sequel is absolutely mired in bugs and glitches, it shouldn’t fare too poorly with critics.</p>



<p>To some who are thinking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-the-outer-worlds-2-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a> might be their most anticipated game of 2025, an 85 might seem low. Of course, we haven’t played the game yet to know for sure, but that is actually a very good score for any game release, let alone an RPG. That being said, if you are expecting the game to contend with other top games this year that reach well into the 90s, you might come away disappointed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Obsidian Entertainment</a> is a brilliant development studio with tons of talent and a great back catalog of games, they’ve never been one to have a game score 90 on MetaCritic outside of Pentiment, which was a shock to just about everyone. We’re willing to be surprised, but don’t expect it.</p>

<p>What are your guesses for The Outer Worlds 2 review scores? Do you think it can contend for the best Obsidian games ever? Or will it be more in line with the original game? Let us know in the comments or on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

                <p>In June, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fbc-firebreak-review-controlled-chaos/1900-6418376/">FBC: Firebreak</a> became Remedy's first self-published game as the company attempted to expand its shared universe that includes Control and Alan Wake. Remedy has previously disclosed that Firebreak's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedy-is-unsatisfied-with-fbc-firebreak-sales-but-it-still-plans-to-turn-things-around/1100-6533852/" data-ref-id="1100-6533852">sales came in below expectations</a>, but the latest report indicates that the game will cost the company a very significant write down.</p><p>Ahead of Remedy's quarterly financial report on October 29, the company <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=b4d23a32-03e7-49e5-bbc3-93ec062699a5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared an update</a> that it is on the hook for a €14.9 million loss or approximately $17,234,085. Remedy notes that this amounts to "a majority of the game’s capitalized development costs," before adding that the company's cash position hasn't been changed by this setback.</p><p>Firebreak ran into trouble out of the gate with 1,992 players on launch day, which turned out to be its peak. Those numbers <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/charts/#max" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">have since drastically fallen</a> to less than 100 concurrent players per day.

The update also made significant changes to how players pick their missions. However, Remedy noted in its report that the update has not met its' "internal targets" despite earning "improved player and sales metrics."</p><p>The company is currently working <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-alan-wake-2-every-game-remedy-is-working-on-right-now/1100-6514998/" data-ref-id="1100-6514998">on Control 2</a>, in addition to the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake project alongside Rockstar Games.

<p>Get ready, trainers</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>The end of this month officially marks the first anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> on mobile devices.</p>
<p>This title has been regularly updated with new expansions and features like trading, and soon it will receive even more "new and updated" features in the form of three major updates "coming soon".</p>
<p>There's the new share feature, the tradable cards list is being expanded, and there'll be improvements to the wonder pick feature. Here's some PR about each feature, and you can see it all in action in the trailer above.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Implementation of the new share feature</strong>
<ul>
<li>A feature that lets you give ♢–♢♢♢♢ rarity cards to friends.</li>
<li>You can send one card to each of your friends each day.</li>
<li>Once friends send you cards through the share feature, you can select and receive one card each day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Range of tradable cards expanded</strong>
<ul>
<li>You will be able to trade cards from even the most recent booster packs.</li>
<li>In addition to cards of ♢–♢♢♢♢ rarity and ⭐︎1 rarities, ⭐︎2 and Shiny 1–Shiny 2 rarity cards will also be eligible for trading.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Improvements to the wonder pick feature</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cards from the latest expansion that you have not obtained will appear more often.</li>
<li>The number of cards you currently own will be displayed on each card in wonder pick.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The team says it's working hard to bring these updates to players "in the best possible way" and continues to listen to player feedback while developing and maintaining the title. The Mega Evolution expansion will also kick off at the end of October.</p>

There are hundreds of options included in this sale from some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">best puzzle brands</a> out there. If you're on the hunt for your next puzzle, or are just looking to grab a nice gift for the puzzler in your life, this promotion makes it a great time to save some money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To take advantage of the promotion, you'll just need to add two eligible jigsaw puzzles to your Amazon cart and the 50% discount will be applied to whichever one is the least expensive.

I couldn't possibly include them all, so I've only highlighted a few top picks that I think best represent what is included here. There's a fairly wide variety of piece counts, from 300 to 3000, but I mostly stuck to 1000-piece puzzles here as they are the most popular whenever I've covered a puzzle sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are looking for some suggestions for what to buy, the Spider-Verse puzzle from Buffalo games has been on our list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzles-for-adults">best puzzles for adults</a> for over a year now. It's got a ton of different Spideys and is consistently one of the most popular marvel puzzles out there. There's also the Disney &amp; Pixar Shop puzzle from Ravensburger that offers something similar for fans of Disney instead of Marvel. There's a bunch of characters and easter eggs hidden in each one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'd also recommend checking out The Drippy Trip puzzle. It's the latest puzzle made by The Magic Puzzle Company and actually <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-series-five-magic-puzzle-company-jigsaw-puzzle-features-art-from-an-adventure-time-designer">features a few fun secrets</a> from the popular cartoon Adventure Time. If you aren't familiar with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-magic-puzzle-company-jigsaw-puzzles">Magic Puzzle Company Puzzles</a>, they are a mix between jigsaw puzzle and magic kit and are generally very popular with families. There have been five different series of these types of puzzles and Amazon has a bunch of them featured in this sale right now.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Board Games Are Also Included</h3><div catalogid="c50f91cc-9caf-48e8-84b9-2ba2d04822db" id="229501"><div id="229501" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buy 1 Get 1 50% Off Board Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon's buy 1, get 1 50% off sale also extends to board games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Bengaluru, India-based developer <a title="Companies > Aeos Games" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/aeos-games">Aeos Games</a> have released a 12-minute early alpha gameplay trailer for <em><a title="Games > Unleash the Avatar" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/unleash-the-avatar">Unleash the Avatar</a></em>, showcasing the Soulslike <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,823 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPG</a>‘s combat systems, enemies, traversal, exploration, and more. <span id="more-999560"></span></p><p>“We’re big fans of Soulslikes thanks to their challenging combat and story-telling,” says Aeos Games CEO and co-founder Rohan Mayya in a press release. “And while it could be easy enough to reskin existing efforts and call it a day, our team has painstakingly built up everything from first principles. From our in-house, best-in-class photogrammetry to full-body mo-cap and even our bespoke enemy AI systems, every single bit of Unleash the Avatar has been lovingly hand-crafted.”</p><p>Mayya added, “Every wishlist counts because not only does it build our confidence that we’re making something you care about, but it signals to the world that Indian games have an audience. So if the trailer resonates with you and if you believe in a bold spin on the Soulslike genre from a scrappy team, please hit that wishlist button now.”</p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><div><p><strong>■ Latest Informaton</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Independent game developer Aeos Games revealed a substantial amount of gameplay for its upcoming Indian Epics-inspired Soulslike, <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>. The events of the game are set in an alternate version of India where the player is up against the wayward forces of Naraka (hell) who manage to unseal the barrier between realms. Along with challenging enemy encounters and memorable boss fights, players will also uncover the events that led to hell on earth and fight back the darkness for good.</p><p>The trailer shows off the haunting vistas of Vishwapur. This once pristine coastal locale is now overrun by Nisthari Rakshas. Players are tasked with defeating them with an assortment of combat options at their disposal ranging from genre staples like dodge, parry, and stagger attacks along with some new innovations like a ranged chakra and a flashy feather prism form.</p><p><strong>■ FAQ</strong></p><p>First up, we’d like to thank each and every one of you for your support for <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>. It’s heartening to see so many people care. Our team is heads down and working to get the game out so that we can live up to your expectations.</p><p>Now, before we start getting into how exactly <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> is built in terms of tech, art, world, and story, here’s all the basic information about the game in one place. This should clear doubts you have about <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> and what to expect.</p><p><strong>Who is Aeos Games?</strong></p><p>Aeos Games is the game development studio behind <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> and is a part of the Aeos group of companies. Founders are brothers Varun and Rohan Mayya. The core development team is a mix of newcomers and industry veterans that have worked on games such as <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> and <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>; and movies like <em>Shazam</em>&nbsp;and <em>Flash</em>.</p><p><strong>What is Unleash the Avatar?</strong></p><p><em>Unleash the Avatar</em> is an Indian Epic Soulslike set in an alternate timeline featuring flashy, intense combat against legendary foes.</p><p><strong>What’s <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>‘s story about? What’s my character called?</strong></p><p>While it’s a little too early for us to reveal all of <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>‘s story, what we can say is, the game takes place in an age where the barrier between Naraka (Hell) and Earth has eroded and both Asuras and Rakshasas—have found their way to Earth. Imbued with a sliver of Lord Vishnu’s power, it is up to you to restore balance to the universe by putting an end to the demons’ sinister plans.</p><p><strong>Why is there an alternate India setting in this trailer that’s more inline with high fantasy instead of the relatively modern setting of the first trailer?</strong></p><p>The first trailer was meant to be a test of our photogrammetry systems and a public showing of our intent to work on a title from India.</p><p>Following feedback from our fans we felt the alternate high fantasy, Indian Epics-inspired setting you see now is more in line with the story we want to tell—and what our fans want to see—from a game like ours.</p><p><strong>What can I play <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> on? Can I wishlist it now?</strong></p><p>For now, <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> is slated for <a title="Platforms > PC [24,525 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via Steam. We’re currently evaluating other platforms as well and will announce them en route to launch. Stay tuned to our Steam page reveal and wishlist us to support what we do.</p><p><strong>Do I have to pay to play <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>?</strong></p><p><em>Unleash the Avatar</em> is a premium, one-time purchase. No battle passes. No loot boxes. No daily grind. No dark patterns.</p><p><strong>When will I be able to play <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>?</strong></p><p>Remember that this is our first production title so we may not be super accurate with our launch dates as it is hard to tell right now. Internally however, we’re on course for a 2026 launch window. We’re currently in the production phase so we do have playtests every now and then. If you would like to be a part of these, keep an eye on our socials for playtest announcement dates.</p><p><strong>Can I make videos on <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>? Will you copyright strike my channel? Is there an <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> creators program?</strong></p><p>Yes you can make videos on <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> and no we won’t copyright strike your channel. There are exceptions to this such as using <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> art, screenshots, videos, and gameplay to misrepresent the game or being in violation of our content creator guidelines. And yes, there is an <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> creators program. Stay tuned to our socials to know more.</p><p><strong>Is <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2?</strong></p><p>For now, <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> is slated for PC via Steam. We’re currently evaluating other platforms as well and will announce them en route to launch.</p><p><strong>Can I play <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> on the Steam Deck / ROG Ally / Xbox ROG Ally X / Lenovo Legion Go 2?</strong></p><p>We’re big fans of handheld PCs and we’d love to bring <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> to Steam Deck and other devices as well. Right now though, our focus is solely on desktops and laptop-grade computers.</p><p><strong>Is AI used in making <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>?</strong></p><p>If you’re referring to enemy AI systems that are a cornerstone of every soulslike, yes those exist. If you’re asking if we’re using generative AI tools to make Unleash the Avatar, the answer is no. The game is handcrafted with love by fans of the genre, using gen AI would be a disservice to soulslikes and their fans.</p><p><strong>Is there anything new that we get to see in <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> that isn’t in other games?</strong></p><p>Built from first principles, <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> runs on several custom systems: a fragmented-chakra engine with its own physics, enemy AI that knows when to reset posture, when to press, and how hard to push (tuned centrally), and a rigorously engineered parry model. Add generous chances to aura farm, and you get a soulslike that feels familiar, yet unmistakably new. We’ve also manually scanned countless photogrammetry assets from old towns in India specifically for <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>, so enjoy an authentic reconstruction of India in a video game!</p></div><p>Watch the trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/indian-epics-inspired-soulslike-action-rpg-unleash-the-avatar-early-alpha-gameplay-trailer]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">In April, the PEGI ratings website <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reportedly-been-rated-for-the-switch-2/1100-6531001/">listed Switch 2 as a platform for Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.

Assassin's Creed Shadows launched in March on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-announces-vantage-studios-a-creative-house-focused-on-three-major-franchises/1100-6535136/">Ubisoft revealed Vantage Studios</a>, which will oversee development on the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/astrobotanica-preview-puzzling-slice-of-survival</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/astrobotanica-preview-a-puzzling-slice-of-survival.1323991/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="25b964ba-1595-45a4-84b1-e7d705f5dc6c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/astrobotanica" rel="nofollow"><em>Astrobotanica</em></a>&nbsp;is an indie survival title being developed by&nbsp;Space Goblin Studio. Funded through a Kickstarter campaign, the title offers a relaxing survival experience during the prehistoric era of Earth. Playing as an alien named Xel, you have the technology to scan plants, animals, and cavemen, create various tonics that can cure illnesses, decrease air needs, and more. I've been interested in the game since I first heard about the Kickstarter campaign and jumped at the chance to dive into the demo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bulk of the demo consists of scanning different plants to learn what they do, interacting with one caveman named Ube, and solving puzzles. It gives a relatively well-rounded feel of what&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;offers to the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="taxonomy_term" data-entity-uuid="a90d9136-1388-4f79-8f46-10943fc6369d" href="https://techraptor.net/genre/survival" rel="nofollow">survival genre</a> mechanics wise. You scan plants and animals to see what they are. Scanning Neanderthals allows you to see what their current health status is. Interacting with them gives you to the chance to heal them and learn their language. Plants have different properties raw and when made into a tonic, with tonic making being a frequent action for surviving.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xel-scanning-ube-caveman-astrobotanica.jpg?itok=l_z1185A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xel-scanning-ube-caveman-astrobotanica.jpg?itok=v6sH8amU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are plenty of puzzles to solve. From collecting trophies to put in specific places, using plant juices, or pushing orbs found in ruins to their correct position, the puzzles stand out as one of the interesting parts of the game. Not only were there multiple things to solve, all of the puzzles were different. If this variety is kept up in the complete version it will give&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;the ability to stand out amongst competitors that have 2-3 puzzle layouts that repeat with various difficulty through those titles.</p>

<h2>Lacking a Hook</h2>

<p>While most of the game mechanics are well explained, there is zero story tying game aspects together. Why are you on this planet? Why do you want to heal Neanderthals? What is your name? The only way you find out what you're called or your appearance is from the P.R.I.M.A.L. tab. Besides that, there's little else to really give you a reason to do, well, anything. If you don't watch any trailers, read the in-depth Steam page description, or skim through news about&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>, you have no idea what the game is about. What is the over-arcing goal that you're meant to work towards?</p>

<p>Hopefully the lack of narrative is due to the demo being a small sample of the early access version.&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;is supposed to be rich with lore, and hints of that are present. You can find different idols and stone tablets while exploring the demo area. However, what they represent or say, and even where they are stored in your inventory, are mysteries.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/juice-puzzle-astrobotanica.jpg?itok=jNAgGHYc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/juice-puzzle-astrobotanica.jpg?itok=-9Pc0FlH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Regardless of missing narrative, there is a quest tracker that updates as you complete various tasks. These include scanning a plant, making a tonic, and healing Ube. There's no real draw to it, though. No fanfare is made when an objective is complete. It's not the biggest issue, but being reminded that a task changed and you're focusing on something else certainly helps streamline the quest cycle.</p>

<p>Other missing items include map markers on the map or being able to put a marker on the map. Even when you buy the P.R.I.M.A.L. HUD upgrade, the map remains unchanged and pretty much useless since you'll be using the HUD compass for all your navigation needs. Since you only have access to the first level of upgrades, map markers could be listed later on.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astrobotanica-primal-tab.jpg?itok=l_MNnIvf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astrobotanica-primal-tab.jpg?itok=iRIL09a3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>One other massive aspect of&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;that was missing in the demo was building. Many open-world survival games have building as one of the big draws to playing. You can design your own camp, create an epic castle, grow massive gardens, etc. The same can be said for this game based on the Kickstarter information. When it comes to the demo, you can't do any building aside from placing garden plots in the demo. You can see some structures you'll be able to construct in the future, but can't actually place them in the world, even if you do unlock the plan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game struggled as I continued to play. By the time I wrapped up my three hour session, it was consistently lagging, sluggish to load areas as I moved around, and put excess strain on my PC. This is a concern for players on older computers and those that like long gaming sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;may have a unique premise and story that is ready to set it apart from the competition, but with no narrative present in the demo and lacking many staple mechanics of the survival genre, it's hard to see it. Open world survival crafting games are extremely popular, with titles like&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="72a14f4d-4d77-4ace-a3aa-09008b8c98bf" href="https://techraptor.net/games/palworld" rel="nofollow">Palworld</a>,</em>&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="294eedd9-16ba-4c31-9a65-967aeca4d3fc" href="https://techraptor.net/games/enshrouded" rel="nofollow"><em>Enshrouded</em></a>, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5840301c-ab91-4d31-a561-7a7d64d82464" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/dune-awakening-interview-art-directors-gavin-whelan-and-david-levy" rel="nofollow"><em>Dune: Awakening</em></a>, and <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fbd23abe-125c-4cba-8afc-994aaf0735ef" href="https://techraptor.net/games/rust" rel="nofollow">Rust</a>.</em>&nbsp;It's a competitive niche to launch a game in.</p>

<p>Many of these smaller issues could be in development and were simply unready for the demo. Nonetheless, playing the demo didn't hook me. There was no story to grab my attention, and the mechanics present weren't unique enough to keep me wanting more.</p>

                <p>The details surrounding the first pack of paid DLC for Borderlands 4 have been revealed. Dropping November 20th, this narrative-based content--called Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day--will feature all new missions, enemies and legendary gear. </p><p>Developer Gearbox Software shared these details on October 11 during a panel at PAX Australia. Apparently, Mercenary Day (think Christmas) is being threatened by the Timekeeper’s Minister of Culture. It’s up to Rush and the vault hunters to show them the error of their ways using an assortment of guns, grenades, and all manner of skill-based attacks. </p>

<p>Aside from the loot gained from completing missions and extra collectibles (like a new Drone Skin or Vault Hunter Style), players will also gain access to a Vault Card with unlockable rewards. There will be 24 cosmetic items to collect and 4 pieces of rerollable gear that can be earned multiple times, giving players a chance to roll each weapon with the “right” stats.</p><h3>The Bounty Pack 1 Vault Card loot:</h3><ul><li>4 rerollable weapons</li><li>4 Vault Hunter Heads usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe</li><li>4 Vault Hunter Skins usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe</li><li>5 Weapon Skins</li><li>5 Vehicle Skins</li><li>4 ECHO-4 Drone Skins</li><li>2 ECHO-4 Attachments</li></ul><p>Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day will be available for players who purchased either of the Borderlands 4 Deluxe editions. The bounty pack can also be purchased via a bundle (which includes all 4 packs) or as a single piece of DLC.</p><p>Gearbox also mentioned Borderlands 4's free seasonal content, including a new mini-event: Horrors of Kairos. From October 23 to November 6, players will be able to face tough world bosses in areas affected by blood rain. Each one will have a chance to drop new legendary loot. If that wasn’t enough, Gearbox is also planning to release new seasonal cosmetics through the use of SHiFT codes.</p><p>Then there’s the new endgame content coming in Q4, an early highlight being a tough boss called Bloomreaper the Invincible. Confronting this boss will be akin to starting a raid-like experience--players will have to adjust their builds in order to deal with Bloomreaper’s giant health pool and powerful attacks. Basically, Borderlands fans have a lot to look forward to.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The system specifications of the PlayStation 6 and next-generation Xbox have allegedly been finalized, and the next console by Microsoft is expected to consistently deliver better performance than Sony's system, according to a known leaker.</p>



<p>The rumors originate from the NeoGAF forums, where KeplerL2, a known AMD leaker with a solid track record, has commented on the recently<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/"> leaked specifications of the PS6</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">the so-called Xbox Magnus</a>, saying that <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/page-6#post-270890566">they have been finalized</a>, corroborating the information shared by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a>. </p>



<p>With these leaked specs in mind, the insider doesn't see <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270891283">how the PlayStation 6 can match the Xbox Magnus</a>, as it has fewer CPU cores, lower CPU frequency, fewer CUs (Compute Units), fewer ROPs (Render Output Units), lower GPU frequency, less cache, and memory bandwidth. The difference is not huge, but it is big enough that the next-gen Microsoft system is expected to deliver better performance in 100% of games, unlike this generation. Sony's system, however, should still have plenty of AI horsepower, as it should be capable of <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270893113">~1200 TOPs</a> (Trillion Operations Per Second), a huge jump from the PS5 Pro 300 TOPs.</p>



<p>The insider also commented on the RAM the PlayStation 6, the PlayStation handheld, and Xbox Magnus will likely have - <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270890829">30, 24, and 36GB, respectively.</a> For the two home systems, this would be a considerable jump over the 16GB of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, which was expected, considering that ray-tracing support and AI-powered features are likely to become more important than in the current generation.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough, it seems like Sony will be the only company to have two systems with different specs for the next generation. According to KeplerL2, <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270892965">a lower-end Xbox Magnus model is possible</a>, but nothing in the documentation they have seen suggests that this is going to happen.</p>



<p>While KeplerL2 has proven to be one of the more reliable sources for early hardware information in recent years,, we have to take what they have revealed with a massive grain of salt. With both the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-launching-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-amd-leaker/">PlayStation 6</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">Xbox Magnus reportedly targeting 2027</a>, however, it will likely not take much longer to learn more about Sony's and Microsoft's next-generation systems.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Variety is the spice of life, and this is incredibly relevant when playing TTRPG like Pathfinder. No one wants to battle the same sets of goblins and highway bandits over and over again. To add a bit of variety to our games, we took a look at the Bog Dwellers, Cave Lurkers, and Forest Stalkers.</p>

<p>These packs of painted minis are intended to add a bit of variety and flair to battles, matched to the region that you'd likely encounter them in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before even getting to what's in any of these packs I'm a fan of them being corralled by the region where you'd likely run into them. When there are just so many monsters in the Pathfinder Bestiary, it can be difficult when trying to build an encounter from scratch to know what is available to you.</p>

<p>These collections, even as a list of names online, allows players searching for a new foe to throw into a Forest or Swamp encounter a few interesting alternatives because again… Variety is the spice of life.</p>



<p>Inside the Pathfinder Battles Bog Dwellers pack you'll find miniatures for the following creatures:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Grimstalker</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Mudwretch</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Castoroides</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Bog Mummy</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Boggard Scout</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Shimmernewt</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-02.jpg?itok=GXtaisgD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-02.jpg?itok=F6X1XK5x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This group can be split pretty evenly between the cuties and the creepies. The cuties are made up of the Castoroides, the large beaver-like creature, the Boggard Scout, ready to pounce or attack with it's conch morning star, and the Shimmernewt, who really isn't doing anything… Ironically the Shimmernewt is the deadliest of these creatures at CR 6.</p>

<p>These characters stand out with bright colors or recognizable features. The Castoroides and Boggard both do a good job of directing you towards their features, informing you about their abilities. Whether it be the Castoroised claws and tail, or the weapon the Boggard is wielding and it's dexterity. While the Shimmernewt is just standing their it's bright color immediately draws your eye.</p>

<p>On the creepier side the Grimstalker and Bog Mummy both fall into a very similar looking "Swamp Zombie" category. While accurate to the look the meshing of the dark greens and brown does give these minis a bit of a legibility issue when across the table from you.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-06.jpg?itok=Oy1Ctn74 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-06.jpg?itok=29m_T2q- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Ironically, the Mudwretch, who is a humanoid pile of mud, is predominantly brown but the bulkier features like his large fingers and drooping face are actually easier to see at a distance.</p>

<h2>Pathfinder Battles Cave Lurkers</h2>

<p>Inside the Pathfinder Battles Cave Lurkers pack you'll find miniatures for the following creatures:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Xulgath Skirmisher</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Xulgath Stoneliege</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Orc Warchief</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Myceloid</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Hunting Spider</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Cave Scorpion</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-03.jpg?itok=QEEpN386 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-03.jpg?itok=yodPx5VQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I'm in love with every single mini in this pack. Of the humanoid creatures – Xulgath Skirmisher, Xulgath Stoneliege, and the Orc Warchief – each has been modeled with great motion or intention. Whether it's a hunched sneer or standing square on shouting each of these characters gives a sense of personality.</p>

<p>The Orc Warchief is a perfect example of what I like seeing from packs like these. They might not all be fodder enemies, but when you want one mini to really stand out from the rest in the pack you want it to be eyecatching. Putting a variety of Orc's on a battle map I want no one at my table to question that the one with the battle flags brandishing the giant mace is going to be the one that gives the most trouble.</p>

<p>Minis where everyone is the same are great to fill a battlefield, but when there is uniqueness it allows a level of immersion in the gameplay that lets the characters, through their player's eyes, infer more about the battlefield.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-07.jpg?itok=cLcVvKGJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-07.jpg?itok=pcNrHdtP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Myceloid is another fascinating creature in just how harshly it's colors juxtapose what you normally see from monsters. Instead of dull colors and realism it's fluorescent green with a hot pink mushroom cap. It's screaming "Danger" in nature.</p>

<p>For the little creepy crawlies, the Hunting Spider and Cave Scorpion, the Cave Scorpion is very plain looking, but the Hunting Spider does a lot to stick out compared to other spider miniatures I've seen. Normally going for a a texture and color of the black hairs on a spider the purple gives off a sense of poison and a hard carapace for defense.</p>

<h2>Pathfinder Battles Forest Stalkers</h2>

<p>Inside the Pathfinder Battles Forest Stalkers pack you'll find miniatures for the following creatures:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Elf Hunter</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Werewolf</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Buso</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Wereboar</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Werebat</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Catfolk Bandit</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-04.jpg?itok=bmJyCCFp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-04.jpg?itok=muDFkJSt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This group of Forest Stalkers is an interesting mix of one standard creature, the Elf Hunter, one wood zombie, the Buso, and a mix of animal-human hybrids.</p>

<p>The Buso is by far the most terrifying thing in this collection as everything about it just seems a bit off. A slender body, but a pale grey, one eye on it's face and a head of hair that belongs in a 6th century monastery, and a curved machete in it's hand ready to swing.</p>

<p>For each of the humanoid hybrids, I'm a big fan of the varying levels of humanity. The Wereboar and Catfolk Bandit dressed as if they were in a town of their peers or heading out on adventures of their own, the Werebat seems to be in a state of transformation shredding a human form for it's present one, and the werewolf has embraced it's change wielding tools and… that's about it.</p>

<p>Immediately, things like these can inform a player of the scenario that they're in and they've been very deliberately picked.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-05.jpg?itok=VnQxJ0KJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-05.jpg?itok=j_MtsE4h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>If Three Is A Crowd, Two Is Company, Then What Is One?</h2>

<p>While each of these miniatures are a fantastic representation of the stat block in Pathfinder that they represent as any player will know even at early levels you'll want to be challenging your party with groups of more than one creature.</p>

<p>The different were-creatures can join together to form a group, as can the two Xulgath's, but for many of the other creatures here it can be hard to put just one down at the table.</p>

<p>A mix of creatures is a great way to get hero or boss style creatures, like the Orc Warchief, but something like a Hunter Spider or Buggard Scout might fare better in a Spider or Buggard themed collection.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-08.jpg?itok=TtFxij1u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-08.jpg?itok=X3EDiYcc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Some of these characters definitely deserve their solo focus, but others come across as pack creatures that you'd want to have a few of if you plan to populate your table with accurate representations for combat.</p>

<h2>Bog Dwellers, Cave Lurkers, and Forest Stalkers Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The Bog Dwellers, Cave Lurkers, and Forest Stalkers of this Wizkids Pathfinder Battles collection is filled with creatures worth of standing as direct foes to your characters, as well as some casual fodder for them to encounter in a random battle along the way.</p>

<p>The strengths in this set are that each mini can help to prompt a GM to get their mind racing about unique encounters related to the location of the bundle. You're headed into a bog or swamp? Well do you want the party to encounter swamp zombies, local fauna, or a brightly lit lizard?</p>

<p>The downside of these collections is that while you'll get a good representation for one or two of a similarly grouped enemy, you won't have enough to run an encounter without having to say "imagine all of them look like this guy" while gesturing to the Shimmernewt.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>More leaks about Pokémon Gen 10, Wind and Wave, have surfaced online, revealing details about the boss fight and the MMO features. </p>



<p>Today has been a big day for Pokémon leaks, with new information coming up online by the minute. We have already been informed about Pokémon Wind and Wave’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-and-waves-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story, setting, new mechanics</a>, and other details. Now, more leaks have appeared detailing the Gen 10 title’s boss fight and MMO features. </p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-wind-and-wave-has-18-boss-fights">Pokémon Wind and Wave Has 18 Boss Fights </h2>



<p>According to new posts by CentroLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977825751467704701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, in Pokémon Wind and Wave, players will be able to beat the game without having to complete all the gyms or even capturing the legendary. All these missions are optional, but must be completed to get the true ending. Players will have the option to challenge the final boss as soon as they receive the ability to traverse the sea. However, beating it in the early game “will be a lot more difficult”.</p>



<p>Coming to the bosses, players will have to fight Wind and Wave Gyms and Titan/Lord Pokémon mixed. There are 18 total challenges, each belonging to a specific Pokémon type. These challenges are inspired by the ‘Sustainable Development Goals’, and clearing all of them allows the player to challenge the champion.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>In Pokémon Wind/Wave the Gyms and the Titan/Lord Pokémon are mixed together</p><p>– There are in total 18 challenges, one for each type.<br>– They will be inspired by the Sustainable Development Goals<br>– Clearing all the 18 challenges allows you to challenge the Champion <a href="https://t.co/78je4sCij4">pic.twitter.com/78je4sCij4</a></p></div>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977827351137591608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-wind-and-wave-mmo-details-codename-naia">Pokémon Wind and Wave MMO Details: Codename ‘Naia’</h2>



<p>Moving on to the MMO part, leaks suggest that Game Freak is looking to blend open-world and MMO elements into the Gen 10 title. The MMO features have been codenamed ‘Naia’, where players can upload the procedurally generated islands they discover to the Naia servers and play with other players. </p>



<h2 id="h-gen-10-wind-and-wave-seed-pokemon-details">Gen 10 Wind and Wave Seed Pokémon Details</h2>



<p>Lastly, more details about the Seed Pokémon have surfaced online. These Pokémon will be provided to the player at the start of their journey, and they need to train them to a certain level to enter the island where the main legendary resides. The island will be procedurally generated based on how trained the Seed Pokémon is. Lastly, the evolution of the Seed Pokémon is procedurally generated as well and includes unique patterns. Which means every player will have a unique Seed Pokémon. </p>



<p>Readers should take this information with a grain of salt as it doesn’t come from an official source. </p>

<p dir="ltr">In addition, EA is throwing in a free premium battle pass for Battlefield 6's upcoming Season 1. Those who already own the premium Season 1 battle pass through the game's pricier Phantom Edition will instead receive the Season 2 battle pass for free.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the EA App hiccups, Battlefield 6's launch was surprisingly smooth across platforms, especially compared to previous launches for the franchise, many of which resulted in extended periods of server downtime.</p><p dir="ltr">That said, some players did run into a few other issues players during the launch weekend. One bug, which saw jump momentum affected while using certain weapons, has already been <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1977388909471338958" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fixed</a>. A problem that still needs addressing allows players in multiplayer matches to get out of bounds and onto rooftops that aren't supposed to be accessible, creating problems for those in a match who aren't taking advantage of the exploit. It remains to be seen when a fix will be coming.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 saw a huge launch weekend, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-having-a-massive-debut-on-steam/1100-6535370/" data-ref-id="1100-6535370">surpassing 747,000 concurrent players on Steam</a> at its peak on launch day. Factor in those playing through the EA App or on consoles, and Battlefield 6 certainly looks to be off to a strong start overall. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">Battlefield 6 Season 1</a> will begin October 28, and will introduce multiple new maps, modes, weapons, and more to the game's all-out-warfare sandbox.</p><p dir="ltr">In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/battlefield-6-review-good-company/1900-6418420/" data-ref-id="1900-6418420">GameSpot's Battlefield 6 review</a>, writer Richard Wakeling gave the latest installment of the franchise an 8 out of 10. He noted that while its campaign is dull and forgettable, there's nothing quite like the multipronged chaos of its excellent multiplayer package, even if Battlefield 6 doesn't feel particularly fresh or new.</p>

                <p>A quietly canceled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-competitive-avatar-the-last-airbender-fighting-game-is-in-development/1100-6521131/" data-ref-id="1100-6521131">Avatar: The Last Airbender fighting game</a> has been reincarnated under a new development studio, with a trailer highlighting what fans of the popular animated series can expect from the one-on-one 2D fighter.</p><p dir="ltr">Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game (a working title) was revealed during an Avatar: The Last Airbender 20th anniversary panel at New York Comic Con, and is slated for a summer 2026 release. It will feature 12 playable characters at launch, with more to come as part of a seasonal release model.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws9w13UD6rs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ws9w13UD6rs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">While it's billed as a 1v1 fighter (and looks that way in the game's debut trailer), its description on Steam lists support characters that will influence a fighter's play style and grant new special moves. Some of the characters highlighted in the trailer include Aang, Korra, Zuko, Toph, Katara, Sokka, and Azula.</p><p dir="ltr">Visually, Avatar Legends looks to capture the look-and-feel of the beloved animated show, with a hand-drawn 2D art style and an emphasis on movement-centric gameplay and a "unique flow system." The game will feature a single-player campaign sporting an original story, as well as a combo trials mode and "best-in-class net code and cross play" for online multiplayer.</p><p dir="ltr">"Designed for both newcomers and veterans, it channels the energy of classic fighting games while breaking new ground in movement, style, and combat expression," the game's Steam page reads.</p><p dir="ltr">An untitled Avatar fighting game in development under Maximum Entertainment was canceled with little fanfare last year via a <a href="https://storage.mfn.se/a6d02489-03d2-4624-a052-18a3d85916bb/eng-me-interim-q32024-report-vf.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">quarterly earnings report</a>.

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest">Next Fest</a> is back! The biannual Steam event that celebrates demos for hundreds of forthcoming games begins today, October 13, and runs until 1 p.m. ET on October 20. But with 3,276 demos to choose from, it’s an overwhelming beast. Fear not, for we—like the brave knights we are—are here to highlight some of the best we’ve found across a breadth of genres, from indie to AAA.</p> <p>I like to think of Next Fest as the games industry’s demonstration that <a href="https://kotaku.com/genres-fps-hero-shooter-adventure-rts-action-opinion-1851772168">genres don’t mean anything any more</a>, as the thousands of demos are categorized through a combination of lies and jazz, and the words “point-and-click” are taken to mean “games that feature pointy objects and clicking sounds.” It can make looking for particular types of games an astonishing headache. So instead, push all such intentions aside: Next Fest is best enjoyed by just scrolling through into the deepest recesses and installing anything that catches your eye. Forget about the sorts of games you already like; instead plunge in deep and experiment. And to save your scroll wheel, we’ve picked out a selection of games that could be your new big obsession.</p>

 <p>Of course this in no way definitive! There will be hundreds of demos worth playing, and if you’ve discovered anything you’d recommend yourself, then we encourage you to do so in the comments.</p> <h2><em>Tingus Goose</em></h2>  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> SweatyChair<br> <strong>Release date:</strong> Q4 2025<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4059560/Tingus_Goose_Demo/">Demo link</a></p> <p>Normally with these roundups I like to start with a well-known name so everyone feels comfortable, safe, and familiar, before I then start adding the super-weird delights. But no such easing ourselves into the deep end today, because there is no more important demo to tell you about than <em>Tingus Goose.</em> I…words cannot suffice.</p>

 <p>This is a clicker in the vein of&nbsp;<em>Cookie Clicker</em>, except you’re…well, listen, you’re clicking on the weird little baby-creatures called Tingus that fly out of the beak of a goose. A goose that is growing out of the belly of a lady lying on a bed. As you water your goose (you heard me) its neck grows longer, and it reaches for the loving kiss of another goose hanging down from the sky above. They want to mate, and it’s your job to have them meet. But you need money to water a goose, and that’s gained by, um, having the babies roll over protuberances that grow sideways out of the goose’s neck. That, as you’d expect, earns cash. And don’t worry, you can click on the babies, too, to get more money, but don’t click too often or they pop.</p>

 <p>This is all a glorious piece of batshit crazy animation and gibberish game design, and I adore every second of it.</p> <h2><em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em></h2>  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> FuturLab<br> <strong>Release date:</strong> 23 Oct, 2025<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968420/PowerWash_Simulator_2/">Demo link</a></p> <p>See, in other years this would have been my more welcoming first entry. We’re all looking forward to <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, right? And now we finally get to play it! Hooray!</p>

 <p>And yes, it is of course utterly marvelous. It’s more&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>, but slightly prettier and with less clunky controls. I am having to force myself to stop playing to write this, and play the rest of the demos, and it’s proving tricky, and that’s what&nbsp;<em>PW</em> always did best: <em>take over your entire life with its demonic pressure-washing powers</em>.</p>

 <h2><em>Slots And Daggers</em></h2>  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Friedemann<br> <strong>Release date:</strong> October 24, 2025<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3970060/Slots__Daggers_Demo/">Demo link</a></p> <p>O<em>h my goodness this is the best I want to play it forever</em>. This being&nbsp;<em>Slots And Daggers</em>, a post-<em>Balatro</em> roguelite slot machine game that purifies the mechanics to sweetest perfection. You begin by choosing the icons that can appear on the slots (starting with coins, sword attacks and shield) and then stop each dial to fight a monster. If you win, coins earned can be spent on new icons (perhaps a bow attack, or an upgrade to your shield), as well as on power-ups that boost your attacks, defense, and technique. You and the enemy have shield and health meters, with some attacks able to do true damage, others protected by your defenses. And, of course, the moment you lose it’s back to the start. Except you also win poker chips as you play, and these can be spent on “illegal” hacks to the slot machine that can permanently improve things.</p>

 <p>It’s all there, right? All the ingredients of a great roguelite, in the neatest possible way. And I can assure you that it’s outstandingly moreish.</p> <h2><em>Mosaic of the Strange</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634621" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634621"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634621">© Mark Ffrench</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Mark Ffrench<br> <strong>Release date:</strong> 7 Nov, 2025<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4057820/Mosaic_of_the_Strange_Demo/">Demo link</a></p> <p>Mark Ffrench makes a very specific genre of game. It’s Fill-a-Pix puzzles writ large, the logic puzzle games that usually fill a small grid on your phone now taking up wall-size friezes.&nbsp;<em>Proverbs</em> was my favorite of his, a massive rendering of Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s painting, Netherlandish Proverbs, turned into a puzzle. And that might sound pretentious, but <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2024/11/proverbs/">damn it was wonderful</a>. Later came&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-rebirth-steam-deck-dynasty-warriors-what-to-play-1851747697/3"><em>2024: Mosaic Retrospective</em></a>, an incredible collage of events of the previous year, and next comes&nbsp;<em>Mosaic of the Strange</em>, the follow-up to a game I now realize I entirely missed,&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3530670/Mosaic_of_The_Pharaohs/?curator_clanid=44696447"><em>Mosaic of the Pharaohs</em></a>. (I know what I’m doing when I should be working tomorrow…) Incredibly, this combines the puzzle concept with a point-and-click adventure, and my mind’s made up.</p> <p>It’s hard to know how to convince a skeptic to give a game like this a try, but they’re blissfully absorbing and I really cannot recommend them enough.</p>

 <h2><em>Painkiller</em></h2>  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Anshar Studios<br> <strong>Release date:</strong> 21 Oct, 2025<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300120/Painkiller/">Demo link</a></p> <p>I’d somehow entirely missed that&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em> was coming back. As 3D Realms trawls its archives, 2004’s&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em> is the latest recognizable name to get a total overhaul. A decade off has done it some good, and its return gives it fresh new central characters, and it’s playable alone or in 3-player co-op. It moves extremely quickly, which is my primary desire from any 3D Realms shooter, and the AI bots seem to do a decent enough job in the demo. It’s also gloriously gory and bursting with <em>Quake 3</em> vibes.</p> <h2><em>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era</em></h2>  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Unfrozen<br> <strong>Release date:</strong> 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241970/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_Olden_Era_Demo/">Demo link</a></p> <p>Hands up, who’s old enough to remember the <em>Heroes of Might &amp; Magic</em> games? No, it’s OK, don’t strain your arm. And let’s not even ask about the OG&nbsp;<em>Might &amp; Magic</em> fans, as the breath of the question might cause them to collapse into dust. The RPG series goes back as far as 1986 incredibly, with its turn-based strategy spin-off&nbsp;<em>Heroes of Might &amp; Magic</em> starting in 1995. Highly regarded turn-based strategy games right up until they weren’t, the series saw diminishing returns beginning with <em>HOMM 5 </em>and 2015’s <em>Might &amp; Magic Heroes VII</em> polished the whole franchise off for a decade.</p>

 <p>Well, it’s back, and its latest entry is coming from <em>Iratus</em> developer Unfrozen. Apparently it has the good sense not to meddle with a beloved formula, letting you build your mythological armies and grow a town, with its emphasis squarely on recreating everyone’s happy memories of <em>HOMM 3</em>. And look, I could lie to you and pretend I understood this demo, but turn-based strategy is a genre I have never gotten my head around. I’m just excited for all the <em>Might &amp; Magic</em> fans I’ve known and loved that it’s back.</p> <h2><em>Kingdom of Night</em></h2>  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Friends of Safety<br> <strong>Release date:</strong> Q4 2025<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1695580/Kingdom_of_Night_Demo/">Demo link</a></p> <p>I installed this one on a complete whim, and I’m very glad I did. It’s an RPG by way of a point-and-click adventure, set in 1980s Arizona with some heavy <em>Stranger Things</em> vibes. You play a teenage kid at high school who finds himself embroiled in a bizarre adventure of invading demons and magical powers. The demo immediately shows how the characteristics you pick affect how you play, with a choice between brains and brawn opening up different conversation options and ways to handle school encounters. It comes with an intricate spell system, real-time combat, and lots of lovely isometric pixel graphics. And I’m really getting into it. This was first announced six years ago, but is apparently arriving this year, complete with an option to play the whole adventure in co-op.</p> <h2><em>Servant of the Lake</em></h2>  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Rusty Lake<br> <strong>Release date:</strong> 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3996940/Servant_of_the_Lake_Demo/">Demo link</a></p> <p>The incredible&nbsp;<em>Rusty Lake</em> series <a href="https://kotaku.com/rusty-lake-mr-rabbit-magic-show-birthday-david-lynch-1851778424">just celebrated its 10th anniversary with a typically macabre birthday game</a>, but now is back with an upcoming full entry in the long-running Lynchian series. <em>Servant of the Lake</em> has the player arrive to the Vanderboom house by horse and cart, there to be a servant to the family for a single weekend. However, long-term fans will realize this puts us in the era of the first generation of the Vanderbooms, and thus in the presence of Aldous Vanderboom, the man who becomes the series peculiar antagonist, Mr. Crow. And, honestly, you own it to yourself to play every <em>Rusty Lake</em> game in order, building up to next year’s release of this one.</p>

 <h2><em>Reanimal</em></h2>  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Tarsier Studios<br> <strong>Release date:</strong> TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4019420/REANIMAL_Demo/">Demo link</a></p> <p><em>Reanimal</em> is of course what Tarsier Studios is making instead of <em>Little Nightmares 3.</em> It’s a whole new project from the team and, still a year on from its announcement, it doesn’t yet have a release date. But at least we can play some of it now! You play as a sack-headed boy, who begins the game steering a boat to pull a mask-wearing girl from the sea, before finally reaching dry land and beginning the adventure of their attempt to escape their hellish home. It’s all extremely atmospheric, but very slow to get going for a demo. Still, persist and you’ll experience this horror-themed adventure for a decent while.</p> <h2><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></h2>  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Tribute Games<br> <strong>Release date:</strong> 2025<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4013980/MARVEL_Cosmic_Invasion_Demo/">Demo link</a></p> <p>I am delighted to report that&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> is a complete delight. Tribute Games follows up&nbsp;<em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em> with another old-school side-scrolling beat ’em up, this time with a broad cast of Marvel heroes to biff with. You pick two at a time (Spider-Man and She Hulk make for a great pairing), then alternate between the two of them as you set up combos and <em>Streets of Rage</em> your way down these pixel-perfect streets. In fact, it’s so&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage</em> that you even eat food you find by smashing garbage cans, just like real superheroes do.</p> <p>It’s so colorful and punchy (in every sense) that it feels like it could be a classic arcade cabinet hit from the ’80s, rejuvenated for modern machines.</p>

<p>Over the Hill is a game about offroading in which players drive vehicles from the 60s to 80s either alone or in a group, while dealing with the challenges that come with navigating some tough trails. It is not just the landscape that will provide a challenge, with Over the Hill featuring dynamic weather and a day/night cycle. The different areas are inspired by real world locations, each filled with different objectives. Completing these objectives will unlock new vehicles, upgrades, customisations, and cosmetics. And, you can capture the scenery through a photo mode.</p>
<p>A date for the full release of Over the Hill is yet to be confirmed.</p>

		<p>TinyBuildGames and developer Fire &amp; Frost have announced that the open world RPG Of Ash and Steel will be launching on November 6th for PC, and a demo has been released for Steam Next Fest. The game is being billed as an old school RPG where players will explore the Kingdom of the Seven without mission markers or overt quest guidance.</p>
<p><iframe title="Of Ash and Steel - Steam Next Fest Demo and Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EHDPSRpxF1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The demo for Of Ash and Steel will feature an area of the game that can be explored including an abandoned village, of which you can try and solve the mystery of what happened. There will be a part of the main quest available to play along with side missions, and players will also be able to delve into the skill trees, various professions, and the upgrades. Players can experiment with different combat styles from being light footed to wearing a full suit of armour while wielding a giant weapon. In addition to the campaign, there is also an Arena mode where players can earn gear, gold, and XP. There are also ranks to climb to defeat more powerful enemies, and become the champion of the arena.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A ton of popular games are included.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon's October Prime Day has ended, but the online retailer is already offering a new "Buy 2, Get 1 50% Off" sale this week. There's a little bit of everything for everyone in here, from classic family games to modern party games. If you've been hoping to add some more board games to your tabletop collection, right now is a great time to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sale itself is fairly straightforward: Amazon has a big <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l2XPE?object_uuid=36931a4c-0172-46ee-99b4-5d30882de1af&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>list of items that are included in the promotion</strong></a> and all you need to do is add two in your cart and the 50% discount will be applied to whatever the cheaper one is. That means if you want to take full advantage of the savings, you'll want to buy two similarly priced items. I've gathered some of the best board game options in the sale here, which are based off of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/board-game-reviews">IGN's own board game reviews</a> and recommendations. There are also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tons-of-popular-jigsaw-puzzles-are-buy-1-get-1-half-off-at-amazon-today">jigsaw puzzles included in the sale</a> if you want to mix and match for the full discount.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Buy 1, Get 1 50% Off Board Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The amount of options to choose from in this sale is truly staggering, and it's difficult to choose only a few recommendations to highlight. Are you looking for intriguing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-murder-mystery-board-games">murder mystery games</a> to play during a Halloween party? Do you need a fun <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board game</a> you can break out on weekends? Are you hoping to find a great <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy game</a> that will take all night to play? There are tabletop options for all of those scenarios right here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those working with a smaller budget, I'd recommend checking out Flip 7. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/flip-7-card-game-review">reviewed it earlier this year</a> and absolutely loved it. It's a fairly easy push-you-luck card game that can be played in under 20 minutes. At only $8, it's already cheap, and this promotion will end up dropping that price down to just $4 when you buy something else (that's at least $8) with it. All-in-all, it's an easy recommendation to make for anyone who just wants a fun game that has a shallow learning curve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for something a bit heartier that's still family friendly, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ticket-to-ride-board-game-buying-guide-and-expansions">Ticket to Ride</a> – both the original U.S. and some of the European versions – is also included here. This game is a modern classic that does a great job of combining simple gameplay with stimulating turn-based strategy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you find a game you like, the next step is picking out a good second option to take full advantage of the discount. I'd recommend browsing through some of the classic board games here that are essential for any collection, stuff like Clue, Catan, Sorry!, and multiple versions of Monopoly. If you don't already have those, now is a great time to pick one or more up for a substantial discount.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Is Now a Good Time to Buy Board Games?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week we saw some pretty <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/board-game-deals-october-prime-day-2025">great board game deals for October Prime Day</a>, but with that sale over and Black Friday on the horizon, you may be wondering if you should be making a purchase right now. While it's true that Amazon will likely have better board game deals for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/black-friday">Black Friday</a> this year, this buy 1, get 1 50% off sale is still a great way to save money right now. If you are looking to grab some stocking stuffers or a family game to play <em>before</em> the holidays, then this sale makes it a good time to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that in mind, you'll still want to wait for better discounts if you're planning on making bigger purchases. Some of the bigger campaign board games that are $100 or more are not included in this sale and aren't likely to be discounted until November.</p></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Oct 13, 2025 7:42 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-buy-1-get-1-half-off-board-game-sale-october-2025]]></content:encoded>

While Assault, Engineer, and Recon classes, too, bring important tools and skills to a fight, it’s only the Support class that can get downed soldiers back on their feet at lightning speed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Squad mates of any class are free to revive each other with or without the medic tools in Support, though they are locked only to reviving players in their squad and take much longer to pick them up.

I've spent my career observing the Tokyo-based publisher from a distance, having not extensively played the Metal Gear Solid, Castlevania, or Silent Hill franchises.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What's made me curious about this revival effort (first announced in 2023) was its strategy to farm out development to multiple game studios without a unifying visual identity. The remake of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was able to ride on the bloody coattails of the original's iconic monsters—but you couldn't tell </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill f</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is from the same series at first glance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But maybe that lack of "iconic" creatures is a boon, not a bane, for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill f</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—and it tells us something about the process of reviving and nurturing game franchises.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Why aren't any of ">Why aren't any of <span>Silent Hill f</span>'s monsters 'iconic?'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beauty is in the eye of the beholder but scanning the internet, I don't see any signs the Japanese folklore-inspired monsters of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill f</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have made as big an impact as their predecessors. I'd chalk this up to one key factor: the wide availability of high-quality 3D visuals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The creature's designs are still strong, and means NeoBard's vision of rural Japense horror resonated with players without any gimmicky creatures shoehorned in. The scarecrow-like Ayakakashi's stuttering movement plays excellently in the game's open areas and the "Spawning Monster," a beast with dozens of pregnant bellies, spews out enemies in a not-so-subtle manifestation of the protagonist's dread over a forced marriage.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/tencent-claims-its-new-ai-tool-will-reduce-art-production-timeframes-from-days-to-minutes" target="_self" data-discover="true">Tencent claims its new AI tool will reduce art production timeframes from days to minutes</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile The Shiromuku's bridal-inspired design continues that trend, while a mysterious individual known as "Fox Mask" takes a more demure approach, appearing as a handsome young man gazing at the player through a Fox mask, made more horrifying by his calm demeanor and how he guides the protagonist into dangerous situations claiming he's helping her—but seems perfectly content to let her harm herself to complete mysterious mystical rituals.</span></p><p>Image via NeoBards Entertainment/Konami.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Again these are all strong designs (and like all Silent Hill monsters they are deeply anchored to the protagonist's psychological turmoil) but they don't ascend to "iconic" status. That's probably because they exist in a world where games that aren't even in the horror genre have their own roster of gory monstrous creatures rendered in high graphical detail. They're competing with the ominous beasts of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elden Ring</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or freshly French-inspired designs of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/unity-promises-stronger-ai-copyright-guardrails-after-employee-conjures-mickey-mouse-on-stream" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity promises strong AI copyright 'guardrails' after employee conjures Mickey Mouse on stream</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those games aren't even horror games.

It just shows the technology available to developers has raised the bar exceptionally high.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2001 PlayStation 2's hardware was so limited that Team Silent famously used the town's ominous fog to lower the required rendering distance in a desperate bid to squeeze as much memory and performance power as they could.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's in this context that Pyramid Head emerged: a product of strong art direction, game design, and writing that seemed especially monstrous, especially in a period where horror games were drifting towards becoming more action-oriented titles. Someone laser-focused on marketable characters that could drive future Silent Hill titles might be disappointed these creatures don't make the mark.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Konami's trust in NeoBards' vision—combined with its multi-pronged release strategy—may be instructive for how other developers can revive dormant franchises and keep ongoing ones fresh.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/keita-takahashi-sent-over-a-bunch-of-adorable-to-a-t-storyboard-sketches" target="_self" data-discover="true">Behind the Scenes: Check out Keita Takahashi's adorable To a T storyboard sketches</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Konami can have its cake and eat it too">Konami can have its cake and eat it too</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Series and franchises are important to the game business because they both breed familiarity for players and can provide stable ground for developers to work on, not having to reinvent all the wheels with every new game (just a few of them, sometimes).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By kicking off its Silent Hill revival with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and not </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Konami quickly rushed the most "iconic" game in the series back in the spotlight.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Publisher HyperTrain Digital and developer Ice-Pick Lodge have announced that Pathologic 3 will arrive on PC this coming January 9, 2026, though if you can't wait until then, there's a demo available to check out now as part of October's Steam Next Fest, which kicked off today and runs until October 20, 2025.</p>



<p>If you're worried about Pathologic 3 potentially being delayed, no need, as Ice-Pick Lodge makes it clear that its January release date is as set in stone as can be in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3199650/view/542244996316660185?l=english">a post on the game's Steam page</a>. "<em>That date is nailed down, screwed in, wrapped in commitments, and it isn’t moving</em>," the studio writes.</p>



<p>Ice-Pick Lodge also debuted a new trailer for Pathologic 3 as part of the demo's arrival and the announcement of its "<em>nailed down, screwed in</em>" release date. This trailer does its best to show the many sides of Pathologic 3, to try and give players an understanding of the game's complexities.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The demo is a small slice from the beginning of the game, with Daniil Dankovsky arriving in the City-on-Gorkhon, looking for an immortal man.</p>



<p>Pathologic 3 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/pathologic-3-announced-will-launch-in-2025/">announced in October 2024 with a 2025 release window</a>, though today's news reveals that Ice-Pick Lodge will just slightly miss that release window by nine days. It's also not the only game with a Steam Next Fest demo, as you can also find demos for <a href="https://wccftech.com/old-school-open-world-fantasy-rpg-of-ash-and-steel-gets-demo-and-launch-date/">games like Ash and Steel</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/lovecraftian-survival-horror-shooter-beneath-release-date-pc-consoles/">Lovecraftian survival horror shooter Beneath</a> during the festival. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Cloud Imperium Games delivered big news to Star Citizen fans this weekend during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9bXJnkgBQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CitizenCon Direct 2025 livestreamed event</a>. The game's third explorable system, Nyx, will launch next month with the Alpha Update 4.4. The system features a hazardous, asteroid-dense environment, the Glacian Belt, with distinctive cold lighting and nebulae. Entry into Nyx will be possible from both the existing star systems: Stanton and Pyro.</p>



<p>According to the backstory developed by CIG, Nyx was initially disregarded by the Empire as unsuitable for terraforming/mining and subsequently became a haven for the revolutionary “People's Alliance.” Levki, its main outpost, mixes frontier spirit with a struggle to survive outside UEE oversight. It returns as a fully explorable social and economic hub, rebuilt with improved interiors, external EVA access, cargo operations, a refinery, a hospital (the Mercy), new markets and shops (Teachers for ships and parts, Cordies for armor, Conscientious Objects for weapons, and Cafe Muse for the social area), and significant visual improvements. While roaming Levki, players will encounter the prominent Anthony Tanaka statue, symbolizing resistance against the oppressive Messer regime.</p>



<p>Two major storylines will be rolled out: Pyro Burn and Science Runner Muk. The latter involves the Empire's regen crisis and the exposure of shady corporate activities, culminating in new missions and mysteries. With the Nyx update, players will also find new mission arcs, such as an urgent investigation of illegal tech and derelict QV Planet Services facilities, featuring combat and narrative branches. The mission structure now includes non-linear missions, social choices (helping NPCs, bugging out, etc.), and persistent replayability. Player exploration will be encouraged to an even greater degree with loot and clues scattered throughout. Moreover, Star Citizen players will fight alien Vanduul ships in the persistent universe for the first time ever, encountering new ship classes like the Vanduul Stinger.</p>



<p>During CitizenCon Direct 2025, CIG also introduced the Genesis group of technologies for planetary and biome generation, shifting from artist-driven placement to physical data-based procedural content (relating to humidity, geology, temperature, seasons, etc.). According to the developers, this change results in much more realistic worlds because terrain, cliffs, biomes, and vegetation are generated following natural criteria, with visible geological logic. This also means instant orbital-to-ground visual authenticity.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Star Citizen | CitizenCon Direct: October 11, 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_n9bXJnkgBQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Nyx will also premiere a new resource, medium tiles, which balances high-fidelity detail with scale and rationalizes the placement of rocks, minerals, and obstacles. This is especially relevant for land vehicle operators and miners. CIG shared plans to apply this technology to rework the Stanton and Pyro systems in future patches.</p>



<p>Throughout 2026, Nyx will be expanded further, with more locations, system-specific features, and ongoing incremental updates. New gameplay loops and content will roll out in an episodic fashion, organically shaping narrative and discovery in the new Star Citizen system.</p>



<p>Just in case you were wondering, no, there were no mentions at all of version 1.0. In August, Game Director Chris Roberts <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-launch-2027-2028-squadron-42-top-gun-star-awrs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that the space simulation game could launch in 2027 or 2028. The single player campaign, Squadron 42, is currently targeting a 2026 release, although Content Director Jared Huckaby candidly <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-content-director-isnt-100-sure-game-launch-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> that, as with any game, there's always a chance of a delay.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-many-playthroughs-of-the-outer-worlds-2-are-needed-for-the-platinum-trophy">How Many Playthroughs of The Outer Worlds 2 are Needed for the Platinum Trophy?</h2>



<p><strong>As of this writing, we do not know for sure how many playthroughs are absolutely required to get all achievements and trophies in The Outer Worlds 2, but it appears that it will require at least two. If certain factions are locked off depending on your choices, it could be more.</strong></p>



<p>The achievement list in this game shows that <a href="https://outerworlds2.obsidian.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Outer Worlds 2</a> follows a lot of the same methods that the original game used when it comes to achievements and trophies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, difficulty achievements tied to multiple achievements are not really common for RPGs, but both games do them here. Hopefully, players who play through first on Very Hard will automatically receive the Hard trophy as well, but if it doesn’t, you will be stuck with an additional playthrough.</p>



<p>It appears that the max level in the game is 30, much like it was in the original, and there are a lot of collectibles to find, including 100 Pitch/Tossball cards, grounding stations, audio logs, and mural pieces. Hopefully, none of those are locked off in areas if you miss them the first time through.</p>



<p>Outside of that, there seem to be a lot of miscellaneous achievements and trophies in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-the-outer-worlds-2-have-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a>. Things like never buying anything in the game or getting kills in various ways. If you want the platinum in this game, you are going to have to cover a lot of ground.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A massive Pokémon data leak has occurred, revealing details about past and upcoming games, including a roadmap for future titles and DLC. </p>



<p>The Pokémon Company has fallen victim to a huge datamine, which recently provided a whole bunch of details on their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-and-waves-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gen 10 title</a>, Pokémon Wind and Waves. Now, new information about other Pokémon games has surfaced online, including details on Gen 11, Legends 3, a remake, and more titles. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-pokemon-projects-currently-in-development-at-game-freak">All Pokémon Projects Currently in Development at Game Freak&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Thanks to CentroLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977791170093687087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), we have a roadmap for future Pokémon games and DLC. Firstly, the Gen 10 title, Wind and Waves, is set to release in 2026, with a DLC arriving in 2027. Pokémon Legends 3, which is called Galar, is “releasing in 2027 or beyond. A Pokémon multi-region remake is in the works, which is planned for 2028 or beyond. Moreover, Pokopia will also receive a DLC, and Pokémon Champions was originally scheduled for a 2025 release. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>THIS IS CRAZY. All the projects Game Freak currently has in development:</p><p>– Wind/Waves is releasing in 2026, with DLC in 2027.<br>– Pokémon Legends: Galar is releasing 2027 or beyond.<br>– Pokémon Multi-Region Remake in 2028 or beyond.<br>– Pokopia will get DLC.<br>– Pokémon Champions was… <a href="https://t.co/OcuIChALaj">pic.twitter.com/OcuIChALaj</a></p></div>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977791170093687087?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-gen-11-release-window-multi-region-remake-and-legends-3-galar-details-surface-online">Pokémon Gen 11 Release Window, Multi-Region Remake, and Legends 3: Galar Details Surface Online</h2>



<p>Players must’ve seen mentions of the multi-region remake, Legends 3: Galar, and more, and must be wondering what all that’s about. Here’s what CentroLeaks has shared about them on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>: </p>



<ul>
<li>Starting with Pokémon Gen 11, has seemingly set a 2030 release window, according to leaks. </li>



<li>Secondly, Game Freak is reportedly developing a multi-region Pokémon remake that lets players “walk from Sinnoh to Hoenn” and includes Kitakami. It is called Project Seed internally and is “a prototyping project for a next-generation online game playable by multiple people, set in a region that connects Hoenn and Sinnoh.”</li>



<li>Lastly, Pokémon Legends: Arceus is set in Galar, 1,000 years in the past, where players must create the first Gigamax Pokéball. The upcoming game is inspired by Xenoblade Chronicles X. </li>
</ul>



<p>As always, players should take this information with a grain of salt and note that all information is subject to change by the final release. </p>



<p>In other news, the full Pokémon Legends Z-A Pokédex, including Shinies and Megas, has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-pokedex-leaked-in-full/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked online</a>. Additionally, here’s the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-preload-guide-file-size-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-load guide and file size</a> for the upcoming title.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest Steam Next Fest began this week, showcasing a wide range of upcoming titles. And as has become a trend, publishing platform <a href="https://indie.io/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>indie.io</u></a> has several titles featured. To celebrate, it has launched a campaign called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/indieio/sale/next_fest_party_indie_io" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Next Fest Party</u></a> that will run from October 13–20 and includes free demos for 12 different games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The games come from a variety of different developers in a variety of different genres, so we figured we’d give you a rundown of everything that’s available. Below you’ll find brief descriptions of each game, with each title linked to its free demos so you can try them for yourself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3772390/Monsters_and_Me_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Monsters and Me</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This 2D top-down roguelite shooter is chaotic, silly, and a bit gross (well, as gross as a 2D game can be). Your city has been overrun with slime mutants who have one goal in mind: ripping your face off. The natural reaction should be to prevent that, so you’ll need to upgrade your weapons and special abilities to fend off the horde. The demo drops you into the game’s first level, and you just need to survive as long as you can. Simple, right?</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3694540/Kriophobia_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Kriophobia</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Kriophobia also challenges you to survive, but in a VERY different way. You play as Anna, a geophysicist who’s trapped in a frozen Soviet bunker … and something else is down there with you. This is classic psychological horror, perfect for spooky season and for players who don’t want their hands held. Combat is tense and difficult, to the point it’s sometimes best avoided altogether. The demo is a standalone section of the game’s second chapter, where you’ll have to contend with the cold, mysterious abominations, and Anna’s traumatic past.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3931400/PLAGUN__The_Plague_Goes_On_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Plagun</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This pixel shooter is a bullet-hell roguelike set in a post-apocalyptic kingdom where an attempted cure for death resulted in an all-consuming plague instead. You were a doctor before this event, but now you must use cursed masks and plague-infused weapons to deal with escalating waves of enemies. The demo is a vertical slice that will give you a sense of the game’s fast pace and let you experiment with different cursed masks and power-ups.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2237320/Dwarf_Delve/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Dwarf Delve</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s time to pick up your Battlemallet, go delving into mines, and try to safely make it out with as many riches as you can in this first-person extraction roguelite. The mines are randomly generated, so no two trips are the same. You’ll need to craft items like support beams and ladders to traverse dangerous areas, as well as utilize lanterns and floodlights to see in the darkness. Once you’ve grabbed your loot, you’ll need to be wary of traps and other dangers on your way back to safety. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2492980/Heistfest_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Heistfest</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you like stealing stuff and then causing untold destruction throughout the city as you try to make your escape while an escalating police force chases you? Well, great news. That’s the premise of the aptly named Heistfest. You’ll speed your way through hand-drawn environments, and things will get more intense the longer you evade capture. And if you think that means just adding some more cop cars and maybe some guns, think again. You’ll have to deal with spike traps, helicopters, paratroopers, tanks, and full-on airstrikes. Chaos and fun are more important than realism anyway. The demo is a vertical slice that gives you a sense of the core gameplay loop: rob a bank, spark a police chase, and see how long you can survive as public enemy #1.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3330930/Locked_in_my_Darkness_2_The_Room/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Locked in My Darkness 2: The Room</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s Halloween time, so of course there can’t just be one scary game on this list. This one is a psychological horror walking sim focused on atmosphere, exploration, and puzzle solving. You play as Yuki Tachibana, a Japanese high school student who recently moved into a new apartment with her family. Something sinister awakens within the walls of their new home, warping reality and dredging up sins of the past. With flashlight in hand, you’ll uncover notes, solve environmental puzzles, and reveal the secrets of Yuki’s family.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3392150/Nullstar_Solus_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Nullstar: Solus</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You are Solus, a scavenger drone sent to salvage the nullstar from a dying world. But there’s only one goal that really matters in this game: be faster. You’ll need to master the flying mechanics, thrusters, and momentum to make it through levels as quickly as possible. Those levels are high-risk, high-reward, and you’ll need to stay on your toes to deal with everything they can throw at you.  </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3544390/Air_Hares/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Air Hares</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You probably haven’t seen a bullet hell quite like this one. In Air Hares, your main goal isn’t shooting enemies out of the sky; it’s using your plane to seed and water crops to save the starving people of the barren Winrose Warren. But your feathered foes in the Gale Gang want to stop you, so you’ll need to dodge, jab, and ram them to send them packing and get back to your important work. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1908520/Binary_Golf_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Binary Golf</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Miniature golf gets a chaotic overhaul in Binary Golf, where you use your golf ball to eliminate targets until the final one becomes the hole you need to get your ball into. But this isn’t just any old mini golf course. You can jump over hazards, teleport across courses, and phase through objects to pull off trick shots. The demo includes the game’s first two episodes, which will teach you the ropes before pitting you against a boss to test what you’ve learned.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong></strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3553150/The_Cascadier/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">The Cascadier</a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve ever wondered what would happen if a roguelike deckbuilder collided with a magical coin-pusher machine, The Cascadier has your answer, and it’s gloriously chaotic.<br>Each run has you charging coins with elemental powers from your deck and dropping them into dazzling, pinball-like cabinets that erupt in chain reactions if you drop your coin just right. You’ll be guided by Fortuna, the trickster goddess of luck, and her envious brother Theodan as you chase divine rewards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each round starts with ten coins to drop and your deck of earned abilities. Like any good coin pusher, you’ll scoop up coins mid-round and play them back in to keep your score and ticket count climbing. Run out, and the round’s over, so make every toss count. Hit your score goal to move on, then choose new powersets to add to your growing deck and mix things up in the next run. You’ll spend your hard-earned tickets on upgrading Trinkets that grant new abilities and permanent boosts. The demo lets you try the first cabinet,  a lush, nature-themed machine that hints at the elemental powers each new board will bring.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1075880/Elemental_Brawl/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Elemental Brawl</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A multiplayer party game, Elemental Brawl tasks you with beating up your friends with the power of the elements. Each round begins with everyone only being able to punch and kick, but as time goes on, random elemental orbs will drop. Collecting them grants you powers related to that element, and you can combine elements as the round continues. And the maps aren’t static, you can use your elements to burn them, freeze them, turn puddles into steam traps, and more. It’s all about coming up with creative ways to eliminate your opponents.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2944590/Chowdown_Kitty/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Chowdown Kitty</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A puzzle game with simple yet addictive gameplay, Chowdown Kitty presents you with a board filled with cat treats. Connect matching treats in a string of three or more, and those treats get pulled out and put in a food bowl for a cat. The more treats you manage to string together, the higher your score gets and the happier the cat gets.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/12-free-demos-for-indieio-games-available-now-as-part-of-steam-next-fest-party]]></content:encoded>

It also suggests that Nintendo's attempts at locating the hackers have not been successful — despite an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-requests-subpoena-of-discord-to-track-down-user-behind-last-years-pokemon-teraleak">legal bid by the company to subpoena Discord</a> to divulge the hackers' identity in April this year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's release of hacked Pokémon Legends: Z-A information comes after days of leaks from players with early copies — legitimate and not — that have laid the new game's Pokédex bare, including a long list of fresh Mega Pokémon species.

As of today, fans reckon they've compiled a list of every Pokémon getting a Mega Evolution not just in the base game, but also in Legends: Z-A's post-launch DLC, which is already available to pre-order.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the game's biggest secrets now available to view online for those who wish to go find them, it seems like the Teraleak hackers have decided now is the time to release what they have had on Pokémon Legends: Z-A — and it looks like they're not stopping there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Teraleak hackers have <em>also </em>now begun to release information they say relates to Pokémon's fabled upcoming "Gen 10" games, which fans widely expect to arrive in 2026 in time for the franchise's 30th anniversary. But as claims of these games' names and settings swirl, it's worth pointing out that this information appears to rely on documentation that's several years' old — rather than actual gameplay footage, as is the case for Pokémon Legends: Z-A. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Pokémon Spin-off Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In October 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-developer-game-freak-reportedly-hacked-stolen-data-on-unannounced-games-as-well-as-nintendo-switch-2-codename-leaked-online">Game Freak issued a statement confirming the company had suffered a data breach</a> in August of that year, and noted that hackers had accessed the details of current and former employees.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/enginefall-is-a-compelling-extraction-shooter-set-on-a-moving-train</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/enginefall-is-a-compelling-extraction-shooter-set-on-a-moving-train.1323841/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Enginefall’s greatest strength based on the limited time I had with it is that it doesn’t have that immediate signature identity of survival extraction battle royale-y sorts of games that it resembles on paper. The Tarkov or Fortnite experience might not get you as far as it would out of the gates in other games. This early learning curve comes from equal parts creative systems that create a faster and more dangerous pace than others, but the amount of all the little things you’ll need to learn to make good choices is intimidating. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every run on the Titan Train starts a similar way: raiders, either by themselves or in crews of up to five, start at the back of the colossal city-state on rails. When the timer starts, it's off to the races, each party running, crafting, climbing, and shooting their way to the engine at the front of the train. It’s all very chaotic from start to finish, in ways that are fun and engaging, but also frustrating and confusing.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Enginefall Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My group of five started hot out of the gate filling our pockets with as many scraps of metal and plastic we could find littering the ground, all important resources used to build bases and starting gear. We started with sledgehammers, useful for breaking the plastic off of the long plastic seats installed on the sides of the train, and busting up bundles of ceramic stuff into smaller, more useful pieces. These took more swings than expected to break off completely, but luckily each swing just put a bunch of plastic in your inventory and didn’t confetti to the ground for you to have to scoop up after. I felt extremely exposed breaking down this raw material, and if I didn’t have several people with me, there's no way I wouldn’t have been a victim. Solo players would likely have to approach this initial part more stealthfully, maybe missing out on gearing up early altogether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our first agenda, plotted by one of my team's developer-sherpas, Shaun “Flak” Stiglingh, was to find a cozy cabin of the train, reinforce the doors, and claim it as our first of likely several forward operating bases where we can store our plunder and upgrade our gear in relative safety. As he organized the resources we had, our second guide, Red Rover Interactive’s CEO Fred Richardson, led the rest of us out to find another good use for our sledgehammers, beating up other raiders and taking their stuff.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, we accumulated enough stuff to get some armor on our bodies and a layout of how the rest of our journey was going to proceed. This didn’t take a long time, and while the crafting menus and systems are pretty straightforward and serviceable, learning how to prioritize what you research and build first to get the best advantage seems like a daunting task only achievable through lots of trial and error. I was happy to let Flak handle it this time, as well as outline our strategy to get to the engine room. In order to get to the front of the train, we have to get keys that give us access to higher-class train cars (we start in 3rd, and need to work through 2nd, 1st, and eventually Conductor classes). We find these keys out there in the train cars we have access to already, be it among scraps, among loot in the assorted boxes tucked in every nook and cranny, or in the pockets of our rival raiders. Luckily, Fred’s previous hammer party produced a 2nd class ticket, so now all we had to do was get to the transfer gate without getting derailed.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Travelling in the rafters high above the main levels of the cars would keep you off of the ground, but the walkways are narrow and one fall would certainly kill you.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">He and Fred decided the best way to go would actually be through the lower decks, mentioning that each train car has several alternative routes that chain to one another, each with their own set of risks and benefits. Travelling in the rafters high above the main levels of the cars would keep you off of the ground, but the walkways are narrow and one fall would certainly kill you. Some cars give you the opportunity to leave the train completely, exposing you to the harsh climate of the wasteland around you, but giving you some deadly shortcuts that would certainly help make up some ground if you can survive it. Similar story with the lower decks, where the exhaust of the train is pumped through. Our path through the cars and up to the 2nd Class section would be more straight forward and hypothetically safer from enemies, but we would all need to acquire gas masks or risk a breathtaking death down below. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With a little more farming of both people and objects, we had the requisite masks. Down we went under the lower tunnels, which as predicted, went rather smoothly. We would have to pop back up to the main level to switch cars every so often, but we took the gassy express lane straight through 3rd Class, and eased into the next zone without many issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2nd Class car is where I found a lot of friction, mostly from the servers themselves. This was a stress test for the Red Rover Interactive, the largest they’d done yet. So I don’t fault them for my fate, which found me rubberbanding in stressful times like firefights and while collecting a treasure trove of goodies from a resource drop that I would eventually die in because I couldn’t tell if the escape I made in my time actually happened in the eyes of my party mates (it didn’t). I spent a good amount of time just unable to do much in the game at all, locked in a death screen while the pandemonium unfolded within earshot. Though I appreciated the opportunity to learn what it was probably like to be one of those ghosts on that train in Final Fantasy 6, it did mean that I missed almost all of the shenanigans that went down in the 2nd Class cars. I was revived and returned to working order eventually, just in time to make a frantic dash to the 1st Class section. Frantic because over time, the lower class cars get sealed off for good, a Fortnite storm ring sort of mechanic that forces all survivors to move up the train or get crushed by the class barriers. Quite the metaphor.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Quite a few interesting happenings occurred to us as we traveled through 1st Class. Initially, we found a train car that was completely exposed, requiring breathing equipment in order to pass through safely. Our early investment in gas masks paid off, but this was not an obstacle I expected to hit, and would have had no answer for if I wasn’t guided by experts. When we got back into a covered car and set up a new base (in a relatively swanky cabin that was pretty large but also had too many doors to feasibly defend for long), we spent far less time shooting at the first people we saw and more time attempting to strike deals with them. There were squads who were already ahead of us making their way into the engine room, and assembling as much resistance as possible against them seemed like a stronger move than attempting to go it alone against a well fortified team with much more of an advantage than us. This is possible, and plausible, because teams who don't steal the train engine’s fuel core can still extract with all of the materials they’ve pilfered and plundered during the run, which can be used to build their own trains.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We didn’t see any of this system during our playthrough, but individual players can hoard materials and resources to upgrade their personal safe havens, and eventually pirate their own Marauder trains. According to Red Rover, players can become conductors of these claimed trains, and invite friends to crew it with them. These raiding clans can pool their resources to add cars and all sorts of upgrades to their marauders, but also will be able to use these battle barges to raid other players Marauders as well as the main Titan Train. This sounds like a hectic, somewhat asymmetrical version of Meet Your Maker’s player dungeons, except the dungeons meet on the rails and everyone inside them fights over scraps of toilet bowl. This is also something very much still in development and farther down the roadmap.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/13/second-class-combat-1760372319524.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With a team already fortifying themselves inside the engine room, and a shaky alliance made between us and another hodgepodge raiding party, we pooled our efforts to secure entry to the conductor class car, and had ourselves a tense and awkward stakeout. The group we allied with got taken out by other stragglers before fully crossing into the car, and we were on our own again, building what would be our last base in a car full of verdant greenery and opulence. Here, we attempted to goad the enemy out, sometimes literally Flak and Fred barking insults through the door hoping to annoy them to death. We sort of had them in a hard spot - their only way off of this train should they decide to take the fuel core and bounce was through us. We weren’t exactly safe either, though, as straggling raiders were making their way up to the engine room, effectively pinching us between the conductors and them. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The conductors took advantage of the chaos to add a bit more, by pulling the fuel core and starting a meltdown sequence, filling the car with toxic gas and using all of the bedlam to escape past us.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The stalemate would eventually break after we were forced to turn our attention to the amassing amount of enemies crowding this final car. The conductors took advantage of the chaos to add a bit more, by pulling the fuel core and starting a meltdown sequence, filling the car with toxic gas and using all of the bedlam to escape past us. The clock starts ticking and everyone has the same primary goal now: get the hell off of the train. Practically, this meant a mad dash back several cars to an escape door and through other players who might be more motivated by spite than survival, shooting at anyone who isn’t them in hopes that we have goodies worth keeping as a consolation prize. It was hard to tell in all the desperate running and gunning who extracted and who didn’t. All I know is that we definitely didn’t, missing the chance to blow the train by mere seconds.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/13/conductor-compartment-1760372335722.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Through our session, I got the most mileage out of the snappy shooting and melee combat and tactical navigation decisions, but there are some systems present that never left the station this time around. A contract was started by a player that asked all of the active raiders to choose a side: either to rise up and overthrow the current conductor, or to fight on the conductor’s behalf. The outcome sorts the lobby into two teams and provides an extra reward if one side wins over the other. I wasn’t entirely sure how either team was supposed to do this? Was there a time limit, or a kill threshold? This is something I'm sure the average player would get the hang of after a few games, but I largely ignored this and didn’t feel like I missed anything. There are also some survival elements to contend with, specifically hunger and thirst. I was constantly picking up things that sounded like terrible meals, like roach nests and weird train grown mushrooms, but I died so regularly that I never had to worry about what a pie made of human ears, a more advanced meal option, might taste like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a lot I didn’t see in my first run of Enginefall, from the alternate pathways players can take making every run to the front of the massive Titan Train unique, to the player-driven or environmental events that incentivize raiders to take higher risks for higher rewards. It can be messy to learn and difficult to know how to proceed at first, and the fast pace of this death race makes it impossible to stop and smell the roses for too long, but the fun shooting and looting really has me interested in getting back on the rails when its first public playtest goes live October 24th-26th.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/enginefall-is-a-compelling-extraction-shooter-set-on-a-moving-train]]></content:encoded>

Crimson Desert is an open-world action game, of course, so naturally <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-deserts-combat-explained">combat is key to the entire experience</a>.

But we also wanted to showcase a little more of the story and help contextualize where some of those… stranger elements come from. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But first, the basics. You play as Kliff, leader of the Greymanes free sword company. Not that he’s doing much leading right now. Crimson Desert’s prologue sees the Greymanes attacked by their sworn rivals, the Black Bears, and the assault leaves the company wounded and scattered (a bloody opening you can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/crimson-desert-exclusive-gameplay">see in action here</a>). Alone, Kliff sets out on a mission to seek out his lost allies, rebuild the Greymanes, and exact vengeance on the enemies who tore the company apart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That mission takes Kliff on a journey across Pywel, a massive continent made up of numerous regions, including the titular Crimson Desert. As he explores, he learns of a number of powerful artefacts that grant immense power – a power that some are using to wreak destructive havoc rather than enact good deeds. Kliff takes it upon himself to get involved and finds himself falling down a rabbit hole that leads to a grander destiny. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the quest we’re showcasing today, "Master of the Forgotten Lands", Kliff has found himself wound up in the affairs of Marni, a scientific genius. Fans of Black Desert Online, developer Pearl Abyss’ previous game, may recognise the name Marni, and while Kliff’s new acquaintance is not the same character, they are somewhat mirror images of each other – both incredibly intelligent scientists who make the impossible possible via unorthodox methods. In Marni’s secret cliff base, you can see one of the origin points of Crimson Desert’s steampunk aesthetic. His array of strange devices suggest he’s much more advanced than Pywel’s wider Medieval-like society. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This quest takes Kliff on a journey along the Great Ocean of Pywel’s coast, up Mount Benus, and into Marni’s Masterium, where an army of unexpected foes await. And then, at the castle’s summit, Kliff must hold his own against the colossal Golden Star. Will he succeed? You’ll have to watch our brand new gameplay video to find out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stick with IGN throughout this month for even more from Crimson Desert. Later this week we’ll be revealing how Pearl Abyss created Golden Star, taking you behind the scenes to see how sound, vision, and gameplay mechanics combine to create a striking boss battle.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-golden-star-quest-gameplay]]></content:encoded>
