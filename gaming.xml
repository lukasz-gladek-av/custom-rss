Unfortunately, the arrival of the Lich King's weapon is also accompanied by portals filled with undead, which players will need to battle against over the course of the July 4-26 event. They'll receive a little undead help of their own, however. A new power, Chill of the Frozen Throne, will see players earn a 10% damage increase after killing five monsters, as well as the ability to raise up to five skeletal minions to fight by their side, no Necromancer required.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ov-entertainments-quest-to-unite-latin-american-games-firms-begins-with-kokku-3ogs-acquisitions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>CEO Thiago de Freitas tells us "the future of games development is coming from South and Latin America"</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The newly-formed OV Entertainment Group has made its first two acquisitions: Brazilian developer Kokku and Argentinian tools and tech specialist 3OGS.</p>
<p>Both were acquired for an undisclosed sum and form the basis of a group that aims to unite Latin American games companies in order to accelerate their growth and give them access to resources they would otherwise be unable to reach.</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> sat down with key execs from all three companies during Gamescom Latam in São Paulo this week, where the vision for the group was described as the brainchild of Thiago de Freitas, founder of Kokku and now CEO of OV Entertainment.</p>
<p>De Freitas (pictured above left) explained that the idea began following a string of acquisition offers for Kokku, one of the largest studios in Brazil and one of the few with AAA development experience. Kokku provides services ranging from art production and co-development to full game development, and has contributed to games such as Horizon Fobidden West, Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War, Prison Architect 2, and more.</p>
<p>"We always wanted to show the world that the future of games development is coming from South America and Latin America, but we decided it's not for us to sell the company to any of these other groups or institutions," the CEO told us. "We really understand the culture, we don't want to be diluted into a different brand. And since we are Latin Amercians and we're proud of that, we know how to work with the culture, with the politics and labour laws, and all the weird financial taxes you need to pay here. Having this kind of understanding helps us to grow business here.</p>
<p>"That's one of the big reasons why Kokku was never sold to anyone, and why we decided to start uniting the Latin America game companies."</p>
<p>De Freitas added that Kokku's reputation and established contacts will help elevate other companies in the group, ones that may not have had the same opportunities before or lacked the structure and resources to take advantage of them.</p>
<p>"Companies like 3OGS, they're very talented, extremely skilled but they were struggling to find better companies and to reach other clients because they didn't have access to investment money and go beyond what they were already doing," he said.</p>
<p>3OGS, which stands for Three Ordinary Guys Studio, is a tech specialist based in Argentina and the team first met with De Freitas nearly two years ago when they were seeking investment. Co-CEO Pablo Navajas (pictured above right) said that when he heard the overall vision for OV Entertainment, it was "beyond our imagination."</p>
<p>"It was aligned with what we wanted to do in future, but we had that ambition alone and with [OV] we have the opportunity to accelerate that process," he said.</p>
<p>"We've also had companies trying to acquire us in the past, but this was the first time we felt like, 'Yes, this is the sort of future we want to shape.' This is going to be the huge step we wanted to do, just more quickly."</p>
<p>Navajas added that being part of a larger group will enable 3OGS to be involved in more complex projects and recruit larger teams to handle them.</p>
<p>De Freitas also hinted that this group will go beyond video games development and services, expressing a "broader vision of tapping into film, TV and other areas."</p>
<p>While OV Entertainment will focus on acquiring companies from Latam markets, the parent company itself is registered and based in the UK, with chief strategy officer Chris Bergstresser (pictured above) telling us this will make it easier for the group to access capital and operate with a more global focus.</p>
<p>Crucially, Bergstresser said the company has been watching other, larger games and services groups carefully and aim to learn from their mistakes.</p>
<p>"The idea [Embracer] got correct is operational independence," he said, by way of example. "Ultimately, the only value in any company is the teams that are there. The reason why you get the best talent is because people love the working methodologies and the culture of those companies. Those are preserved.</p>
<p>"While Kokku and 3OGs are all part of OV Entertainment, it's the same shareholders so I wouldn't say they've lost independence. No one will do that in the future. It's effectively the same guys running the companies as it was before."</p>
<p>De Freitas added: "When we created OV Entertainment, it was to make sure we would use the company not like a Keywords or Embracer or these other groups, but we want to be a backstage kind of group. We're not here to take the lead or to dilute brands."</p>
<p>Navajas concurred, emphasising that a key reason 3OGS agreed to this acquisition was because the team can "make our own decisions [and] keep our clients."</p>
<p>"I think this is going to be a great group, and the next few years are going to be great. If we went alone, this sort of thing would have taken us another ten years, and now we can be there in two to three years."</p>

Where were you all when I was the last holdout of my middle school lunch period trying to do synchro-summons because I thought they were the coolest thing in the world? I ask this because there has not only been a discernable uptick in the trading card game and video games’ popularity of late, but some guy is now pulling out cards and winning Olympic qualifying races like some kind of mad man.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="191665" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Hearthstone Deck Will Kill You In One Turn" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="141" data-playlist="191665,194718,194547" data-current="191665"><div><p>This Hearthstone Deck Will Kill You In One Turn</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191665/191665_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191665/191665_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191665/191665_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191665/191665_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/17440.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Noah Lyles, who’s evidently on his way to representing the US in the Paris Olympics later this year, is also apparently the Olympics preeminent <em>Yu-Gi-Oh </em>scholar. Before his recent heats (or races), Lyles has been flashing popular <em>Yu-Gi-Oh </em>cards to the cameras, including Blue-Eyes White Dragon and the head of Exodia, before tucking them back <em>into </em>his running suit. To top it all off, or perhaps to add insult to injury, he’s been <em>winning </em>these races as well. Folks, I think we may have discovered the fastest geek alive.</p><p>After flashing the head of Exodia just the other day, Lyles has followed it up in the most delightfully predictable way: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Dexerto/status/1806679621313720498&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Dexerto/status/1806679621313720498" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two<em> more</em> pieces of Exodia</a></span>. For the uninitiated, unaware, and unbothered, Exodia is a legendary monster in the fiction of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh</em>. It’s so powerful that when it was sealed away as a card, it was split into several pieces in the hope that they would never be used for fear of its literal destructive power. Thus, there are five pieces of Exodia: a head, two arms, and two legs.</p><p>In practice, Exodia is one of the most potent monsters to have in your deck because simply drawing all five pieces immediately wins the game. The modern version of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh</em> features mechanics that allow for Exodia to be taken out of play, or at the very least mitigated, so it isn’t <em>all </em>powerful like it used to be. Still, a player stunned a crowd by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/yu-gi-oh-legend-uses-the-iconic-exodia-to-win-a-modern-tournament-match-as-the-crowd-chants-one-more-piece-and-even-his-opponent-claps-for-him/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/yu-gi-oh-legend-uses-the-iconic-exodia-to-win-a-modern-tournament-match-as-the-crowd-chants-one-more-piece-and-even-his-opponent-claps-for-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">winning a tournament using Exodia</a></span> just last year, so they’ve still got the juice, and that’s seemingly what Lyles is suggesting about himself.</p><p>In the same interview where he flashed both the right and left arms of Exodia, Lyles claimed that “Now it’s time to build the whole thing. I got the left and right arms, and I got the legs coming tomorrow.” When the interviewer had <em>zero </em>clue what Lyles was telling him, he clarified, “All the <em>Yu-Gi-Oh </em>fans know. Something big is coming.”</p><p>Lyles isn’t just pulling out the cards because he’s a huge fan of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh </em>and anime though. In an incredibly cute twist, he’s actually <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/06/24/noah-lyles-yu-gi-oh-cards-olympics/74194959007/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/06/24/noah-lyles-yu-gi-oh-cards-olympics/74194959007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flashing them as part of a bet</a></span> with another athlete, the world champion shot putter Chase Ealey. According to Lyles, they have a running bet which stipulates that if he flashes <em>Yu-Gi-Oh </em>cards before his heats throughout the ongoing Olympic trials, Ealey will wear Rock Lee’s (of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/naruto-live-action-shang-chi-director-1851283058&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/naruto-live-action-shang-chi-director-1851283058"><em>Naruto</em></a></span>) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDzse1-2W8Q&amp;t=1s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDzse1-2W8Q&amp;t=1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leg weights</a></span>—which ironically make him super fast-–and take them off during her own finals. This might be the best sports anime I’ve ever seen.</p><p>It now seems incredibly likely that we’ll see Lyles pull out the entirety of Exodia over the course of his Olympic trials, and seeing as how he keeps knocking wins back, only time will tell what else he’s got up his suit. I only pray that he makes it to the Olympics and keeps this bit up for the hell of it. In the meantime, do you think he’s taking suggestions? If so, bring out Black Luster Soldier next, king. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Along with providing easier access to the original trilogy, DRM-free, GOG has also revealed that the original version of Resident Evil 2 is based on the 1998 Windows PC version. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It's been hard keeping this secret but I'm happy to announce that GOG is doing the impossible and is bringing back the classic Resident Evil Trilogy! I've played the ports of RE1/2, and here are my thoughts on what I've experienced! RTs very appreciated! <a href="https://t.co/lh4dHfsnYd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/lh4dHfsnYd</a> <a href="https://t.co/p15HI87qTO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/p15HI87qTO</a></p>— Suzi Hunter (@TheSphereHunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSphereHunter/status/1805934519943569909?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The news was <a href="https://youtu.be/o38wFuD3Wag?si=cU4011hLRCva3cr3&amp;t=436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first reported by YouTuber The Sphere Hunter</a>, who revealed she had the chance to play the first two games in advance — revealing that Resident Evil 2 classic was based on the original Windows PC version, not the Sourcenext version. A GOG spokesperson also confirmed this detail to IGN in a statement sent via email. </p><p>If you're unfamiliar with these two ports, the former was released in 1998 for Windows 98, while the latter, developed by software company Sourcenext, was a WindowsXP-compatible port released exclusively in Japan in 2006. </p><p>The biggest difference between these two versions is that the Sourcenext version provided higher-quality full-motion videos (FMVs). Many Resident Evil fans have argued that the Sourcenext version was the definitive way to play Resident Evil 2 on PC. Though this version was only released in Japan, as content creator Ultra Creed <a href="https://youtu.be/N-XB8ctbteE?si=maRyIcp949ZKlPDE&amp;t=759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out</a>, fans have used the Resident Evil 2 Classic REbirth mod to not only translate the Sourcenext version to English (minus the FMVs) but also add support for modern controllers and added optional gameplay features you could enable, such as quick turns and tactical reloads.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/03/23/resident-evil-2-7">our review of the original PC version of Resident Evil 2</a>, IGN wrote: "It's just too shallow for the average PC gamer. With such little change over the Playstation version, it makes you wonder why it took Capcom three months to get this one out on the PC." </p><p>The original Resident Evil is now available on GOG. Resident Evil 2 and 3 are not available yet.</p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

The latest version of this technology aims to improve upscaling image quality in supported games and "decouple" the company's FSR 3 frame generation tech from the standard FSR 3. The latter means that PC players can use FSR Frame Generation concurrently with Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) or Intel's Xe Super Sampling XeSS tech. </p><p>AMD further revealed in the blog post that the third-generation of FSR 3 has expanded, with 60 games now available or soon to be released supporting the tech. Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2, Starfield, Concord, and The First Descendant are among the games supporting FSR 3.</p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

More recently, From Software added<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-post-dlc-elden-ring-patch-rebalances-early-difficulty-after-community-backlash/1100-6524525/"> another patch, which made Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier</a> for those who may be stuck.</p><p dir="ltr">In our<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/"> Shadow of the Erdtree review</a>, Tamoor Hussain wrote, "Elden Ring was a masterful open-world game that I would describe as generation-defining--it will go down in history as one of the all-time greats. But, when the final blow was struck in the Land of Shadow and my journey came to an end, I couldn't help but reflect on how it has made me feel and what has stuck with me."</p>

Here’s what we’ve learned about <em>Elden Ring</em>, its story, and its characters while playing <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. <strong>Major spoilers incoming. </strong></p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spoiler warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spoiler warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h108076"><a id=""></a><strong>What is the Shadow Realm?</strong></h2><p>The Realm of Shadow is essentially an alternate, death-filled version of the Lands Between. The Scadutree at its center is literally a shadow version of the Erdtree in the Lands Between, and the prevalence of ghostly tombstones and coffins delineate that this is a world steeped in death. Though the Realm of Shadow exists under a veil, it’s believed to be sitting smack in the center of the original <em>Elden Ring </em>map, right under that cloud that’s just south of the Erdtree.<br></p><h2 id="h108077"><a id=""></a><strong>Who is Messmer the Impaler?</strong></h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-let-me-solo-her-him-messmer-shadow-erdtree-1851563743&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-let-me-solo-her-him-messmer-shadow-erdtree-1851563743">Messmer </a></span>is the son of Queen Marika, and the brother of Malenia and Miquella. He was born with a snake living inside of him (that he calls the Abyssal Serpent) which threatened to take him over, so his mother contained the serpent by removing one of Messmer’s eyes and placing a magical seal there instead.<br></p><p>Before the Elden Ring shattered, Messmer was sent to the Realm of Shadow to purge the tower-dwellers (the Hornsent) who were not followers of Marika’s religion/bathed in the light of grace. Remember: in the Lands Between, the Hornsent are called Omens, and are shunned from society or killed in attempts to remove their horns. That’s because they represent the dominant religion of the land <em>before</em> the establishment of the Greater Will and its vassal, Marika. As we progress through the DLC, however, the beef between Marika and the Hornsent gets a bit more complicated (more on that later).<br></p><p>For some reason, Marika abandoned Messmer in the Realm of Shadow, but he refused to stop purging folks. </p><figure id="" data-id="514cb2c8811f28ac54c8776ab5b840bf" data-recommend-id="image://514cb2c8811f28ac54c8776ab5b840bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Freyja believes Radahn wants to be be brought back for &quot;endless war.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Freyja believes Radahn wants to be be brought back for &quot;endless war.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="514cb2c8811f28ac54c8776ab5b840bf" data-recommend-id="image://514cb2c8811f28ac54c8776ab5b840bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Freyja believes Radahn wants to be be brought back for &quot;endless war.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h108078"><a id=""></a><strong>Who is Kindly Miquella and why did he go to the Shadow Realm?</strong></h2><p>Miquella is the twin brother of Malenia, both born to Marika and Radagon and both cursed—Malenia with scarlet rot, and Miquella with eternal youth. Though Miquella traps himself in a cocoon at the base of a tree he tried to grow to cure himself and Malenia, he is stolen while in slumber by Mohg, who wanted to use his blood in order to start his own empire (though now, it appears that Miquella may have tricked Mohg into doing all of this so he could enter the Realm of Shdaow).<br></p><p>When Miquella fell into his slumber, he entered the Realm of Shadow to find the soul of the Promised Consort, who turns out to be Radahn, the very same Radahn who is the child of Radagon and Rennala. Miquella wants to stand at the gates of divinity (seen in the trailer for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>) and complete a ritual in order to become a god. That ritual involves capturing the dead Radahn’s soul in Mohg’s body—remember, you have to kill both of those bosses in the base game to even start the <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC, and now we know why.<br></p><h2 id="h108079"><a id=""></a><strong>Why did Miquella choose Radahn as his Consort?</strong></h2><p>Some think that Miquella chose Radahn to be his Consort because of his sheer strength as a demigod—the only person to best him was Malenia, and perhaps her Scarlet Rot affliction made it impossible for Miquella to name her as Consort. A cutscene that plays after you defeat Radahn in the DLC shows that Miquella proposed some sort of vow to Radahn that would result in him becoming his consort after ascending to Godhood. It’s unclear if that’s why that big battle between Malenia and Radahn that we saw in the original trailer for <em>Elden Ring</em> took place—if that battle was part of the vow or something else entirely. We also don’t know for sure if Radahn accepted the vow <em>or</em> was just acting while under the influence of Miquella, who can even charm the player during the final boss bottle, stealing your heart and insta-killing you.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="8ff4f9ae51c10d59d3e205f063d15011" data-recommend-id="image://8ff4f9ae51c10d59d3e205f063d15011" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ansbach realizes what Miquella wants to do with Radahn and Mohg." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ansbach realizes what Miquella wants to do with Radahn and Mohg." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8ff4f9ae51c10d59d3e205f063d15011" data-recommend-id="image://8ff4f9ae51c10d59d3e205f063d15011" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ansbach realizes what Miquella wants to do with Radahn and Mohg." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h108080"><a id=""></a><strong>What does Miquella want, and is he all that Kindly?</strong></h2><p>Early on in the DLC, you meet several NPCs who represent different factions in this world: Needle Knight Leda, the last remaining footsoldier for Miquella; Freyja, who once fought alongside Radahn; the Hornsent, a member of the aforementioned tower folk; and Sir Ansbach, who served Mohg. Though they come from disparate backgrounds, they are all in the Realm of Shadow to find “kindly Miquella,” and they recruit you, as well.<br></p><p>But it appears that Miquella charmed all of them, twisting their minds to support his cause. That’s why, when you head towards the Shadow Keep (Messmer’s castle), an in-game event will take place: you hear the audio cue for using a rune arc, and the words “somewhere, a great rune has broken…and so too has a powerful charm.” After speaking to the NPCs, you learn that Miquella himself broke this rune, thus also freeing all of those under his charm. They’re confused, uncertain who to follow or where to go, as they were only united because Miquella was forcing them to be. Ansbach remembers fighting Miquella for Mohg, calling the once-Kindly Miquella a “monster.”<br></p><p>After this event takes place, Miquella’s goal becomes even more clear: the crosses you find scattered across the map are places where Miquella has shed parts of his being in order to be born anew, and breaking his rune arc is part of that process.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-lore-messmer-miquella-1851492064&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-lore-messmer-miquella-1851492064">I posited before the release of the DLC</a></span> that Miquella wanted to right his mother Marika’s wrongs, and bring justice to the people of the Realm of Shadow who were (seemingly) crusaded against because of their horns (more on that later), and that still seems to be the case. Miquella wants to bring about an “Age of Compassion,” and many NPCs reference his love, but the way he’s going about everything is pretty fucked up—charming people into fighting for him and using the dead body of one lord to house the soul of another.</p><figure id="" data-id="1e8322173671c8581bc2c5115d371c6d" data-recommend-id="image://1e8322173671c8581bc2c5115d371c6d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished kneels before St. Trina." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Tarnished kneels before St. Trina." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1e8322173671c8581bc2c5115d371c6d" data-recommend-id="image://1e8322173671c8581bc2c5115d371c6d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished kneels before St. Trina." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h108081"><a id=""></a><strong>Who is St. Trina?</strong></h2><p>St. Trina is only briefly mentioned in the base game, but she has a whole section dedicated to her in the DLC, and an NPC dedicated to her as well: Thiollier. The DLC confirms beliefs that players have had for years: St. Trina and Miquella are the same person, just like Radagon and Marika are believed to be two halves of a whole. A cross near where you can find St. Trina confirms that this is where Miquella discarded his “love.” And yes, just like Radagon and Marika, a soul can clearly exist in two different bodies in this world—and fall in love with itself.

The description says that this meat is used to fill great jars, and that “This is what becomes of the condemned, who get sliced up and stuffed into jars to become saints instead.”</p><p>Albi and others believe that Marika and her people lived in the Shaman Village, an area in the Realm of Shadow that you can find after gesturing in front of a statute of Marika, which will reveal a door to the wildflower-covered region. Though there are two Tree Sentinels there you must fight, there’s little else in this area, save for two items: a spell that conjures up a minor Erdtree, and a lock of Marika’s hair.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="40d9c1f75ea58331ccce37d70bef3545" data-recommend-id="image://40d9c1f75ea58331ccce37d70bef3545" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished sits amongst hundreds of wildflowers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Tarnished sits amongst hundreds of wildflowers." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="40d9c1f75ea58331ccce37d70bef3545" data-recommend-id="image://40d9c1f75ea58331ccce37d70bef3545" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished sits amongst hundreds of wildflowers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The spell’s description reads: “Marika bathed the village of her home in gold, knowing full well that there was no one left to heal.”<br></p><p>The only other reference to shaman in the DLC, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKWkWp69dA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKWkWp69dA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as noted by YouTuber Gingy</a></span>, is a Hornsent ghost saying that a shaman’s place is in the jar. We now know that, at some point, the Hornsent were torturing the shaman—an item you can find called the Tooth Whip describes this process.

Can time slow down? No? Okay. Fine. Well, at least we’re at the weekend, so that means (hopefully) you have some free time to spend on video games. This week we’ve rounded up an eclectic mix of eight games worth checking out as you shelter from the heat (assuming it’s hot where you are. If not, well, aren’t you lucky? Unless it’s too cold. Look, you can manage your own weather).  </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e1f4d8af1a6790a957fbbeb875c7d23c" data-recommend-id="image://e1f4d8af1a6790a957fbbeb875c7d23c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A big monster looks down at someone off camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A big monster looks down at someone off camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e1f4d8af1a6790a957fbbeb875c7d23c" data-recommend-id="image://e1f4d8af1a6790a957fbbeb875c7d23c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A big monster looks down at someone off camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows (Steam Deck: YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Finish the post-<em>Endwalker</em> patches before <em>Dawntrail</em> releases</p><p>After putting it off for as long as I possibly could, I finally finished <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-goodbye-dawntrail-1851561996&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-goodbye-dawntrail-1851561996"><em>Endwalker</em></a></span> literally hours before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-dawntrail-ps5-controller-1851385139&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-dawntrail-ps5-controller-1851385139"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a></span>’s servers went down for maintenance.

Even with the uneven pacing of <em>Endwalker</em>, I still grew to love the expansion in the end, and it reaffirmed why I keep coming back to <em>F14</em>, so I am re-energized to dive in for more. </p><p>That being said, post-expansion patches are often a major slog and I can’t help but worry I’m in for some tedious questing. I do know that there are some things to look forward to: namely meeting Zero and tackling the Myths of the Realm raid series. Whatever the case, I only have this weekend to marathon through the remaining quests ahead of <em>Dawntrail’</em>s wide release on July 2. I’m gonna be optimistic and say I can get it done with time to spare. — Willa Rowe</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fb2c2769b69d63bebd90484dd2a8c579" data-recommend-id="image://fb2c2769b69d63bebd90484dd2a8c579" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Beyond Good &amp; Evil sneaks around a corner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Beyond Good &amp; Evil sneaks around a corner." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fb2c2769b69d63bebd90484dd2a8c579" data-recommend-id="image://fb2c2769b69d63bebd90484dd2a8c579" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Beyond Good &amp; Evil sneaks around a corner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, Windows (Steam Deck: YMMV)</p><p><strong>Current goal:</strong> Just be. Goals are pressure.</p><p>Every time I replay <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>, I forget how it starts. In my memory, it’s a game that begins with heroine Jade on her lovely, idyllic island, running around taking photographs of all the various beasties, and then, eventually, attacks rain from the skies. So I’m bemused, each time, when it’s the other way around.</p><p>I’m pretty disappointed by the state of the Steam release of the game. For no good reason you have to play it through an Ubisoft Connect account, and it lacks basic PC options like a way to play in a window on my ultra-widescreen monitor. (It even overrides Steam launch settings to force this!) Also, other people on Steam are so VERY mad that it doesn’t have the promised achievements. It’s not an auspicious launch. But it’s still <em>BG&amp;E</em>, a game that I seem to replay every five or so years. So much so that honestly, I don’t want a sequel. I certainly don’t want a sequel that looks like anything in any of the bullshit trailers that have appeared over the years, pretending to be from a game that exists. The original is plenty. — John Walker</p></div></div><div><div id="191891"><div data-video-id="191891" data-monetizable="true" data-position="kinjavideo" data-video-title="This Game Teaches You How To Use A Synthesizer IRL" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="191891" data-current="191891"><div><p>This Game Teaches You How To Use A Synthesizer IRL</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" playsinline="" poster="https://no.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_542,pg_1,q_60,w_965/197xrjaz7466rpng.png" data-poster="https://no.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_542,pg_1,q_60,w_965/d6725de22c32d1bb16f48a5f6298c92b.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191891/191891_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191891/191891_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191891/191891_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191891/191891_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><figcaption>This Game Teaches You How To Use A Synthesizer IRL</figcaption></div><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>Windows (Steam Deck: YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Develop a better understanding of control voltage</p><p>I do love video games, but I probably love making music even more. And over the past five years, I’ve only developed a greater appetite for and interest in synthesis—particularly modular synthesis, as I’m no keyboard player.

That’s not necessarily a problem, but I could use a better understanding of how voltage flows, combines, splits, can be attenuated, and more. <em>The Signal State</em>’s puzzles are all about that, asking you to route signal paths in specific ways such as, “SRC 2 is a binary signal. When it is at 100 volts, send SRC 1 to OUT 1. Otherwise, send 0 volts to OUT 1,” or, “Send SRC 1 to OUT 2, but with its intensity boosted by a percentage by SRC 2.”</p><p>Riveting stuff, huh? Sure, it’s dry. But dry is what I need right now and <em>The Signal State</em> seems like the perfect set of exercises for me to just drill the basics of voltage flowing across a system. This is especially useful for me as I’m slimming down the number of individual Eurorack modules I own to prioritize my use of semi-modular gear. So as I figure out what modules I’m keeping to fit into a tinier, more portable 42HP rack, hopefully <em>The Signal State</em> will key my brain into thinking more about direct utility and voltage control than shiny, fancier stuff (but damn do I really want that Qu-Bit Nautilus delay module and maybe it was a mistake to sell my Monsoon…).</p><p>And though I do use and love <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://vcvrack.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://vcvrack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VCV Rack</a></span>, that’s an actual piece of music software and doesn’t have the puzzles, challenges, and restrictions that are conducive to making progress in learning new skills (especially musical ones). — Claire Jackson</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4cde24bffe19f4e6f0a7b9521caea734" data-recommend-id="image://4cde24bffe19f4e6f0a7b9521caea734" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Barret and Red XII fight monsters in a cave." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Barret and Red XII fight monsters in a cave." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4cde24bffe19f4e6f0a7b9521caea734" data-recommend-id="image://4cde24bffe19f4e6f0a7b9521caea734" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Barret and Red XII fight monsters in a cave." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Get the fuck out of the Gold Saucer</p><p>I’m back in the Cait Sith saddle folks and it feels, ugh, fine.

That whole completing random mini-games, including actual honest to god Fiverr-style gig work just to get bathing suits to get on the beach to do a random boss fight that didn’t exist in the original game was just not working for me.

Haha fuck yeah!!! Yes!! Shooting boxes on a mine cart? Well this fucking sucks. What the fuck. When I reached the Gold Saucer in the original game it was a fun reprieve.

Its visuals were always impressive, but the notion of a first-person brawler never quite captured my attention. Hearing that it was basically an immersive sim set in the pages of a noir comic book set my brain ablaze though, and I had a blast with the first few levels and how open-ended it was. I’m so used to games ascribing scores based on how well you play, so I was shocked when <em>Fallen Aces </em>refused to judge me for occasionally fudging stealth segments and going loud. That flexibility and encouragement to improv your way through a level is what’s going to usher me through the end of the current early access build. I’ll be sad to have to wait for more, but if its beginnings are any indication, <em>Fallen Aces </em>is going to be a riot of a game when it’s complete. –Moises Taveras  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="53179b2538c6a7bc6f7839576b0c2450" data-recommend-id="image://53179b2538c6a7bc6f7839576b0c2450" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player in Riven looks at a dome-shaped object." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player in Riven looks at a dome-shaped object." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Cyan, Inc.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="53179b2538c6a7bc6f7839576b0c2450" data-recommend-id="image://53179b2538c6a7bc6f7839576b0c2450" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player in Riven looks at a dome-shaped object." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Myst </em>sold like hotcakes when it was released in 1993, but for a game so financially successful, it has a strange reputation. A lot of those copies may have been bought by normies just eager to see what the CD-ROM drives on their pricey new PCs could do, because when I bring it up in gaming circles, I’m more often met with derision than reverence. “The puzzles sucked!” many say. “It’s just so boring.” Well, it certainly made for a stark contrast with <em>Doom</em>, released the same year, and while I admired both, <em>Myst</em>’s<em> </em>was the world I got utterly lost in. I think everything about the game is brilliant. Its distinctive architecture and atmosphere seeped into my mind so deeply that, out and about in the real world, I’d sometimes spot something vaguely <em>Myst</em>-like and feel transported into the game. And I think its puzzles were brilliant, each so distinctive and absorbing, with all the information you needed to solve them able to be picked up through experimentation and examination of the environment around you. <em>Myst </em>is a masterpiece, one of the games of my life. </p><p><br>But when its sequel landed a few years later, I was in no position to play it. Here it was, the follow-up to one of the most mind blowing and formative experiences of my life as a lover of video games, and I missed it. By the time, years later, that things in my life had settled and I actually could play it, the moment had passed, and despite my love for <em>Myst</em>, I struggled to go back to a game with rigid, node-to-node movement, even one as gorgeous as <em>Riven</em>. Now, finally, this landmark sequel has gotten the remake treatment it so clearly deserved, and I can experience its atmosphere and its puzzles in free-look, free-movement glory. I admit I think that inevitably, when remaking a game like <em>Riven</em>, some things will be lost even as others are gained—I will always prefer the original’s live-action characters to the 3D models of those in the remake (watch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/jLCGegxqu3Q?si=JR8tACOcc1a8HbTb&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/jLCGegxqu3Q?si=JR8tACOcc1a8HbTb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the early stretch of this video</a></span> for a comparison of the two)—but the environments look incredible.

But I eventually burned myself out a bit, and stopped playing once I wrapped up the main story and some of the endgame. But recently, I felt this urge deep inside to wander around dungeons, killing thousands of demons while collecting loot. So I booted up <em>Diablo 4 </em>again to check out the new season. </p><p>I’ve never played the seasons in <em>Diablo 3</em> or this latest entry. But I made a new character, a druid, and hopped in. I really think Blizzard needs to do more to explain what is happening, where to go, and the gameplay loop of the season, because it took me some time and googling to figure it out. However, now that I (mostly) understand what I’m doing, I’m having a blast in <em>Diablo 4. </em>The loot is flowing, the demons are dying and my druid is quickly growing in power as I complete quests and level up the battle pass. I’m not sure I’ll be back for every future season, but with the new expansion coming later this year, I’m suddenly much more excited about <em>Diablo 4</em> in 2024 than I expected.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/23350899/nintendo-switch-controllers-best-wireless-joy-con-gamepad<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The best Nintendo Switch controllers aren’t the ones that come with it. While the removable Joy-Cons included with all non-Lite Switch consoles are convenient given they can be detached for wireless use, their tiny contourless design isn’t that comfortable for long gaming sessions or large hands. And while Nintendo has taken steps to address the dreaded <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">Joy-Con drift</a> and earlier quality control problems, some issues persist.</p><p>In this buying guide, we focus on wireless controllers that are both comfortable and reliable, as well as a few options that come with unique features designed to match your play style. We’re not covering wired controllers that plug into the Switch’s dock, as they’re almost all the same and don’t offer substantial savings in many cases. (<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.powera.com%2Fc%2Fnintendo%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fcontrollers%2F">PowerA</a> and <a href="https://pdp.com/collections/nintendo-switch-controllers">PDP</a> make decent ones that will do in a pinch, but they’re very basic. Unless you detest recharging your controllers, it makes more sense to go wireless.)</p><p>Also, if you buy a third-party wireless controller (as in, one not made by Nintendo), there are certain things that it likely won’t be able to do unless otherwise noted:</p><div><ul><li>It won’t have HD rumble. This is what Nintendo calls its advanced haptic feedback, which is more precise than that of many third-party controllers and more akin to Sony’s haptics engine in its subtlety. That said, some more limited rumble may be present.&nbsp;</li><li>Many third-party Switch controllers don’t have motion controls for gestures or gyroscopic aiming in games that support it, though more options are starting to implement the latter feature with varying degrees of quality.</li><li>Most non-Nintendo options lack an NFC reader for Amiibo cards or figurines, which unlock special features in some games.&nbsp;</li><li>Most third-party options won’t be able to turn on the Switch remotely. (You’ll have to manually press the console’s power button.)&nbsp;</li><li>While some Switch controllers have 3.5mm headphone jacks, getting audio out of them can only happen through a wired USB connection, not wirelessly. For most people, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22690100/how-to-pair-bluetooth-wireless-headphones-earbuds-nintendo-switch">pairing Bluetooth headphones to your Switch</a> is a sufficient (and very easy) workaround.</li></ul></div><div><p>If you’re playing your Switch while docked, it’s hard to go wrong with the official <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0/?tag=theverge02-20">Nintendo Switch Pro Controller</a>. It’s the only traditional gamepad that checks all the boxes above — minus the 3.5mm audio jack — and it’s one of the most satisfying controllers we’ve tested. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-NS-Switch-Joysticks-Button%EF%BC%88Black%EF%BC%89/dp/B09MS2VFSB/?tag=theverge02-20">GuliKit KingKong 2 Pro</a>, meanwhile, makes for a great Xbox-style controller with exhaustive customization, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Split-Ergonomic-Controller-Handheld/dp/B08FJ7XY3B?tag=theverge02-20">Hori Split Pad Pro</a> is great for those who prefer to play in handheld mode. Then there’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9BGJVLL?tag=theverge02-20">8BitDo’s PC-friendly Ultimate Bluetooth Controller</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Android-Raspberry/dp/B08XY8SK9B/?tag=theverge02-20">DualShock-esque Pro 2 controller</a>, both of which are well worth a look.</p></div><div><p><h3>What we’re looking for</h3></p><p><h4><strong>Connectivity</strong></h4></p><p>Does it support Bluetooth? Can you use it in wired mode? Are there alternate wireless modes, such as 2.4GHz?</p><p><h4><strong>Quality</strong></h4></p><p>Do the buttons, sticks, and triggers feel good and sturdy? Does the controller have a satisfying, well-balanced weight? Does it use premium materials for the casing and grips? Any connection issues or glitches?</p><p><h4><strong>Extra features</strong></h4></p><p>Are there rear-facing buttons? Does it support macros? Can you use it on multiple platforms?</p><p><h4><strong>Customization</strong></h4></p><p>Can you remap buttons? Is there software support for tweaking controller settings? Does it have interchangeable buttons or sticks? Can you fine-tune vibration and sensitivity?</p><p><h4><strong>Value</strong></h4></p><p>Is it priced fairly? Are the features and quality worth the money?</p></div><p><h3>The best Nintendo Switch controller for TV mode</h3></p><div><p>The Switch Pro released alongside the Switch console in 2017, and it’s a tough controller to beat. It offers an unmatched set of features (HD rumble, motion controls, NFC), and it’s one of the most comfortable Switch controllers out there.</p></div><p><small><em><strong>Supported platforms:</strong> Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / <strong>Connectivity: </strong>Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons: </strong>No / <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Rumble: </strong>Yes, HD / <strong>NFC: </strong>Yes / <strong>Motion: </strong>Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> Yes</em></small></p><p>More than seven years down the road, Nintendo’s first-party Pro controller is still the best gamepad for the Switch. It launched alongside the console in 2017 as a more traditional alternative to Nintendo’s quirky Joy-Cons, and in many ways, it rivals the standard models from Sony and Microsoft in terms of comfort and build quality. </p><p>Aside from the Joy-Cons, the Switch Pro Controller is the only wireless option that includes HD rumble, gyroscopic movement support, and an NFC reader for Amiibo cards and figurines. It’s also the only controller we’ve tested (again, aside from the Joy-Cons) that can power on the Switch without being plugged into it. The gamepad is built like a tank, and its battery life is so good that it sometimes seems like it’ll never run out. Nintendo says that it lasts around 40 hours per charge, so it’ll likely take casual gamers a long time to run down the battery.</p><p>The buttons and triggers have a satisfying bounce, while its directional pad is responsive and clicky enough to satisfy retro gamers. The controller charges via USB-C, just like the Switch, and it’s compatible with a slew of other platforms you might game on, including PC, Android, and SteamOS. It also works with Apple devices thanks to its compatibility with the latest versions of iOS, macOS, and even tvOS and visionOS.</p><p>Given the price, we wish that it had other features, like programmable buttons or a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio, even if wireless audio transmission from the Switch to a controller isn’t currently possible. (At least you can connect a pair of wireless headphones via Bluetooth, but only <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/55973">if you have no more than two controllers</a> connected to your Switch at once.)</p><p><h3>The best Switch controller for handheld mode</h3></p><div><p>The Split Pad Pro represents Hori’s take on the Nintendo Switch Pro controller, one that is split into two separate pieces. The Split Pad Pro is a good Joy-Con alternative for people who primarily play their Nintendo Switch in handheld mode.</p></div><p><small><em><strong>Supported Platforms: </strong>Switch / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> Joy-Con slots / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes / <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Rumble:</strong> No / <strong>NFC:</strong> No / <strong>Motion:</strong> No / <strong>Power:</strong> via Joy-Con slots / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> No</em></small></p><p>I’m sure there are some people who enjoy using Joy-Con controllers, but kids and small-handed folks aside, most people probably wouldn’t say they’re the most comfortable option. That’s where the Hori Split Pad Pro comes in.</p><p>The Split Pad Pro comes in a variety of colorways, and it both looks and feels like a Switch Pro Controller that’s split in half. One-half slides into each side of the Switch console like Joy-Cons, but unlike Nintendo’s default controllers, Hori’s gamepad features big, easy-to-reach buttons and generously sized triggers and analog sticks, all of which feel great in play. It also provides a lot of grip, which is particularly useful for people who need to get a better handle on the console for fast gameplay or stay comfy over longer play sessions.</p><p>The Split Pad Pro doesn’t have batteries or sensors — not to mention support for rumble, motion, IR, or NFC&nbsp;— so it’s completely useless when detached from the Switch. It’s only for handheld mode unless you purchase the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23007610/hori-split-pad-pro-attachment-nintendo-switch-price-features-review">Split Pad Pro Attachment</a> that turns it into a wired controller. We don’t recommend most people go that route since the attachment alone costs more than a Switch Pro Controller, which is a shame considering it doesn’t try to add any of the aforementioned elements (it does add a 3.5mm headphone jack, however).</p><p>The company also sells the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/12/23348870/hori-split-pad-compact-nintendo-switch-joy-con-price-features">Split Pad Compact</a>, which is a smaller version of the Split Pad Pro that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Split-Compact-Light-Yellow/dp/B0BDSNHLDY?tag=theverge02-20">costs around $50</a>. It might be worth a look if you want something as functional as the Split Pad Pro but closer in size to a Joy-Con.</p><div><p>The Hori Split Pad Pro is a comfortable controller that may be larger than your standard Joy-Cons but is more ergonomic.<br></p></div><p><h3>The best Xbox-style controller for the Switch </h3></p><div><p><h3><a data-item-id="7csjbY" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-NS-Switch-Joysticks-Button%EF%BC%88Black%EF%BC%89/dp/B09MS2VFSB/?tag=theverge02-20">GuliKit KingKong 2 Pro</a></h3></p><p><span>$<!-- -->70</span></p><p>If you’re looking for a Switch controller that’s also a great Bluetooth controller for PC, Mac, Steam Deck, iOS, and Android, GuliKit’s KingKong 2 Pro is a worthwhile purchase. It has drift-free Hall effect analog sticks, Amiibo support, and it feels like an Xbox controller in the hand.</p></div><p><small><em><strong>Supported Platforms: </strong>Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type: </strong>USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> No / <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Rumble:</strong> Yes / <strong>NFC: </strong>Yes / <strong>Motion:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> Yes</em></small></p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/KingKong-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Bluetooth/dp/B09QJN8ZD9?tag=theverge02-20">GuliKit KingKong 2 Pro</a> rivals the Switch Pro Controller in build quality, but it feels more like a modern Xbox controller, and its textured rear grips might give it the edge for some. Unlike most third-party controllers, it retains Amiibo support, though some users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Controller/comments/vmiyjh/gulikit_king_kong_pro_2_amiibo_compatibility/">have reported issues</a> with inauthentic Amiibo products. The KingKong 2 Pro can connect via Bluetooth to the Switch and to PC, macOS, iOS, Android, and other platforms. And because it uses GuliKit’s Hall effect sensors for its analog sticks, it’s immune to drift.</p><p>We recommend checking out <a href="https://youtu.be/JluAuIJ-tSY">this video at iFixit</a> to see a thorough explanation of how it works, but in essence, Hall effect sensors use magnets to alter electrical current instead of physically rubbing on (and eventually wearing down) a sensor to produce an input. While we haven’t heard widespread reports of chronic analog stick drift issues on the Switch Pro Controller thus far, controllers with Hall effect sensors will never<em> </em>encounter it, and the peace of mind is worth the added cost. (The 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller below <a href="https://twitter.com/GuliKitDesign/status/1564852820141957120">also uses GuliKit’s sensors</a>.)</p><p>Control-wise, almost everything about the KingKong 2 Pro feels just right. The face buttons, bumpers, and D-pad all strike a balance between travel, tactile feedback, and feel. The analog sticks are incredibly fluid yet easily snap back into their default positions. Clicking the sticks doesn’t require much force, either, even when they’re off-axis. And while we can’t fully credit GuliKit for the excellent ergonomics afforded by the Xbox-inspired shape, we can award points for the sturdy materials used and nailing a well-balanced weight. </p><p>The controller provides exhaustive customizability options, too. You can swap button layouts, program macros, and cycle through preset levels of rumble intensity and trigger sensitivity (which may not apply when using it with the Switch, as it doesn’t support analog triggers). However, managing these settings is less than ideal, as you can only change them by inputting button combinations. Sure, the combos are simple, but memorizing them all is challenging. Thankfully, GuliKit clearly spells everything out in the comprehensive manual you’ll receive with the gamepad.</p><p>It’s worth noting that GuliKit recently released a <a href="https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/1222182.html">KingKong 3 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/1130420.html">KingKong 3 Max</a>. The KingKong 3 Pro builds upon the premium controller by adding four slots for detachable rearward buttons or paddles (two come in the box) and a 1,000Hz polling rate for improved responsiveness. The KingKong 3 Max is similar but includes three pairs of back buttons (including short and long styles) and a 10-minute macro recording limit (versus 10 seconds on the KingKong 3 Pro). There’s also a dedicated trigger mode switch, RGB lights around the analog sticks that signal which sensitivity mode you’re in, and NFC for Amiibo support.</p><p><h3> A Switch controller for PC and Steam Deck</h3></p><div><p>The 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller comes with its own charging dock, features remappable controls, and is compatible with the Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, and Windows PCs thanks to its Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connectivity. Unlike the 2.4GHz-only version, it features drift-free Hall effect sticks.</p></div><p><small><em><strong>Supported Platforms:</strong> Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Rumble:</strong> Yes / <strong>NFC:</strong> No / <strong>Motion: </strong>Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> No</em></small></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9BGJVLL?tag=theverge02-20">8BitDo’s Ultimate Bluetooth Controller</a> feels like a Switch Pro Controller in shape, with a similarly short grip profile that larger hands may not prefer. Both share Switch and Windows PC support, but 8BitDo gets a leg up with full Steam Deck compatibility. Its haptics are decent but not as good as Nintendo’s, and it’s missing Amiibo support, though it does feature motion controls and customizable back paddles. It also comes with a charging dock, which stores the 2.4GHz dongle when not in use. The included dock is handy for charging the 22-hour battery, which is still pretty generous but comes well short of the 40-hour mark set by Nintendo’s official controller.</p><p>The Ultimate controller comes in several variants, but we recommend the Bluetooth model over the 2.4GHz or wired options because it includes 2.4GHz connectivity and GuliKit Hall effect sticks, which the 2.4GHz-only version lacks. The analog sticks offer just the right amount of resistance and sport a comfortable concave top, but they’re just a tad short on the sides. All of the buttons offer great travel, though, and the analog triggers have a satisfying amount of resistance when pulled.</p><p>As for tweaks, you can customize button mapping profiles, macros, vibration intensity, and stick and trigger sensitivity using the Ultimate Software app on mobile or PC. The controller has a dedicated button that lets you swap between three profiles on the fly, plus an extra turbo button you can either reconfigure or remap. When it comes to Switch controllers, 8BitDo sets the standard for the breadth of these options and how to access them, which is another reason it’s high on our list. </p><p><h3>A well-rounded Switch controller that looks like a DualShock</h3></p><div><p><h3><a data-item-id="cNNs5L" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Android-Raspberry/dp/B0CSPHXJYM/?tag=theverge02-20">8BitDo Pro 2</a></h3></p><p><span>$<!-- -->50</span></p><p>The 8BitDo Pro 2 offers many of the same features as the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller but at a lower price point and with a DualShock-style layout.

The Pro 2 has a comfortable grip, a crisper D-pad than the Switch Pro Controller, and two easy-to-press paddle buttons on the underside. It has rumble support (though not HD rumble) and motion control for games like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/4/23387041/overwatch-2-review-new-battle-pass-heroes-maps"><em>Overwatch 2</em></a>, both of which allow for gyroscopic aiming. PlayStation gamers will also appreciate that the left analog stick is located toward the bottom — just like on Sony’s controllers — rather than above the D-pad as on the Switch Pro.</p><p>With&nbsp;<a href="https://support.8bitdo.com/ultimate-software.html">8BitDo’s Ultimate software</a>&nbsp;on a mobile device or a Windows computer, you can customize the Pro 2’s button mapping and the sensitivity of its triggers and analog sticks. You can even save up to three control scheme profiles and cycle through them with a button located between the analog sticks. On its rear, there’s a switch that lets it toggle between Nintendo Switch, X-input for PC, DirectInput, and macOS modes, each with its own control customizations and Bluetooth profile. This controller offers a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>&nbsp;for $50 (or $54.99 if you want the incredibly cool&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-pro-2-bluetooth-controller-for-switch-pc-macos-android-steam-raspberry-pi-special-edition">translucent purple</a>&nbsp;version).</p><p><h3>An adapter that lets you use your own controllers</h3></p><div><p>8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2 looks like a flash drive, but once connected to your Switch’s dock, it enables you to wirelessly pair it with a number of older PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo controllers.</p></div><p>There are many <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/7/18068220/gbros-wireless-adapter-gamecube-controller-nintendo-switch">other</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/24/16533008/nintendo-switch-gamecube-controller-support-update">devices</a> that allow you to use third-party controllers, but 8BitDo’s might be the best value. Instead of spending $70 on multiple Switch Pro Controllers, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09M8CVMYF?tag=theverge02-20">$19.99 8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2</a> lets you turn a Bluetooth&nbsp;controller you already own into a wireless Switch controller. It plugs into your Switch dock and supports a wide variety of models, from the latest Xbox and DualSense controllers to last-gen gamepads for the Wii and PlayStation 3. (Note: the first-gen model can’t connect to most Xbox Bluetooth controllers due to a Bluetooth incompatibility, so make sure you get the latest model.)</p><p>To our surprise, the PS5 DualSense controller we tested it with worked incredibly well, with better-than-average rumble and more responsive motion controls than many dedicated Switch controllers offer. What’s more, so long as you’re using one of the newer Xbox Series X or S controllers, an Xbox One Bluetooth controller, a DualSense, a DualShock 4, or the Switch Pro Controller, you can customize their button mapping, analog stick sensitivity, and more within 8BitDo’s computer and mobile app.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://support.8bitdo.com/Manual/USB-Adapter-2/xbox-switch.html">8BitDo has an extensive support page</a> that lists the steps required to set up your specific controller, as well as which features of those controllers it supports. That said, it’s best if you know the Switch’s button layout by heart if you plan to use either a PlayStation or Xbox controller with this adapter, as the layout on your controller will not match the on-screen prompts in games.</p><p>If you already have a controller you really like and don’t mind jumping through a few small hoops to connect it, 8BitDo’s affordable adapter deserves a spot in your entertainment center. If you plan to use more than one third-party controller at a time, you’ll need an adapter for each controller (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PKG18DR?tag=theverge02-20">and a USB hub</a>), but if you have a lot of controllers sitting around, it might be worth it.</p><p><h3>Other Switch controllers you should know about</h3></p><div><ul><li>We like CRKD’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/28/24017863/nitro-deck-micro-review"><strong>Nitro Deck</strong></a> around here. It’s a cradle-style controller that holds the Switch between a pair of Hall effect sticks, outfitting it with a standard array of face buttons, four programmable back buttons, turbo functionality, gyro motion controls, and rumble. It has passthrough charging, though, not passthrough video, which would allow it to double as a dock for TV gameplay. The step-up <a href="https://crkd.gg/collections/allndp"><strong>Nitro Deck Plus</strong></a> adds said functionality (with a USB-C to HDMI adapter), along with Bluetooth connectivity and adjustable vibration intensity / analog sensitivity. We’ve found these to be notable improvements, but wish the passthrough solution was more elegant and that CRKD could solve the ergonomics (particularly on the right side, where the analog and button placement can cause discomfort).</li><li>We recently tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-Wireless-Controller-Switch-Drifting-Nintendo/dp/B0CDX449NJ?tag=theverge02-20"><strong>GameSir T4 Cyclone Pro</strong></a> ($49.99) for consideration. It offers many of the same functions as the GuliKit KingKong 2 Pro — including remappable buttons, Hall effect sticks, and two distinct macro buttons — along with dedicated vibration motors in the triggers, which is something the GuliKit can’t claim. That said, it falls just short due to mushy-feeling buttons. GameSir considers the extra padding under the buttons a feature that makes the impact softer, but we felt it takes away from the experience. Also, although it’s perfectly usable with the Switch, the Pro’s button labeling takes after Microsoft’s, which may not be ideal for those who have trouble memorizing inputs. We also found resyncing with the Switch to be a chore after switching from a mobile device or a Windows PC.</li><li>We also recently tried several wireless PowerA controllers, including the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-GameCube/dp/B0CT5JPCCC?tag=theverge02-20"><strong>GameCube Style Wireless Controller</strong></a> ($59.99) and a Pikachu-themed version of the standard <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Enhanced-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Black/dp/B08DRRJBC6?tag=theverge02-20"><strong>PowerA Enhanced Wireless</strong></a><strong> </strong>($59.99). We like the fun design of PowerA’s controllers, but they don’t live up to the quality of the models we recommend above, which is a shame considering some cost nearly as much. The GameCube-style wireless controller is a pretty faithful recreation of the original if you fancy a pure <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> experience, but it’s barebones with no rumble, NFC, or IR. It’s an easy way to get the old-school feeling back if you don’t already have a Bluetooth-based alternative to use with 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2.</li></ul></div><p><em><strong>Update, June 28th:</strong> Updated to include details on several new models, including the Gamesir T4 Cyclone Pro and PowerA’s GameCube Style Wireless Controller.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Amazon Games has many projects in the pipeline, but the two biggest ones are the next Tomb Raider game and the Lord of the Rings MMO, both of which are produced in partnership with franchises owned by the Embracer Group.</p>
<p>Those are massive IPs that may well interest millions of fans. However, it's been a while since we heard about any of those. The new Tomb Raider game was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-entry-in-development-crystal-dynamics-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> to be in production (with Epic's Unreal Engine 5) in April 2022, while the publishing deal with Amazon was <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-game-single-player-confident-lara-amazon-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in December of that year. As for the Lord of the Rings MMO (which Amazon was making before the deal <a href="https://wccftech.com/lord-of-the-rings-mmo-canceled-due-to-contractual-dispute-between-tencent-and-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fell through with Tencent</a> and had to be renegotiated with the Embracer Group once the latter company acquired Middle-earth Enterprises), the game was only <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-once-again-in-production-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked about briefly in May 2023</a>.</p>
<p>When can players expect to see them? According to Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann, recently interviewed <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/amazon-games-christoph-hartmann-tomb-raider-lord-of-the-rings-1236046995/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by Variety</a>, it shouldn't be that long, although neither project will be rushed.</p>
<p><em>It’s not going to be tomorrow, but it’s not too far away. As I said, we’re getting into a much more regular cadence of shipping games. That’s all I’m allowed to tell you right now… It’s all about quality. You don’t want to just be rushed out. That’s doesn’t work. It has to be Triple-A quality, because the bar is so high.</em></p>
<p>We've heard <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-tomb-raider-rumored-to-be-open-world-set-in-india-out-soon-lara-has-a-motorcycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> that Tomb Raider specifically should be released in less than a year, featuring an open world that protagonist Lara Croft will traverse with her motorcycle. If that's the case, a reveal at Gamescom or The Game Awards at the latest makes sense.</p>
<p>With Tomb Raider, Amazon is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preparing a new TV series for Prime Video.</a>&nbsp;Earlier rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> that the universe would be connected between the games and the live action, but Christoph Hartmann seemed to dispel that notion in the Variety interview.</p>
<p><em>Obviously, we want to work much closer together, and we’ll be working much closer together with the different entertainment areas Amazon has and a very natural one is Prime Video. You see it with “Tomb Raider,” where we’re gonna have a “Tomb Raider” game coming and they’re doing a show. And some people say, “Oh, will they be linked together?” And I give them the example, look at “Spider-Man.” There’s amazing, amazing games. There’s great animated content, there’s great live-action, and everyone seems to be very happy with that. So it does not need to be always that everything is mingled together, but it’s really one brand, which really just shows for me why transmedia nowadays is so important, and how games is such a vital part.</em></p>
<p>As for the Lord of the Rings MMO, it may well be too late for that project to be intertwined with the TV series (which is getting its second season soon). As a reminder, we don't know much about this game other than it'll be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-will-be-very-different-from-new-world-will-use-a-next-gen-version-of-its-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">based on an enhanced version of the New World engine</a>, albeit with different priorities due to the specific intellectual property.</p>
<p>Overall, Hartmann said Amazon now has eight games in development, with the publisher aiming to get two or three out in a given year. This year's titles are probably <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-f2p-mmorpg-launches-on-september-17-on-pc-and-consoles-with-cross-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Throne and Liberty</a> (out on September 17 on PC and consoles) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-brings-the-mmo-to-consoles-with-cross-play-new-10-player-raid-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New World: Aeternum</a> (slated for October 15 on PC and consoles). Amazon also announced deals to publish Bandai Namco Online's Blue Protocol (although the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-global-may-never-launch-as-bandai-namco-online-goes-insolvent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is in a dire financial situation</a> and the game hasn't been mentioned by Amazon press releases in a long while), the next games <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-games-glowmade-horizon-zero-dawn-fable-battlefield-vets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by Glowmade</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-games-to-publish-disruptive-games-multiplayer-action-adventure-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disruptive Games</a>, and Maverick Games, and two projects in development at the internal <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-amazon-montreal-studio-new-multiplayer-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Montréal</a> and Bucharest studios.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24188110/megan-thee-stallion-otaku-hot-girl-jujutsu-kaisen-yuji-itadori-gojo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="7rUk10">Yuji Itadori might just be a high schooler fighting for his life in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24084825/anime-awards-2024-winners-list-jujutsu-kaisen-demon-slayer-chainsaw-man"><em>Jujutsu Kaisen </em>anime</a>, but now he’s caught the attention of a global star IRL. Rapper <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24091333/megan-thee-stallion-hot-girl-anime-inuyasha">Megan Thee Stallion</a> — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23940797/megan-thee-stallion-halloween-cosplay-anime-taste-death-the-kid">official hot girl and anime lover</a> — shouts him out in a big way on her new album, <em>MEGAN</em>. Her song, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USxIYOaIpig">Otaku Hot Girl</a>,” contains an introduction narrated by the English voice actor of Itadori and numerous references to <em>Jujutsu Kaisen </em>and other anime. </p>
<p id="Rxxtt3">Megan Thee Stallion released <em>MEGAN</em> on Friday. Fans quickly took note of the introduction of “Otaku Hot Girl,” which starts with a voiced introduction from Adam McArthur, the voice actor of Yuji Itadori in the English dub of <em>Jujutsu Kaisen </em>in addition to <a href="https://x.com/lesbianmista/status/1806550400343880028">sampling a tune</a> from the anime. In the song, McArthur says in the voice of Itadori that he likes, “a tall woman with a nice big ass, like Grammy winner Megan Thee Stallion,” and references other characters from the series by name, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24040106/usher-gojo-satoru-cosplay-jujutsu-kaisen-anime">like Gojo Satoru</a>. </p>
<p id="xDAODd">The introduction references a viral fan moment within the <em>Jujutsu Kaisen </em>fandom. In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H80iK0EMq2Q">official English dub</a>, another character asks Itadori who his type is and he says, “A tall woman with a nice big ass. Just saying, Jennifer Lawrence.” Based on this, fans popularized the idea that Itadori would also have a crush on Megan, since she could be his type and because she is a known anime fan. In response, Adam McArthur shared an audio clip on X in 2021 where he rerecorded the line and replaced the name Jennifer Lawrence with Megan Thee Stallion. The clip later became popular and widely used on social media platforms like TikTok and the idea that Itadori could have a crush on Megan has become widely accepted by fans. And now, the track has prompted excitement among fans as people share viral <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kaludiasays/video/7385414157027298591">reaction videos on TikTok</a>. </p>

<p id="nQ5uvO">But the song’s anime references aren’t limited to just Itadori, the lyrics also mention things like<em> </em>Gojo’s domain expansion powers and Sasuke from <em>Naruto</em>. However, the singer encountered trouble with this track. The musician said she had to rerecord the track a few days before the album release because she didn’t get clearance to use the characters’ names in her song. “I really hope y’all think this shit sound fire because I had to jump through 8 million hoops to get this shit,” <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@biran337/video/7384949254210506030">she said in an Instagram live</a>. </p>
<p id="gkhDji">The track oozes <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24054429/megan-thee-stallion-hiss-tokyo-ghoul-anime-meaning">Megan’s love for anime</a>. Still, the artist has had to deal with fans who think she’s a fake fan despite her repeated participation in several anime fandoms. In her years as a star, she has become known for her <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23940797/megan-thee-stallion-halloween-cosplay-anime-taste-death-the-kid">incredible cosplays</a> and referenced <em>Naruto</em> in one of her breakout hits, “Girls in the Hood.”  Now, this song allows her to respond to skeptics. In one line she talks about how she won’t be bothered by people with anime avatars online. She sings, “I’m not finna argue with a Sasuke avi/Incel mad, I’m a weeb and a baddie.” </p>
<p id="HTdCvX">So if you want to rock out to some anime-inspired lyrics “Otaku Hot Girl” is out to listeners now. </p>

But while the game looks great, it is a bit weird to be getting a new <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> game without the involvement of series creator Hideo Kojima, something that came up during a recent video from Konami. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/mXoV47YGV70&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/mXoV47YGV70" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In the first episode of Production Hotline</a></span>—a dev diary-like series featuring <em>MGS </em>developers speaking about the game—producer Okamura was asked if there was “any chance” that the original staff who worked on <em>MGS 3</em> would return to help or supervise <em>Delta’s </em>development. In response, Okamura responded: “Wow, okay. I can see we’re starting with a tough one, huh.” </p><p>“Well, it’s not my place to answer on behalf of anyone outside the company, or to guess how they might feel about it,” said Okamura. “But just speaking for myself, personally, I’d like nothing better than to work with Mr. Kojima and the rest of the team again. If that could happen, that would be the dream.”</p><p>However, Okamura isn’t pretending as if that will ever happen, clarifying that “people have moved on to new things” and “that’s just our current reality.” <br></p><p>“We can’t just take it for granted that everyone would work with us again, or let ourselves be completely dependent on them. I just don’t think it’s right for us to be the ones to make that kind of demand of anyone. So we’re working with the expectation that whatever we make, it’s up to us, it’s on our shoulders to do a good job,” said Okamura. </p><p>The <em>MGS</em> producer also addressed fan concerns that Kojima and the original developers of <em>Snake Eater</em> would not be included in <em>Delta</em>’s credits. </p><p>“Mr. Kojima and all the original development staff are of course credited for their original roles. They were already included in the <em>Master Collection</em>, and they’ll be listed in [<em>Delta</em>] as well. They’re a part of these games too, so absolutely, they’re in.”</p><p>The answers from Okamura feel oddly honest and transparent, something that is becoming increasingly rare among big publishers and developers. I’m sort of shocked Konami kept this in the final edit, but I’m happy to see the publisher is letting Delta’s devs speak openly about Kojima and the <em>MGS </em>franchise. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-permanent-injuries-1851529537&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-permanent-injuries-1851529537"><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em></a></span><em> </em>launches sometime later this year on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a surprising turn of events, the individual responsible for disrupting several Nintendo events has confessed to his actions. <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">OatmealDome</a> on Twitter spotted a 27-year-old man admitting to sending threats to Nintendo due to his frustration with games. The prosecution is seeking at least a one-year imprisonment for the wrongdoer.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>[Nintendo Live 2024 TOKYO]</p><p>A 27 year old man accused of sending 39 bomb threats to Nintendo recently appeared at trial.</p><p>He admitted to the charges: "The more I lost [in Splatoon 3], the more frustrated I would become."</p><p>The prosecution is seeking a 1 year prison sentence. <a href="https://t.co/93ShXbDeYq">https://t.co/93ShXbDeYq</a></p></div>— OatmealDome (@OatmealDome) <a href="https://twitter.com/OatmealDome/status/1806527226935959710?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.ktv.jp/news/articles/?id=13276" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kansai Television News</a>, Kenshin Kazama confessed to sending threats to Nintendo at a trial on June 26, 2024. He tried to justify his actions by explaining that he sent the messages when he was feeling stressed and irritated from losing in a game. – Now that’s stupid.</p>



<p>Kazama sent 39 threats to Nintendo between August and November 2023, including messages like “I will kill everyone involved. Be careful about events with spectators,” which led to several event cancellations and disrupted Nintendo’s business.</p>



<p>The prosecution revealed that Kazama caused damage worth ¥700 million or around $4.3 million. They have stated that the situation is “serious” and “there is no room for leniency for a childish motive.” The prosecution has requested at least a one-year prison sentence for Kazama to learn from his actions. The final verdict will be revealed on July 24, 2024.</p>



<p>Conclusion: Do not send threats to Nintendo, or anyone for that matter. </p>



<p>In other news, pre-orders for games showcased at the Nintendo Direct June 2024 event are now live, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-is-now-available-for-pre-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-pre-orders-are-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-and-luigi-brothership-pre-orders-are-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership </a>and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/you-can-pre-order-super-mario-party-jamboree-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>.</p>

All shoulder-charge abilities deal bonus damage when activated in the air, and damaging tough opponents like mini-bosses and Tormentors with one of those attacks will refund energy to that ability. Appropriately, strength is the highest stat on these Exotic boots, although the high mobility stat does deprive resilience and recovery from being better. If you haven't already got it, this Exotic is worth picking up this weekend.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 16</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 11</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 9</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 20</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 64</li></ul><h3>Stomp-EE5 (Exotic Hunter leg armor)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4326706-destiny22024-06-2819-06-56.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326706" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4326706-destiny22024-06-2819-06-56.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326706"></a><figcaption>St0mp-EE5</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4326706-destiny22024-06-2819-06-56.jpg"></figure><p>A favorite for Hunters in the Crucible, St0mp-EE5 increases sprint speed and slide distance, improves several jump abilities, and allows you to take reduced damage from targets when you're airborne.

Landing the Super will also refund some energy back to your Warlock, depending on the number of kills. Void Warlock builds are pretty popular now, and with Pale Heart weapons allowing you to quickly charge your Super ability, this is a great Exotic to grab. The crucial Intellect stat is the highest here, while resilience and recovery are pretty good as well. Strength could be better, but it's not often that we see Xur offer a Skull of Dire Ahamkara helmet with mostly good stats like this.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 13</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 12</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 7</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 19</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 67</li></ul><h2>Exotic Weapon Catalysts</h2><h3>Jotunn</h3><p>Faster charge time or draw time when surrounded by combatants.

For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

And with its striking new Fortnite design, it's even more enticing. Along with the cool graphics, you're getting six dedicated macro keys, a media roller and secondary media keys, and Yellow Switches that are linear and silent. This full-sized keyboard also includes a numpad and function keys, giving you all the inputs you'll need for gaming, streaming, and working.</p><hr><h2>Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro - Fortnite Edition</h2><h3>$170</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4326614-httpshybrismediaprod.blob.core.w%281%29%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326614" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4326614-httpshybrismediaprod.blob.core.w%281%29%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326614"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4326614-httpshybrismediaprod.blob.core.w%281%29%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>This ultra-lightweight mouse clocks in at just 63 grams, making it a great companion for fast-paced shooters or the demanding building mechanics of Fortnite. With a 1,000Hz polling rate, Razer Focus Pro 30K Optical Sensor, and two programmable side buttons, it's a great all-around gaming mouse. It supports both wired and wireless connections, with a battery powerful enough to get up to 90 hours of game time when running at 1,000Hz and up to 17 hours at 8,000Hz. Its switch is rated for 90 million clicks, so it should last you a (very) long time before needing a replacement.</p><hr><h2>Razer Goliathus Extended Chroma - Fortnite Edition</h2><h3>$100</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4326615-httpshybrismediaprod.blob.core.w%282%29%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326615" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4326615-httpshybrismediaprod.blob.core.w%282%29%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326615"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4326615-httpshybrismediaprod.blob.core.w%282%29%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>Need something to pull together your battlestation? This massive desk mat is a great option, as it gets you vibrant Fortnite graphics along with premium materials that elevate your gaming space. Clocking in at just over 36 inches wide and nearly 12 inches tall, it's perfect for the BlackWidow and DeathAdder listed above. The micro-textured cloth surface helps pick up even the smallest mouse movement, and it's a much more comfortable place for your hands than the hard surface of your desk.</p><hr><h2>Razer Kraken V3 X - Fortnite Edition</h2><h3>$100</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4326616-httpshybrismediaprod.blob.core.w%284%29%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326616" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4326616-httpshybrismediaprod.blob.core.w%284%29%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326616"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4326616-httpshybrismediaprod.blob.core.w%284%29%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>The last Razer x Fornite gadget up for grabs is the Razer Kraken V3 X. Built with 40mm drivers for booming audio, the Razer HyperClear Cardioid Mic for crisp voice chat, and comfortable memory foam ear cushions, it's a good-looking and relatively affordable headset. It's also pretty light at 285 grams, so it should remain comfortable no matter how long you're gaming.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-4k-blu-ray-box-set-amazon-preorder/1100-6524366/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Collection Is Back In Print, Preorders Live At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-xbox-controllers-get-significant-discounts-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6524341/">Official Xbox Controllers Get Significant Discounts At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-links-awakening-is-back-in-stock-for-40-at-amazon/1100-6511630/">Get Ready For Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom With This Great Link's Awakening Deal</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-big-on-nintendo-switch-joy-con-controllers-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6523566/">Save Big On Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Controllers At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-out-2-fans-should-check-out-the-new-lego-mood-cube-set/1100-6524400/">Inside Out 2 Fans Should Check Out The New Lego Mood Cube Set</a></li>   </ul> </div>

			<p>For years, telling friends about The Legend of Heroes games has felt less like recommending a cool new RPG and more like assigning Summer homework. Hyping up a game in this franchise comes with the caveat that you need to play every entry in order so you can fully understand the story, but when you’re talking about over a dozen 80+ hour JRPGs, that isn’t an easy ask. It’s why I’ve been so excited for The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak to get an English release, and so frustrated that it’s taken so many years for it to happen. In a world where games that were once niche Japan-only titles now get synchronised global releases, the delayed release of this new entry point in a long-running franchise has likely lost much of its momentum for a potential global audience. That isn’t fair at all, when this is one of the most engaging and enjoyable new JRPGs I’ve ever played.</p>

<p>The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak takes place in the Republic of Calvard, a country far east from the main locales from the last handful of The Legend of Heroes games. You won’t be expected to know what happened in previous games, who their protagonists were, or what the dozens of characters in those games may or may not be up to when you start this one.</p>


<p>You’re given a clean slate in the form of new series lead Van Arkride, who works a day-job as a humble Spriggan. Essentially, he’s Columbo with a license to kill – clients come to him looking for a detective, a bounty hunter, or a combo of the two. When a young girl by the name of Agnes Claudel comes to him seeking help in tracking down seven mementos from her great-grandfather, Van ends up taking her in as an assistant and the two of them set off on a conspiracy-unfurling journey through the seedy city of Edith and beyond.</p>
<p>Typically,&nbsp;protagonists in The Legend of Heroes live up to that “hero” moniker, with a lot of them being plucky young swordsmen with a lawful moral compass and plenty to learn about the dark secrets of their world. Van isn’t like that at all, and it ends up being such a breath of fresh air to play as a protagonist who isn’t just bucking the trends of his franchise, but of the JRPG genre as a whole.</p>


<p>Working as a detective-slash-fixer means that Van knows every dirty little secret about the city of Edith and the people who occupy it’s seedy underbelly. He has connections to secretive factions like Oroboros, and no qualms with taking on jobs that are slightly on the wrong side of being illegal. At the same time, he does his best to protect Agnes and his other inexperienced companions from being too exposed to the shadier sides of his business. Striking that balance as he tackles underground mafias and scientific conspiracies is incredible storytelling, and it’s a thrill whether you’re a longtime fan or fresh to the franchise.</p>
<p>A lot of other aspects of The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak are a fresh glow-up from prior entries. This game utilizes a brand new engine, resulting in lots of much-needed improvements to the gameplay experience. Character models look better than ever, and the dynamic cutscene animations we had just a taste of in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/30/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-into-reverie-review/">The Legend of Heroes: Trails into Reverie</a> are dialled up even further in this game. There’s a much better sense of connectivity and seamless exploration to the game, too – you’ll encounter far fewer loading screens than usual as you run around the streets of Edith, and you can enter and exit houses or stores seamlessly without any loading screens. It’s small stuff, but stuff that has been long overdue for a franchise that’s been running on dated technology for so long.</p>

<p>Most exciting to me of all the changes and upgrades in The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak, though, is the combat. There are two different combat modes in the game – real-time action combat like you’d experience in modern Ys games, and positional turn-based battles that feel just like combat from prior entries in the series. You can choose to use one mode or the other as much as you want, with the exception of boss battles that are only turn-based in nature.</p>
<p>The game smartly rewards you for swapping between the two regularly styles – damaging enemies enough in real-time combat will stun them, and if you switch into turn-based battle from there they’ll take increased damage and have delayed turns. It’s something I genuinely wish other JRPGs could implement. I’m a massive action-combat fan, and I also appreciate turn-based battles, but in long games they can both get a little repetitive. Having the ability to swap between the two so often kept me on my toes and excited to play all the way until the credits rolled.</p>

<p>Inevitably, a sequel to The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak will require some knowledge of prior games to fully appreciate the narrative web they’re weaving. As far as this title alone, goes, it’s an amazing starting point for anyone, and a genuinely captivating and exciting JRPG in its own right. It isn’t just easy to recommend this game because it’s a standalone adventure – it’s easy to recommend because it’s just that good.</p>
