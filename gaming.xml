It seems, however, that Capcom might have another title lined up for a reveal later this year.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2012597154825515449">Dusk Golem</a>, who has had a history of accurately reporting Capcom's plans for Resident Evil, the company will be announcing a remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_code_veronica_x">Resident Evil: Code Veronica</a> in 2026 (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcoms-next-big-resident-evil-remake-will-reportedly-be-revealed-this-year/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>Code Veronica, largely regarded as a mainline entry in all but name, has been long rumoured to receive the remake treatment, and Dusk Golem seems particularly confident that this is real, stating plainly "I promise you".</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2FTBspZymlg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0iztqxg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>"No, there is NOT a Resident Evil 5 Remake that's going to be announced this year. Instead, later this year a RE Remake that starts with "(C)" &amp; ends "(ode Veronica)" is going to be announced, I promise you."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Questions arose around a potential remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_5">Resident Evil 5</a> after Eva La Dare, the voice actor behind Sheva Alomar in the 2009 original, stated that she's "Got a few fun things lined up for March" in relation to Resident Evil's 30th anniversary.</p>
<p>Capcom <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/zombies-return-in-resident-evil-requiem-but-now-theyre-more-terrifying-than-ever">recently showcased</a> more gameplay for Resident Evil Requiem ahead of its release, highlighting the differences between protagonists Grace Ashcroft and Leon Kennedy. It's also been confirmed that those after a challenge can set the difficulty higher and thus necessitate the use of Ink Ribbons during Grace's sections.</p>

            <guid>1409806</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A notable Resident Evil insider has stated that the RE5 Remake will not be announced in 2026; instead, Code Veronica Remake will be revealed.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Resident Evil 5’s voice actor made a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-5-voice-actor-hints-at-possible-30th-anniversary-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptic post</a> last week, leading the community to speculate that Resident Evil 5 Remake will be revealed on the franchise’s 30th Anniversary. However, it seems this won’t be the case, and a remake of an older title could be shown instead. The insider has also discussed reasons why this might be the case. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-code-veronica-reveal-reportedly-coming-in-2026">Resident Evil Code Veronica Reveal Reportedly Coming in 2026</h2>



<p>The latest bit of information comes from DuskGolem, who accurately leaked Resident Evil Requiem’s reveal and that Leon Kennedy would be part of the game. In the insider’s latest <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2012597154825515449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter), they debunk the community’s theories that Resident Evil 5 Remake will be announced this year and reaffirm their claim that Code Veronica Remake will be revealed. </p>



<p>Late last year, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-remakes-scheduled-for-2027-2028-respectively-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that Code Veronica and Zero Remakes were scheduled to release in 2027 and 2028, respectively, with the former being revealed in 2026.</p>



<p>Another <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2012675455250235692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a> by the insider also discusses the probable reasons Code Veronica and Zero Remakes took priority over others. The first reason is surveys, where fans have apparently voted for these two titles to be remade. The second reason is that several devs at Capcom worked on the original RE Zero and have ideas to improve it. The third reason is seemingly scope and scale, where RE5 and RE6 are considerably bigger titles. </p>



<p>As always, readers should take this information with a grain of salt, as the information doesn’t come from an official source. </p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-north">Rockstar North</a> office has been cordoned off by police following an explosion. While the source is currently unconfirmed, reports suggest that a boiler is the cause.</p>
<p>The building, located on Holyrood Road in Edinburgh, has been attended by both police and city fire departments. <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25776012.gta6-dev-rockstar-north-building-taped-off-boiler-explosion/">According to the Scottish Herald</a>, around seven Scottish Fire and Rescue vehicles were sent to the scene after alarms were raised around 5am. No injuries or deaths have been announced by the authorities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-news/edinburgh-fire-crews-rush-ongoing-33257244.amp">Edinburghlive</a> has stated that Scottish Fire and Rescue have been on the scene for upwards of two hours after the call reporting the incident came in. The outlet was also provided a statement by Scottish Fire and Rescue, in which a spokesperson stated the following:</p>

<p>"I can confirm that we got a call at 5.02am this morning. We mobilised three pumps and four of our specialist appliances. It's an ongoing incident and we're still in attendance at the moment with other agencies."</p><p>

The Scottish Herald were told, again by a spokesperson from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, that firefighters worked to secure "structural damage" to the building. These crews left after three hours after the area was deemed safe.

</p><p>This piece will be updated as more information on the explosion have been confirmed.</p>

<p>A risqué <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> island aimed at 'adults only' has been deleted by Nintendo after more than five years.</p>
<p>This comes courtesy of creator <a href="https://x.com/churip_ccc/status/2011099062666477894">@churip_ccc</a> (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-bans-infamous-japanese-adult-only-animal-crossing-island-creator-says-thanks-for-turning-a-blind-eye-all-these-years/">Automaton</a>), who posted on social media to confirm the deletion, stating "To Nintendo, I apologize from the bottom of my heart. Or rather, thank you for turning a blind eye for more than five years."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Actually, just a day before the update,<br></em><em>The Dream Address for the Adult Island was deleted by Nintendo.<br></em><em>To Nintendo, I apologize from the bottom of my heart.<br></em><em>Or rather, thank you for turning a blind eye for more than five years.<br></em><em>To everyone who visited the island,<br></em><em>And to all the streamers who showcased it in their videos,<br></em><em>Thank you so much."</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The island in question contains its own Edo-inspired 'Red Light District', while certain shops sell nothing but schoolgirl-inspired cosplay and toys. <em>Yikes</em>. Looking at the video above, more subtle hints towards the island's 'adult only' theme include magazine and posters littering the floor, some labelled 'DVD' in pink font.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Blathers' museum-inspired room has an entire corner dedicated to pictures of Isabelle, with seemingly used tissues strewn about the place. Must have a runny nose, huh?</p>
<p>It's interesting that Nintendo took so long to get rid of it in this case, but alas, it's gone. No doubt we'll see similar attempts in the future, but we reckon Nintendo will be pretty vigilant if it happens again.</p>

<p>Bungie’s release date trailer for Marathon has leaked online, revealing a March 5, 2026, release. </p>



<p>After delays, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-artist-satisfied/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plagiarism controversy</a>, and its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">art director leaving</a> just months before the release window, it seems Bungie is finally set on the Marathon release date. As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-march-2026-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> by Sony back in November 2025, Marathon will release this year in March, as a new leaked trailer confirms. </p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-releases-on-march-5-leaked-trailer-confirms">Marathon Releases on March 5, Leaked Trailer Confirms</h2>



<p>Spotted on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qgvybm/marathon_release_date_trailer_leaked_5th_march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>, Marathon’s release date trailer has leaked online, revealing new details. The trailer starts like most of their newer videos, blending gameplay and cinematics. Towards the end of the video, we finally get a release date revealed: “Coming March 5, 2026.” Pre-orders will begin when the trailer is officially dropped, and the Deluxe Edition will feature a ‘Midnight Decay Bundle’, two weapon skins, and additional content. </p>



<p>Leading up to the release, Marathon developers have provided extensive details about the upcoming Extraction Shooter. We already know about the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-devs-reveal-pricing-battle-pass-details-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pricing, battle pass details, improvements</a> across the board, and more. Additionally, just last week, we received details on the archetypes, abilities, and customisations you can do with Marathon’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-devs-reveal-details-on-runner-shells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Runner Shells</a>. There is no confirmation yet on when the trailer for the release date will officially drop. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Marathon is an upcoming FPS, PvPvE survival extraction title from Bungie, which takes players to the world of Tau Ceti IV, where you get to play as bio-cybernetic Runners. The goals are to scavenge zones for valuable items while indulging in fast-paced PvPvE combat. The game also focuses heavily on customisation, allowing players to craft unique playstyles using existing runner shells. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-million-damages/</link>
            <guid>1409779</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Former Assassin’s Creed boss Marc-Alexis Côté has filed a claim with the Superior Court of Quebec for $1.3 million in damages against Ubisoft.</p>



<p>The file comes months after Ubisoft announced that Marc-Alexis Côté <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/head-of-assassins-creed-has-left-ubisoft-after-20-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left the company voluntarily</a>, a claim which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-confirms-ubisoft-asked-him/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Côté later denied</a>, stating that he was “asked to step aside” from the company. </p>







<p>In a lengthy LinkedIn post, Côté said, “Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin’s Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it. The truth is simple: I did not make that choice.”</p>



<p>He later continued, “But I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly: I did not walk away. I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside.”</p>



<p>The new report from <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2221328/marc-alexis-cote-ubisoft-assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CBC Radio Canada</a> states that Côté is now taking Ubisoft to court, claiming $1.3 million in severance pay and moral damages.</p>



<p>According to the report, Côté was told during a management meeting in late summer 2025 that Ubisoft’s new subsidiary with Tencent was looking to find a “Head of Franchise”, which was a position not offered to Côté. Instead, Côté was offered the position of “Dead of Production”, which would have seen him reporting to someone else.</p>



<p>The lawsuit states that in September, the position to lead a “Creative House” with abstract outlines was offered. After lengthy negotiations, Ubisoft reportedly asked him to make a decision on the changes, to which Côté formally demanded that the company pay him severance.</p>







<p>In response, Ubisoft reportedly told him not to show up for work as planned on October 13, and to continue his reflection period until the company responds to its formal notice. The next day, Ubisoft announced via a press release and internal emails that Côté was leaving his position voluntarily to&nbsp;<q>explore new opportunities</q>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for comment, but did not receive one prior to publication. Should one be received, we will update the article.</p>

            <p>We've been greatly enjoying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout Season 2</a> so far, and it seems that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-new-vegas-player-numbers-skyrocket-thanks-to-the-unavoidable-impact-of-fallout-season-2">most fans are</a> too, but the change from binge-based season drop to a weekly release schedule has had an impact on the show's ratings. Don't worry, though: this stumble isn't in danger of disappointing the powers that be.</p>
<p>On 15th January, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/streaming-ratings-dec-15-21-2025-1236475572/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> shared the latest report from Nielsen, a leader in media valuation and data analytics. As expected, the debut of Fallout's second season was a sizable one, with the show accumulating 794 million viewing minutes through the week of December 15th through 21st. At the same time, it was well below Season 1's appeal, which earned 2.9 billion for its opening week in April 2024. That one was Amazon's best-ever premiere on the platform.</p>
<p>Those keeping track of what goes down on the TV front might've already noticed what's going on here. Since Nielsen traditionally tracks viewership in minutes watched across devices that send the needed data, the company's numbers never give us the complete picture. It only tracks TV sets, but it's always been a good way to measure the temperature and streaming habits of the populace. The more important bit of info here is that 794 million minutes for a single episode versus 2.9 billion for an entire season that could be binged on Day One is very impressive all the same.</p>
<p>Moreover, we must take into account many viewers who have grown accustomed to Netflix's binge release strategy are just waiting for the entire thing to be available. All in all, Fallout is doing remarkably well still, and nabbed the 7th spot on <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/data-center/top-ten/">Nielsen's ranking</a> for the December 15th through 21st period. During that week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stranger-things-final-battle-was-directly-influenced-by-baldurs-gate-3">Stranger Things</a> reigned supreme in the lead-up to its series finale with a massive 2.37 billion minutes watched.</p><p>As it stands, Fallout Season 3 is a go and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">already targeting a production start date for 1st May, 2026</a>. The Prime Video series is among the very few big-IP shows that are sticking to tight pre-production and filming schedules, with S2 arriving only a year and a half after S1. For comparison, we're still waiting for <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-ahsoka">Star Wars: Ahsoka</a>'s second season on Disney Plus; the first set of episodes came out during summer 2023.</p>
<p>Are you watching each episode of Fallout Season 2 weekly, or are you waiting to make your trip to New Vegas until it's all loaded up?</p>

			<p>It's apparently leak day in the games industry: after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-launch-date-is-march-5-xbox-store-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon launch date leak</a>, there's also the first in-game look at <strong>ZeniMax</strong>'s canceled <strong>Project Blackbird</strong>. Insider eXtas1s <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/2012971422679765352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared it on X</a>, and Tom Henderson later <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blackbrird-footage-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> it was real, adding that it was used internally to show off the <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong>-powered lighting. It is unclear whether the game was still running on Unreal Engine 4 when it was canceled, had already updated to Unreal Engine 5, or was planned to.</p>



<p>To be honest, that footage isn't very impressive. I'm not crazy on the character designs, for example. That said, it could be old, and of course, it doesn't tell us anything about how the game actually played. I've played a ton of <strong>The Elder Scrolls Online</strong> and was definitely looking forward to ZeniMax Online's new project, so I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt on that count, especially given the reports.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>In November 2022, the game, based on a new intellectual property, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-game-has-been-in-development-for-4-5-years-now-with-200-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already been in development for <strong>over four and a half years</strong></a> and boasted a manpower of <strong>more than 200 employees</strong>. We didn't really hear anything further about Project Blackbird until <strong>Microsoft</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suddenly announced its cancellation in July 2025</a>, as part of a major round of layoffs that also affected <strong>Rare</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Everwild</strong> was canceled</a>) and <strong>The Initiative</strong> (the whole studio was shut down, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Perfect Dark</strong> was canceled as well</a>).</p>



<p>A couple of days later, Bloomberg's <strong>Jason Schreier</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Microsoft Gaming CEO <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> had loved his hands-on time with the game just a few months ahead of the cancellation. The journalist also viewed some gameplay footage of Project Blackbird and confirmed it looked impressive. This backs up the public-facing statement of ZOS Lead Graphics Programmer Alex Tardif, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/canceled-zos-mmorpg-was-heading-in-a-great-direction-and-new-engine-had-found-its-footing-says-lead-graphics-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> the new engine had found its footing and the game was heading in a 'great direction'.</p>



<p>Another report by TrueAchievements <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-cancelled-mmorpg-story-gameplay-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided a few more details on the game itself</a>: it <span>would be a third-person online shooter in which players would become&nbsp;<strong>Revenants</strong>, bio‑enhanced operatives employed by alien syndicates to navigate the underworld of <strong>Soteria</strong>, a tidally-locked planet with</span> extreme biomes. Throughout Project Blackbird, players would rise through criminal/corporate ranks and uncover a murder conspiracy.</p>



<p>Former ZeniMax Online founder and studio head <strong>Matt Firor</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-blackbird-was-the-game-i-had-waited-my-entire-career-to-create-says-ex-zos-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged</a> earlier this month that the cancellation of Project Blackbird led to his resignation, adding that this was the game he had waited his entire career to make. Following the cancellation, at least two different studios have been formed by the fired employees: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-zenimax-online-devs-form-sackbird-studios-working-original-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sackbird Studios</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ironroot-games-established-former-zenimax-online-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ironroot Games</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Nowadays, ZeniMax Online has returned to focus solely on <strong>The Elder Scrolls Online</strong>, recently<a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-zenimax-interview-free-content-battle-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> revealing a major shift to a seasonal model and free content updates</a>.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Factory production lines in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/satisfactory/" data-ref-id="5000-483395">Satisfactory</a> will grow to immense sizes the longer you play, and it can be hard to manage. A good friend, though, will cut that work in half. Satisfactory offers both peer-to-peer multiplayer and server-based multiplayer, and each of them has their disadvantages. We'll talk about how to get each of them going here.</p><p dir="ltr">There are three ways to host games in Satisfactory: Peer-to-peer games, self-hosted servers and rented servers. Peer-to-peer and self-hosted server options are both free, while a rented server option will have a monthly cost associated with it. Meanwhile, peer-to-peer is the easiest to set up, followed by rented servers, and finally self-hosted servers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1603/16030002/4627915-satisfactory-multiplayer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4627915" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1603/16030002/4627915-satisfactory-multiplayer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4627915"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1603/16030002/4627915-satisfactory-multiplayer.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Peer-to-peer</h3><p dir="ltr">A peer-to-peer session has to be initiated by whoever has the save game you're playing in. Sessions can be private, meaning that you'll need an in-game invite to join, or set to Friends Only, meaning that anyone on your friend list can hop in via Satisfactory's Join Game menu. Each game has a Session ID. If you share this with someone, they can join a Friends Only game regardless of whether they're on your friends list. Each time you initiate a session, though, the Session ID will be reset.</p><p dir="ltr">This is, by far, the simplest option, and will be sufficient for most players, but it assumes your schedules will line up enough that the host can always be on when you feel like playing.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Self-Hosted Dedicated Server</h3><p dir="ltr">A self-hosted dedicated server is something you set up on a computer you have access to, and leave it to run indefinitely, allowing multiple users to join it whenever they wish. The software itself is free, and comes with the game. This is the most complex option in terms of setup and maintenance, and you'll want to refer to the <a href="https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Dedicated_servers" rel="nofollow ">Satisfactory wiki on Dedicated Servers</a> for the details--it's more than we can reasonably go into here. Your ability to do this can also depend on hosting rules set by your internet service provider, meaning that depending on who supplies your internet connection, this may not even be an option at all.</p><p dir="ltr">If you have the know-how or the patience, this option will give you the most freedom at the lowest price.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Rented Dedicated Server</h3><p dir="ltr">A rented dedicated server gives you all the freedom of a self-hosted server, but on someone else's hardware. Most people don't just have a computer that sits around left on and unused all the time that they can set a server up on, so this is going to be a better option for most than the self-hosted option. You have a lot of set-up options, so it will take some patience to set up, but if you have a few friends with different schedules who want to play together, this is a great option. Hosting starts at around $10 a month, though reliable and performant hosting will likely be closer to $15. The more people you intend to have playing, the more important that will be. We're not going to call out any specific providers here, but there are many, many options out there through your favorite search engine.</p><p dir="ltr">This option is expensive, but is ideal for a group with multiple players who don't mind pitching in a few dollars to keep things going.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Early indicators that advertisements are coming to the Xbox Cloud Gaming service have been spotted by users, with messages stating that "ad-supported playtime" popping up for users when launching games.</p>
<p>One such user, The Verge's Tom Warren, <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/2012346097465782273">posted their own experience seeing this message firsthand</a>. Ad-supported Xbox Cloud Gaming has not been confirmed by Microsoft as of writing, nor its scope across the service. However, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/arts/halo-playstation-microsoft-xbox.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">last year an Xbox official confirmed </a>that the company would be experimenting with free ad-supported cloud gaming.</p>
<p>This hint at advertisement rollout across Xbox Cloud Gaming comes at an interesting time too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-developer-direct-showcase-january-2026">with an Xbox Showcase set to take place on the 22nd January</a>. While it's been stated that the show will focus primarily on a handful of games including Fable and Forza, rumours have been circulating that such a shift with the company's cloud gaming service <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/791213/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ad-supported-version">could be rolled out this year</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>It's also coming at an interesting time for cloud gaming in general. With the AI boom ongoing, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">hardware prices have skyrocketed for consumers</a>. This will, or perhaps already has, curbed the ability of gaming enthusiasts to buy their own machines, potentially leading a new wave to Cloud Gaming services such as what Xbox is offering. While not especially great news for the consumer, there's no doubt that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers-can-now-stream-select-games-from-their-own-library-via-cloud-gaming">Microsoft has positioned itself into a leading position as far as cloud gaming is concerned</a>.</p><p>Microsoft too has faced heavy criticism when it comes to its gaming output, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">laying off significant portions of its workforce last year</a> and cancelling several projects as a result. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-suffers-worst-year-on-record-for-console-sales-in-the-uk">2025 was also the worst year on record for Xbox console sales in the UK</a>, though competitors like the PS5 also saw a drop during the same period.</p>

            <p>Happy new week of PC game releases, all! First, the customary paragraph of Maw musings. What we refer to as the Maw goes by many other names in different regions, as different cultures react to its cosmic incursions. Across the channel in Normandy, generations of monks have addressed the creature as La Bête des Trous. The Finnish know the Maw as Tuleva Syöjä. In the United States, meanwhile, they call it Friday Night at Applebee’s. 
</p>
<p>The Maw reacts to every naming with delight, for each name is a fresh morsel of News. By all means add your own invention to its plate, once you’re done reading about some of those forthcoming PC games.</p>
<h2>Monday 19th January</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1972450/Earth_of_Oryn/">Earth Of Oryn</a> is a pretty medieval kingdom builder, out this day in early access, with some real-time military elements and changing seasons.</li>
<li>Also coming to early access, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1031080/Lunars/">Lunars</a> is one of those multiplayer family boardgames where every board node is a minigame. In this case, it’s zodiac-themed, and the minigames seem relatively chaotic and Fall Guys-ish. </li>

                <p>The Forge has one of the deepest crafting experiences you will find in any of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roblox-games/2900-6830/" data-ref-id="2900-6830">most popular games in Roblox</a>. You are able to not only find ore throughout the world, but you are then able to take it and create gear to use for battles against zombies and more. There are so many different armor recipes you are able to craft in The Forge.</p><p>The general idea for how to craft in The Forge is pretty simple. You mine the ore using your pickaxe and then take it to the titular forge to create gear using a couple of enjoyable minigames. Depending on how many pieces of ore you use and what types they are, you will get various gear. If you want to know how to make all of the armor recipes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-forge-quest-guide-how-to-complete-all-main-quests/1100-6537007/" data-ref-id="1100-6537007">The Forge</a> Roblox, check below.</p><h2 id="The_Forge_All_Light_Armor_Recipes">The Forge All Light Armor Recipes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629286-img_5322.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629286" data-ratio="0.57233626588465" data-width="2046" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629286-img_5322.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629286"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629286-img_5322.jpeg"></figure><p>Light armor is the most basic type of armor you can make in The Forge. It is also the easiest, but you won’t get nearly any of the protection that the other armor types offer. That said, for beginners, light armor is what you want to start with.</p><p>In general, unless you are using a specific type of armor recipe, the ore type doesn’t matter all that much. Instead, it is all about how many pieces of ore you use. Fortunately, you don’t need many at all to make light armor.</p><p>Here are all of the light armor recipes that are available in The Forge and how to make them:</p><ul><li>Light Helmet: 1 in 1 chance of crafting with 3 ores of any kind</li><li>Light Leggings: 1 in 2 chance of crafting with 7 or more pieces of ore</li><li>Light Chestplate: 1 in 3 chance of crafting using roughly 10 pieces of ore</li></ul><h2 id="The_Forge_All_Medium_Armor_Recipes">The Forge All Medium Armor Recipes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629287-img_5325.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629287" data-ratio="0.56591796875" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629287-img_5325.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629287"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629287-img_5325.jpeg"></figure><p>Medium armor is where the boosts to your stats and the money you can make from selling starts to really kick off. This is the intermediate type of armor that you should focus on once you get past the tutorial of The Forge.</p><p>Here are all of the medium armor recipes that are available currently in The Forge:</p><ul><li>Medium Helmet: 1 in 1 chance of crafting when using more than 10 pieces of ore but less than 17</li><li>Medium Leggings: 1 in 2 chance of crafting when using more than 17 pieces of ore</li><li>Medium Chestplate: 1 in 3 chance of crafting when using 17 or more pieces of ore</li></ul><h2 id="The_Forge_All_Heavy_Armor_Recipes">The Forge All Heavy Armor Recipes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629288-img_5324.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629288" data-ratio="0.59228515625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629288-img_5324.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629288"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629288-img_5324.jpeg"></figure><p>Heavy armor, also known as knight armor, is for the players who are trying to get the most out of their ore. As you might expect, this has some of the highest stats in the game and sell price, but it has harsh requirements at the same time.</p><p>Here is how to make all of the heavy armor recipes in this Roblox experience:</p><ul><li>Knight Helmet: 1 in 1 chance when crafting with roughly 30-35 pieces of ore</li><li>Knight Leggings: 1 in 2 chance when crafting with 35 or more pieces of ore</li><li>Knight Chestplate: 1 in 3 chance when crafting with roughly 35 or more pieces of ore</li></ul><h2 id="The_Forge_All_Special_Armor_Recipes">The Forge All Special Armor Recipes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629307-img_5321.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629307" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629307-img_5321.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629307"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629307-img_5321.jpeg"></figure><p>There are special versions of the medium and heavy armor sets that you are able to make. They are generally better than their base versions, but they require highly specific sets of ore to make them.</p><p>Here is how to make the Samurai version of the medium armor set:</p><ul><li>Samurai Helmet: 1 in 2 chance of crafting with 3 Eyes Ore, 3 Obsidian Ore, 3 Uranium Ore, and 7 Mythril Ore</li><li>Samurai Leggings: 1 in 2 chance of crafting with 2 Eye Ore, 5 Obsidian Ore, 5 Uranium Ore, and 5 Mythril Ore</li><li>Samurai Chestplate: 1 in 2 chance of crafting with 2 Eye Ore, 5 Obsidian Ore, 5 Uranium Ore, and 5 Mythril Ore</li></ul><p>Dark Knight armor, on the other hand, is a special version of the heavy armor set. It, too, has special requirements for how to make it:</p><ul><li>Dark Knight Helmet: 1 in 2 chance when crafting with 2 Demonite Ore, 3 Eye Ore, 3 Mythril Ore, 6 Obsidian Ore, and 6 Uranium Ore</li><li>Dark Knight Leggings: 1 in 2 chance when crafting with approximately 10 Demonite Ore, 2 Eye Ore, 8 Mythril Ore, 9 Obsidian Ore, and 9 Uranium Ore</li><li>Dark Knight Chestplate: 1 in 2 chance when crafting with approximately 8 Demonite Ore, 5 Eye Ore, 8 Mythril Ore, 8 Obsidian Ore, and 8 Uranium Ore</li></ul><p>There is so much to see and do in Roblox The Forge, so the thrills don’t end with the main quests.

			<p>A few hours ago, the <strong>New York Videogame Critics Circle</strong> (NYVGCC) unveiled the winners of the <strong>2026 New York Game Awards</strong>, starting with Sandfall Interactive's <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong>, which won the top prize of best game of the year.</p>



<p>It's yet another meaningful award for the highly acclaimed single player JRPG, following <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the win at <strong>The Game Awards</strong> last month</a>. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-has-third-most-goty-wins-in-single-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already surpassed Baldur's Gate 3</a> as the third game to earn the most GOTY wins, and the award season is far from over, with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 well-positioned to win other prizes, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/"><strong>D.I.C.E. Awards</strong></a>, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gdc-awards-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dominates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDC Awards</a></strong>, and our own Wccftech Awards, which will be announced imminently. It only lost to <strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-2025-goty-award-goes-to-hollow-knight-silksong-beating-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the <strong>Steam Awards</strong></a>, although those were voted on by the public.</p>



<p>Anyway, the so-called '<strong>Big Apple Award</strong>' wasn't the only one that the French developer brought home, so to speak. Jennifer English was once again recognized for her work as Maelle with the <strong>Great White Way Award</strong>, which rewards the Best Acting in a Game. Here's the rest of the prizes that were given during the 2026 New York Game Awards:</p>



<p><strong><em>Off Broadway Award for Best Indie Game<br></em></strong><em>Blue Prince</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Herman Melville Award for Best Writing in a Game<br></em></strong><em>Blippo+</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Statue of Liberty Award for Best World<br></em></strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades II</a></em></p>



<p><strong><em>Tin Pan Alley Award for Best Music in a Game<br></em></strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight</a></em></p>



<p><strong><em>Excelsior Award for Best NY Game<br></em></strong><em>Ball x Pit</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Coney Island Dreamland Award for Best AR/VR Game<br></em></strong><em>Lumines Arise</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Central Park Children’s Zoo Award for Best Kids Game<br></em></strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em></p>



<p><strong><em>A-Train Award for Best Mobile Game<br></em></strong><em>Is This Seat Taken?</em></p>



<p><strong><em>High Line Award for Best Remake<br></em></strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a></em></p>



<p><strong><em>Chumley’s Speakeasy Award for Best Hidden Gem<br></em></strong><em>News Tower</em></p>



<p><strong><em>NYC GWB Award for Best DLC<br></em></strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-overture-one-more-lie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lies of P: Overture</a></em></p>



<p>This year's edition of the <strong>Andrew Yoon Legend Award</strong> went to a company rather than a person (last year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was the recipient): <strong>The Pokémon Company</strong>.</p>

            <p>Young Alfie Williams reckons <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> should introduce his character from 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple into the multiplayer slasher-fest.</p>
<p>Williams was chatting with IGN's lovely social producer Mat Jones about the 28 Years Later sequel, when conversation turned to video games and Dead by Daylight. Now, when I say young Alfie Williams, I really do mean young. Williams is, at the time of writing, only 15.</p>

<p>However, the actor - who plays Spike in both 28 Years Later and the newly-released sequel The Bone Temple - says that the previous inclusion of Stranger Things' characters by in Dead by Daylight proves that minors can be part of the bloody fray, so, really, why shouldn't the team include him?</p>
<p>"I know they bring Stranger Things in, so they can have minors in the game," Williams reasoned. He added he believes Dr. Ian Kelson, played by Ralph Fiennes in both films, would probably be quite a good fit for a Dead by Daylight survivor.</p>
<p>You can check out the full exchange with Williams and Mat below.</p> <div>

<p>As well as Stranger Things, other Dead by Daylight collaborations have included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-details-its-walking-dead-collaboration-as-public-test-build-go-live">The Walking Dead</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-celebrates-ninth-anniversary-with-five-nights-at-freddys-and-the-witcher-collaborations">Five Nights at Freddy's, The Witcher</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nicolas-cage-is-now-available-in-dead-by-daylight">Nicolas Cage</a> (who was able to fake his own death).</p>
<p>Given all that, a 28 Years Later collaboration is hardly out of the question, though I do think I would feel a little uneasy hunting down a child. What do you think of Williams' idea to feature Spike in Dead by Daylight?</p>

            <guid>1409722</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Bungie</strong> has so far <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungies-marathon-launches-march-2026-developers-provide-updated-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that <strong>Marathon</strong> would launch in March, but not exactly when. An <strong>Xbox Store</strong> leak may have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qgsa0y/marathon_release_date_discovered_on_xbox_store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed it to be <strong>March 5</strong></a>, so at the very beginning of the month.</p>



<p>Later, an Xbox user even <strong>captured the pre-order trailer</strong> and posted it on Streamable. You can find it embedded below - hurry up, though, as parent company <strong>Sony</strong> is likely to issue a DMCA takedown soon. Anyway, there's a <strong>Deluxe Edition</strong> that includes the so-called <strong>Midnight Decay bundle</strong> (two weapon skins) and more. No doubt, Bungie will share additional details when pre-orders open. It could be in just a few hours, as companies tend to follow up quickly on leaks to definitively confirm or refute the information.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Marathon returns almost exactly thirty years after the previous franchise entry, Marathon Infinity. This new game is very different from the old ones, though. It's modeled after the growing trend of <strong>PvPvE </strong><span><strong>survival-extraction</strong>&nbsp;<strong>games</strong>, played in first-person</span> only. </p>



<p>In each session, you'll infiltrate the derelict colony of <strong>Tau Ceti IV</strong>, a world whose inhabitants mysteriously vanished and is now contested by rival Runner crews and corporate security forces. Runners are <strong>bio‑cybernetic mercenaries</strong> who use a synthetic body built to survive extreme environments, hunting for weapons, upgrades, and valuable resources across repeated runs. </p>



<p>As with other extraction games, treats come from both NPCs (PvE) and other human players (PvP), <strong>making each session unpredictable</strong>. Additionally, Bungie has included <strong>dynamic events</strong> and <strong>environmental hazards</strong> that should keep players constantly on their toes.</p>



<p><strong>Successful exfiltration advances your character's seasonal power</strong>, earns cosmetics for your achievements, and lets you assemble stronger builds with the stolen loot. In Marathon, players customize their Runner's playstyle using weapons, implants, and equipment they collect.</p>



<p>The most recent official Deep Dive from last week <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-deep-dive-runner-shells-gameplay/">showed off the game's <strong>Runner Shells</strong></a>, or classes if you prefer:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Destroyer </strong></li>



<li><strong>Assassin </strong></li>



<li><strong>Recon </strong></li>



<li><strong>Vandal </strong></li>



<li><strong>Thief </strong></li>



<li><strong>Triage</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>There is a seventh Shell, the <strong>Rook</strong>, which can only be used in solo queues and has the advantage of coming with a free standard loadout, allowing newcomers to play without much fear of losing their own items.</p>



<p>The base game will be available at <strong>$39.99 / €39.99 / £34.99</strong>. The Deluxe Edition will certainly be more expensive, although we'll have to wait for the full pre-order announcement to know exactly how much. Marathon will be released on <strong>PC</strong>, <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, and <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> and <strong>X </strong>with full <strong>cross-play</strong>.</p>

The primary goal of the test is to verify server stability and identify critical bugs. While some content will be limited, the test aims to provide a gameplay experience that closely resembles the live service. The Server Slam Test will run for 72 hours, from February 19, 2026, 18:00 p.m. to February 22, 2026, 18:00 p.m. (PDT).</p><p>The test build will feature a variety of new content previously introduced in developer notes. This includes the new boss mutant “Yacha,” along with newly added normal and elite mutants, and the implementation of an elite / boss-exclusive equipment system. In addition, players can experience enhanced anti-cheat measures, user interface / user experience improvements based on player feedback gathered during Steam Next Fest, overall optimization updates and new cosmetic content.</p><p><em>THE CUBE, SAVE US</em> previously gained significant attention during Steam Next Fest, achieving 3rd place in peak concurrent players and “Top 8” in the global popular demo rankings. Taking these results into account, XLGAMES plans to further refine the game’s overall quality through the Server Slam Test.</p><p>Meanwhile, XLGAMES has scheduled Steam Early Access for Q1 2026. The upcoming Server Slam Test will serve as a final comprehensive evaluation of both service stability and gameplay quality ahead of Early Access.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nintendo always keeps a careful eye on its branding and the face of its company, Mario. Even when collaborating with a partner like Sega.</p>



<p>Of course, the relationship between Sega and Nintendo is much different today than it was 30 years ago at the height of the console wars. As many know, Sonic, Sega’s mascot, was designed specifically to make Mario seem slow and outdated, so more players would gravitate toward the Sega Genesis home console. However, Sega left the console war in 2001 and, in later years, appeared alongside Mario in Super Smash Bros. games and in their own game, where Mario, Sonic, and many of their side characters from their respective franchises participated in Olympic sports.</p>







<h2 id="h-mario-can-t-appear-to-be-a-step-behind">Mario Can’t Appear to Be a Step Behind</h2>



<p>Ryoichi Hasegawa, a former Sega producer, worked on the Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games franchise. Now, he’s sharing a fun story that offers insight into how protective Nintendo is of its mascot.</p>



<p>He was recently interviewed by Adrian of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r6XcQF_pBI&amp;pp=0gcJCU8KAYcqIYzv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Arcade Attack Retro Gaming Network,</a> and during the interview, explained that Nintendo once was upset that Sonic’s foot was ahead of Mario’s in the key art for the Mario and Sonic at the Beijing Olympics video game</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“But there was one funny story. There was, of course, artwork of Mario, Sonic, and other characters standing on the field. Those artworks were used for the package, the instruction manual cover, and the cartridge label, and things like that. There was one small error. Sonic’s foot was in front of Mario’s foot. Nintendo demanded us to change the priority. I still remember that. We were like, ‘Oh my God! We have to change it, or there’ll be no deal.'”</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>That’s right, blast processing be damned! Mario will always be one step ahead. There were six games featuring the Mario and Sonic characters at the Olympics. However, the series has remained dormant since the 2019 release of Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020.</p>

<p>Two minutes of in-engine footage of ZeniMax Online Studio’s cancelled Project Blackbird has leaked online.</p>







<p>The footage, which Insider Gaming can verify is legitimate, was used internally at ZeniMax to showcase the game’s lighting in Unreal Engine 4. You can see the two minutes of footage below:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="es" dir="ltr"><p>👀🔥 LEAK ⚡️</p><p>Nuevo metraje de "Project Blackbird", el MMO de Zenimax Online cancelado hace meses por Xbox.</p><p>Qué ganas le tenía 🥺. <a href="https://t.co/4Nz1G22l2F">pic.twitter.com/4Nz1G22l2F</a></p></div>— eXtas1s 🎮 Noticias &amp; Rumores (@eXtas1stv) <a href="https://twitter.com/eXtas1stv/status/2012971422679765352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Project Blackbird was cancelled by Microsoft in July 2025 as a part of Microsoft’s mass layoffs, which also saw other projects at the publisher cancelled.</p>



<p>Speaking with sources on Blackbird, the game was targeting a 2028 release date and had amazed Microsoft Gaming executives just months earlier during a presentation. As of the time of writing, Microsoft Gaming still haven’t given a reason as to why Blackbird was cancelled.</p>



<p>The game’s cancellation led to the layoff of some 300 developers and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/matt-firor-quit-zenimax-project-blackbird-cancelation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">departure of studio president Matt Firor</a>. </p>

<p>The live-action Legend of Zelda movie will stream exclusively on Netflix after its theatrical and home entertainment releases.</p>



<p>Very little is known about the Legend of Zelda movie, aside from the fact that it is slated to release in May 2027. However, as part of Sony Pictures’ Pay-1 licensing deal with Netflix, the upcoming Legend of Zelda movie will join Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse and the forthcoming quartet of Beatles movies, directed by Sam Mendes, in streaming exclusively on Netflix.</p>



<p><a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-and-sony-pictures-entertainment-enter-new-global-pay-1-deal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a press release, </a>Paul Littmann, EVP of Global Distribution at Sony Pictures Television, praised the partnership with Netflix and cited the new deal as the next step in that relationship.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Our partnership with Netflix has always been incredibly valuable. This new Pay-1 deal takes that partnership to the next level and reinforces the enduring appeal of our theatrical releases to Netflix’s global audience. It also further underscores the strength of our independence and unique ability to create meaningful opportunities that benefit our creative stakeholders, consumers, and world-class partners.”</p>

<p>In November 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-live-action-images-reveal-link-and-zelda-in-costume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official images</a> of Zelda and Link in the film were revealed. Bo Bragason will play Princess Zelda, and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth will play Hyrule’s protector, Link. Filming began in 2025, but there’s still over a year until the actual release, and much remains to be learned about the casting, plot, and more. Recently, it was suggested that a star of the popular Apple TV series, Severance, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zelda-movie-leak-impa-severance-actor-filming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">could be joining the cast.</a></p>







<p>2026 is also the 40th anniversary of the The Legend of Zelda franchise as a whole. In celebration, a new LEGO set is on the way.
