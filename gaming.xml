<p>And is that a mouse mode tease?</p>

<figure><a title="Mina the Hollower" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/78b01dc5b84de/mina-the-hollower.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Yacht Club Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yacht Club Games kicked off today's Indie World showcase strongly by announcing that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/mina-the-hollower-yacht-clubs-retro-zelda-inspired-adventure-scores-switch-2-release-date">coming to both Switch 1 and Switch 2 on 31st October 2025</a>. And you might be wondering, <em>'what does a Switch 2 version of a pixel art game entail?'</em> Well, let us — and the developer — inform you.</p>
<p>In a blog post on <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/mina-the-hollower-launches-on-nintendo-switch-1-2-on-oct-31-play-the-demo-now-/">Yacht Club Games' website</a>, the team confirmed that the Switch 2 version of the game supports 120fps, an extremely tasty prospect for those with the new console. You can also spy 120hz and HDR output <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mina-the-hollower-switch-2/">at the bottom of the eShop page</a>. And hey, there's a native Switch 2 demo, so that's worth checking out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://youtu.be/Em_IP-6snrs?si=cpGJ6X0nKTk6ngyn">our friends over at GVG have a comparison video</a> of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mina_the_hollower">Switch 1</a>'s 60fps release and the Switch 2's 120. Have a watch of it below.</p>

<p>And, since Mina the Hollower is all about a mouse, it would make sense to have <em>some</em> kind of mouse compatibility, right? Well, fear not, as Yacht Club Games seems to be teasing <em>something</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In Mina the Hollower, you ARE the mouse! But we heard that if you turn your Joy-Con 2 on its side while playing and move it around, <em>something</em> may happen.."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, well, well... Yacht Club Games is the Big Cheese of the retro throwback, so we expect great things, especially given that this one's clearly inspired by the top-down Game Boy Color games of the early '90s.</p>
<p><em>Will you be getting Mina the Hollower on Switch 1 or Switch 2? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beaten-almost-every-cod-game-twitch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-has-beaten-almost-every-call-of-duty-game-ever-made-on-twitch.1264884/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Battlefield 6 beta commenced earlier today, and it has been skyrocketing all day in social and streaming circles. The game has become one of the most highly anticipated first-person shooters to emerge in several years, and it’s looking like a strong turning point for a series that has found itself on rocky ground for almost a decade.</p>



<p>As the beta unravels, scores of fans are taking to Twitch and YouTube to watch streams as they await the <strong>open portion </strong>of the beta to kick off. As I write this, almost 850,000 people are watching the beta on <strong>Twitch alone</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-huge-numbers">Huge Numbers</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 is being played by some of the most prolific streamers in the world right now, and they’re pulling in gargantuan numbers. At the time of publishing, the Battlefield 6 beta had 830,000 live viewers, which is something of a stunning record for the series.</p>



<p>Not only is it the most-watched Battlefield game ever released (not that it’s released yet), but it’s also effortlessly beating the peak viewership count for <strong>every major Call of Duty game ever</strong>, bar Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>



<p>Only the battle royale game stands between Battlefield 6 and total dominance.</p>



<p>For reference, here’s the ranking for peak viewer counts on Twitch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III – 444,866</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 – 481,586</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War – 705,050</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II – 751,937</li>



<li><strong>Battlefield 6 – 844,723</strong></li>



<li>Call of Duty: Warzone – 1,613,626</li>
</ul>



<p>As the weekend approaches, could we see Battlefield 6 threaten Warzone’s record?</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that Battlefield 6’s highest peak has also topped Rainbow Six Siege (583,166), Overwatch (634,296), Escape from Tarkov (566,684), and PUBG (597,663).</p>



<p>This is one heck of a high-performing game, and we’re on the first day of the beta. The sky might just be the limit for Battlefield 6.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-owners-having-issues-with-madden-26-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-owners-having-issues-with-madden-26-access.1264878/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Madden 26 is out now for Deluxe Edition owners, but Xbox users are having issues getting access to the game. </p>



<p>A quick search on social media—or a visit to my DMs—shows a number of players don’t have access to the game they purchased if they got it as part of the EA Sports MVP Bundle that included both Madden 26 and College Football 26. </p>



<p>The specific issue is that the game is showing as unowned. </p>



<p><strong>“For our Xbox MVP Bundle owners, we’re aware of an issue some are experiencing where they’re unable to access the game,” </strong>the <a href="https://x.com/MaddenNFLDirect/status/1953495214695338229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Madden team posted</a>. <strong>“We’re working closely with Microsoft and plan to resolve this as soon as possible.”</strong></p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>For our Xbox MVP Bundle owners, we’re aware of an issue some are experiencing where they’re unable to access the game.</p><p>We’re working closely with Microsoft and plan to resolve this as soon as possible.</p><p>Updates will be threaded below as needed!</p></div>— MaddenNFLDirect (@MaddenNFLDirect) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaddenNFLDirect/status/1953495214695338229?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>One work around is that if you have EA Play, you can download the 10-hour trial. After that download completes, it <em>should </em>show that you own the full game and you’ll be all set. </p>



<h6 id="h-more-madden-26-madden-26-soundtrack-features-chappell-roan-dmx-green-day-and-more">More Madden 26: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-soundtrack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26 Soundtrack Features Chappell Roan, DMX, Green Day, and More</a></h6>



<p>If you don’t have EA Play or the workaround doesn’t work, you’ll have to simply wait for an update from EA and Microsoft on the matter.</p>



<p>Madden 26 is also available for PlayStation 5, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2. Those who bought the Standard Edition of the game have to wait until August 14 to play.</p>



<p>Have you had any issues accessing Madden 26 on Xbox or other consoles? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has been out for over two months now, which means players have had ample time to puzzle over and tease out every morsel of its lore. But there's still one ultra-rare item in the game that most players have probably never seen before, but which some in the community believe still holds an enormous secret: the Cord End.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you play Nightreign and, like me, had no idea what this even was until just now, here's the rundown: the Cord End is a legendary consumable item that only appears in big and small churches in Nightreign from breaking boxes. Its drop percentage is ridiculously low - just 0.035% - meaning most players will likely never even run into it. Its listed use is cryptic: "Gain entry somewhere." If you don't know where that somewhere is, the item is totally useless to you.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But for those in the know (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Use_Cord_End_in_Nightreign_for_Secret_Door">or those following our handy guide</a>), it's not too hard to find the secret door it opens. Hidden in a cliff wall in a ravine at the center of the map, there's a sealed entrance that only opens if you have the Cord End on hand. Inside is a strange statue of a girl, and three Sacrificial Twigs, talismans that allow the wielder to die exactly one time without losing runes or levels. It's an interesting reward, to be sure, but admittedly a little underwhelming given the ridiculous rarity of the Cord End required to get them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, granted, it's likely at least part of the Cord End's mystery is in adding lore details to Elden Ring Nightreign via its description and the statue of the girl in the chamber it opens. We won't cover that here, as the meaning behind it is pretty deep into endgame spoiler territory for Nightreign, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9FXm1IEwHY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lore YouTuber VaatiVidya</a> has a great breakdown of what the Cord End is from a lore perspective and why it matters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that all said, the lack of real mechanical payoff for such a rare find has players speculating that there's something more to this secret door. For the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l7j5m9/follow_up_to_my_sacrificial_twig_theory/?share_id=LXYt4Qg7gPNfE7Cg27Cpo&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last two months</a>, the community has been testing out theories around the Cord End and the Sacrificial Twigs. With a lack of any new or recent clues, the secret hunting had largely slowed down, but a cryptic post on the Nightreign subreddit recently fired up everyone's curiosity again, inspiring people to float new theories about how to do... something... with those twigs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest barrier to finding anything is the sheer rarity of the Cord End. Some players are reporting <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mft3jp/after_exactly_222_hours_got_my_first_cord/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seeing their first one</a> after hundreds of hours of play. So anyone who wants to test theories has to get extremely lucky in actually getting a Cord End to begin with, and then also getting the exact perfect other circumstances they're looking for (specific bosses, certain locations appearing, certain characters in the party, and so forth) to test out whatever it is they want to test. So while it's unlikely that there's anything new to discover regarding the Cord End at this stage, there's at least a whisper of possibility in the fact that so few people are in a position to make that discovery to begin with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is it a secret? Is it merely lore? Is it something we'll be able to unlock in a future DLC, as some have theorized? Who knows! But what's genuinely cool here is that an ultra rare item is still sparking this level of curiosity and discussion and mystery in the community months after the game's release. Whether there's anything deeper to the Cord End or not, its enticing rarity is sufficient to get me, at least, fired up... if I can ever get one to drop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave Elden Ring Nightreign a 7/10, saying that "when Elden Ring Nightreign is played exactly as it was designed to be played, it’s one of the finest examples of a three-player co-op game around – but that's harder to do than it should be, and playing solo is poorly balanced." Nightreign <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-finally-gets-duos-mode-with-patch-102-game-balance-adjusts-to-the-current-number-of-players">recently saw the addition of a duos mode</a>, and the game had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-developer-thanks-fans-as-nightreign-and-shadow-of-the-erdtree-top-new-sales-milestones">sold five million copies</a> as of July.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Alternatively, the premium Xbox Ally X will cost €899 (US prices to be confirmed).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dealabs cautions that this release date has only been verified via its sources for the machine's European launch — so there may still be some slight difference here for other markets, though likely not by much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft is set to showcase more of the ROG Xbox Ally this month at Gamescom, with the handheld available to try publicly on Microsoft's trade show booth, alongside the highly-anticipated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But whether this gives us a firmer grasp on Silksong's elusive release date remains uncertain. During June's Xbox Games Showcase 2025, Xbox president Sarah Bond stated that Silksong would be "available at launch and in Game Pass when Ally releases later this year" — leading many fans to believe the game was being lined up to arrive as a launch title for the handheld.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, writing on the game's official Discord, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-developer-responds-to-release-date-confusion-promises-launch-before-holiday-not-tied-to-xbox-handheld-arrival">Silksong developer Team Cherry subsequently clarified that the game was not sat waiting for the ROG Ally X to launch</a>.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> has made an annual tradition out of adding horror icons as skins each October when spooky season rolls in. Last year it was Leatherface and Billy the Puppet, the year before that it was Michael Myers and Jack Skellington, and the year before that brought us Ash Williams. But it's looking like those lineups might pale in comparison to what's in store for us this year, as dataminers have collected evidence that both Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th and Ghostface from Scream will be coming for us all during this year's Fortnitemares in October.</p><p>While no one has actually seen these alleged Ghostface and Jason Voorhees skins, some compelling evidence was found in the Fortnite game files with the new season update. For Jason, leakers found references to <a href="https://x.com/wensoing/status/1953356200487092312?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new medallion named after him</a>, which is pretty clear cut. The evidence is slightly more circumspect for Ghostface--there's data about a new mythic item called a <a href="https://x.com/Wensoing/status/1953353415762776514" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Stalker Knife"</a> which seems very much like it would fit with a Scream collab. That could instead be related to the existing Michael Myers collab, but Fortnite usually reserves new mythics for <em>new</em> collabs, not returning ones.</p><p>Regardless of what the reality actually is, it'll probably be a couple months before these rumors are officially confirmed or shut down, since Fortnitemares won't start until October anyway. In the meantime, though, there's plenty of new content to consume in Fortnite, what with the simultaneous launches of the new seasons of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-battle-pass-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-6856/" data-ref-id="2900-6856">Battle Royale</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-og-pass-season-5-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-6862/" data-ref-id="2900-6862">OG</a>. Battle Royale in particular is experiencing a massive vibe shift as it moves from the superhero-themed season that just ended to an invasion of bugs and very large worm creatures. Catch up on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-weapons-and-loot-in-fortnite-og-season-4/2900-6654/" data-ref-id="2900-6654">new loot pool</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-map-changes-in-chapter-6-season-4-shock-n-awesome/2900-6854/" data-ref-id="2900-6854">map changes</a>, and everything else Season 4 is adding to BR with the gallery below.</p>

                <p>Microsoft's wave of game cancellations continues today with the news that Just Cause developer Avalanche's day-one Game Pass release Contraband has been cancelled. Citing sources, this was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lvt7g4p7fs2k" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">first confirmed by reporter Jason Schreier.</a> The game was planned for PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/breaking-microsoft-stops-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>, meanwhile, said Avalanche has "stopped active development" on Contraband but didn't use the word "cancel." The report said the game is now "on hold," citing a source that said the project was in the works for five years.</p>

The streams need some adjustments after a few years and [have] been wanting to readjust to better serve players."</p><p dir="ltr">This is all coming ahead of Season 10, which is at the end of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-2025-roadmap-highlights-new-crossovers-endgame-updates/1100-6530666/" data-ref-id="1100-6530666">Diablo 4's 2025 content roadmap</a> and is largely shrouded in mystery aside from the fact that it will bring updates to the game's Infernal Hordes endgame activity and introduce a new IP crossover.</p><p dir="ltr">Fletcher said earlier this summer that the Diablo team had heard the "warcries of wanting more change" from players, and that Blizzard "has been cooking" on bigger changes asked for by the community. What exactly those changes will be, and whether they will arrive alongside Season 10, are still unknown. However, a recent meeting attended by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">Diablo content creators regarding Diablo 4's future</a> seems to imply some major changes are imminent.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">Diablo 4 is set to receive its second expansion</a> in 2026.

            <p>
ASUS' Xbox-branded ROG Ally - perhaps the closest we'll get to an official Xbox gaming handheld anytime soon, if recent reports are true - launches this October, says a reliable leaker.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, it's claimed ASUS is targeting a 16th October European release date for the Xbox ROG Ally and its beefier-specced sibling, the Xbox ROG Ally X. That's <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-connait-enfin-la-date-exacte-de-sortie-60340">according to Dealab's Billbil-kun</a>, who has a long history of accurate leaks.
</p>
<p>
Both machines were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-xbox-branded-asus-handheld-finally-gets-an-official-reveal">officially unveiled in June</a>, when it was confirmed the Xbox ROG Ally would include an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor alongside 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage, while the Ally X - described as a machine for "the most demanding players" - features an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor and 24GB of high-speed RAM.

<p>
At the time, ASUS would only say the machines were launching this "holiday" across select countries including the UK and US, and other details were limited. However, Billbil-kun recently claimed the Xbox ROG Ally will cost €599 (around £520), while the Xbox ROG Ally X variant is said to be priced at €899 (approximately £780). Pre-orders for both machines will reportedly begin on 20th August, with an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-handheld-consoles-rog-ally-and-ally-x-preorders-open-during-gamescom-report-says">official announcement expected during Microsoft's Gamescom showcase</a>, which begins at 2pm BST on the same day.
</p>
<p>
The Xbox ROG Ally and ROG Ally X, as we learned previously, are both powered by Windows 11, include a full-screen Xbox interface, and feature an aggregated gaming library with access to installed games from a range of PC stores, including Steam, Battle.net, and GOG. And, of course, the machines support Xbox Play Anywhere titles.
</p>
<p>
Xbox boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-discusses-potential-xbox-handheld-plans">long teased Microsoft's plans for an official Xbox gaming handheld</a>, and reports earlier this year suggested the company had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">settled on a multi-pronged strategy</a> that would initially see it partner with a third-party to launch an Xbox-branded portable machine before the end of 2025 while it worked on its own in-house project to release sometime in 2027. However, later reports <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-xbox-handheld-reportedly-sidelined-as-it-focuses-on-third-party-portable-devices">claimed a change in strategy</a>, with Windows Central saying Microsoft's internal handheld project had been "sidelined" in favour of more third-party partnerships, while The Verge went further, calling the project "essentially cancelled".
</p>
<p>
Curiously, however, Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-says-its-working-on-next-gen-xbox-consoles-youll-play-in-your-living-room-and-in-your-hands">recently announced the company was partnering with AMD</a> to "co-engineer silicon across a portfolio of devices including our next-generation Xbox consoles in your living room and in your hands". For now though, the only certainty is ASUS' handhelds, and we should get a confirmed release date very soon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Gearbox has put the spotlight on the beefcakiest of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> Vault Hunters, Amon the Forgeknight, showing off the character’s axe chucking abilities and role as the frontline tank of the party.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Official Gameplay Overview - Amon" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4lCbxjy0zI4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As a Forgeknight, Amon can draw upon drones to quickly craft the weapons and gear that he needs. This includes a Forgehammer to smash enemies with, Forgeaxes to throw at and slice enemies, a Forgeshield to soak up damage, and more.</p>
<p>These Action Skillsdepend on which of the three skill trees you’ve levelled up, though, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crucible (Cybernetics skill tree) – Wield the elemental might of fire and ice with Amon’s twin Forgeaxes, which deal Incendiary or Cryo damage by default, have multiple charges, and can be picked up to reduce their cooldown. The Forgeaxes make any damaged target Primed, causing them to explode in a damaging, bloody mess when killed.</li>
<li>Scourge (Vengeance skill tree) – Charge headlong into the fray as Amon summons his Forgeshield, which will soak up incoming damage and fill up a Vengeance Meter. Once you’ve absorbed the brunt of the incoming hurt, you can return the favor by firing back a Forgewave that consumes Vengeance to deal freezing Cryo damage.</li>
<li>Onslaughter (Calamity skill tree) – Wallop your foes in the face with Amon’s Forgefist, which dashes to your target to unleash an explosive Rocket Punch. The force of this Incendiary Melee Damage impact will Stagger most enemies, leaving them dazed so you can finish them off with a flurry of bullets.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/game-info/vault-hunters/amon/">view each tree in depth here</a>.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing. Amon’s Forgeskill trait gives him a secondary Action Skill, which comes with a separate cooldown, so you can really bounce back and forth between them. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-Edge (Crucible Action Skill equipped) – Throw a twinned Forgeaxe, dealing Cryo Damage to enemies it passes through and returning to Amon, dealing Incendiary Melee Damage on the way back.</li>
<li>Firewall (Scourge Action Skill equipped) – Deploy a Firewall that absorbs enemy projectiles, and grants friendly projectiles that pass through it increased damage and velocity. Absorbed damage is converted into Vengeance if Scourge is active, and enemies near Firewall get burned with Incendiary damage over time.</li>
<li>Molten Slam (Onslaughter Action Skill equipped) – Slam a Molten Forgehammer into the ground, dealing Incendiary damage to enemies in a large area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Amon is the third character that Gearbox has released a deep dive on, following on from <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/vex-spotlight/">Vex the Siren</a> and <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/rafa-spotlight/">Rafa the Exo-Soldier.</a> There’s just Harlowe the Gravitar to go, which will doubtless be coming soon, what with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/29/borderlands-4-gameplay-state-of-play-is-airing-tomorrow-30th-april-release-date-moved-forward/">Borderlands 4’s release date being set for 12th September</a>. There’s not much time left!</p>

<p>Reef Entertainment has released a new overview trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D: No Fate</a>, and sorry, but we know you're all excited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> and whatnot, but this looks <em>bloody amazing</em>.</p>
<p>Clocking in at just over three minutes, the trailer takes us through some of the levels you'll be exploring, the types of gameplay at hand, and the modes available at launch. You can go through the campaign as standard, partake in a boss rush mode, an infinite mode, or an arcade mode to really get those nostalgia juices flowing.</p>
<p>Gameplay will be a mix of stealth and full-on action, with supplies hidden throughout the levels to aid in your progress. Multiple difficulty modes will also be available, including 'Easy Money', 'No Problemo', 'Hasta la Vista', and 'Judgement Day'. You know we're going straight for the latter.</p>
<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate launches on the Switch on <strong>31st October 2025</strong>. It's a bit odd that the trailer didn't include the Switch box art at the end, but we suspect there's some promotional campaign in place with Sony / PlayStation. Nothing to panic about.</p>
<p>We recently spoke to the developers behind the new title, so if you want a bit more information on what to expect and how the team came up with the project, be sure to check it out.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> is currently available for players to try in an early access, semi-closed beta form, which is only semi-closed because technically anyone could have acquired a code through specific channels, but only those with a code can jump into the beta today and tomorrow before it opens to the rest of the non-code-having public on August 9-10 and then again next weekend from August 14-17.</p>



<p>And even in that confusing, not entirely closed, yet not entirely open form, hundreds of thousands of players have jumped through every necessary hoop to play Battlefield 6 as soon as possible, with today's kick-off of the beta already seeing concurrent player numbers on Steam alone surpass the all-time high concurrent player count of Battlefield 2042.</p>



<p>We expected Battlefield 6's beta numbers to be high, since <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-servers-already-full-thousands-in-queue/">servers were already starting to fill up yesterday</a>, but no one thought they'd necessarily be this high. Per SteamDB, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1517290/charts/#max">Battlefield 2042's highest concurrent player count</a> on Steam only reached 107,376 players, a mark reached two years after it launched, and beating out its launch concurrent player numbers by about 2,000 players.</p>



<p>The Battlefield 6 beta, once again according to SteamDB, has already reached a peak of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/?peak=334549"><strong>334,549</strong> concurrent players</a>. At the time of this writing, there are 303,222 players in the beta on Steam.</p>



<p>It's all a clear sign that there are hundreds of thousands who were hungry for a new Battlefield game that at least looks like it has the chance of capturing the same attention and hold the series once had on the shooter genre.</p>



<p>It's a great start for a game that EA has put so much behind, with four studios all working together on various aspects of Battlefield 6 to ensure that it gets the best chance at being the comeback-kid the series and EA desperately needs it to be.</p>



<p>Of course, the real test will come when the game actually launches later this year in October, and if its launch can not only repeat, but beat these numbers - and then sustain them for longer than a day.</p>



<p>If you're not able to check out the beta this weekend but want to find out more about how Battlefield 6 plays, then you can check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto's impressions of the game</a>, as Kai got the try it out last week during the multiplayer reveal event EA hosted. </p>

            <p>
Folk Emerging describes itself as a turn-based 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game, but in practice, it's possibly more of a 2.5X strategy game, in that it puts you in charge of a nomadic hunter-gatherer community from before the rise of agriculture and the founding of towns and cities. 
</p>
<p>
As this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2275300/view/517468855824548048">developer update suggests</a>, it's like the turn or two at the very start of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization</a> when you just have one Settler unit, but stretched out across thousands of years, with a social element and rustic spreadsheet aesthetics that remind me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-of-dragon-pass">King Of Dragon Pass</a>. It's got somewhat doofy cartoon Stone Age muzak, but is otherwise the most intriguing Civlike strategy game I've laid eyes on since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/4x-strategy-game-entrotria-is-in-theory-galactic-civilizations-but-looks-like-a-jackson-pollock-painting">the one that looks like an octopus murder scene</a> - and whadayaknow, by happy coincidence there's a public playtest running from right now till August 18th.

<p>
Going by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2275300/view/517468855824548048">the Steam page</a> descriptions, you'll move your tent-dwelling tribe continually around a procedurally generated hexagonal map that consists of nine climates. Each climate has a different food web that is represented by an actual web, with a node for each predator and prey species. Ideally, you'll pick a mixture of food sources from that web so as to keep your cavepeople hale and hearty, without reducing the local ecosystem to dust.
</p>
<p>
While the hunter-gatherer premise obviously precludes construction elements, there <em>is</em> a research tree. You start off splitting flints, later gravitate to the mysteries of fire, and eventually clock domestication and the process of sowing and reaping. Alongside this, you'll flesh out your community's culture by picking between binary norms such as "pride" or "modesty" and "diligence" or "hedonism": these affect things like the odds of war with other groups of humans and how you approach trade.
</p>
<p>
And then there's the social simulation elements, which are represented as a tangled natto ball of coloured faces. "Manage the relationships between individuals, families, and tribes," explains the Steam page. "Watch your collective adapt over countless generations. Beware the unintended consequences current choices can have on your great-great-great-grandchildren." Mental note: try not to accidentally invent the patriarchy.
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>
Lastly, there's combat, which sees you autobattling with charcoal cave paintings. You'll want to be wary of picking fights, because if Grarg the Forager takes a sharpened stone to the kisser, you'll not only lose her foraging skills but also all of the "hard-won wisdom" she might otherwise pass on to her kids. So the technologies and practices at your disposal are hereditary, then, like in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/norland">Norland</a>? 
</p>
<p>
Other points of interest: the world periodically succumbs to an Ice Age, which obviously requires ingenuity and preparation to survive. You can join up with other roving communities to form bustling tribes of quarrelling factions. I'm going to sign up for that playtest and see how long it takes me to become an evolutionary dead end.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>I’m desperate for <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mode-option-patch-1-02-ps5-1851786981"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a> to enter its next phase, and dataminers may have finally revealed what that is, thanks to references hidden in the multiplayer roguelite’s latest update. It sounds like an endless mode could be on the way, complete with ranked matchmaking. I wouldn’t care about any of that in most games, but <em>Nightreign</em> isn’t most games, and this new mode could be exactly what it needs to get me hooked again.</p> <p>Players have spent the summer circulating through a new rotation of tougher Everdark Sovereign variants of the game’s existing Nightlord boss fights. They’ve mostly been pretty fun, even last week’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-augur-evergaol-everdark-time-1851787245">divisive overhaul of Maris Fathom of Night, AKA Augur,</a> which forced players to use a magic sword that drops during the fight. Otherwise, most players have burned through the main campaign and each character’s remembrance side quests. We know the randomized Limveld map like the palm of our hands. Most runs have become a walk in the park. We need something different. We need something harder.</p> <p>That could be precisely what a new endless mode is bringing. References to it were discovered in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Adminisitrator/comments/1mh908l/elden_ring_nightreign_new_mode_deep_of_night/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-dataminers-have-uncovered-plans-for-a-new-endless-mode-with-armored-core-6s-rank-system-and-skill-based-matchmaking/">a recent datamine</a> posted on Reddit (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-dataminers-have-uncovered-plans-for-a-new-endless-mode-with-armored-core-6s-rank-system-and-skill-based-matchmaking/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>). The images reveal a new matchmaking option called The Deep of Night with the following description: “The Deep of Night is a battlefield of endless Night. Victory will increase your rating, burnishing your Depth. The Darkness extends unto infinity.” Screenshots shared in the post suggest five levels each with ranked ratings of 0 to 9,999. Bosses in the Deep of Night look slightly different, and the weapons you earn down there each come with unique de-buffs to make things harder. Players will also seemingly unlock additional slots on vessels where new “Depth” relics can be equipped.</p>

 <p>It’s unclear how much the map itself will change in this mode, but it sounds like players will keep going until they die rather than ending after night three with a final boss fight. At the very least, the increasing difficulty, new gear, and extra relic slots are enough to establish a completely new endgame, while the ranking system gives the sweatiest Nightfarers among us a new goal to reach for.</p> <p>It’s not clear when FromSoftware is planning to add this mode, but sometime in September seems like a good bet, as players wrap up the last run of Everdark Sovereigns this month. I’m excited for a Bell Bearing Hunter at the bottom of the castle on night one to become the least of players’ worries if this new endless mode ends up delivering on the level of difficulty teased in these datamining leaks.</p>

<p>A new claim states that proximity chat is coming to Fortnite’s battle royale mode. </p>



<p>With Fortnite introducing a brand new season for Chapter 6, Epic Games has a boatload of content for players to try out. The Shock ‘N Awesome season goes live today, introducing the highly anticipated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-power-rangers-collaboration-confirmed-in-new-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Power Rangers collaboration</a>, along with brand new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-shock-n-awesome-season-details-revealed-new-enemies-weapons-pois-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapons, enemies, POIs</a> and more. The latest development reveals that Fortnite might have more in store for us. </p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-is-reportedly-bringing-proximity-chat-to-battle-royale">Fortnite is Reportedly Bringing Proximity Chat to Battle Royale</h2>



<p>The update about Fortnite’s proximity mode comes from a <a href="https://x.com/Wensoing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wensoing</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Loolo_WRLD</a> (corroborated by <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1953377603588345984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a>). Their latest post on X (formerly Twitter) states that this feature is being developed for the battle royale mode. Epic Games has seemingly separated some “Creative Proximity Chat files” so that they can be incorporated into the battle royale mode. The feature will also include a setting to deactivate or activate it according to the player’s preference. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Proximity chat will introduce another layer of chaos and strategy to Fortnite’s battle royale mode. For those who are unfamiliar, this feature enables players to hear the voices of other players in the lobby, depending on their in-game proximity. Proximity chat has been an integral factor in creating numerous viral content pieces for games like Call of Duty and Among Us, as it enables interactions that were previously impossible in the base game. </p>

<p>The next party game coming for the Mario Party crown has an official release date as Lego Party is set to launch on September 30. </p>



<p>The game will be available for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam.</p>



<p>Lego Party is your standard party board game, featuring customizable Lego characters, 60 minigames, and multiplayer with up to four players locally or private online games no matter the platform. What it won’t have, however, is online matchmaking with random players.</p>



<p>Lego Party is presented like a game show where you’ll travel around the board, avoiding obstacles, and playing mini games to collect Golden Bricks. The player with the most Golden Bricks at the end of the game wins. And don’t worry, there aren’t any bonus bricks at the end of the game that will snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.</p>



<p>In our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-party-hands-on-preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview of the game</a> from hands-on time at Summer Game Fest, I called Lego Party a game with all of the <strong>“makings of being the next great party game”.</strong> </p>



<p><strong>“Throughout the entire Play Days event, the LEGO Party booth was the loudest and most active among all of the games being shown. That’s a good sign when the goal is to bring people together.”</strong></p>

It is available via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/caves_of_qud" target="_blank">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://freeholdgames.itch.io/cavesofqud" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its store pages:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Caves of Qud</em> is a science fantasy roguelike epic steeped in retrofuturism, deep simulation, and swathes of sentient plants. Come inhabit a living, breathing world and chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations. Decide: is it a dying earth, or is it on the verge of rebirth?</p><p>Do anything and everything. <em>Caves of Qud</em> is a deeply simulated, biologically diverse, richly cultured world.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Deep Physical <a title="Genres > Simulation [802 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">Simulation</a></strong> – Don’t like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point.</li><li><strong>Fully Simulated <a title="Companies > Creature [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/creature">Creature</a>s</strong> – Every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Faction System</strong> – Pursue allegiances with over 70 factions: apes, crabs, trees, robots, and highly entropic beings, just to name a few.</li><li><strong>Richly Detailed Science Fantasy Setting</strong> – Over fifteen years of worldbuilding have led to a rich, weird, labyrinthine, one-of-a-kind storyworld, layered on top of the simulation, all for you to explore. Live and drink, friend.</li><li><strong>Tactical Gameplay</strong> – Turn-based, sandbox exploration and combat offers as many solutions as you and your mutations, implants, artifacts, and skills are creative enough to invent.</li><li><strong><a title="Genres > RPG [17,483 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> Elements</strong> – <a title="Platforms > Quest [146 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>s, NPCs, villages, historic sites; some dynamic and some handwritten, interwoven to produce a transportative RPG experience.</li><li><strong>Atmospheric Original Soundtrack</strong> – Over two hours of otherworldly music to delve to.</li></ul><p><strong>Character Creation</strong></p><p><em>Caves of Qud</em> has one of the most expressive character creators of all time.</p><p>Play the role of a mutant indigenous to the salt-spangled dunes and jungles of Qud, or play a true kin descendant from one of the few remaining eco-domes—the toxic arboreta of Ekuemekiyye, the ice-sheathed arcology of <a title="Games > Ib [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ib">Ib</a>ul, or the crustal mortars of Yawningmoon.</p><p>Build your character out of:</p><ul><li>Over 70 Mutations—outfit yourself with wings, two heads, four arms, flaming hands, teleportation, the power to clone yourself…</li><li>Dozens of cybernetic implants (and more to find as treasure)—night vision, translucent skin, carbide fists, spring-loaded ankle tendons…</li><li>24 castes and kits from across the social order of Qud and beyond Moghra’yi, the Great Salt Desert</li><li>Too overwhelmed to build a character from scratch? Choose one of nine preset characters and start your <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,441 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> right away. Then return to character creation when you are ready.</li></ul><p><strong>Modes</strong></p><p>Play one of four modes:</p><ul><li><strong>Classic</strong> – Like other traditional roguelikes, this mode has permadeath, meaning you lose your character when you die. Extremely challenging even for experts.</li><li><strong>Roleplay</strong> – Play it like an RPG. Save your progress at checkpoints located in settlements.</li><li><strong>Wander</strong> – Focus on exploration. Most creatures will not attack you, you don’t gain experience by killing, but you DO gain experience by discovering new locations and treating with legendary creatures.</li><li><strong>Daily</strong> – One chance with a fixed character and world seed. How long will you survive?</li></ul><p><strong>What’s New in Version 1.0?</strong></p><p>After nine years of continuous development and frequent updates, <em>Caves of Qud</em> has finally reached its 1.0 release! Here are some highlights of what’s been added for 1.0:</p><ul><li>The last leg of the main quest.</li><li>The new, fully graphical user interface.</li><li>Hundreds of visual and sound effects.</li><li>Lots of polish and stability.</li></ul><p><strong>History</strong></p><p><em>Caves of Qud</em> is a project of epic proportions that’s been in development for over fifteen years, since 2007. It began as the science fantasy roguelike dream of co-creators Jason Grinblat and Brian Bucklew, who released the first beta in 2010. Since then, it’s accrued a few more contributors who have enriched the project by helping to add visual effects, sound effects, an original soundtrack, a new user interface, new game systems, new lore, and half a world of content. <em>Caves of Qud</em> has grown into a wild garden of emergent narrative, where a handwritten story weaves a path through rich physical, social, and historical simulations. The result is a hybrid handcrafted and procedurally-generated world that’s alive in a way few games are.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Switch Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Caves of Qud - Announcement Trailer - Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HGueIQVO_fY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/caves-of-qud-coming-to-switch-in-q4-2025]]></content:encoded>

Up until a few days ago, this would have been a $50 discount. Not bad, but not terribly exciting either. But earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-increasing-price-of-switch-and-other-devices-in-the-us/1100-6533633/" data-ref-id="1100-6533633">Nintendo increased the prices</a> on Nintendo Switch hardware and select accessories. The new Switch console prices included all three of legacy consoles, with the Switch OLED seeing the largest increase by moving from $350 to $400. That puts the Switch OLED just $50 shy of the Switch 2. So, if you want a Switch OLED, now seems like a good time to buy one. You can also get an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHR4Y8G?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">extra pair of Joy-Con Controllers</a> for $69 (new

comes with a pair of white Joy-Con Controllers, matching white wrist straps, a black Joy-Con grip, and the upgraded dock set with an HDMI cable and AC adapter. The Switch OLED, as the name suggests, still has one thing going for it that is objectively better than the Switch 2: OLED. The 7-inch OLED panel produces a more vibrant color range with deeper blacks and better contrast.</p><p>If you want a Nintendo console in 2025, the Switch 2 is clearly the better choice, especially when thinking about the next few years. That said, if you don't want to spend $450-$500, the new Nintendo console owners will have enough games to keep them busy for years to come. The Switch library is arguably the best in Nintendo's storied history, and if you want to play in handheld mode, the Switch OLED's screen is markedly better than the regular Switch's 6.2-inch LCD display or the Switch Lite's 5.5-inch display.</p><p>At $299, the Switch OLED is selling for the regular Switch's old MSRP. The regular Switch now costs $340, while the Switch Lite jumped from $200 to $230.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                                                                                          <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller\/dp\/B01NAWKYZ0?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Nintendo Switch Pro Controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller\/dp\/B01NAWKYZ0?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$69 | New MSRP: $80</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller remains the best conventional controller for the original Switch.

		<p>PGA Tour 2K25 is kicking off Season 3 with the build up to the&nbsp;FedExCup Playoffs, but what’s this? You can now be a magician?</p>
<p><iframe title="PGA TOUR 2K25 Season 3 Trailer I 2K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZXz5V3IkMA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Well kind of. Instead of pulling rabbits out of bunkers, making golf balls come out of people’s ears or drawing endless linked handkerchiefs out of your pocket, this is a new playing archetype. The Magician is a player type that’s able to get out of sticky situations, with the featured pro players that exemplify this being Max Homa, and the “World’s Greatest Golfer” Chris McDonald.</p>
<p>Through Season 3, players that choose this archetype will have specific quests to try to complete, and then once their MyPlayer character has reached an OVR of 85, they’ll learn the Recovery shot type.</p>
<p>Regardless of your player type, Season 3 of PGA TOUR® 2K25, is all about the FedExCup playoff championships, including the FedEx St. Jude Championship at TPC Southwind and the TOUR Championship at East Lake Golf Club. There’s themed quests and ranked tour events that will take place through the season as well, and alongside new apparel and equipment in the PGA Tour Superstore, the Wear and Earn event will boost VC earnings to help you afford it.</p>

<p>There’s also the Challenges mode, which adds new skill-based challenges with rewards, new themed maps that will be added through the season, and Clubs can now be upgraded to Diamond Tier to let you improve your kit even further. A new free and premium Clubhouse Pass is also available, including the Lob Shot, which can be unlocked for free by reaching Tier 25.</p>
<p>We had a good time with this latest iteration of HB Studios’ golf game, with Nick saying, “While not striking the same feeling of EA’s golf games of old, PGA Tour 2K25 is HB Studios’ best effort yet. There’s enough here to keep you going for a while and if the PGA Tour 2K series continues on this trajectory, might just have the best take on golf games in years to come.”</p>

            <p>Oh, hello there, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/is-this-seat-taken">Is This Seat Taken?</a> The logic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzler</a> with a name that's real awkward to stick midway through a sentence has surprise-released today, August 7th, right off the back of an appearance in a Nintendo Indie World showcase.</p>
<p>When we woke up this morning, all we knew was that this game about telling people where to stick their bottoms would be coming out in August - a vague window previously announced during June's Whole Direct. Now, it be here.</p>

<p>"We are thrilled to finally release our debut game," devs Ausiàs Dalmau Roig and Sergi Pérez Crespo wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3035120/view/545616987916599655?l=english">Steam post</a>. In doing so, making official the release they'd revealed with a fresh trailer in Nintyland. "Over the past two years, we have worked hard to bring you Is This Seat Taken? We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it!"</p>
<p>As you might have gleaned from the name, the game's all about pleasing little shape-people -  who each have different wants and demands - by seating them in the appropriate spots, with the infinite whims and limited chairs in each scene forming the challenges you'll bang your head against. Well, relatively. It looks pretty chill.</p>

<p>If you want a taste of what it offers before dropping your hard earned cash, the demo our Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-stress-free-logic-puzzles-of-is-this-seat-taken-make-for-my-favourite-demo-in-ages">played earlier this year</a> is still free to grab on Is This Seat Taken?'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035120/Is_This_Seat_Taken/">Steam page</a> as of writing.</p>
<p>"I'm almost positive it's a very ancient of genre of game and/or basically an elaborate GCSE Maths test question, although I'm struggling to think of any comparisons off the top of my head," the Reuben wrote of his time with said demo, "The world's first Seatlike? No, that's terrible. Either way, its nice to be surprised by something that also feels quite traditionally designed."</p>
<p>So, there you go. It's like the video game version of a nun's robe that's secretly concealing a strap-on. Or maybe that's not quite what he meant there. You can see why when I ask Is This Seat Taken?, the answer's often a look of disdain, can't you?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/is-this-seat-taken-i-hope-not-because-the-sitting-themed-logic-puzzler-is-out-now]]></content:encoded>
