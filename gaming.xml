			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-classic-strategy-modern-upgrades/">Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</a> offers ample character customization possibilities with one of the series' most versatile Job Systems to date. However, having this many abilities can feel overwhelming, especially with Reaction Abilities, whose efficacy can be challenging to evaluate just from their in-game descriptions. As these abilities are a central part of combat, often turning a losing fight into a decisive win, the right choice can completely change how a unit performs on the battlefield.</p>



<p><strong><em>NOTE: This guide is based on Enhanced mode’s Tactician difficulty, but it applies to other difficulty settings and Classic mode as well. All screenshots were captured from the 1.0 Steam version.</em></strong></p>



<div><h2>The Best Reaction Abilities in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-shirahadori" data-level="2">Shirahadori</a></li><li><a href="#h-auto-potion" data-level="2">Auto-Potion</a></li><li><a href="#h-critical-recover-hp" data-level="2">Critical: Recover HP</a></li><li><a href="#h-mana-shield" data-level="2">Mana Shield</a></li><li><a href="#h-vanish" data-level="2">Vanish</a></li><li><a href="#h-reflexes" data-level="2">Reflexes</a></li><li><a href="#h-first-strike" data-level="2">First Strike</a></li></ul></div>



<h2 id="h-shirahadori">Shirahadori</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Shirahadori is the best Reaction Ability in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Job: Samurai</strong></li>



<li><strong>JP: 700</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Shirahadori is undoubtedly the best Reaction Ability in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles for any unit with high Bravery. This ability turns the unit's Bravery stat into its parry rate for all physical attacks, both melee and ranged, meaning that a unit with 90+ Bravery will be able to parry the vast majority of physical attacks. While it doesn't provide any defense against magic or monster attacks, Shirahadori is so good that it makes it possible for a single unit to clear out an entire map without getting damaged once.</p>



<h2 id="h-auto-potion">Auto-Potion</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Auto-Potion is just as useful as Shirahadori, depending on the situation</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Job: Chemist</strong></li>



<li><strong>JP: 400</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Auto-Potion is the ultimate restorative Reaction Ability in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, and the ability to learn for Ramza to win the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-win-the-battle-at-riovanes-castle-keep-in-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-guide/">most challenging battle in the game</a>. This ability makes it so a unit automatically uses a Potion when receiving damage, prioritizing the weaker Potions in your possession. As such, you can get a guaranteed 150 HP healed per attack for a unit with high Bravery if you discard every Potion and Hi-Potion to use X-Potions exclusively, granting this unit unparalleled survivability against every attack that doesn't take them down.</p>



<h2 id="h-critical-recover-hp">Critical: Recover HP</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Critica: Recover HP is a solid Reaction Ability for tanks like the Samurai or the Knight</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Job: Monk</strong></li>



<li><strong>JP: 500 JP</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Critical: Recover HP is not on the same level as Auto-Potion in terms of utility, but it's a pretty good ability to equip, especially for tanks with high HP like the Knight, Samurai, and Dragoon. When a unit is damaged and put in Critical condition, the ability will fully restore its HP. Unlike Auto-Potion, Critical: Recover HP has a higher degree of risk, as an attack could put the unit to low HP but not in Critical condition, so it's a little less reliable, but it's still overall very solid.</p>



<h2 id="h-mana-shield">Mana Shield</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Mana Shield requires some upkeep to be effective, but it's very good nonetheless</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Job: Time Mage</strong></li>



<li><strong>JP: 400 </strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Mana Shield is another solid Reaction Ability in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles that can give a unit excellent survivability with the proper setup. With this ability equipped, received damage will be converted from HP to MP, which is great for any unit that doesn't use spells, essentially allowing them to survive mortal 1-hit KO attacks with no drawback. If you pair this ability with the Monk's Martial Arts skill Chakra, you can restore your MP to continue using this ability once the unit's MP has been depleted without having to rely on items.</p>



<h2 id="h-vanish">Vanish</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Vanish is a great Reaction Ability to take some risks against enemies using physical attacks</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Job: Ninja</strong></li>



<li><strong>JP: 1000</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Vanish is a really good reaction ability that works best for units with excellent mobility to reduce the risks of rushing into enemy groups or for backline mages getting targeted by Archers. Upon receiving a physical attack, the unit will be granted Invisibility, making it impossible for them to be targeted by the enemy. Unfortunately, Invisibility will end as soon as the unit takes action, so Vanish isn't as versatile as some of the other best Reaction Abilities in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-reflexes">Reflexes</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Reflexes can make some units almost untouchable</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Job: Ninja</strong></li>



<li><strong>JP: 400</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Reflexes is a good Reaction Ability that works great for units with an innate high evasion rate or those equipping cloaks. Upon receiving an attack, the unit's evasion rates against physical and magical attacks are increased significantly, making it easier for them to evade attacks. Equip this ability to a Ninja wearing a cloak, and enemies will have a tough time hitting them, although there's still the small chance that attacks will land, so reliability isn't the best.</p>



<h2 id="h-first-strike">First Strike</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>First Strike can be devastating with certain character builds.</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Job: Monk</strong></li>



<li><strong>JP: 1300</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>First Strike requires more effort to learn than the other Reaction Abilities above, but with the proper setup, it can be used offensively and defensively. This ability prevents human units within standard attack range from dealing damage by preemptively attacking them. While its usage is limited to standard physical attacks, if you equip a unit with both First Strike and the Dual Wield support ability from the Ninja, you can create a unit that can obliterate physical attackers before they even get the chance to attack.</p>



<p>With these Reaction Abilities, you should have no trouble dealing with every enemy that bars your way in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In an interview published in the latest EDGE Magazine (<a href="https://www.magazinesdirect.com/us/edge-subscription/dp/39f150bb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issue 416</a>), Embark Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-ea-dice-exec-starts-embark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founder and CEO Patrick Söderlund</a> spoke about the coincidence of the studio's next game, ARC Raiders, and Battlefield 6 launching in the same month. </p>



<p>As some of you might recall, Söderlund was CEO and then Vice President and General Manager of DICE for over ten years. As such, Battlefield was a huge part of his career. The executive said Battlefield 6 looks really good, and expressed happiness that the franchise is in a good place now.</p>



<p><em>It is odd. I mean, we built Battlefield! But honestly, when I saw Battlefield 6 and what the team has done with it, I know how much time and energy has gone into it. I think it looks really good, and I’m very happy it does look good. It’s an IP and a game that deserves to be great. I want to play it. And I will play it – until the day we release ARC Raiders. And then I will play ARC Raiders instead.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-opens-pre-orders-server-slam-oct-17-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Due on October 30</a>, ARC Raiders, a PvPvE third-person extraction shooter, is admittedly very different from Battlefield 6. However, Embark's debut title, THE FINALS, has a lot more in common with Battlefield, a first-person shooter with an emphasis on environmental destructibility. </p>



<p>The game launched in December 2023 and has had its ups and downs. Fans should not worry, anyway, as Söderlund said that Embark plans to support THE FINALS for years to come.</p>



<p><em>We take a 12-month approach, reviewing on an annual basis. In December 2024, it’d been out for a year, we sat down and said, ‘We’ll give it one more year and see what happens’. And then, relatively quickly, during the spring, we saw an uplift. So, right now, I don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t continue supporting it for the next five years, to be honest.</em></p>



<p>Season 8 <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-finals-season-8-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched last month</a>, adding new weapons and improving the game's physics destruction.</p>

            <p>Delightful medieval <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pentiment">Pentiment</a> is among a number of games which have been temporarily delisted on Steam, as a result of a security vulnerability being unearthed in the Unity engine. Other games, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/among-us">Among Us</a>, have already received updates as a result of the issue.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"A security vulnerability was identified that affects games and applications built on Unity versions 2017.1 and later for Android, Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems," Unity <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/unity-platform-protection-take-immediate-action-to-protect-your-games-and-apps/1688031">revealed late on Friday</a>. "There is no evidence of any exploitation of the vulnerability, nor has there been any impact on users or customers. We have proactively provided fixes that address the vulnerability, and they are already available to all developers. The vulnerability was responsibly reported by the security researcher RyotaK, and we thank him for working with us."</p>
<p>Unity added that all versions of games made with Unity since an update in September 2017 "may contain this vulnerability". A <a href="https://unity.com/security/sept-2025-01">security advisory page</a> about the issue says such apps risk being "susceptible to an unsafe file loading and local file inclusion attack depending on the operating system, which could enable local code execution or information disclosure at the privilege level of the vulnerable application." The advisory also claims that the Unity engine itself has been provided with the fixes that developers will need.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>A security vulnerability affecting our games that use Unity has recently been identified.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;As a precaution and to keep you safe, we have temporarily removed the following titles and products from digital storefronts while we implement the necessary updates to address the issue:…</p></div>— Obsidian (@Obsidian) <a href="https://twitter.com/Obsidian/status/1974215697845923976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>As a result, publishers including <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/advisory/ADV256762">Microsoft</a> and Obsidian have opted to temporarily pull affected games from sale on Steam while they're updated. Pentiment, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-shelter">Fallout Shelter</a>, Wasteland 3, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a> are among the yanked games, and as of writing have yet to be restored to the storefront. Meanwhile, some games have ended up as more complex cases. For instance, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>'s premium edition has been pulled, but the base game remains up, because the only element of it at risk is a Unity-developed artbook.</p><p>A number of games have also remained online after receiving rapid updates, with Among Us devs Innersloth having been fittingly quick to <a href="https://x.com/AmongUsGame/status/1974232390479298663">deal with potential susness</a>, while Marvel Snap <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1974171006085554309">was rapidly patched</a>. It's worth noting that Microsoft recommend you temporarily uninstall any affected games until updates are available. The company extend that to games they no longer support, like The Elder Scrolls: Legends and 2019 versions of both Doom and Doom 2. These unsupported games have also been pulled from stores, so the need to uninstall only applies if you already own them.</p>
<p>Odds are the pulled games which haven't been sunsetted will return to Steam relatively soon with fresh updates, but it's maybe worth checking your list of current installs to make sure nothing affected's hanging around on your drives.</p>

<header><section>
<p>A little Game Boy Advance goodness?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you played Orbital Media's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/scurge_hive">Scurge:Hive</a> back when it launched in 2006, on both GBA and DS, you'll already know that it's a super-solid action effort that takes its cues from the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/metroid_fusion">Metroid: Fusion</a>, and then melds them into a tight isometric space adventure.</p>
<p>Now, Raitalaika Games has announced that its new Switch port of the game will hit the eShop on 10th October (hey, that's this week!), priced at £14.99/$14.99.</p>
<p>Scurge: Hive sees you jump into the space boots of impossibly long-haired Jenosa Armaon, as she takes on "a shocking and dangerous mission" that sees her, well, head to a mysterious space station to investigate a bizarre lifeform.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is a mission that, across its ~10-hour running time, gives you an intense blast of manga action that plays very like a Samus joint in its power suit and arm cannon upgrading. However, here you also have to factor in tricksy isometric shooting angles and the ever-present prospect of death, as Jenosa is infected and dying. Intense!</p>
<p>Here's some further info from the PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our heroine has been contracted by the Military to recover a top-secret science laboratory on an obscure distant planet. To her surprise, the cause of the disaster is a notorious virus known as “Scurge”, which has the ability to enslave all things to its destructive will. Powered by bio-protective armor, Jenosa is able to resist but not destroy “Scurge”.</p>
<p>She must use her agility, her weapons, and her wits to contain and ultimately defeat the cruel virus before it spreads.<br>
<strong><br>
Features</strong><br>
- Six different levels with boss fights<br>
- Boss Rush<br>
- Isometric platforming, combat and puzzles<br>
- Epic science-fiction narrative<br>
- Upgrade your arsenal<br>
- “Infection meter” mechanic<br>
- Save States, cheats &amp; rewind functionality</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With a delightfully chunky art style and some incredibly familiar-looking enemies in some of the screenshots, we have to admit there's something very appealing about a return trip to Confederation Research Lab 58.</p>
<p>The DS version has <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/scurge-hive/">a Metascore of 70</a>, so if you didn't play it two decades back, it's not too late.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-canceled-amd-minimum-order/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-handheld-rumored-to-have-been-canceled-over-amd%E2%80%99s-high-minimum-order-requirements.1317247/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-amd-apu/">Xbox handheld </a>has been canceled over AMD's high minimum order requirements, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>The rumors originated from the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/microsoft-we-are-actively-investing-in-our-future-first-party-consoles-and-devices-designed-engineered-and-built-by-xbox.1688818/page-4#post-270871817">NeoGAF forums</a>, where known AMD leaker Kepler L2, who accurately provided information multiple times in the past regarding AMD products, including consoles, said that, as far as they know, the handheld was canceled because AMD wanted a commitment of over 10 million units to justify the R&amp;D required to make a dedicated SoC for the console. However, with the Steam Deck selling around 5 million units, and the ASUS ROG only selling no more than 2 million units, Microsoft didn't want to take the risk.</p>



<p>Despite Kepler L2's excellent track record, we have to take the real reason behind the cancellation of the Xbox handheld with a grain of salt. As the system was never officially announced, Microsoft will unlikely release an official statement on it. However, considering <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-might-go-full-third-party-leaving-hardware-for-good-rumor/">the company's strategy seemingly shifting more towards becoming a third-party publisher</a>, it's quite possible it didn't want to commit to producing so many units for a system that may not have been a massive seller.</p>



<p>Although the Xbox handheld was never formally announced, there was no doubt that a portable system has been in the works at some point, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-will-offer-the-best-of-console-and-pc-put-together-says-microsoft-more-info-coming-in-2025/">execs teasing it multiple times in the past</a>. The system would have been part of the company's handheld strategy, which is now going to be centered around the ROG Xbox Ally launching later this month. Despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-handhelds-asus-rog-ally-x-999-usd-ally-599-usd-pre-orders/">its relatively high price</a>, the handheld system is proving to be quite popular, as<a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-already-selling-out-across-the-globe/"> it's already sold out almost everywhere</a> before its launch set for October 16.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Handheld makers are throwing paint at the wall to see what sticks. They apparently can’t<a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/618709/steam-deck-3-year-anniversary-handheld-gaming-shipments-idc"> compete with the Steam Deck</a> on price, so they’re trying<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24344308/asus-rog-flow-acer-nitro-blaze-steam-deck-giant-pc-handheld-experiment"> giant handhelds</a>,<a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/763957/abxylute-will-actually-sell-intel-and-tencents-gigantic-glasses-free-3d-handheld"> 3D handhelds</a>, more<a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/776797/xbox-ally-x-prongs-comfort-editorial"> familiar and comfortable handhelds</a>, and premium handhelds<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769776/legion-go-2-official-lenovo-new-flagship-handheld-cost"> with Switch-like detachable controllers that double as mice</a>. Many now cost $1,000 or more.</p></div><p>But boutique brand GPD has taken premium handhelds to a new extreme. With<a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gpd-win-5-the-ultimate-external-battery-handheld#/"> the GPD Win 5</a>, I can confirm it’s created the most powerful handheld ever — by sacrificing a big chunk of the portability that makes handhelds attractive to begin with. With prices ranging from $1,600 to $2,200, it’s too rich for me, but I’m beginning to wonder if cord-first handhelds might be a legit new category for the most demanding PC gamers.</p><p>The Win 5 is a 7-inch, 1080p, 120Hz VRR handheld that looks like a giant PlayStation Vita crossed with a PSP, right down to its silver rounded metal corners and transparent D-pad. Which, by the way, is one of the best D-pads I’ve ever used. But the reason you’d buy one isn’t the comfortable sculpt, it’s that it’s the first handheld with AMD’s Strix Halo chip. That’s the same one you’ll find<a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/749404/framework-desktop-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-max-385-395-plus-review"> in the Framework Desktop</a>, with the fastest integrated gaming graphics yet made.</p><p>To power that monster chip, GPD makes you either A) plug in a power cord, or B) snap on a battery “backpack.” That’s right: there’s no battery inside this handheld itself.</p><p>I was ready for that to be a dealbreaker. I half-expected I’d give up after a few days of fighting the cord or flinging around a heavy brick.</p><p>Instead, after a week and change playing with an early prototype, I’m finding it surprisingly well thought out. GPD studied the cord, leaning into its strengths to create a lighter and far more powerful handheld plugged in. I can attach the battery, then unplug the cord and still play games at high framerate; when I tire of the battery’s weight, I can run a cable between the battery and handheld and stick the battery part in a pocket or bag.</p><p>And this isn’t like sticking a normal USB-C battery into a normal portable. These tethers unlock far more power.</p><p>Even though it’s been over three years since the Steam Deck first arrived on the scene, handheld performance hasn’t evolved all that much. Rivals have put faster chips in their portables, but none play the latest games at 1080p any more competently than the Steam Deck could. Why bother with high-res screens at all?</p><p>The GPD Win 5 justifies its 1080p screen. It plays today’s games that way, not just titles from yesteryear. <em>Cyberpunk 2077, Returnal, Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> all gave me over 60fps at 1080p and ultra settings, without any AI-enhanced upscaling or frame generation techniques. And newer games like <em>Expedition 33 </em>and <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> are running at 1080p in high spec for me. Depending on the game and power mode the GPD Win 5 ran two, three, even four times faster than rivals.</p><p>Here’s how it compares to the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus and the Lenovo Legion Go 2, the newest and theoretically the most powerful retail handhelds, each running full bore. Then, you’ll see the GPD Win 5 compared to a wider range of handhelds at 720p.</p><div><h2>GPD Win 5 vs. top rivals</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>GPD Win 5</h3></th><th><h3>Lenovo Legion Go 2</h3></th><th><h3>MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 1080p ultra on battery</td><td>71</td><td>24</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>1080p ultra, plugged</td><td>79</td><td>25</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>720p low on battery</td><td>116</td><td>70</td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>720p low, plugged</td><td>138</td><td>67</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 1080p ultra on battery</td><td>92</td><td>33</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>1080p ultra, plugged</td><td>95</td><td>31</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>720p low on battery</td><td>141</td><td>106</td><td>114</td></tr><tr><td>720p low, plugged</td><td>177</td><td>108</td><td>119</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 1080p ultra on battery</td><td>76</td><td>23</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>1080p ultra, plugged</td><td>71</td><td>20</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>720p low on battery</td><td>89</td><td>46</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td>720p low, plugged</td><td>109</td><td>47</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 1080p ultra on battery</td><td>111</td><td>39</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>1080p ultra, plugged</td><td>120</td><td>40</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>720p low on battery</td><td>142</td><td>88</td><td>81</td></tr><tr><td>720p low, plugged</td><td>180</td><td>89</td><td>81</td></tr><tr><td>HZD Remastered, 1080p ultra on battery</td><td>34</td><td>24</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>1080p ultra, plugged</td><td>39</td><td>23</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>720p low on battery</td><td>45</td><td>33</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>720p low, plugged</td><td>46</td><td>36</td><td>46</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><h2>720p benchmarks</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>GPD Win 5</h3></th><th><h3>MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S (Z1E, SteamOS)</h3></th><th><h3>ROG Ally X (Z1E, Windows)</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck OLED</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>51</td><td>51</td><td>57</td><td>41</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>72</td><td>60</td><td>73</td><td>59</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>87</td><td>71</td><td>79</td><td>65</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>97</td><td>76</td><td>82</td><td>71</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in maximum</td><td>138</td><td>77</td><td>86</td><td>71</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>65</td><td>79</td><td>74</td><td>59</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>91</td><td>93</td><td>92</td><td>84</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>112</td><td>105</td><td>99</td><td>91</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>125</td><td>114</td><td>100</td><td>93</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in maximum</td><td>177</td><td>119</td><td>102</td><td>93</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>42</td><td>40</td><td>24</td><td>31</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>60</td><td>48</td><td>30</td><td>40</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>79</td><td>52</td><td>32</td><td>43</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>88</td><td>54</td><td>33</td><td>46</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in maximum</td><td>109</td><td>56</td><td>34</td><td>46</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>63</td><td>55</td><td>62</td><td>52</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>88</td><td>66</td><td>83</td><td>65</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>111</td><td>73</td><td>89</td><td>70</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>125</td><td>81</td><td>93</td><td>76</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in maximum</td><td>180</td><td>81</td><td>96</td><td>76</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>HZD Remastered, 15-watt TDP</td><td>29</td><td>31</td><td>37</td><td>28</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>34</td><td>37</td><td>47</td><td>30</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>40</td><td>42</td><td>50</td><td>28</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>42</td><td>44</td><td>52</td><td>34</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in maximum</td><td>46</td><td>46</td><td>55</td><td>34</td><td>33</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>All games tested at 720p low, save Cyberpunk 2077 in “Steam Deck” mode.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>But you need to know GPD is winning because the Strix Halo chip is guzzling down electricity.</p><p>While the Steam Deck’s processor tops out at 15-watt TDP, and beefier handhelds like the MSI Claw 8 and Legion Go 2 now do 30 or 35 watts, GPD’s Strix Halo can go all the way to 60 watts on battery. Plug in the included AC adapter, and you can play and charge while offering the chip an entire 80 watts of juice. And that’s just how much the processor uses — when you add all the other system components that keep it fed and blast pixels towards your eyes, I sometimes saw battery drain of 100 watts or more.</p><div id=":Rk9djeab96:"><p><figcaption><em>Battery backpack optional.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>With an 80 watt-hour battery I was lucky to get 45 minutes of play away from a wall when running it full bore. And that was with fans blasting so loudly there’s no way I’d be comfortable on public transit or in a car. Never mind that it weighs over 2 pounds and feels back-heavy with that battery on. (There’s an optional battery extension cable if you’d rather stuff it in a bag or cargo pants pocket.)</p><p>But you don’t need that battery at home: plug it into its (admittedly bulky) 180W AC barrel adapter, remove the battery, and suddenly it’s a spry 1.25 pounds, lighter than a Steam Deck. This handheld isn’t the worst of both worlds: you can choose.</p><p>You also don’t have to drain the battery so quickly. GPD gives you fine control over the processor’s power limits, and I was able to take the Strix Halo all the way down to a 6-watt TDP, theoretically giving me six-plus hours of battery life in the least intensive games. (That’s not bad, but not great, for a handheld with an 80 watt-hour battery.) But to actually get more speed than other handhelds, I had to use more power than them.</p><p>Let me illustrate with one last table:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power

modes to begin with — and how much more performance I often saw that way. But notice the battery drain? If I want to play three hours of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, the MSI Claw 8 will currently give me better performance than the GPD Win 5 (60fps vs. 51fps). But if I’m willing to play only two hours on a charge, it’s reversed: 87fps for the GPD Win 5 vs just 76fps for the Claw.</p><p>If I only need 45 minutes to an hour, that’s when the big benefits emerge — or when you compare to handhelds that have smaller battery packs than the GPD Win 5 and Claw 8, such as the 55Wh pack in the Legion Go S or the 49Wh pack in the Steam Deck OLED. You get lower performance per hour there because the batteries don’t stretch as far. Scroll right in my table to see those.</p><p>(You might have noticed not all games I tested used the Strix Halo’s full horsepower. <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em> mysteriously limited itself to fewer watts even when I gave it free rein, and both the Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS and the Claw 8 trounce it at 720p.).</p><p>Or, you could sidestep all of this battery discussion by simply plugging in the cord.</p><p>You should know the early prototype I’m playing with needs a lot of work, and this is <em>not</em> a review of the GPD Win 5 for that reason. <em>The Verge</em> only reviews final products. I ran into quite a few full-system-hangs, particularly when trying to change the TDP or unplug the DC barrel jack, a buggy touchscreen driver, squeaky triggers and more — which I mention because GPD is a small company that crowdfunds and sells products before it’s isolated and ironed out all those sorts of issues.<a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gpd-win-5-the-ultimate-external-battery-handheld#/"> This one’s on Indiegogo</a> right now.</p><p>Despite some initial reservations, I did have a good time<a href="https://www.theverge.com/laptop-review/657618/gpd-win-max-2-review-2024-2025-tiny-laptop-handheld-gaming"> with the GPD Win Max 2</a> and I’m finding a lot to like with this new Win 5: good D-pad, good buttons, a <em>hardware</em> (not software) mouse mode switch, a full-size USB port, it’s even got that<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/759624/china-is-about-to-launch-ssds-so-small-you-insert-them-like-a-sim-card"> fancy new SIM-card like SSD slot</a>.

            <p>Nintendo has revealed more details of how Samus's motorbike will work in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>.</p>
<p>At Nintendo's Direct in September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-gets-release-date-plus-samus-on-a-motorbike">the game's release date was finally revealed</a>, along with the new mode of transportation, which proved controversial for some.</p>
<p>Now, the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/a376fcba-6f8a-4b2e-9ff7-7958b45b4997">game's Japanese website</a> has been updated with new details. The motorbike is called "Vi-O-La" and is used to explore expanses across the planet Byrus (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-reveals-more-details-about-samuss-metroid-prime-4-motorbike/">VGC</a>).</p>

<p>It seems the motorbike can only be ridden in specific areas, with players returning to Samus's point of view afterwards - we saw this in the release date trailer.</p>
<p>While riding the motorbike, Samus can boost and power slide to deflect enemies and crush ores, as well as increase speed.</p>
<p>She can also fire projectiles, locking on to up to five enemies. The projectiles return to Samus akin to a boomerang.</p>
<p>The motorbike will also be available as an amiibo.</p>
<p>It's not much to go on yet, but Metroid fans are keen to glean more information ahead of the game's release on 4th December.</p>
<p>The motorbike section of the trailer certainly stood out for providing something novel among otherwise standard <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime">Metroid Prime</a> gameplay, but also feels particularly flashy and un-Metroid. The games are known for their slow exploration, so the inclusion of a motorbike is certainly a surprise.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-will-give-samus-psychic-powers">Samus will also have psychic powers</a>, used to operate mechanisms, open doors, and control the trajectory of beams. Thrilling.</p>

According to the official release, it will be a "fully real-time simulation with thousands of soldiers fighting simultaneously" utilizing "next-gen multi-threaded AI." </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/kingmakers-official-announcement-trailer"><u>Kingmakers' announcement trailer</u></a> was a viral hit, garnering hundreds of thousands of views on IGN and other channels, with more than a few fans comparing it to Gate, an anime that features a similar mix of modern warfare and medieval fantasy.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While many fans <a href="https://x.com/PlanBeeApiary/status/1974187263958659327" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accepted</a> the news, some were <a href="https://x.com/khaliltooshort/status/1974157925624279376" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>disappointed about the late notice</u></a>, especially as the delay came less than a week before the scheduled release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Why is Kingmakers being delayed? In short, it's an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game, and we don't want to cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out the door earlier," the company explained. "Our goal, from the start, has been to create something that's nothing like anything else on the market, in terms of gameplay, scale, scope, and interactivity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With Kingmakers, we set out to push the Unreal Engine 4 codebase to its absolute limits, while still providing true 60fps to mid-range PCs, without the need for fake frames. We are an 80% engineering team, who got into this business to push technological barriers."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement went on to explain that the shooter boasts "tens of thousands of soldiers, each with AI and pathfinding that rivals what you'd expect from a AAA person shooter." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"When you walk away from a battle, it continues to play out," it added. "Nothing is faked. We have giant six story castles where every room can be entered and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed. When you build a Lumbermill, it's a real place that can be entered or, in an enemy invasion, turned into a combat area.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Every mission takes place in a giant, massive map that each player on the server is free to explore – with or without their own personal army of thousands," Redemption added. "We set out to do all of this, with full drop-in/drop-out four-player multiplayer support, and we have. We just need a little bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it. So that is what we are doing now. We're making sure everyone who buys the game is enthralled and feels like their money was well spent. We want this to be the case whether you have a top-of-the-line rig or a PC that's seen better days."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Redemption Road did not provide a revised release date, but did promise to share a half-hour-long "deepdive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">OpenAI has vowed to give copyright holders “more granular control” over character generation after its Sora 2 app produced a flood of videos that depicted copyrighted characters — including those owned by Nintendo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the launch of Sora 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-dont-sue-me-sora-2-app-opens-floodgates-to-ai-videos-of-pikachu-mario-and-more">social media was awash with videos featuring licensed characters, such as Mario, Pikachu, and an array of other <u>Pokémon</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">“The Dark Knight” <a href="https://t.co/2Hk0vlJBKJ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2Hk0vlJBKJ</a></p>— Justine Moore (@venturetwins) <a href="https://twitter.com/venturetwins/status/1973405656658092093?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 1, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">According to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-new-sora-video-generator-to-require-copyright-holders-to-opt-out-071d8b2a" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Wall Street Journal</u></a> report published ahead of the launch of Sora 2, OpenAI had already begun contacting movie studios and other intellectual property owners to offer them the chance to retroactively opt out of their fictional characters being available within the app's AI videos. That differed from the approach OpenAI said it would take to using the likeness of a recognizable public figure, which required that person to opt in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, on Saturday, <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/sora-update-number-1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a blog post</a> that the company had been “taking feedback” from users, rights holders and other groups, and would make changes as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He said rights holders would be given more “granular control” over the generation of characters, similar to how people can opt in to share their own likeness in the app, but with “additional controls.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are hearing from a lot of rightsholders who are very excited for this new kind of ‘interactive fan fiction’ and think this new kind of engagement will accrue a lot of value to them, but want the ability to specify how their characters can be used (including not at all).”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/06/gettyimages-2236544077-1759743013545.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called Sora 2 videos using copyrighted characters "interactive fan fiction." Photo by: Kyle Grillot/Bloomberg via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Altman said OpenAI would “let rightsholders decide how to proceed” and that there would be some “edge cases of generations” that get through the platform’s guardrails that should not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He said the company would also “have to somehow make money” from video generation, and already the platform was seeing people generating much more than expected per user. He said this could mean payment to rights holders who grant permission for their characters to be generated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The exact model will take some trial and error to figure out, but we plan to start very soon,” Altman said. “Our hope is that the new kind of engagement is even more valuable than the revenue share, but of course we want both to be valuable.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added there would be a high rate of change, similar to the early ChatGPT days, and there would be “some good decisions and some missteps.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tellingly, Altman pointed out the situation in Japan, saying: “In particular, we'd like to acknowledge the remarkable creative output of Japan — we are struck by how deep the connection between users and Japanese content is!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Altman’s statement comes as Nintendo took the unusual step of issuing an official statement seemingly in response to comments from Satoshi Asano, a member of Japan’s House of Representatives. In a deleted social media post he subsequently apologized for, Asano accused Nintendo of “avoiding using generative AI to protect its IP” and "engaging in lobbying activities with the government" over the increased use of generative AI in the gaming industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo denied this, but did warn it would take “necessary actions against infringement of our intellectual property rights.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Contrary to recent discussions on the internet, Nintendo has not had any contact with the Japanese government about generative AI,” <a href="https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1974716195246088220" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo said</a>. “Whether generative AI is involved or not, we will continue to take necessary actions against infringement of our intellectual property rights.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One Sora 2 video viewed by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/04/sora-openai-video-app.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a> showed Sam Altman standing in a field with several Pokémon characters, where he says: “I hope Nintendo doesn’t sue us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As CNBC pointed out, Disney and Universal have sued the AI image creator Midjourney, alleging that the company improperly used and distributed AI-generated characters from their movies. Disney also sent a cease and desist letter to Character.AI, warning the startup to stop using its copyrighted characters without authorization.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of the videos that people are going to generate of these cartoon characters are going to infringe copyright,” Mark Lemley, a professor at Stanford Law School, told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/04/sora-openai-video-app.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a>. “OpenAI is opening itself up to quite a lot of copyright lawsuits by doing this.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Pokémon Spin-off Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN last week, business lawyer and creator of the Virtual Legality podcast Richard Hoeg said the legality of OpenAI’s actions wasn't yet clear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In short, we don't have a definitive answer yet," he said. "There are indications in some quarters that training on protected materials is likely going to be deemed legal so long as the materials themselves were acquired for some lawful purpose (and not pirated). But on the output side, the Disney/Dreamworks lawsuit makes some good arguments for why/how the law should expect these platforms to police prompts for infringing requests, especially if they are already policing for something else (porn, bigotry, etc.). But all of those are still just arguments, not settled law.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hoeg continued: "The law moves slowly, far slower than technology, which is why you see these tech companies racing ahead of it a bit. My best guess is that OpenAI is probably going to be okay long term on the training sets they used (assuming they weren't pirated), and that the 'opt out of training' option therefore won't do much of anything. Where they really need to concern themselves is on the output side and/or if they are marketing their software's abilities with protected content themselves."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Nintendo and The Pokémon Company for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, the famously litigious The Pokémon Company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this">formally responded to the use of Pokémon TV hero Ash Ketchum and the series' theme tune by the Department of Homeland Security</a>, as part of a video showing people being arrested and handcuffed by law enforcement agents. "Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content," a spokesperson told IGN, "and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

EA's first-person shooter has an October 10 release date, with pre-loads available now across all platforms except the Epic Games Store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 1, Battlefield 6's first major free update, kicks off on October 28 and releases in three phases: Rogue Ops, which brings new map Blackwell Fields, new weapons, and a new 4v4 mode called Strikepoint; California Resistance, which introduces new SoCal map Eastwood and a 8v8 mode called Sabotage — that's coming on November 18; and the final phase of the first season, Winter Offensive, which rolls out on December 9. That includes "seasonal map" Empire State and an unannounced themed event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is no early access for players buying the more expensive editions, so Battlefield 6 unlocks for all at the same time across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S. Steam players will not need to use EA App to play Battlefield 6 but will need an EA account. Those who purchased Battlefield 6 via the Epic Games Store will need EA App and an EA account to play.

<p>On the Nintendo side of things, the catchily-titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> made its chart debut at third, pushing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> down into fourth. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_tactics_the_ivalice_chronicles">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a> also got off to a decent start, emerging at fifth, with 55% of the console split coming from Switch sales. Oh yes, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_party">LEGO Party</a> cropped up at 26th.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ws0BZJ-l_eg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed626890lmqkhw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>None of these newbies were enough to trouble the top spot, mind you, with Sucker Punch's latest PS5 joint, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ghost_of_yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>, hitting the ground running in its first week. Even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA SPORTS FC 26</a> got out of the way for this one, so you know it's serious! Interestingly, we still don't have the platform breakdowns for FC 26 between Switch 1 and 2, so it's unclear how the latest baller is selling on the new hardware.</p>
<p>Here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a> beta cheaters were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/water-is-wet-the-sky-is-blue-and-call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-beta-has-cheaters">inevitable and expected</a>, with Activision hinting that they were intentionally prepping their big anti-cheat guns prior to early access kicking off. Now the beta's first weekend's passed, the publishers' anti-cheat enforcers Team Ricochet have posted an update addressing the cheating situation, claiming that their efforts thus far have seen a lot of success.</p>
<p>Seriously, they go as far as openly declaring that cheat sellers are "feeling the heat", which is a massive missed opportunity to use the phrase '<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">quaking in their unsecured boots</a>', but we can't have everything.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"You may have seen clips of cheaters in the Black Ops 7 Beta," Activision's post read. "We had already actioned on most of those accounts before they hit social media. We’re watching closely, acting in real time, and learning from every attempt."</p>
<p>Cue the whipping out of some stats which the developers say apply to the beta's opening two days. "97% of cheaters were stopped within 30 minutes of their first sign-in," and "fewer than 1% of cheating attempts reached a match, and those who did were removed within minutes." "And this is just the beginning," Activision wrote. "When launch arrives, every layer of protection will be in full force, and Ricochet Anti-Cheat’s defenses will only grow stronger."</p><div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>They're impressive stats to tout, but they do leave some question marks. Without the full numbers in terms of cheating instances detected and dealt with, it's tough to say how much success this symbolises. There's also the matter of any numbers only taking account instances of cheating Team Ricochet managed to detect, leaving the potential for attempts that may have gone totally undetected to have slipped through the cracks.</p>
<p>Activision also went beyond just saying their beta anti-cheat efforts have been successful thus far. "Major cheat providers are now labeling their tools 'unusable' or 'detected'," they wrote further on in the post. "Resellers are acknowledging they have no reliable products to offer for Black Ops 7. We’re not only disabling their cheats, but also their illegal businesses as well. We have now directly contributed to the closure of over 40 cheat developers and resellers since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Black Ops 6</a> launched. Vendors sharing clips during Beta were already on our radar and we will pursue them beyond in-game enforcement."</p>
<p>The fight against cheating is an industry-wide challenge and we’re committed to leading the charge," they concluded. "We continue to bring new systems online during Beta, fine-tuning our protections, responding faster and gaining deeper insights." It's fighting talk and we'll have to see whether Black Ops 7's full release brings more hoops for regular players to jump through as has happened with mandatory secure boot.</p>
<p>Black Ops 7's beta runs until October 8th, so odds are Activision will be back to share more stats about their anti-cheat efforts across the full duration of early access then.</p>

			<p>Almost three years on from its original release, the ultimate version of Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless is coming to the Switch 2, bringing with it all of the previous paid DLC, alongside a new story “The Nethertime Support Force”, new gameplay features (the ability to remove stat caps) and free access to the previously MC-exclusive Hell Mode. Considering that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/26/disgaea-7-review-vows-of-the-virtueless/">we awarded the base game a stunning 9/10</a>, surely that makes Disgaea 7 Complete an even more essential purchase for Switch 2 owners?</p>
<p><iframe title="Disgaea 7 Complete – Release Date Announcement – Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aSkaI-CTl0k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But what even is Disgaea? Simply put, it’s a quirky tactical RPG along the lines of a Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem, but with everything turned up to 11. Everything comes with flashy animations, everyone speaks by shouting, the story is fast-paced nonsense and it’s all rather easy to get swept up in what’s going on.</p>


<p>Disgaea 7 is a wild ride on the demon side. Why demons? Because everyone you come across in this hell-adjacent Netherworld is a demon. Your main characters are Fuji, a self-centred demon who wants power and is allergic to empathy, and Pirilika, a spoiled rich kid on holiday looking for bushido in the world of Hinamoto.&nbsp;As you might expect, there’s no bushido, there’s no warriors, just a bunch of poor and pissed off demons. Chaos (and plenty of tactical battles) ensues.</p>


<p>The problem is that this combat is both incredibly deep and utterly impenetrable to new players, with tutorial screens frequently being 12–15 pages long. As someone that reads and writes for a living, my god was I getting bored of the endless, poorly formatted tutorial pages, with sentences and paragraphs splitting over multiple screens. At a base level, the combat is pretty fun, but when you start adding in the more complicated mechanics, the bajillion classes which aren’t explained, the lack of an ability to optimise equipment and no video or playable tutorials to explain anything that’s going on, you rapidly run into problems.</p>
<p>If you’re new to the franchise, you’ll find it’s like the move Titanic, in that it starts getting good around 3 hours in. After this point, you should have wrapped your head around the game and its mechanics, but it’s up to you if you want to commit to that level of time investment.</p>

<p>Putting new players to one side, there’s a lot here for franchise veterans to love, including all of the old DLC and a brand new post-game chapter letting you venture into the Netherworlds of past Disgaea games. On top of this, there’s a new playable character and, once you unlock it in the Dark Assembly, uncapped stats to help you build your party to utter (and absurd) perfection.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the Dark Assembly will also let you unlock Hell Mode for all of your characters — something previously limited to the main characters — once you clear the main story. This obviously doesn’t affect the gameplay for the vast majority of the game, but it’s a nice post-game quality of life upgrade.</p>

<p>And for those of you who are simply masochists, there’s an all-new superboss to look forward to. Remember those end-game stat cap removals we just spoke about? They’re going to be essential if you want to stand a chance here.</p>

	<div id="gp-summary">
		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Disgaea 7 Complete clearly is the ultimate version of Vows of the Virtueless. The story is as quirky and fun as ever, and the bonus content is an absolute must for die-hard fans. Being able to play it on the Switch 2 on the go is also great, with the game looking and feeling fantastic in both handheld and docked mode. The only knock is the uphill struggle for newcomers with reams of tiresome tutorials –&nbsp;hopefully NIS will have figured out by the time Disgaea 8 rolls around.	</p></div>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>: Valley of Memory - a free major update coming to the Ubisoft Blockbuster - has been officially teased via a new cinematic trailer ahead of a full reveal later today.</p>
<p>According to the teaser video description, that full reveal will arrive at 9AM PT / 12PM ET / 5PM BST / 6PM CEST.</p>
<p>The Valley of Memory DLC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-to-get-surprise-free-story-dlc-later-this-year">first announced by Ubisoft in August</a>, will be set in the ancient Arabian city of AlUla within Saudi Arabia. The DLC will include a new story chapter, new missions, and a variety of gameplay improvements.</p>

<p>The DLC was reportedly developed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-claiming-its-signed-a-saudi-deal-for-fresh-assassins-creed-mirage-content">thanks to a deal between Ubisoft and the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund</a>, the national wealth fund of Saudi Arabia. Ubisoft declined to comment when asked by Eurogamer back in January.</p>
<p>The Public Investment Fund is part of Saudi Arabia's ongoing attempt to diversify income for the oil-rich nation, as well as a dedicated push to improve its global image. Saudi Arabia has been criticised heavily for its <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/">history of human rights abuses</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">and blamed for the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi</a>.</p>
<p>Only last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund was part of a three-way bid to turn Electronic Arts private for $55bn.</a> If approved, the American games industry giant will be saddled with $20bn in debt in 2027.</p>

            <p>The former chair of the FTC has commented on Microsoft's decision last week to raise Xbox Game Pass prices, claiming the company has "become too-big-to-care".</p>
<p>Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">$68.7bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a> was the biggest company buyout in video game history, but was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftc-suing-to-block-microsofts-69bn-activision-blizzard-acquisition">heavily opposed by America's Federal Trade Commission</a>, which claimed the deal would "harm competition in multiple dynamic and fast-growing gaming markets".</p>
<p>Lina Khan was chair of the FTC at the time of this opposition, and has now commented on social media, responding to a post charting the rising cost of Game Pass despite Microsoft claiming in 2023 subscription prices would not increase as a result of the merger.</p>

<p>"Microsoft's acquisition of Activision has been followed by significant price hikes and layoffs, harming both gamers and developers," said Khan.</p>
<p>"As we've seen across sectors, increasing market consolidation and increasing prices often go hand-in-hand.</p>
<p>"As dominant firms become too-big-to-care, they can make things worse for their customers without having to worry about the consequences."</p>

<p>After appeals following the acquisition in October 2023, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftc-finally-drops-appeal-against-microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard">FTC finally dropped its case against Microsoft</a> in May of this year.</p>
<p>Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith at the time called the decision "a victory for players across the country and for common sense in Washington, DC".</p>
<p>Yet last week's price hike for Game Pass certainly doesn't feel like a victory for players, with many of the FTC's resulting fears from the acquisition now seemingly coming true, as Khan has pointed out.</p>
<p>Khan <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-ftc-chair-khan-resign-commission-coming-weeks-2025-01-20/">resigned from her position at the FTC</a> at the start of 2025.</p>
<p>Microsoft's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">increase the price of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> by 50 percent comes despite record revenue from subscriptions last year, and follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-xbox-fans-hit-with-another-hardware-price-hike-just-four-months-after-the-last-increase">hardware price increase in the US</a>.</p>
<p>Since the increase was announced, some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-xbox-game-pass-price-hike-is-it-time-to-cancel-and-start-buying-games-again">players are now choosing to cancel their Game Pass subscriptions</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-get-two-masters-dlc-early-2026/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ninja-gaiden-4-to-get-%E2%80%98the-two-masters%E2%80%99-dlc-in-early-2026.1317172/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>KOEI TECMO's Team Ninja is about to launch NINJA GAIDEN 4 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-october-release-date-announced-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to be available on October 21</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X), but their work doesn't stop there, given that there is a DLC titled 'The Two Masters' due to be released early next year.</p>



<p>Game Director Masakazu Hirayama talked about this DLC <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIGrGeUYAeA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the latest episode of the Official Xbox Podcast</a>, which was recorded at Tokyo Game Show 2025. </p>



<p><em>The Two Masters DLC, which will be available in early 2026, contains new weapons for Yakumo and Ryu. You can see from the key visual that Yakumo's new weapon captures his personality and his approach to combat with his expressive abilities. Whereas Ryu’s weapon has a more precise look to it and will allow you to perform powerful and high-speed abilities. Each of these weapons will have its own distinct qualities and a plethora of mechanics for NINJA GAIDEN 4 players to dig into. So, we invite players to look forward to it.<br>In addition to these weapons, there's also going to be new story content included in the Two Masters DLC, and the story content takes place after the events of the base game and unfolds from the perspective of both of these characters. In addition to the story content, there will also be post-game challenge content that exists separately from the Ninja Trials that are in the base game. So there is a lot of content for players to dig into.</em></p>



<p>The Two Masters DLC can be accessed by purchasing NINJA GAIDEN 4 Deluxe Edition or the Deluxe Edition Upgrade. The Deluxe Edition costs $20 more than the base edition.</p>



<p>The base game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-to-last-15-20-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will last between 15 and 20 hours</a>, but the DLC will undoubtedly increase the time players can spend in the action game. Team Ninja did not quantify by how much, though.</p>

<figure data-uuid="089d0b230b630"><a title="Silent Hill 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/089d0b230b630/silent-hill-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Konami</em></figcaption></figure><p>When the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake launched on <strong>8th October 2024</strong>, it was made clear that it would only be exclusive to the PS5 and PC for one year.</p>
<p>So now that we're approaching its first anniversary, the possibility of a Switch 2 release has grown after empty slots for two additional platforms have been discovered on the <a href="https://www.blooberteam.com/silent-hill-2">official website</a> by <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1974879946830131421">Rebs Gaming</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/10/silent-hill-2s-ps5-console-exclusivity-is-coming-to-an-end">Push Square</a>).</p>
<p>There's no clear indication as to which platforms will be added, but it's reasonable to assume at this point that it'll be the Xbox Series X|S and the Switch 2 (though a Linux/MacOS release may also be on the cards). It's also likely that an announcement will be made imminently as the exclusivity window officially ends this Wednesday.</p>

<p>Silent Hill 2 launched to critical acclaim, marking a significant shift in perception toward developer Bloober Team, which had previously worked on more divisive titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/medium_-_cloud_version">The Medium</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blair_witch">Blair Witch</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/layers_of_fear_legacy">Layers of Fear</a>.</p>
<p>The studio has most recently launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> on consoles and PC, with the Switch 2 version proving to be a solid option with stellar visuals and reasonable performance. Our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">7/10 review</a> highlighted it as a "celebration of survival horror", but noted that it did little that could be deemed truly original.</p>
<p>Bloober Team is now currently working once again with Konami on a remake of the original Silent Hill.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-just-cut-almost-2000-from-its-elitebook-laptop-packing-intel-core-ultra-7-32gb-ddr5-ram-and-1tb-ssd-2000631866</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hp-just-cut-almost-2000-from-its-elitebook-laptop-packing-intel-core-ultra-7-32gb-ddr5-ram-and-1tb-ssd.1317124/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>HP typically keeps discounts modest on its official website to protect its brand positioning and margins. But sometimes, the company unleashes aggressive promotions through Amazon that catch everyone off guard. This <em>Prime Big Deal Day</em> is one of those rare moments, with deals that don’t happen under normal circumstances. The HP EliteBook 6 G1i business laptop,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4506/"> equipped with an Intel 12-core Ultra 7 255U processor, 32GB DDR5 RAM, and a 1TB PCIe SSD, has dropped to $1,149 from $2,999.</a> That’s a 62% reduction and it’s slashing nearly $1,850 off the price. This isn’t just a modest trim on an overinflated MSRP: This is a legitimate business-class machine with enterprise-grade specs hitting a price point that makes it competitive with mid-range consumer laptops.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4506/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AI-Powered Performance That Matters Most</h2>
<p>The Intel Core Ultra 7 255U processor is <strong>Intel’s newest architecture purpose-built for AI workloads</strong>. This 12-core processor sports 14 threads and up to 5.2 GHz in Intel Turbo Boost Technology, supported by 12MB of L3 cache. Here, the distinguishing factor is the onboard NPU which performs the work of doing AI tasks locally without burdening the processor or sending data to the cloud. This onboard AI accelerator enables features such as Microsoft Copilot, which is able to summarize documents, rewrite text, make contextual recommendations and keep you organized without the lag and attendant privacy issues of cloud computing.</p>



<p>The 16-inch screen is WUXGA resolution at 1920×1200 so you get additional vertical screen real estate versus typical 1920×1080 panels. You notice more in height when editing documents or in coding when you need to see more content and less scrolling. The UWVA IPS panel provides broad viewing angles and precise color rendition and the anti-glare treatment minimizes eye strain from long use. At 400 nits, the screen is still readable in brightly lit offices or in the vicinity of windows. Low Blue Light inhibits harmful wavelengths that interfere with sleep cycle for late-night work sessions to put less strain on eyes and circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>32GB of DDR5 RAM allows you to keep dozens of web pages and virtual machines running at the same time without pause. DDR5 is faster in its data transmission and more effective in power compared to DDR4 and that means snappier response and more life from your battery. With the 1TB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD, you have more than sufficient capacity for your files and media and fast read speeds that make boot times and transitions of files virtually instantaneous.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi 6E goes beyond the 6GHz frequency, giving you faster speeds and less congestion compared to regular Wi-Fi 6. This is significant in busy office spaces where dozens of devices are all fighting for bandwidth. Bluetooth 5.3 gives good connections for wireless peripherals with better range and lower power usage. Port selection includes two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports that support 40Gbps data transfer, USB Power Delivery 3.0 for power, and DisplayPort 2.1 for connecting high-res external displays. You also get two USB Type-A ports at 5Gbps for older devices, HDMI 2.1 for simple display connections and an RJ-45 Ethernet port for direct network connections.</p>
<p>For $1,149, this is business-class build quality made affordable for more than corporate buying departments.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EcoFlow Delta 2 Power Station Is Now Selling for Pennies, With 1800W AC and 100W USB-C Ports]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ecoflow-delta-2-power-station-is-now-selling-for-pennies-with-1800w-ac-and-100w-usb-c-ports-2000631861</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ecoflow-delta-2-power-station-is-now-selling-for-pennies-with-1800w-ac-and-100w-usb-c-ports.1317115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Picture this: the power goes out during a storm and your refrigerator starts warming up while you’re scrambling for flashlights. Or you’re deep into a camping trip and your phone dies just when you need to check trail maps. Maybe you’re working remotely from an RV and your laptop battery hits 5% with two hours of work left.</p>
<p>If you’ve found yourself in any of these situations, you know the anxiety of losing power at the worst possible moment. A portable power station eliminates that stress entirely. Ecoflow has established itself as the global leader in portable power solutions <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/">and right now the Delta 2 (1800W AC output, 100W USB-C charger) is available for $429, down from $699, representing a 39% discount for Prime Big Deal Day</a>. The newer Delta 3 offers marginally more power but costs nearly twice as much which makes the Delta 2 the smarter choice for most people.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Lightning-Speed Charging That Never Disappoints</h2>
<p>The Delta 2 recharges seven times faster than other portable power stations. Simply plug it in via a wall socket and you’re <strong>going from dead to 80% charged in only 50 minutes</strong>, and full charge in 80 minutes. This kind of fast-charging changes the dynamics of the use of the device. When you’re in the middle of a power blackout, you can rapidly charge it when, for instance, electricity is back for just minutes and use that stored power for hours afterwards.</p>
<p>The <strong>1800W AC output is powerful enough to power virtually any household appliance</strong> or electric tool. You’ll have the ability to power up a full-sized fridge, microwave, coffee machine, power drill or even space heater. There are <strong>15 diverse outlets for all types of connections</strong> that you’ll ever want: household AC prongs, USB-A connections, a<strong> 100W USB-C fast-charge connection</strong> for notebooks and tablets, and an automobile outlet for automobile-engineered equipment. Its inclusivity includes the <strong>use of multiple devices simultaneously</strong> without adapters or converters.</p>



<p>The 1024Wh LiFePO4 battery chemistry is the key technological leap forward: LFP batteries endure orders of magnitude more cycles than typical lithium-ion cells and this model is rated for more than 3000 recharges. Realistically, that’s equivalent to being able to completely <strong>charge and discharge the Delta 2 more than 3000 times before it drops to 80% of its original storage capacity</strong>.</p>
<p>Worth special mention is the expandable capacity: The base model itself only has 1kWh of storage but you can add on additional battery modules for up to 3kWh of usable capacity. This expandable aspect lets you begin with just the base model and upgrade when you want, rather than buying an oversized system to start with. For small camping or for emergency backup, 1kWh is enough for the majority of applications.</p>
<p>At $429, this package puts serious portable power within reach for Prime Day. Thanks Amazon!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-lego-city-advent-calendar-2025-sees-a-third-price-cut-now-at-its-lowest-ever-on-amazon-2000631849</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Advent calendars have become essential for building holiday excitement with kids, but finding one that offers genuine value beyond cheap chocolates or throwaway trinkets is harder than you’d think. LEGO’s approach solves this problem by delivering 24 actual building surprises that kids can play with long after December ends.</p>
<p>Amazon initially offered a modest discount when the LEGO City Advent Calendar 2025 launched in September, followed by another price drop last week. Now, for Prime Big Deal Day, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4349/">the retailer has slashed the price even further to $20, down from $34</a>. This <strong>40% discount</strong> represents a record low that you won’t see again before the holidays.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4349/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Twenty-Four Days of Building Joy</h2>
<p>The LEGO City Advent Calendar<strong> turns the countdown to Christmas itself into a daily building challenge</strong>. Behind each of the 24 doors is a surprise for kids aged five and older, from minifigures to mini builds and holiday accessories. There’s even <strong>Santa and Mrs. Claus minifigures</strong>, perennial crowd-pleasers, and costumed characters in irreverent dress such as polar bear, reindeer, and holiday tree.</p>



<p>Each surprise includes building instructions printed right in the calendar window itself so there is never any need for instructional booklets or digital apps separately. This considerate touch makes it ideal for little builders who are just beginning their LEGO adventures or for hectic mornings when you do not wish to go searching for instructions. Children can pull their door, read right off just what they must build and finish their surprise of the day all on their own before schooltime.</p>
<p>The included playmat opens up to <strong>provide a holiday-themed backdrop for all the builds</strong>. This turns the calendar from its constituent part list into an integrated play scene in which children may host holiday parties and concoct seasonal stories. The playmat puts the builds in context and invites creative storytelling in addition to building the parts. Your child may position the minifigures, place the mini builds, and develop stories that change over the month as more elements arrive in the scene.</p>
<p><strong>Each of the 186 elements</strong> in this set is designed to serve the purpose of facilitating imaginative storytelling. Mini builds could consist of holiday ornaments, wintery accessories or seasonal buildings that populate the LEGO City landscape. Together, these pieces accumulate to form an entire wintertime celebration scene once Christmas is near. Its real value, however, is that all of these elements all remain part of the LEGO City sets once December is finished. Children at that point may use these minifigures and accessories in their own LEGO inventory, beyond just the advent calendar itself.</p>
<p>For just $20 in this Prime Big Deal Day deal, you’re getting <strong>186 LEGO pieces and 24 days of fun for just under a dollar each surprise</strong>. These all-time-low prices won’t linger once demand climbs closer to the holidays and inventory is gone.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-hits-meta-hard-the-quest-3s-vr-bundle-just-got-suddenly-a-lot-cheaper-2000631843</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-hits-meta-hard-the-quest-3s-vr-bundle-just-got-suddenly-a-lot-cheaper.1317097/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Virtual reality is slowly carving out its place in the tech world, but let’s be honest: it’s still a niche market. If you’re curious about VR and mixed reality, dropping $4,000 on an Apple Vision Pro that has limited content and unclear use cases doesn’t make much sense. Your better bet is going with the company that’s been all-in on VR from the beginning: Meta.</p>
<p>The <strong>Quest 3S represents the most affordable entry point into Meta’s VR ecosystem</strong>, and for Prime Big Deal Day, Amazon is offering an exclusive <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4500/">Cardboard Hero Bundle at $299: This package includes the headset plus the Handiwork Helmet, Handiwork Armor, and 1,000 shiny rocks for Gorilla Tag, adding $45 worth of in-game content to sweeten the deal</a> +<strong> three months of Meta Horizon Plus</strong> at no cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4500/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mixed Reality That Actually Makes Sense</h2>
<p>The Quest 3S bridges the gap between pure virtual reality and the real world through <strong>mixed reality capabilities</strong>. This means you can blend digital objects into your actual environment, playing games where virtual characters interact with your furniture or working on multiple virtual screens while still seeing your room. The headset uses <strong>passthrough cameras to show you your surroundings in high-definition resolution</strong>, which makes the experience feel natural rather than disorienting. You can dial up the immersion and go full VR when you want complete escapism, or keep your environment visible when you need to stay aware of your surroundings.</p>



<p>Meta also fitted the Quest 3S with the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 platform which provides twice the Quest 2’s graphics performance. This means less stuttering in highly demanding games and <strong>sharper in-game detail</strong> that enhances the realism of virtual worlds. Better processing power also allows smoother operation of experiences that would stutter or lag in older headsets for a better immersion even in long gaming sessions or highly detailed virtual worlds.</p>
<p>The home theater-like effect in itself is worth thepurchase for some users. You get to make whatever room is available your own in-home cinema by darkening your space and watching content on a giant and colorful virtual screen. You’re essentially <strong>getting a 100-inch TV that only exists in your headset</strong>. You plug in your USB-C headphones for the 3D-like sounds, or use your regular 3.5mm headphones with your USB-C adapter (available separately) and this is perfect for watching movies.</p>



<p>Physical activities feel comfortable due to the wireless freedom and compact nature: Virtual exercises put your heart rate up with no cables limiting your mobility, and full-body games make your whole living room your playground. <em>Touch Plus Controllers</em> deliver realistic feedback and precise pinch and tilt for games involving fine motor controls and hand tracking enables you to move menus and interact with content with your hands alone.</p>
<p><strong>Meta included strong parental controls</strong> within the system so that you could control screen time, see daily use, and assign permissions for your household members. You could also initiate multiple user profiles and sharing accounts for content, so it is simple for all household members to have their own customized experience. Accounts for users who are 10 years and older are turned on and special safety recommendations are on hand online.</p>
<p>Your membership entitles <strong>you to three months of Meta Horizon Plus at no cost</strong>&nbsp;which entitles you to immediate access to a seasonal game library, monthly content drops, and special experiences. You get to test the library in VR for free without additional purchases right away, subject only to eligibility and auto-renewing terms.<br>
At just $299 for the special bundle, the Quest 3S is an affordable portal to VR and mixed reality at just a tiny fraction of the price of competition in headsets.</p>

              <p>The high-end noise-canceling headphone market is more crowded than, say, Times Square during New Year’s Eve celebrations. Apple, Bose, Sonos, Sennheiser, and Sony are all fighting for your attention, each claiming their model is the best. Here’s the reality: <strong>over the past five years, the improvements in high-end ANC headphones have been incremental at best</strong>. A few tweaks here, minor updates there, but nothing revolutionary.</p>
<p>That means buying the latest model doesn’t make sense, especially when a slightly older flagship delivers nearly identical performance at a fraction of the cost. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/">Sony’s WH-1000XM4 is on sale for $228, down from $348, during Prime Big Deal Day</a>. To put that in perspective, these headphones cost <strong>almost three times less than Apple’s AirPods Max</strong> while delivering similar performance.</p>

<h2>Noise Cancellation that Truly Works in the Real World</h2>
<p>The Sony 1000XM4 incorporates <strong>Sony’s Dual Noise Sensor</strong> tech which employs microphones both externally and internally in each earcup to absorb ambient noise. The earcups then create an inverse sound wave to eliminate the noise before it hits your eardrums. Unlike less expensive alternatives, this dual-sensor method is the distinguishing characteristic of high-end ANC. And Adaptive Sound Control takes it one better and adjusts the level of noise cancellation according to your activity and location.</p>



<p>Battery life is also where the WH-1000XM4 is way better than many competitors: You’re <strong>talking up to 30 hours of playback with the ANC in use</strong>&nbsp;so you could use these ‘phones for an entire week at the workplace and never have to recharge them. There’s quick charge too, and that’s the real convenience aspect: <strong>charge for 10 minutes and you’re getting five hours of playback</strong>. And that’s all through USB Type-C cable, included in the packaging.</p>
<p>The right earcup’s touch controls do it all without having to pull out your phone: You swipe up or down to volume-control, swipe forward or back to skip songs, tap once to pause or start, and tap twice to answer calls. You get used to it in a day or two. The <strong>Speak-to-Chat</strong> is actually brilliant: when you initiate speaking, the headphones automatically pause your tunes and admit background noise so you may converse. When you cease speaking, your tunes start again after a brief pause. You never have to take your headphones off when asked a question, for instance.</p>



<p>Call quality is improved with five in-built microphones and fantastic audio signal processing technology. With cooperative operation, the microphones block background noise and capture your own voice, causing calls to ring out even in background-noisy locations like crowded city intersections or bustling airports.</p>
<p>Sony revised the physical appearance to <strong>minimize pressure points</strong> which is important for long listening sessions. Earcups employ foam, pressure-distributed padding that sits evenly around your ears in place of resting on them directly. The headband does the same along your forehead. These design elements translate to wearing the WH-1000XM4 for hours without pain, and that is critical for long-haul flights or all-day work commutes.</p>
<p>At $228 for Prime Day, these Sony earphones provide flagship performance in an affordable package.</p>

              <p>Finding a laptop that will keep up with your hectic schedule without constantly hunting for an electric outlet is more difficult than it should be: You want one that is built for serious multitasking, video conferencing that won’t make you look like you’re calling from a basement and sufficient battery life to make it through an entire workday plus your nightly Netflix binge.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s latest Surface Laptop meets all these requirements and right now it’s going through an unprecedent price reduction for <em>Prime Big Deal Day</em> on Amazon. The manufacturer just debuted a whopping $400 off its highest-end laptop configuration, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4499/">cutting the cost from $1,399 to just $972</a>. This is the configuration with high-end specs such as <strong>512GB SSD storage and the Snapdragon X Elite processor</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4499/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Copilot+ PC Revolution Now Here</h2>
<p>This is not another Surface Laptop refresh: Microsoft is entering its <strong>second computing epoch with Copilot+ PCs</strong> and this 2024 laptop is its most ambitious yet to date when it comes to integrating AI capabilities. The <strong>Snapdragon X Elite processor is 12-core and incorporates a dedicated NPU</strong> (neural processing unit) that does AI tasks on your device, locally.</p>



<p>The 13.8-inch touchscreen display employs vibrant HDR technology concentrated in an ultra-thin form that ensures screen real estate is maximized and doesn’t increase the laptop’s footprint size. With the touch aspect of the display, it changes your dynamics with your work, and it feels second nature to annotate pages of your document with your hand, navigate through web pages, or zoom in on pictures with fluid gestures. With razor-thin bezels, it gives you more viewing real estate in a small form factor, and it makes a difference if you’re looking at trying to display two documents side by side or if you’re editing a detailed spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Battery life has always been a pain point for Windows laptops, but the Surface Laptop flips that narrative: You’re <strong>getting up to 20 hours of usage on a single charge</strong>, which means you can work through an entire day and still have juice left for streaming or gaming in the evening. This extended battery life comes from the efficiency of the Snapdragon X Elite’s ARM-based architecture, which sips power rather than guzzling it like traditional x86 processors.</p>
<p>The Copilot+ features genuinely change how you work: Windows Studio Effects enhances your video calls by improving lighting conditions, canceling background noise and blurring distracting elements in your environment. If you’ve ever taken a call from a poorly lit room or worried about the mess behind you, these features solve those problems in real time. The Recall feature creates an explorable timeline of everything you’ve done on your PC which makes it easy to retrieve that document you worked on last week or find that website you can’t quite remember. Real-time subtitle translation supports 44 languages during video calls or streaming.</p>
<p>At $972, this Microsoft Surface laptop features high-end specs and <strong>up-to-the-minute AI capabilities</strong> in a package that is affordable for more consumers. With this Prime Big Deal Day offer, it is a unique chance to own Microsoft’s flagship laptop at close to average PC prices.</p>

              <p>The Nintendo Switch became the best-selling console because you can take it anywhere. But here’s the frustration: playing on that small built-in screen, especially when two people are huddled around it, can strain your eyes and diminish the experience. Portable monitors solve this problem by giving you a bigger display that weighs barely more than a notebook: The <em>Forhelp</em> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4202/">15.6-inch portable monitor is now on sale for $59, down from its typical price of $79, during Prime Big Deal Day</a>. This screen lets you display your Switch games on a much larger canvas and makes multiplayer sessions actually enjoyable. The same monitor works with your laptop for dual-screen productivity, your PlayStation or Xbox for gaming sessions without hogging the TV.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4202/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD Display for Everywhere You Go</h2>
<p>The 15.6-inch screen features <strong>1920×1080 Full HD resolution from an innovative IPS matte panel</strong>. This kind of panel technology provides you with a 178-degree viewing angle so colors and contrast do not suffer even if you’re looking at the screen off to the side. This matters if more than one person is looking, or if you’re in a room that doesn’t put you right in front of the screen. This technology produces accurate and vibrant colors that make games and movies appear real life with high detail. The matte finish reduces glare from lights or windows above.</p>



<p>The monitor has various <strong>display modes that adjust to varying circumstances</strong>. Copy mode reflects your main screen, ideal for presentations when you have to display your laptop screen to others in the room during meetings. Extension mode uses the portable monitor as an additional screen, greatly expanding your display real estate for use in productivity activities such as documenting comparisons or having reference materials up and see while you work. HDR mode delivers improved image quality with higher highlights and more natural color reproduction and improves your viewing for video and games.</p>
<p>The screen is equipped with <strong>blue light blocking technology</strong> that eliminates hazardous wavelengths without it having any impact on colors. This is useful in long gaming sessions or if you’re using the screen as another screen for working during the day. Flicker-free tech eliminates the imperceptible screen throb that contributes to eye strain, and you’re able to effortlessly look at content or game for long periods without experiencing that burning, tired feeling that low-end displays create.</p>
<p>Aluminum alloy build is employed for the body that maintains the <strong>overall weight at only 1.52 pounds</strong>. With a measurement of 0.3 inches thin, this screen fits seamlessly in your backpack along with your laptop or Switch. You get to use the magnetic smart cover that does two jobs: it safeguards the screen from scuffs when you’re carrying it and doubles as a stand with two positions for varying the viewing angle. The cover incorporates sturdy PU leather on the outside that gives it that premium look and delivers full coverage protection.</p>



<p>What’s more, there are two full-featured USB-C ports and one mini HDMI port on the monitor. Both video signal and power transmission result from the USB-C connection via a solitary cable and minimize cable mess. You must have equipment that supports Thunderbolt 3.0, Thunderbolt 4.0, or USB 3.1 Type-C with DisplayPort Alt Mode in order for the USB-C connection to function. There is universal compatibility with game consoles, older model laptops and non-USB-C video output equipment on the mini HDMI port.</p>
<p>Dual built-in speakers render the use of external audio redundant when on the move. These speakers handle dialogue well and provide adequate volume for personal use, although hard core gamers might still desire the immersion that only headphones provide. These speakers prove handy when rapidly setting up in the case of a hotel room or even in a coffee shop.</p>
<p>Right now for Prime Day, this transportable display is cheaper than many premium competitors and gives you a full second display outcome.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-wont-admit-it-needs-discounts-so-its-quietly-offloading-macbook-airs-through-amazon-2000631829</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-won%E2%80%99t-admit-it-needs-discounts-so-it%E2%80%99s-quietly-offloading-macbook-airs-through-amazon.1317070/</guid>

              <p>Here’s something you likely know: <strong>Apple never goes on sale</strong>. The tech giant carefully guards its premium image by refusing to slash prices on its official website or in its retail stores. But here’s the thing—even Apple needs to boost sales, and that’s where authorized retailers like Amazon come in.</p>
<p>For this October’s <em>Prime Big Deal Day</em> (essentially the fall version of Prime Day), Amazon is offering record-low pricing on the 2025 MacBook Air lineup, and these deals are too good to ignore. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">13-inch model with the new M4 chip and 256GB storage has dropped to $897, down from $999</a>, and<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/"> the 15-inch 256GB version is available for $1,078, reduced from $1,199</a>.</p>

<h2>The M4 Chip Changes Everything</h2>
<p>At the heart of this 2025 MacBook is Apple’s M4 chip which represents a significant leap forward in performance and efficiency. The M4 delivers big improvements when you’re juggling multiple applications or running graphics-intensive games. The chip’s architecture allows for seamless multitasking without the fans kicking in (because there aren’t any) and without draining your battery. Speaking of which, you’re getting up to 18 hours of battery life which means you can work through an entire day and well into the evening without hunting for an outlet.</p>



<p>The screen warrants particular admiration: Both t<strong>he 13.6-inch and 15.3-inch Liquid Retina displays handle one billion colors</strong>, translating to extremely lifelike photos, videos bursting with deep contrast and text that’s crisp enough to minimize eye strain when working for long stretches. The larger 15-inch variant provides additional screen real estate for productivity applications such as working on spreadsheets or designing projects in which you desire multiple windows in sight at all times. When it comes to video conferencing and content creation, the 12MP Center Stage camera automatically positions you in the center of the picture when you’re in motion.</p>
<p>Connectivity is another aspect in which the 2025 MacBook Air excels: <strong>You have two Thunderbolt 4 ports</strong> that manage blazing-fast data transfer rates of up to 40Gbps which is ideal for external storage or high-end monitors. There’s the MagSafe power port that ensures you won’t pull your laptop off the desk if you kick your foot against the cable—the cable automatically disconnects magnetically without causing damage. Wi-Fi 6E support prepares you for the newest router tech with increased speeds and less traffic, and Bluetooth 5.3 ensures seamless connections for wireless peripherals. You’re connectable to up to two external displays as well.</p>



<p>Apple Intelligence is the company’s new personal intelligence system and it is baked right into the MacBook Air. This feature helps streamline your writing, creative expression and daily tasks with groundbreaking privacy protections that ensure your data stays yours (even Apple can’t access it). The system integrates with macOS to make common tasks faster and more intuitive. If you’re already in the Apple ecosystem with an iPhone, the integration becomes even more powerful: iPhone Mirroring lets you control your phone directly from your Mac screen, while Universal Clipboard means you can copy text on your iPhone and paste it on your Mac.</p>
<p>The audio system is backed with <strong>six speakers for Spatial Audio and three microphones</strong>, and it produces an immersive listening experience for music, movies, and games. Speakers deliver exceptionally deep bass and crisp highs for such thin case depths. Both models come with 16GB unified memory and 256GB SSD storage in this configuration, and unified memory architecture allows the system to distribute resources back and forth between processor and render tasks dynamically.</p>
<p>At <strong>these all-time-low Prime Big Deal Day prices</strong>, you’re getting the best laptop technology from Apple at a discount that doesn’t originate from an authorized dealer. They won’t stay on sale like this forever.</p>
