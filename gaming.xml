Zero&nbsp;</em>has launched to the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>series' highest Steam player count ever, and it's not even a close call.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco and Spike Chunsoft's latest&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>fighter launched just yesterday, but at time of writing, it's already hit a Steam player count <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1790600/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">high of 122,554</a>, and that's with the weekend yet to come.</p>
<p>That's easily enough to dethrone its nearest competitor in the franchise,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em>, which has an all-time Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/678950/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">player peak of 44,303</a>. That total is not to be sniffed at, but&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>has left it in the dust.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-highest-steam-count-series-goku.jpg?itok=qj-RTmBB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-highest-steam-count-series-goku.jpg?itok=zT-8vH3G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Picture Goku as&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>and his opponent as every other&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>game on Steam thus far.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally,&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>also comes out ahead of other&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>games like&nbsp;<em>Xenoverse</em>, its sequel, and ill-fated&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>-style mobile game&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: The Breakers</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, according to SteamDB,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>is currently Bandai Namco's third best-performing game of all time on Steam, second only to&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>.</p>
<p>It's pretty close between&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 3</em>, too, with the latter achieving a peak Steam player count of 129,975 across its entire lifetime. I'm betting that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>beats that total by the time the weekend is through.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>pulls out pretty far in front with almost a million concurrent players, but given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million">staggering popularity</a> of that game, I don't think&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>should feel too worried about its success.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, it's actually the fourth game in the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi&nbsp;</em>series, and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/yakuza-like-dragon">pulling a&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/yakuza-like-dragon">Like a Dragon</a>&nbsp;</em>by adopting the Japanese title (since the games were released in Japan under the name&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball Z: Sparking!</em>).</p>
<p>The game boasts more than 180 playable characters, "heart-pounding, high-speed 3D battles", and a feature by which you can create your own&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>battles and share them with like-minded fans around the world.</p>
<p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1790600/DRAGON_BALL_Sparking_ZERO/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dragon-ball-sparking-zero/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dragon-ball-sparking-zero/9N7XMJJHNFC3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

<p>The Axis Unseen launches on October 22 for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1807810/The_Axis_Unseen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-axis-unseen-439821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>, and Insider Gaming has an exclusive first look and walkthrough at never-before-seen gameplay.</p>



<p>The gameplay comes from our interview with The Axis Unseen creator Nate Purkeypile. It takes place in a region in the game called “The Darkness” about halfway through the game, and features a couple unique monsters, including one you can only see out of your player’s peripheral vision. It’s also terrifying as it has teeth for eyes.</p>



<p>Check out the gameplay below. You can also check out the full interview for yourself. In the interview, Purkeypile talks about the game’s development, a potential console release, future updates, and more.</p>



<p>A demo for The Axis Unseen is available on Steam.</p>

<h2 id="h-about-the-axis-unseen">About The Axis Unseen</h2>



<p>“The Axis Unseen is a heavy metal horror game,” the game’s description reads. “Hunt nightmarish monsters from ancient folklore in a mysterious open world, collecting their enhanced sense powers and discovering elemental arrows. Beware, the hunter is also the hunted.”</p>



<p>There is also an original heavy metal soundtrack composed by Clifford Meyer of the post-metal bands Red Sparowes and ISIS.</p>



<p>Other features of the game include, per Just Purkey Games:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unique Arrow Types</strong> – Your bow and arrow keeps you alive. Upgrade your bow or even find different arrow types such as fire, wind controlling or time distorting arrows. Experiment to see all of the different ways the arrows can interact with each other, such as wind arrows making the fire spread faster.</li>



<li><strong>Improve your senses</strong> – Upgrade your senses with the powers of the creatures. See scent particles. Feel the warmth left behind on their tracks. See colors that no human has ever seen.</li>



<li><strong>Uncover the secrets of the hunters</strong> – Find out what happened to the hunters who came before you and what secrets they uncovered by inspecting their journals and drawings. Where did this world come from? How do you stop the creatures from escaping into your world?</li>
</ul>

Check back later to take your own deep dive in the Fat Babies archives.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hello dear readers. Chris is out this month for some well-deserved R&amp;R, leaving the pilot's seat open for me to come in and steer the good ship </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/patch-notes-4-strange-scaffold-rejected-a-culture-of-hope-to-resurrect-i-am-your-beast">Patch Notes</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Today, we're going to take a strange trip through game development history.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I was working on a completely unrelated story a couple weeks ago when a source I was speaking with casually asked me "you remember 'Fat Babies,' right?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fat Babies? The name was so outlandish I thought for a moment I was being played. But nope. I dug through </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001019024348/http://www.fatbabies.com/">The Internet Archive</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and discovered there was indeed a game developer's gossip hub called Fat Babies, and it was incredibly unhinged.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How else could I describe it? Where in 2024 would you find a website where bloggers spilled industry gossip, developers argued viciously on forums, and the site hosts took regular swipes at Democrats? The site appears to have sprung up in late 1999, meaning Game Developer (née Gamasutra) was up and running by that point, but this was an entirely different beast. One part Perez Hilton, one part 4chan, one part job board, this was a site fully of its day and age.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our goal is to be the premier site for gaming gossip," wrote anonymous contributor "FatSlicky," whose real identity is still unknown to this day.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have a number of 'insiders' within the industry who are eagerly reporting back here with their gaming news—everything from slipped release schedules, cancelled projects, budget overruns, internal team conflicts, and key personnel hirings and firings."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tab over to the "musings" section of the site though and you'll see why developers like Playable Worlds co-founder Raph Koster have "bad memories" of Fat Babies. He explained in an email to Game Developer that a site contributor put him in their crosshairs and reached out to his coworkers in search of "dirt," later posting personal attacks about his character. "I got a pile of emails from coworkers saying 'Fatbabies sucks, you’re not like that,' he said highlighting that the site's toxicity didn't represent everyone in the video game business.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's not hard to dig up other vicious messages shared by the site's operators—some elevated from the forums (which weren't preserved by The Archive), giving us a snapshot of what some of the gossip looked like. The attacks on designers like Ion Storm level designer Stevie Case by contributor "FatMamaCita" feel particularly gross now that she's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2022/10/stevie-case-vs-the-world-gaming-industry-sexism">told her story</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> about the sexism that sent her out of the business.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet, for all the bile, Fat Babies was a rare source for developers to hear about the industry from other developers. "We didn't have any way of keeping in touch—there were no subreddits, social media leaks, Linkedin, Blind, any places that insiders could talk or share info anonymously," recalled former Wargaming and Sony Interactive Entertainment executive Scott Hartsman. "There was no such thing as ambient internet information yet."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The "rumors" tab is filled with loads of single-sourced rumors, many of which didn't age well. That's because they either turned out to be not true or because they were tinged with drive-by racism. It's also the tab that documented a spree of layoffs at companies like Sierra Online, Electronic Arts, Eidos, etc. There's a good chance that was the only way for some developers to hear about that kind of news—and Hartsman said sometimes it was the only way you'd learn about goings-on at your own employer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Imagine being a worker at Westwood given the chance to see </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010910023513/http://fatbabies.com/story_ww-email1.jpg">your boss's emails</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> discussing why they're releasing "junior or weaker members on the team." Access to that kind of information would definitely make the toxicity bearable for some readers, wouldn't it?</span></p><p>Image via Fat Babies. Names blacked out to protect identities.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers like Trevor Stricker of Pixel Disco told me they remember at first thinking Fat Babies was brilliant. "It felt like somebody else saw through the bullshit and publishing [the rumors] felt heroic."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But he, like many we spoke with, became disillusioned by the personal attacks on developers. He recalled a piece targeting Visual Concepts founder Greg Thomas that made him see Fat Babies in a different light. "My opinion started to shift, like [the writer] was using his anonymity as a bully pulpit just to denigrate. he just hated on everyone and everything but...why? It was actually a fertile time for the industry. All this guy had to offer was bile."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I admit to speedrunning through Thomas' experience. When I first clicked through Fat Babies, my jaw hit the floor. Old gossip! Trashy blogs! Random asides about Iraq War protestors being paid by Democrats!

			<p>Starship Troopers: Extermination has officially launched on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, a new title that has been developed by Offworld Industries, who are known for producing the 2020 game Squad. The Starship Troopers game is part of the franchise and takes place within the Starship Troopers movie universe. This title was created in collaboration with Sony Pictures Consumer Products and Knights Peak. Now, players will get to dive into a familiar world full of horrifying creatures to fight off in exciting and explosive battles. Starship Troopers: Extermination is a 16-player FPS that has finally escaped from Early Access to be launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and the Epic Games Store, after only previously being available on Steam.</p>
<p><iframe title="Starship Troopers: Extermination - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9kp46jD26oQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/starship-troopers-extermination-1-0-launches-on-october-11-adding-single-player-mode-and-more/">latest version</a> of the sci-fi title comes with brand-new features, including a solo-play tutorial mode with Casper Van Dien reprising the role of General Rico to accompany you on your journey. This is just chapter one of the solo play tutorial mode, and chapter two of the solo play mode will come in post-launch updates, which help to introduce players to new mechanics in the game.</p>
<p>The Tanker Bug that appears in the game is a direct inspiration from the 1997 movie. This is a new addition, specifically in the 1.0 update, and these Bugs are an armored assault unit in the Arachnid army and are incredibly strong, with the potential to kill you and others on the team in mere seconds. To be able to dispatch it at all, the entire team will need to focus their attention on blasting the Tanker Bug, which is full of holes.</p>
<p>The full-release update of the game also comes with a new ice planet called Boreas, where players will get to explore and kill as many bugs as possible until their hearts are content on an icy cold planet that was hit with a Bug Meteor, which allowed the Arachnid army to set up camp and begin to evolve to survive the extreme winter.</p>
<p>There are other new features in the fully released version of the game, including new Companies, which allow players to build a company of dedicated Troopers, much like General Rico and his Roughnecks. Each Company will enable players to work together on the Galactic Front and complete special Company Operations, which will provide you and the other players in the Company with rewards as well as the power of friendship.</p>
<p>Starship Troopers: Extermination is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1268750/Starship_Troopers_Extermination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S for $49.99.</p>
<p>Will you be diving into the game?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-axis-unseen-review-heavy-metal-elevates-hunting-experience.1007382/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/axis-unseen-heavy-metal-elevates-hunting-experience<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Axis Unseen</em>&nbsp;is the first indie project by Nate Purkeypile and his studio Just Purkey Games. A veteran game designer who worked on&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="167cdfe5-ff47-41b1-9613-8e5afb7de3c4" href="https://techraptor.net/games/fallout-76"><em>Fallout 76</em></a>,&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="50194234-bf65-48d6-8b69-3165aebab8cc" href="https://techraptor.net/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim"><em>Skyrim</em></a>, and <em>BloodRayne 2</em><em>,&nbsp;</em>he wanted to bring his creative vision to life with a new indie venture. The result was&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em>, which blends heavy metal, horror, and hunting. After experiencing the unknown world, I can thoroughly say that <i>The Axis Unseen</i>&nbsp;is a knockout indie entry in gaming.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Experience a New Kind of Hunt in&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em></h2>
<p>The main premise of&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em>&nbsp;is you're a hunter following in the footsteps of those who came before you. Hunt down creatures and collect journal entries to learn about hunters and the world around you as you journey toward the Mountain. A world between worlds, this unknown place is not where you originally came from, and the Mountain is the way back to the real world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It took me around 25 hours to complete my first playthrough where I gathered all the powers, magic, and arrow types. I played on average difficulty, but you can choose harder ones, even permadeath. Once you make it through the Portal at the top of the Mountain, you can embark on new game+, start a new playthrough, or keep playing the game to earn different achievements.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/axis-unseen-elusive-greenman.jpg?itok=-YUVTab0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/axis-unseen-elusive-greenman.jpg?itok=XaNzRcqz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The creatures you hunt aren't your ordinary deer, quail, or bear, however. They're what legends are often told of. Cryptids and beasts from folklore that somehow slipped into our world from this place. This is where a chunk of the horror present in the game comes into play.</p>
<p>Not only are these creatures startling in appearance, with giant bone growths or lacking skin, but they also make incredibly creepy sounds. There are creatures so large they shake the earth when they walk, while others scream if you get too close to them. Even during the day, these can ambush you with fatal consequences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While your prey may be scary to look at or hear, the world of&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em>&nbsp;is filled with giant human skeletons, horned creature skeletons, and an abyss filled with fleshy tissue. Everywhere you look there are bones, altars, and abandoned structures. It sets the scene for all the tension that builds as you hunt, and are hunted, across the regions.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/axis-unseen-giant-skeletons.jpg?itok=RQfJO0bV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/axis-unseen-giant-skeletons.jpg?itok=Cd-udmwd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Heavy Metal Instrumentals&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Throughout the game, the music enhances all encounters. The Forest is melancholic, the Darkness puts you on edge. Like other titles, the music changes as you encounter stronger enemies. What makes it the perfect fit for&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen&nbsp;</em>is the genre of music, metal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it was classical or electronic, the music wouldn't fit as well. It wouldn't enhance all interactions in the game like metal does. Entering a new region brings new music. Combined with creature sounds, new visuals, and potential attacks, it heightens the tension substantially. At one point, the music had amped me up so much that I almost jumped off my chair when I got attacked by a new creature.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/axis-unseen-goatman-huay-chivo.jpg?itok=o1NZPjpd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/axis-unseen-goatman-huay-chivo.jpg?itok=F6Nhl0Te 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The genius behind the heavy metal is&nbsp;Clifford Meyer, a former member of&nbsp;Red Sparowes. His band experience and musical talent allowed him to craft instrumental music that elicits a variety of emotions from triumph to sadness to fury. Without this aspect of&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em>, it wouldn't be as fun to play as it currently is.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>It's Not All Hunting Trophies</h2>
<p>There are a lot of good things about&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em>, but there are a couple of issues with the game as well. While there's an intricate story laced throughout the game, it involves finding the scattered journal pages. This isn't necessarily hard since most are found near Portals, magic altars, or energy hotspots. The real downside is the pages and pages of reading you have to do to learn about the story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I don't mind reading a bit of lore to understand a story. However, it's about 150 pages of reading that you need to go through to get the big picture. On top of having to read a lot of words, you can be attacked while getting through the journal entries. Unless you're sure there are no creatures around, learning lore can be a bottom-of-the-list task.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/axis-unseen-journal-entry-darkness.jpg?itok=sP4_CnxX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/axis-unseen-journal-entry-darkness.jpg?itok=xBTwWXDJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In addition to large-scale reading, there are some areas you can fall through the map. Don't jump off any ledges, as you may get stuck at the bottom of a cliff and have to end your hunt, sacrificing any unlocked energy you've collected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, an arrow type you're looking for gets skipped over when changing arrows. This can disrupt your timing for explosions, getting in a kill, or being able to see in the dark. This is a minor inconvenience and doesn't happen all the time, but often enough that it should be mentioned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all,&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em>&nbsp;is a solid solo game produced by&nbsp;Nate Purkeypile. It combines horror, hunting and shooting, with heavy metal music to carve out a place among competing titles. For players looking for something new, want to experience their favorite music genre in a different way, or just want to check out a great indie title,&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em>&nbsp;should be on the list.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-disco-elysium-devs-reveal-two-new-studios-and-spiritual-successors.1007379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ex-<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developers have announced two brand new studios and two spiritual successors to the influential RPG within just a day or so of each other. Feel free to make your own "weird that it happened twice" joke here.</p>
<p>The first new studio to make its announcement (in our running order, not necessarily chronologically) is Dark Math Games, which describes itself as a "breakaway group from the original development team of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>".</p>
<p>The team is based in the UK and boasts a staff of 20, "about half of whom contributed to bringing the critically acclaimed hit&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>...to life", according to a press release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disco-elysium-new-studios-spiritual-successor-xxx-nightshift.jpg?itok=rAR4RCPA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disco-elysium-new-studios-spiritual-successor-xxx-nightshift.jpg?itok=VOxJ99yn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>XXX Nightshift&nbsp;</em>is one of the two&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>spiritual successors revealed today.</figcaption></figure><p>Dark Math's debut game is&nbsp;<em>XXX Nightshift</em>, a slightly questionably-named narrative RPG in which you are "stranded at a luxury ski resort in Antarctica".&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you play, you'll experience "deep single-player role-playing", complete with an "innovative and powerful role-playing system" that "respects your time and trusts your intelligence with seismic choices". Sounds pretty&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>-esque, alright.</p>
<p>Somewhat cheekily, Dark Math also promises&nbsp;<em>XXX Nightshift&nbsp;</em>will bring "a few less words" and "a few more bullets" to the RPG table, resulting in a "lot more fun".&nbsp;It's probably fair to say there was a lot of reading involved in enjoying&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>.</p>
<p><em>XXX Nightshift&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date or window yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3261450/XXX_NIGHTSHIFT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam here</a> if you want to follow along with its progress.</p>

<p>Next up on the&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor conveyor belt is Longdue, a new studio that boasts a dozen staff members "including team members that worked on <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disco-elysium">the original</a>&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>and its unreleased sequel".</p>
<p>Longdue is also pulling in talent from the likes of Bungie and Rockstar for its debut title, which it describes as a "psychological RPG" which "explores the delicate interplay between the conscious and subconscious".</p>
<p>Unlike Dark Math's game, Longdue's debut project doesn't have a name yet, but you can keep an eye on its progress by heading over to the studio's <a href="https://www.longduegames.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new official website</a>.</p>
<p>In total, this makes four companies arguably vying for the legacy of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>. As well as the two studios above, there's also Red Info, a studio supposedly founded by ex-<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>leads Robert Kurvitz and Aleksander Rostov, although we haven't heard much about that studio for a while.</p>
<p>Of course, original&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developer ZA/UM is also technically still a going concern, although it did <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs">cancel a project and lay off some of its staff</a> earlier this year. Which of these studios will emerge victorious in the battle for&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>'s soul? We shall have to wait and see.</p>

According to the latest sales data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l6ahdhuslg2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>, US video game hardware sales saw a drastic year-over-year decline in August 2024.</p>



<p>Per the sales data, hardware spending fell from roughly $325 million to $208 million. That’s a 36% drop year-over-year. It was also added that each current-generation console had at least a 34% fall in sales compared to August 2023. The Nintendo Switch had the furthest fall at 41%.</p>







<p>While steep, the drop in sales shouldn’t be surprising. The current-generation Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 consoles are almost four years old, and most players who would buy them already have them. The Nintendo Switch is over seven years old and is set to be replaced, so the near 50% year-over-year fall is somewhat expected.</p>



<p>The PS5 Pro launch should see a jump in sales later this year, but it won’t move the needle all too much with its $700 price point. The holiday shopping season will also see an uptick in sales in some way.</p>



<p>Sticking with cost, money likely plays a large factor in hardware sales. With basic goods and services more expensive now than ever before, spending money on things like video game consoles and other hardware can take a backseat on the priority list. </p>



<p>Also falling in August, but not nearly as much, were accessory sales as they fell 3% to $173 million.</p>



<p>“Growth in the Remote Play Device segment (PlayStation Portal), was offset by a 10% year-on-year decline in Gamepad spending,” Mat Piscatella of Circana said.</p>

The developers describe the actions as such, with you playing as Art, who "disrupts movie sets where films about his own gruesome acts are being shot.

Oyama voiced Doraemon for an incredible 2,338 episodes over the course of more than 25 years before finally handing the role to Wasabi Mizuta for a new show that began in 2005. She also had a starring role in the iconic 1970s mecha anime Zambot 3, where she played the hero Jin Kappei.</p><p>After Doraemon, Oyama took on a new role: Monokuma, the villainous mascot of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/danganronpa-trigger-happy-havoc">Danganronpa</a>, a "walking, talking, psychopathic bear."

          <p>After a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/judge-orders-google-to-distribute-third-party-app-stores-on-google-play/">US court ruled earlier this week</a> that Google must open its Play Store to allow for third-party app stores and alternative payment options, Microsoft is moving quickly to slide into this slightly ajar door.</p>
<p>Sarah Bond, president of Xbox, <a href="https://x.com/BondSarah_Bond/status/1844506029599707255?t=SrOvyzBRyQLwuWk9wn58hw&amp;s=19">posted on X (formerly Twitter)</a> Thursday evening that the ruling "will allow more choice and flexibility." "Our mission is to allow more players to play on more devices so we are thrilled to share that starting in November, players will be able to play and purchase Xbox games directly from the Xbox App on Android," Bond wrote.</p>
<p>Because the court order requires Google to stop forcing apps to use its own billing system and allow for third-party app stores inside Google Play itself, Microsoft now intends to offer Xbox games directly through its app. Most games will likely not run directly on Android, but a revamped Xbox Android app could also directly stream purchased or subscribed games to Android devices.</p>
<p>Until now, buying Xbox games (or most any game) on a mobile device has typically involved either navigating to a web-based store in a browser—while avoiding attempts by the phone to open a store's official app—or simply using a different device entirely to buy the game, then playing or streaming it on the phone.</p>

The first two were originally released for the PlayStation 1 and Dreamcast, while the third one came out on PlayStation 2. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/12/04/tomb-raider-the-last-revelation-3">All three</a> are considered <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/12/04/tomb-raider-the-last-revelation-3">lesser entries</a> by many fans, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/07/10/tomb-raider-angel-of-darkness-review">Angel of Darkness in particular</a> being known for being buggy and unfinished.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Here are the official descriptions of all three games.</p><p><strong>Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation (1999)</strong></p><p>Lara Croft uncovers the lost tomb of the Egyptian God Set, unwittingly unleashing him and fulfilling an ancient prophecy—one that plunges mankind into darkness.

They follow in the footsteps of the Tomb Raider I - III Remastered Collection released earlier this year, which were developed in part by a fan who had previously been working on remakes of the original games.</p><p>We wrote in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered-vs-rtx-remix-performance-review">our tech review</a>, "The very small and largely independent team that built Tomb Raider I-III Remastered have clear passion and skills for the legacy of Lara Croft. The enhancements offered are great and much better than, for example, the recent <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1">Konami Metal Gear Solid Collection</a>. High frame rates, dual new and old modes, all of the expansion packs, improved graphics and controls alongside fast swapping across all 3 titles and DLC from the main menu are welcome."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/tr-100-million-1728595236292.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Tomb Raider has officially reached 100 million games sold.</figcaption></figure></output><p>In the midst of announcing the remaster, Crystal Dynamics also revealed that Tomb Raider has hit a notable milestone, having officially sold 100 million units over its lifetime. An official statement celebrating the accomplishment said, "We’re so honored to share a huge milestone for Tomb Raider – we have officially reached over 100 million games sold across the franchise! This is a momentous accomplishment that few video game franchises ever achieve." </p><p>We owe our thanks to you, the fans, as well as to all the passionate developers and artists whose talent and imagination have given us so many stories and experiences to share together for nearly three decades. We’re extremely grateful for the Tomb Raider community’s collective spirit of adventure, and we look forward to all the journeys still to come as Lara Croft and Tomb Raider continue to reach new heights."</p><p>Tomb Raider I - III Remastered was released on February 14, 2024, and Tomb Raider IV - VI Remastered will follow exactly one year later on February 14, 2025 for PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-asks-switch-online-playtesters-not-to-disclose-any-information-but-how-long-will-that-last<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Nintendo is requesting participants in its secretive <a href="https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-gb">Nintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program</a> do not disclose details of the test.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Nintendo announced it would soon be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-playtesting-mystery-new-switch-online-feature-this-month-with-up-to-10k-people">playtesting a new Switch Online feature</a>, but only up to 10,000 people would be accepted.</p>
<p>This, of course, drew plenty of attention and excitement - so much so that the playtest application reached capacity within a minute of going live yesterday.</p>

<p>Twitter/X user (and Nintendo dataminer) OatmealDome was one of the lucky people to be accepted and has since shared a screenshot of Terms and Conditions from Nintendo that must be accepted.</p>
<p>"We request that you do not discuss or disclose content from either the Nintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program test software or website with others," it reads.</p>
<p>The download code also cannot be shared with others, or re-issued.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>[NSO - Playtest]</p><p>Note: players will not be allowed to talk about the contents of the playtest. You must accept an NDA before the software can be downloaded.</p><p>(Pretty sure there will be people who post to social media about it within the first 5 minutes regardless...) <a href="https://t.co/uhvmwFs4Q9">pic.twitter.com/uhvmwFs4Q9</a></p></div>— OatmealDome (@OatmealDome) <a href="https://twitter.com/OatmealDome/status/1844467949190451647?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>While this isn't strictly an NDA, it's clear Nintendo wants lucky applicants to keep quiet about what they experience.</p>
<p>But really, how likely is that?</p>
<p>The playtest itself is set to take place from 24th October until 6th November and involves a 2.2 GB software download.</p>
<p>So what do you think the playtest will be for? A new Virtual Console? Game streaming? Something related to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/11/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered-announced-for-another-valentines-day-release/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Following on from the well received original trilogy remaster, Aspyr Media has announced Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC. You love to see it, and that’s probably why they’re releasing it on 14th February 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ow6cM-fgiB4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>While the first three games were all numbered, the games that came fourth and onwards were all named. 1999’s The Last Revelation sees Lara uncover the lost tomb of the Egyptian God Set, unwittingly setting him free. She’s then presumed dead after saving the world from that danger, with Tomb Raider: Chronicles rounding out the series’ PS1 era with family and friends reminiscing on earlier Lara Croft adventures (which you obviously get to play through).</p>
<p>Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness saw the series make the leap to PlayStation 2, coming with a brand new engine and overhauled gameplay – Lara has a stamina meter for climbing, can perform melee attacks, stealth, and more. Unfortunately, this was a real problem project for Core Design, taking three years to produce with multiple delays and content being cut or scaled back to meet deadlines. While it sold a 2.5 million copies, it was not a critical success, and Eidos decided to hand the series over to Crystal Dynamics going forward.</p>
<p>As with the first remastered trilogy, Aspyr is making a number of modernising changes. You’ll have both overhauled and classic graphics that &nbsp;you can switch between on the fly, and there’s a more modern control scheme inspired by later games to give camera controls, or you can still play with the old tank controls. Further quality of life tweaks include boss health bars, and there’s trophies and achievements integrated as well.</p>

<p>The Darkness trilogy will come in at the same $29.99 / £24.99 / €29.99 price point as the first trio.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/21/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered-review-ps5-xbox-switch-pc/">Tomb Raider I-III Remastered review</a>, we said, “Lara’s original trilogy has been lovingly restored with the launch of these remasters, offering a definitive collection that bundles the core games and their expansions. However, dusting off these old relics in the name of nostalgia may come with a nasty surprise. Don’t worry, there are no mummy curses, snake pits, or swinging pendulum axes, though the clunky controls will definitely take some getting used to (again).”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-franchise-sells-over-100-million-units-comes-with-remaster-announcement/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://www.tombraider.com/news/video-games/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered-reveal-100-million-games-sold-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crystal Dynamics posted</a> that the Tomb Raider franchise has officially reached over 100 million games sold across the entire franchise, a franchise that started in 1996 and is still going strong even today in 2024. Not only did Crystal Dynamics express their gratitude and excitement over the success of the franchise, but they also announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-the-last-revelation-remaster/">that Tomb Raider IV-VI are getting their very own remaster collection</a>, which is monumental news for those who have been waiting to see whether Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness would ever receive any special treatment. Angel of Darkness has always been the most controversial game in the series, and it's already taken plenty of Tomb Raider fans by surprise that they've chosen to remaster this game, too. It's possible that by remastering it, all of the bugs that the game ever had will be fixed, and its reputation may finally swing to a positive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered Starring Lara Croft" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bdQDT7LSPWU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Remastering all of the original games in the collection means that they are more accessible than ever, which will definitely help to contribute to the number of sales made in the Tomb Raider franchise. While the numbers for the Tomb Raider I-III Remastered collection weren't revealed, the <a href="https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Embracer-Group-publishes-Interim-Report-Q4-January-March-2024-Adjusted-EBIT-increased-by-56-to-SEK-1426-million-240523.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Embracer Group financial report</a> stated that the collection was positively received and performed above management expectations. The first remastered collection saw a lot of Limited Edition merchandise released for the title, which helped boost and promote the game. Additionally, those working on the game continued to release bug fixes and updates, making the game as flawless as possible.</p>
<p>While Tomb Raider IV-VI are not considered many people's favorites in the franchise, it will bring the entire collection full circle, and will make the entire collection more accessible to those who want to play it on alternative consoles, as well as giving those who create content an easier way to do it, as the game allows you to choose between the original graphics and the remastered graphics.</p>
<p>This will likely help to bolster the sales of the Tomb Raider franchise, especially as the last new game in the franchise was released in 2018, and the next game in the Survivor franchise hasn't received any new information.</p>
<p>Whether this remastered collection will receive the same amount of fanfare and promotion as the first three will remain to be seen, but it will be released on all platforms similar to the first remastered collection. Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered is set to release on February 14, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-sales-1m-already<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Studio Zero and publisher Atlus have announced that&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio&nbsp;</em>sales have already reached an impressive milestone, even though the game has only been out for a handful of hours.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000006046.000005397.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Japanese press release</a> (for which we're using machine translation), physical shipments and digital sales of the game have already passed the one million mark, which is a pretty impressive point to be at this early in the game's life cycle.</p>
<p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio&nbsp;</em>also boasts the <a href="https://steamdb.info/developer/ATLUS/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">highest Steam concurrent player count</a> of any Atlus game in history; the game is currently sitting at 60,103 players on Steam (at time of writing), which handily beats the publisher's next most popular game&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>(45,002).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metaphor-refantazio-sales-running.jpg?itok=JMtN1-81 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metaphor-refantazio-sales-running.jpg?itok=QpxFz8XO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio&nbsp;</em>sales have already hit a very impressive milestone, and it's only been a handful of hours.</figcaption></figure><p>In the press release, Atlus also points to&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>'s strong critical reception. The game is currently sitting at a <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17289/metaphor-refantazio" rel="noopener" target="_blank">92% rating on OpenCritic</a>, with 99% of aggregated critics awarding it a positive score.</p>
<p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>'s strong performance is especially impressive given that it's a completely new IP; though it shares similarities with the&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>series (including a publisher and several former developers), it's not an entry in that franchise, so its strong sales will likely be encouraging for Atlus.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, it's a new turn-based RPG from Atlus and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atlus-reveals-studio-zero-and-new-rpg-codenamed-project-re-fantasy">developer Studio Zero</a>, which counts several former&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>alumni among its ranks.</p>
<p>The game features a mixture of turn-based and real-time combat, as well as systems that will be familiar to Atlus fans, including social elements, time-sensitive events, and more.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2679460/Metaphor_ReFantazio/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/metaphor-refantazio/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/metaphor-refantazio" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need any further incentive to do so, you can read our very own Andrew Stretch's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/metaphor-refantazio-review-persona-formula-perfected">glowing review of the game here</a>, in which he praises its "deep and thematic" narrative and "satisfying" evolution of the&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>series' signature combat style.</p>
