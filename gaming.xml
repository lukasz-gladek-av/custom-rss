		<p>Back in March, ustwo games announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/monument-valley-3-is-coming-to-pc-and-consoles-this-summer/">Monument Valley 3 would be coming to PC and consoles this summer</a>. Now, the studio has confirmed the exact release date for Monument Valley’s release on PC, Switch, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series XS is July 22nd. This follows the first two Monument Valley games releasing on the same consoles back on April 15th.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monument Valley 3 | Launch Trailer |" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R0BGVxbWmHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/07/31/ustwo-games-confirms-monument-valley-3-is-now-in-development/">Monument Valley 3 was first announced</a>&nbsp;way back in 2019, so it did take five years to get to release. In this third game, players are Noor. Noor is on a mission to find a light source to push back the darkness that is enclosing her world. Like the previous games, players will have to manipulate the environment to find the solutions to the puzzles with each chapter adding a new spin to things. In a first for the series, Monument Valley 3 lets you set sail in open areas to further explore the world. Post launch, ustwo games has confirmed there will be new puzzles and chapters added to the game.</p>
<p>Anyone who purchases Monument Valley 3 will also be donating to charity, as ustwo games has stated the 3% of profits to support flood relief efforts. Before you buy, you will be able to play a demo on PC via Steam Next Fest, which takes place June 9th-16th. Further, a digital and vinyl release of Monument Valley 3’s soundtrack will be coming this summer.</p>

If we're being honest with ourselves, the original PSP was a sort of Proto-Switch too, no? As in it was home to a lot of odd, smaller-scope games that not many other platforms might have featured outside of Nintendo's earlier handhelds. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/patapon">Patapon</a> was one such tiny oddity, one of the most charming games on the platform, if not to ever outright exist. It did go on to get a couple of sequels, but the series (outside of an upcoming remaster of the first two) is sort of dead. Luckily, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ratatan">Ratatan</a>, a spiritual successor from Patapon's creator is here to satisfy your tiny-guy-chanting-to-music needs with a newly revealed release date!
</p>

<p>
Featured during yesterday's Day of the Devs presentation, it was revealed that the rhythm <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> action game (take a shot for every genre it mixes) will be coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2949320/Ratatan/">Steam in early access</a> next month on July 25th. I'm quite excited by this one personally, those little chants in the original Patapon are burnt into my ear canals, I'm looking forward to getting something fresh in there that I can also repeat to myself ad infinitum. Yes that sounds like someone's personal hell, I just love a good chant.

Luckily, none of us actually have to wait to check it out either. There's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3449820/Ratatan_Demo/">demo</a> you can give a punt right now, something I'll be trying to fit in amongst the 1000 showcases taking place this week. The one thing I'm uncertain of is the roguelike element - outside of that it just looks like an incredibly lush and colourful, modern take on an old classic. Whether that roguelike quality will rob itself of tightly designed levels is something I'll have to find out for myself.
</p>
<p>
Ratatan also differs slightly in that you can freely move the little guys around, adding an extra tactical layer to it all. I will cry if even one of the Ratatans die, so, I'll be working hard to make the right choices.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-the-beast-the-first-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast-%E2%80%93-the-first-preview.1211199/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-the-beast-the-first-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">So much of Dying Light is informed by the series’ melee-first design. Its impact can be seen in the damage system that causes its grotesque zombies to fall apart with every slash of your blade, as well as the weapon crafting, which turns household tools into hilariously impractical killing machines. And, of course, it influences the parkour movement, which allows you to keep well away from chewing teeth and clawing hands. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what happens when you add guns to this close-quarters formula? And I don’t mean one or two rusty pistols, but a whole armoury stocked with shotguns, assault rifles, and plentiful ammo. That’s a question the next game in the series, Dying Light: The Beast, poses. The answer is not the obvious one. Far from transforming into a regular first-person shooter, guns have turned Techland’s latest into something that feels closer to Crysis or even (if you squint a bit) Dishonored. They’re another layer of an increasingly varied toolset that ensures every encounter is a sandbox solved by your own rules.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For this month’s IGN First, I was able to play an hour-long mission from an early section of Dying Light: The Beast. This meant stepping into the combat boots of Kyle Crane, the returning protagonist of the original Dying Light. Held hostage and experimented on for 13 years by a shadowy figure known only as The Baron, I join Kyle a few hours into his quest for revenge. Deep within the new, much more rural zone of Castor Woods, I infiltrate one of The Baron’s factories. And, standing on the facility’s roof, I realise my options are more varied than the last time I played Dying Light. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dying Light: The Beast - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Using Kyle’s heightened “survivor” senses (a benefit of all those experiments he endured), I’m able to highlight the patrolling members of The Baron’s militia. Some are marked in orange, while others are red; an indication of who is armed with melee weapons or guns, respectively. It’s a colour-coded threat level that helps me set up a plan of action. Yes, it’s all very Batman: Arkham.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I start right in front of me with a blissfully unaware bowman. Approaching silently, I perform a melee takedown using a shiv I’ve crafted – much faster than choking him out – and then swipe the bow from his corpse. Bows were, of course, in Dying Light 2, but kept out of reach until the back half of the game. Their earlier introduction in The Beast promises a greater level of engagement options across the campaign, especially considering their ranged stealth potential. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notching an arrow, I headshot the bowman’s buddies, including a rifle-wielding sniper on the opposite roof. No one hears him slump to the floor, so I’m free to parkour across and add his gun to my collection. Once again, my engagement opportunities expand: no longer limited to firing single arrows and enduring long draw speeds, I can take out groups of charging melee enemies before they make it into striking range… although everyone around me will know exactly what’s going on. Might as well make a spectacle of it, then. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I dive down to the roof below, where a further two riflemen, a squad of brawlers, and – delightfully – a pile of explosive gas canisters await. The dive triggers a slow-motion effect. It’s hardly the slick bullet time of Max Payne and the old FEAR games, feeling more as if you’re suddenly travelling through sticky air rather than becoming John Wick, but it nonetheless successfully emphasises Kyle’s military background. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Taking more than a few pages from The Walking Dead’s book, you can now smear yourself in undead guts in order to mask your human scent.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With this expanded toolkit, Dying Light’s encounters have graduated into a space similar to Crysis and Far Cry’s sandboxes. Using Kyle’s survivor sense allows you to methodically remove enemies with guns from the playing field before going toe-to-toe with less dangerous foes. Flowing fluidly from stealth takedowns to silent headshots to shell-sputtering shoot-outs allowed me greater control over the space than I’ve come to expect from the typically messy melees of Dying Light 2. Combined with the parkour, which makes a respectable stand-in for teleportation, there’s even a little of Dishonored’s strategy to be found here, too – albeit less elegant in execution. My hope is that, beyond the boundaries of this demo, there are encounters that encourage a strong variety of approaches. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve reason to be hopeful. As I explore Castor Woods, I encounter a zombie wearing a battery pack that detonates on contact, sending arcing forks of electricity through the horde. Another wears an explosive canister on its back – just one good shot will turn him and his buddies into barbeque. Talking of seared flesh, I later acquire a flamethrower. It’s clear that there are plenty of toys to experiment with, and I hope that Techland is playful enough to use these elements to coax players into cleverly absurd solutions for clearing out the undead and deadly alike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that Techland has upped its game when it comes to stealth, too. The bow, shivs, and tools like throwing knives are naturally all very good at silently dispatching human opponents, but there’s now a method for quietly avoiding zombies, too. Taking more than a few pages from The Walking Dead’s book, you can now smear yourself in undead guts in order to mask your human scent, and then casually walk through the horde. It’s a simple stealth tool, but one that’s incredibly evocative of the fiction Dying Light revels in.     </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/06/dltb-02-1749214336850.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">But Kyle isn’t special because he can use a gun or take a bath in a zombie’s insides. Those aforementioned experiments have turned him into the titular Beast. It’s a similar backstory to that of Aiden Caldwell, the protagonist of Dying Light 2, but where Aiden’s infection gave him some zombie-like superhuman abilities, Kyle has become something much closer to a leaping wrecking ball. Triggered at will after taking and dealing enough damage to fill a meter, Beast Mode allows you to tear regular enemies apart with gory animations akin to Doom’s Glory Kills. A thunderous ground pound violently throws foes to the seven winds – using it indoors is effectively a screen wipe attack, sending zombies splattering into the walls and ceiling. All this came in handy against the demo’s final boss, a towering “Chimera” zombie known as a Behemoth, which is capable of hurling engine blocks and concrete boulders across the arena. The Behemoth has a number of easily recognised attack patterns, but the challenge is in its resilience, as well as the number of minions that shamble after you. With Beast Mode engaged, I was able to easily clear those mobs and inflict big damage spikes against the boss. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But as much as going toe-to-toe with another beast is good fun, I’m actually more interested in the utility aspects of Kyle’s mutations. Techland tells me that playtesters have used the Beast mode’s extended leap ability to bypass entire parkour challenges. And so it’s the unconventional uses of these abilities that promise to join the likes of guns and camouflaging yourself with guts in ensuring that The Beast feels like a meaningful upgrade over its predecessor. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The scope of this demo was pretty limited – in fact, it was largely a playable version of the hands-off presentation I saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dying-light-the-beast-reveal-trailer-gamescom-2024">at gamescom last year</a>, and so there is almost certainly more to see in time. But being able to wander about this small slice of the world on my own time allowed me to enjoy some of the smaller details. The world feels like a substantial upgrade over Dying Light 2, not so much in level design (although much of what I liked about the old town section of Villedor returns) but in atmosphere. The new weather effects system is exceptional, with storms drenching the landscape with heavy rain and winds whipping trees, bushes, and long grass into a frenzy. And when the sun sets, the light really does die. It’s nearly impossible to see during the witching hour, forcing you to sparingly use your flashlight to navigate between the patrol paths of the much more difficult nighttime terrors. Long-time fans who pine for the scarier nights of the first game should hopefully be well catered for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I left <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-the-beast-literally-brings-out-the-big-guns-for-a-shooting-heavy-spin-off-gamescom-2024">my appointment with Techland at gamescom last year</a>, I was somewhat skeptical as to how guns would affect the core ideas Dying Light is built on. Naturally, the studio wanted to show off its new toys, and that hands-off demo was played largely as a shooter. But having had the opportunity to play myself, in which I had the agency to choose when and where guns were deployed, I quickly learned that firearms are just one component of Dying Light: The Beast, not the main attraction. Their addition, alongside what feels like a strengthened inclusion of the bow and the series’ many trademark DIY melee solutions, made the demo’s encounters feel richer and more textured. Each combat scenario felt like a problem with a dozen solutions, rather than the melee mosh pits that I typically found myself in while playing Dying Light 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is how all this evolves over the wider game. There are several tools and weapons that I didn’t get extensive or any time at all with, such as the aforementioned flamethrower and oddities like a throwable shock knife, and so my hope is that The Beast constantly adds weapons with unique utilities to the toolkit. And then, of course, there’s your mutations; each Chimera you kill allows you to inject more freaky DNA into your veins and unlock a skill tree of powers. I can only hope that the further down those branches you go, the more wild your ability set becomes. And provided the campaign continues to offer up interesting challenges that encourage the use of both abilities and tools, then I think The Beast could be a much more interesting sequel than it initially appears to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">One of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s greatest strengths is its scalability. You can run it on the highest of high-end PCs or a years-old phone, and it's going to be playable either way. Players across all platforms can join parties and play battle royale, Creative, Fortnite Festival, or almost anything else the game has to offer--sans Saves The World mode--and each player will get a performance and visual experience tailored to their platform. Among many other reasons it's found such lasting success, this is key. You're not locked out based on where you're playing.</p><p dir="ltr">For my tastes, I still want that high-end experience, so I play Fortnite on my PC or my Xbox Series X most of the time. Switch 2 players have now joined the fray as the latest platform to host Epic's everything-game, and though it's a downgrade for those like me, for Switch 2 players, it's a sizable step forward.</p><p dir="ltr">Playing Fortnite on Switch 2 was nearly my first time playing anything on Nintendo's new hybrid console--save for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-madden-26-on-switch-2-and-it-didnt-suck/1100-6532037/">Madden 26 a few days ago</a>. Like that experience, I found Fortnite can't keep up with Xbox Series X|S or PS5. Textures are noticeably fuzzier; the pop-in of far-away objects, like trees as you glide down to the island, is quite common; and character models lack the same fidelity of the other major consoles. At first, this irritated me. A new console should move the needle, I felt. Why have I been frantically chasing down a Switch 2 for sale if it can't even offer me an experience the likes of which I've been playing for half a decade elsewhere?</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo, of course, is the reason. The Switch 2, like the original Switch, isn't trying to achieve performance parity with those other consoles. The Switch's debut was essentially Nintendo making it clearer than ever that it wasn't interested in the graphical arms race with Sony and Microsoft, and I can't really blame it given the success of its machine. The Switch 2 definitely moves the needle closer to those consoles, but certainly falls short.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4508461-4506873-fortnite-reload-nintendo-switch-2-1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4508461" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4508461-4506873-fortnite-reload-nintendo-switch-2-1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4508461"></a><figcaption>Switch 2 doesn't put Fortnite on par with other consoles, but neither does it have to.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4508461-4506873-fortnite-reload-nintendo-switch-2-1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">However, two things began to change my mind as I played more Fortnite on Switch 2. For one, handheld mode hides some of those aforementioned blemishes. Texture fidelity is hardly noticeable when I'm playing the game in my hands. The same goes for the character models. My assortment of skins--so many I hope I'm never able to calculate the true cost--look totally acceptable in Switch 2's handheld mode. And whether I was playing on a monitor or in my hands, the game offers a smooth 60fps frame rate.</p><p dir="ltr">I've often felt like I can't easily tell the difference between 4K and 1080p. If I intently look for it, I'll spot it, but in typical play sessions, it's the 60 frames I really demand because that's what I notice effortlessly. This is where Fortnite on Switch 2 really succeeds. The game looked terrible on Switch, to be blunt about it. That's no longer the case. On Switch 2, the frame rate boost carries it a long way forward, and eventually helped me forgive some of its other shortcomings compared to my preferred platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">I said there were two things that changed my mind about Switch 2's Fortnite. The other is Lego Odyssey. The survival-crafting game that debuted in Fortnite's massive 2023 update looks awesome on the Switch 2, and it occurred to me how important that will be on the kid-friendliest console out there. Once I played Lego Odyssey on Switch 2, I felt my frustration evaporating quickly. I pictured my kids playing this mode next to me on the couch while I joined them on my Xbox, and I'm sure that use case will be a popular one for families that game together.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortnite has been reinventing itself for years now. With experiences like Unreal Editor for Fortnite overhauling Creative mode, music integration in the form of Fortnite Festival and a new mode that lets players have a dance party with Sabrina Carpenter, and the abundance of Fall Guys and Lego games to play, Fortnite hasn't truly been a battle royale game in a long time. That remains its most-popular mode today, but the sum total of the game's other virtually limitless games to play make up a great deal of what younger players are playing when they boot up the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The Switch 2 isn't going to be where I play Fortnite battle royale, but it will surely become the go-to platform for my kids when they want to play Lego games, music games, or anything Creative has to offer. And in any case, it's going to look much nicer than the potato version that ran on the original Switch. I expect players who are siloed in Nintendo's ecosystem will be very impressed with Fortnite on Switch 2, even as I and others recognize it's still a technical half-step toward levels of detail we've been enjoying since 2020.</p>

            <p>Summer Game Fest's 2025 showcase is over for another year. Packed end-to-end with a whole slew of announcements and teasers, it even included a shadow-dropped <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> DLC, Overture.</p>
<p>If you missed part of it, all of it, or simply don't want to scrub through 120 minutes to see if the announcement you were hoping for popped up, here's every single thing announced at Summer Game Fest 2025 in the order they were revealed. Pray for my tendonitis. Enjoy!</p>
<h3> Mortal Shell 2</h3>
<p>The show kicked off by noting how many of Steam's biggest sellers this year have been from indie developers, and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-shell-2-revealed-at-summer-game-fest-coming-to-ps5-xbox-and-steam-in-2026">threw us into the evening's first announcement: Mortal Shell 2</a>. The dark fantasy action game, developed by Cold Symmetry, is coming to PC via Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series in 2026.</p>

<h3>Death Stranding 2</h3>
<p>We already knew that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-upcoming-death-stranding-2-panel-and-gameplay-showcase-will-be-streamed-online">Death Stranding 2 was getting its own premiere</a> separate from the main Summer Game Fest stage - that's coming tomorrow, 8th June - but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> accompanied Geoff on stage anyways, treating us to a "special exclusive clip for SGF", which you can check out below. The teaser lets us spend a little time with Neil and Lucy, after which Kojima reminded us that the sequel is set to release later this month on 24th June, 2025.</p>

<h3>Chronicles: Medieval</h3>
<p>"Thou shalt not kill, so the priests tell us, so the lord commands," says some gruff, disembodied voice as we zoom in on a blacksmith blacksmithing. Apparently, ambitious men do not listen, though, which is why Chronicles: Medieval invites you to forge your destiny in a host of epic historical battles when it drops in early access in 2026.</p>

<h3>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds x Minecraft World</h3>
<p>After introducing us to the latest Sonic racing game, Sonic creator officer, Takashi Iizuka took us into a CrossWorld promotion with Minecraft, where familiar Minecraft folk zoom around the place in little rectangular carts. It's quite the spectacle. There's no release date yet, just the promise that it'll be "drifting across dimensions soon".</p>

<h3>Mouse P.I. for Hire</h3>
<p>Join private investigator Jack Pepper on a guns blazing, jazz-fueled adventure in Mouse: P.I. For Hire. The inaugral title from Fumi Games, Mouse P.I. stars Troy Baker and combines "the charm of hand-drawn rubber hose animation inspired by the classic cartoons of the 1930s with the adrenaline and action of an explosive first person shooter". It's out later this year on PC via Steam, Switch, and current- and last-gen consoles.</p>

<h3>Felt That: Boxing</h3>

Step into the shoes of Ezra "Fuzz-E" Wright, an unlikely hero with a big heart. There's no release date for Steam as yet, and no mention of a console release at all. We'll have to watch this fuzzy space...

<h3>Splitgate 2</h3>
<p>Splitgate 2 - often referred to as "halo with portals" - is in the pink in the sequel, showing that even with a light, bright pastel palette, you can still get your arse kicked. It released at the end of May, so this is just a reminder that the follow-up free-to-play shooter is finally here.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/aether-iron-sets-up-beautiful-world-for-gritty-noir-story<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine a 1930s New York where technology had been created to float parts of the city into the sky, flying cars were common, and everyone spoke with enough pulp to put Humphrey Bogart to shame. This is the world of <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em>, a new detective game, by Seismic Squirrel.</p>

<p>At SGF we had a chance to sit down with Tyler Whitney, Narrative Lead, and Joshua Enz, Producer, to talk about what inspired the game, what experience players can look forward to, and even got some time hands on to explore a picturesque bar in the clouds, take on a mysterious man in car on car combat, and explore our home base.</p>

<h2>What A World To Live In</h2>

<p>In <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em>, players take on the role of Gia, a down-on-her-luck detective who has had one too many jobs go sideways. Returning to her employer, Mr Black, she's handed the job of escorting Nellie to the Lowers.</p>

<p>This job quickly escalates as both Gia and Nellie are thrown into danger and important and mysterious documents that Nellie was holding close are stolen.</p>



<p>The game is broken up into two gameplay styles, the first is exploration. As Gia you'll be able to interact with scenes and locations, having conversations with those you come across, or perhaps find an item or two to pick up for use later.</p>

<p>My first experience of exploration was in a bar with a glass floor, the view extending down to nothing but clouds below, the interior decked out as you'd expect a speakeasy of the time, but with a 'Neo-Decopunk' aesthetic.</p>

<p>When asked about what led to the idea of merging the past, of 1930s New York with a futuristic concept like that of Aether, the simple response from Whitney was that "we know that we want to have something beautiful, but was different." Whitney also offered up his love of movies like 2004's Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow, though he jokingly accepted that he might be in the minority for that.</p>

<p>Seeing the gleaming skyline of the city it reminded me of the Metropolis of Superman's Silver Age. Beautiful skyscrapers that tell you that this is a safe and glorious place to live, that's ignoring the other locations in this game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aether-iron-interior.jpg?itok=DHq_o0fO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aether-iron-interior.jpg?itok=iPyhMbLv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>After picking up a bottle of booze and prodding the passed-out drunk, I approached the bar to open dialogue with the barkeep, a fellow employee of Mr Black.</p>

<h2>Explore And Interact With The World of <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em></h2>

<p>Dialogue in<em> Aether &amp; Iron</em> is fully voiced, letting you really get sucked into the noir dialogue filled with flowery phrasing and an internal monologue that exposits without feeling like it's spoonfeeding information to the player.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Additional Voice &amp; Text Options On The Way<br>
It was explained to me that after <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> launches at the end of the year they will be adding Spanish and Chinese text localization, as well as working to add Spanish and Japanese Voices</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whitney attributed the passion for this genre with characters like Phillip Marlowe. He spoke about how he was given reign to write and that he then made it "flowery as hell." He wanted to write in a way that would make you feel, he laughed referencing the line "walking a knifed edge with bare feet" and how even now the thought of that made his toes curl in response.</p>

<p>At various points in conversation you'll be prompted with choices, these might be of no consequence merely moving the conversation forward, could only be possible if you have a certain item, or could be settled with a speech check.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aether-iron-taxi-rank.jpg?itok=-OlNwGYd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aether-iron-taxi-rank.jpg?itok=7agGhhh2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>An element of the speech checks that I loved were the inclusion of dice rolls. Each would prompt you to roll two dice, add your relevant stats, and any companion bonuses to try to meet the difficulty level of the check. You might be trying to fool someone, get some additional information out of them, or press your luck with an intimidating statement.</p>

<h2>The Choices… And Consequences Of Dialogue</h2>

<p>While I cleared most of the speech checks during my time playing, earning additional experience and earning additional money for Gia, there was one extremely difficult check that I failed. This didn't lead to any immediate negative repercussions but instead a funny moment where Nellie made fun of Gia and her very obvious attempt at lying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It might not have earned me experience as a character, but as a player, it showed a side to this new character I hadn't seen yet and endeared me further to her.</p>

<p>I asked about what kinds of negative repercussions there could be, and if you failed enough, if there were "fail states" where you'd have to revert to a save. The answer I got was quite surprising as there could definitely be scenarios where you keep talking back and end up getting shot because of it.</p>

<p>Each of these fail states are presented with the idea of a retro newspaper spinning up towards the screen. When one happens it's something monumental enough that it would make the front page, Whitney explained that internally they "view them as hidden collectibles."</p>

<p>The choices that you make during the story of <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> each have varying weights and some can even lead to exclusive branched narrative paths.</p>

<p><em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> is expected to take about 20 hours for an initial playthrough, and Whitney mused that if you knew exactly what you were doing it would take about three playthroughs to see everything, but I'm guessing if you're going in blind it might take a lot longer.</p>

<p>Due to the way you not only interact with the world, but also pick up and develop relationships with different characters and factions of <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> there are currently ~16 different endings. These aren't all wholly unique but much like a game like Fallout has endings for individual character stories, faction plots, and the overall game each of the permutations can lend to one another.</p>

<p>Outside of exploration and interrogation when making your way across the city there are events that can prompt such as road combat.</p>

<p>Here the combat is turnbased, functioning on a grid where every turn you have a certain number of actions you can perform. You can ram your car or unleash a shotgun blast, or simply shift from lane to lane.</p>

<p>A neat element of movement is that while shifting lanes left and right you'll use up a point of stamina, but going up and down (accelerating and decelerating) you have complete freedom.</p>

<p>Other dynamic elements of this combat were other drivers on the road, that you could use to get inbetween yourself and whoever you're facing, and also lanes that appear and disappear during combat. Just like real life you may be asked to merge or shift lane so as to stay on the road, be sure to pay attention!</p>

<h2>Rooted In History</h2>

<p>An interesting aspect of <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> for history buffs is that there are certain characters and elements that are rooted in the real life history of New York. An example given was that of the White Wings, the group of uniformed cleaners for New York established in 1895 by Colonel George E. Waring Jr.</p>

<p>Each of the segments of New York that have taken to the skies in <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> function like company towns, with an organization at the head, and one of these factions is a militaristic group of cleaners.</p>

<p>It's by creating the world first, and then creating a story that inhabits it that the team hopes to create "a world that others feel so immersed in that when they walk away they continue to play in their heads."</p>

We wanted to create something different, a space where players can exhale. A space that values listening, empathizing, and slow, intentional conversations. With <em>Fireside Feelings</em>, we hope to inspire joy, catharsis, and connection through something as simple—and human—as sharing words beneath the stars.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via The CoLab:</p><blockquote><p>Following a philosophy that “we all need a good talk under the stars,” <em>Fireside Feelings</em> sees players sharing heartfelt and empathetic thoughts about diverse—and sometimes challenging—topics.</p><p>Players choose and customize their avatar from one of six different animals, including a besuited bear, a barista bee and a skater fox. Once selected, players begin their journey across meditative locales, including a beach, woodland and a record store.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>There they’ll meet Spark, a sentient campfire guiding them through a series of questions inspiring thoughtful and empathetic answers under the stars. Sat on the other side of the fire is a second animal, sharing another player’s previous answers to the same questions and forming a contemplative, yet asymmetrical, conversation on the chosen topic.</p><p>To provide a highly robust level of player safety, <em>Fireside Feelings</em> anonymizes answers and the player’s in-game character name. Responses given by the other player across the campfire are not live, but chosen from a moderated database of conversations.</p><p>Furthermore, sensitive topics that might be discussed and might be triggering for players—including violence, self-harm, mental illness and more—can be avoided by removing them from the discussion at the start of the game or via the main menu.</p><p>Team Empreintes and The CoLab have worked with Safe In Our World, the games industry’s mental health charity, to integrate a link to the Safe In Our World website from within the experience, where players can access resources and support.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the launch trailer below.</p><h2><span>Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Fireside Feelings Launch Trailer - Wholesome Direct" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y3j3JRzardU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Amid news on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/007-first-light/" data-ref-id="5000-522472">007 First Light</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mindseye/" data-ref-id="5000-647385">MindsEye</a>, IO Interactive also had a lot to say about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination/" data-ref-id="5000-600315">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> during the first-ever IO Interactive Showcase. But the one that caught my eye most of all is a Hitman co-op mode. IO told me in an interview after the show how its existence is a sign of how the Hitman team is still exploring new ways to expand the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"Even the early prototypes [of co-op mode] that we showed a little bit of [on stage], it's just a different experience to play with a friend in that world," Christian Elverdam, CCO of IO Interactive told me. "And I'm sure, if you know the game, you could imagine a gazillion ways [to play differently]. Like, 'You could do <em>this</em>, I could do <em>that</em>!'"</p><p dir="ltr">Elverdam told me the game's ambitions have led to the team being on a perpetual "journey of discovery," the same journey that spawned the roguelite Freelancer mode two years ago. I asked him how long the team plans to support the game, and he didn't have a timeline. "We're not done figuring out what this thing is. Because [Freelancer was made by] a fairly small team that went like, 'We have this killer idea about what we could do with all of this body of work. What if we did this?' I think co-op will do some of the same things. And so we're super curious about that. I feel we have super fertile ground to keep innovating."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4508457-ioishowcase2025-officiallivestream42-13screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4508457" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4508457-ioishowcase2025-officiallivestream42-13screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4508457"></a><figcaption>Hitman co-op mode will change the way players interact with its intricate sandboxes, in some ways IO tells me it can't even foresee yet itself.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4508457-ioishowcase2025-officiallivestream42-13screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Although Elverdam admitted that the co-op mode is far from finished and still taking shape, he made it clear that it'll be a mode within Hitman: World of Assassination, the all-in-one Hitman hub that houses everything the series has released since 2016. "It's still early days, but it's clearly inside the World of Assassination. Stone and Knight already exist as characters. So we just felt it was fun to do a little bit of a different take, and we're still exploring that. So, I mean, we honestly will come back when we know a little bit more. It's not particularly clear. It's a different dynamic. When you have two players, and it's not going to be Diana and Agent 47, it's something different, and it's super interesting."</p><p dir="ltr">The co-op mode is far off, but you can experience Hitman continuing to build on itself as early as today and continuing later this year. Two more celebrity Elusive Targets have been teased for later, while the first of this new trio is out now and free for all players. In it, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-villain-coming-to-hitman-today-as-elusive-target/1100-6532213/">Mads Mikkelsen reprises his role as Casino Royale's Le Chiffre</a>.</p>

		<p>Lizardcube know a thing or two about reviving classic Sega game franchises. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">Streets of Rage 4</a> is right up there as one of the very best beat ’em up sequels, capturing so much of what made the originals great, making for a masterful modernised tribute to the genre. And now it’s time for Shinobi to take the spotlight once more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shinobi: Art of Vengeance – Another retro revival masterclass" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cgyl43tXLZE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Developed in collaboration with Sega themselves, this time around, Shinobi: Art of Vengeance is a game that unapologetically makes you feel awesome. Where the gaming world now feels like it’s dominated by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/lies-of-ps-overture-dlc-is-out-today/">dark</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/code-vein-ii-revealed-by-bandai-namco-coming-in-2026/">fantasy</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/mortal-shell-2-is-coming-in-2026-for-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs/">Soulslikes</a> and tough melee combat where you have to earn every break and opening, where you’re punished and staggered for missing any block or dodge window, Shinobi: Art of Vengeance turns the tables and has you stagger and interrupt you enemies with impunity.</p>


<p>Of course, you’d expect nothing less from a master ninja like Joe Musashi. He’s now quite literally the last man standing from the Oboro Clan, with his home town having been burned to the ground by a whole army, and with almost all his compatriots having been turned to stone, somehow. Outside of Joe’s protege, he’s apparently now the only thing in the way of world domination by Lord Ruse and ENE Corp. It’s a good thing that he’s the best of the bunch, isn’t it?</p>


<p>Right from the off, Joe feels powerful. It’s almost funny how the first ninja you meet –&nbsp;a base level goon that slings shuriken your way –&nbsp;is so confident of claiming victory, when Joe can deftly double jump over the slow-moving projectile and dispatch him in a single attack. There’s a pleasing weight to Joe’s attacks, the halts in animation as his strikes land adding to that heft.</p>
<p>And again, as tougher enemies emerge, such as the beefier yellow clad enemies, your ability to interrupt their sign-posted attacks shines through. There’s no blocking needed here, you just get your strikes in first. Of course, that does become trickier as we progress through the stage and encounter more mystical foes. Archers that fire lightning arrows up and down on your position, strange toad-like enemies, enemies that have the form of Olympic axe throwers.</p>

<p>As enemies are weakened by your attacks, you can build up the power with certain attack types to pull off an Execution Move, zipping across the screen to land deadly finishing blows of anyone that has the symbol above their head. And of course, there’s then screen-clearing Ninjutsu, coming with flamboyant animated cutscenes and feeding off your building Rage gauge.</p>
<p>Platforming is also light and fluid. Of course Joe can wall-jump and even dash up them a few feet, but once he’s retrieved them, use claws to cling on and climb walls, while there’s an air-dash to bridge larger gaps, a rapid twirl to hurdle over boxes, and more. A part of the progression will be uncovering new Ningi tools to overcome obstacles, and applying magical amulets to give even more enhanced abilities.</p>

<p>It’s all brought together by a fantastic hand-crafted art style that simultaneously feels like it draws upon classic 90s cartoons and has modern touches like dynamic edge lighting from the surroundings that you’re running through. After the opening mission, we skipped ahead to a later level, trying to halt an attack on a city in the middle of a fireworks display – with so much action on rooftops and small hanging ledges, it was just as satisfying to juggle enemies and kick them off the stage, as it was to fully defeat them.</p>
<p>It built up to a fun boss battle against a spider mech, using a charged attack to crash through its energy shield and then unleashing a string of damage, before backing off to avoid bullets and fire grenades.</p>

<p>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance is shaping up to be another absolutely brilliant retro revival from Lizardcube, bringing another Sega classic back in glorious fidelity and style.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>! It's an extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>! A fact that will leave many with the question, "is this the one that'll push the genre to the mainstream?" Personally I haven't the foggiest, and I don't have a horse in that race either. That kind of nonsense matters more to shareholders than it does to little old me. Still, we've not got a huge amount of time to wait to find out if Arc Raiders is the one to make extraction shooters big, as during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pondering-geoffs-orbs">Geoff's Livestream of Questionable Quality and Orbs</a>, it got a release date.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
That date is October 30th, a little over four months away. Just in time for Halloween, too, which isn't at all thematically appropriate or relevant, but, it's a holiday? Sort of? Yeah, let's go with that. The shooter held a technical test last month to see if the thing actually works, and according to a press release, executive producer Aleksander Grøndal said it was the "best rehearsal we could get."

<p>
Grøndal explained that there are the usual things developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/embark-studios">Embark Studios</a> have to do ahead of launch like bugs, polish, and performance improvements. But there's also more gameplay oriented things like balance and the player economy to work on. Notably, he also said that they're working on "an even better onboarding experience for players who come in new to this genre." Quite clearly, Embark understand that they have some work to do to get people to stick with their extraction shooter.
</p>
<p>
For those not yet on the uptake with Arc Raiders, you'll be playing as one of those titular raiders in an alternate future of earth overrun by evil robots (the titular Arc). You'll need to scavenge what's left of the surface world to build up your home underground, either working with others, or facing off against them, depending on how co-operative you're feeling. Good looking vibes so far, but the proof will be in the pud.

Whether you are a whisker away from solving a puzzle or looking for a more relaxed experience, you can ask your furry friend for assistance in Logic Assist mode. This feature shows possible solutions to help complete puzzles with two options: An “automatic case-solving” button and a “show mistakes” button. For experienced nonogram players seeking a greater challenge, “Nini’s Challenge” offers a more difficult variant of each puzzle, unlocking colorways for furniture in your home.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-soul-of-the-last-of-us-is-in-gustavo-santaolalla%E2%80%99s-music.1211091/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/interview/681172/gustavo-santaolalla-interview-the-last-of-us-music<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When fans nervously tuned in to watch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23543145/hbo-the-last-of-us-review">HBO’s adaptation of one of their favorite video games</a>, there was one familiar presence that immediately calmed their nerves: the mournful guitar of Gustavo Santaolalla. As certain story beats changed and beloved polygonal faces were replaced with new actors, the beating heart of <em>The Last of Us</em> — its mesmerizing, tension-ridden score — survived the transition to TV intact.</p><p>“[Series creator] Neil Druckmann has said that my music is part of the DNA of <em>The Last of Us</em>,“ Santaolalla says. “I think the fact that we kept the sonic fabric — that we didn’t do an orchestral score for the series — has been instrumental in keeping those fans of the games fans of the series, too.”</p><p>Born and raised in Buenos Aires, Santaolalla first started releasing music when he was 17. Loving both English rock bands and the traditional Argentine folk music that he was raised on, Santaolalla melded both into his own unique sound, part of a genre called rock nacional. Before he could fully make his mark, Santaolalla’s family fled the Argentine junta dictatorship in 1978, moving to Los Angeles, where his unique sound soon caught the attention of filmmakers. Snapped up to score the 2000 film <em>Amores Perros</em> and 2003’s <em>21 Grams, </em>their success led to Santaolalla composing the soundtracks for <em>Brokeback Mountain</em> and <em>Babe</em>l, both of which won him Oscars.</p><p>Santaolla’s sonic secret? Embracing the eloquence of silence. “I work so much with silence and space, because silences sometimes can be louder than a note that you’re playing,” says Santaolalla. “I remember on <em>Brokeback Mountain</em> when I first sent them the music, the producer said ‘I thought you were pulling my leg at first, because you wait so long to play the next note!’”</p><div><p>“Silences sometimes can be louder than a note that you’re playing.”</p></div><p>After winning two Oscars back to back, Santaolalla carefully considered his next career move. Despite being a self-professed “terrible gamer” Santaolalla tells me he always loved watching his son play, mesmerized by the on-screen kineticism. “I always thought that if somebody connects this at an emotional level with a player, it’s going to be a revolution.”</p><p>It turns out, the universe had picked up on Santaolalla’s newest interest. Post-Oscars, he was approached by several game companies to do music, but turned them down because “I’m very picky about the work that I do.” That includes a lucrative gaming project that he is careful not to name. “Everyone thought I was crazy!” he chuckles. Still, Santaolalla quietly hoped that a more emotionally-resonant project would materialize.</p><p>“So, I waited… and then Neil appeared,” Santaolalla says. “When Neil told his colleagues that he wanted me to do this, [his colleagues ] said, No, Gustavo is not going to be interested — he won two Oscars! But when Neil [told me] the story, and that he wanted to do a game that connects with people on an emotional level… I was sold.</p><p>What even Neil Druckmann wasn’t prepared for, however, was that Gustavo’s music would become just as crucial a presence as Ellie and Joel. In a post apocalyptic world where life is scarce and danger lurks around every corner, silence hangs in the air like a threat. Santaolalla’s scuffed notes, discordant melodies and screeching fret slides reverberate across the dilapidated city streets, feeling as unpredictable as the world Ellie and Joel inhabit.</p><div><p>“I love the use of imperfections, even errors or mistakes.”</p></div><p>“I love the use of imperfections, even errors or mistakes,” Santaolalla explains. “Any professional guitar player when they’re recording tend to avoid all kinds of noises; when you run your hand on the fretboard or little glitches in your playing. But sometimes, I’ll push those in my mix, and I think that humanizes it. That’s why many people have said that my music becomes like a character — a presence. It’s why I play things myself.”</p><div><p>In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286964/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4">the second game</a>, Gustavo’s music becomes a physical part of the fiction, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281499/the-last-of-us-part-2-ps4-guitar-touchpad">Ellie carrying a guitar throughout her quest for vengeance</a>. She takes out the instrument during welcome moments of downtime, offering cathartic respite. And just like Gustavo’s score, these beautiful vignettes break up the harrowing silence, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tv-reviews/644415/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-hbo">which carries through in the second season of the show</a>.</p></div><p>“I love the TV series too,” says Santaolalla. “ For the show, Neil associated himself with another incredible talent, Craig Mazin — the guy that did <em>Chernobyl</em> — who knows that media and that language. I think it was a big, big challenge, because when you go from one media to another one, people say no, I like the original better! So, I think, once again, that the way we have used the music has been instrumental to keep that fan base attached.”</p><p>He adds that “I think that when a story is really great, like a theatrical piece — like Shakespeare — it doesn’t matter who plays the character. Obviously Pedro Pascal’s Joel is different than the Joel from the game, but the substance of the character is so powerful that those things are just superficial. They could have done this as a series, as a feature film, as a puppet theatre piece, or an animation and it will still land regardless — because it’s just great writing.”</p><p>Now as Santaolalla finds himself releasing his very own instrument — the Guitarocko — it feels like the culmination of the musical journey he started as a teen. Melding the traditional Bolivian 10 stringed ronroco with the form factor of a Fender Stratocaster, Gustavo feels a father-like pride for his musical creation: the 73-year-old is invigorated by what <em>The Last Of Us</em> has given him at this stage in his career.</p><p>“I’ve been blessed with the fact that I have connected with an audience since I was very young,” he says. “But the way I connect with the fans of <em>The Last of Us</em> and the way they connect with the music… here’s a special devotion that is really beautiful. I have this new audience which is fantastic, and I love that they didn’t know me as an artist or as a film composer! Now they look for my music, and they discover these things. It’s been a gift for me, at this point — after everything that I’ve been through — to be involved with a project like this.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<article id="article">
<header><section>
<p>Now that's worth buying a console for!</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="mix switch 1 and 2 controllers" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0fd2ae727169d/mix-switch-1-and-2-controllers.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yes, friends. We've spent the past few days pushing and pulling at our new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2s</a> as we get to figuring out just what this baby is really capable of. And, well, it seems as though it's capable of some quite twisted stuff.</p>
<p>Or at least <em>a bit mixed up</em>, as it turns out you can actually mix and match your Switch 1 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-differences-how-do-the-new-controllers-compare">Switch 2 Joy-Con</a> as working pairs and get stuck into playing games and browsing the Switch 2 console menus in the manner of someone wearing two completely differently-sized gloves.</p>
<p>There's no real point to it - unless you can't find the Joy-Con 2 you're looking for or someone else is using it. Indeed, we hadn't even thought to check until we saw the r/NintendoSwitch post hanging below this sentence:</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ulmjop&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Not wanting to simply take <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l583dn/you_can_mix_and_match_switch_1_2_joycons_as_its/">u/iOvercompensate's</a> word without investigating a little further (no offence, we're just massively paranoid from existing in this timeline), we can confirm that we have achieved the same result. We were never in doubt.</p>

<p>In order to do the same, for whatever reason (maybe you've got relatives over and nobody is speaking anymore - a party trick might ease hostilities!), simply jump into the controller settings on Switch 2, then go to change your grip order, then press 'L' and 'R' to detect the Joy-Con you wish to mix. Ta-da!</p>
<p>Now. Does it work the other way, though? Can you go out and buy some fancy Switch 2 Joy-Con to use on your OG Switch?</p>

<p>Eh...no. No, you cannot. Silly us.</p>

The goal of the wolves is to murder all the lambs, while the lambs' goal is to discover who the wolves are to put a stop to their murder spree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players explore the mansion, collecting survival tools, gear, and weapons from chests and merchants scattered throughout. Tokens can be collected from quest completion and spent to unlock certain chests for better gear. There are over 20 different characters to choose from, all with different abilities that can be leveled up throughout a match, and they all can equip all sorts of different weapons from guns to knives to grenades to fend off members of the opposing team.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When a player is murdered, a clue is left on their body as to who the murderer was, which players can use to try and deduce the culprit. The clues might be hair, skin, fingerprints, blood, or clothing, all of which can help you narrow down who the wolves are. Good news, it looks like the game tracks clues for you, helping you narrow down wolves with UI markers indicating that someone is getting increasingly suspicious.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once a lamb has identified a wolf, it's their job to dispatch them before they can kill anyone else. You'll automatically be eliminated if you kill as a lamb as another lamb, so Killer Inn encourages you not to just go on a murder spree to try and save yourself. There are also safe zones scattered around where wolves are forbidden from killing lambs, because the staff in the vicinity will immediately out their identity to other lambs. There's another win condition, too: there's a boat at the harbor the lambs can unlock and use to escape, though its dispatch is challenging.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Killer Inn is gearing up for a closed beta over Steam sometime soon, but it doesn't have a release date just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Yakuza 0: Director's Cut Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156551/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a> was the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/yakuza_kiwami">Yakuza</a> game — after many, many attempts on my part — that finally and fully opened my eyes to the magic of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's long-running (and entirely bats**t) franchise. This was the one that finally did me in.</p>
<p>And from the moment its <em>incredible</em> opening cutscene sequence kicks in, it's not hard to see why, it's not hard to know you're in the very best of company with Yakuza 0. It's a lavish, opulent, gritty, violent and wholly adult affair, that also happens to be incredibly cheesy, almost ludicrously silly, and full of good-intentioned heart. It's a complicated old thing, is this Yakuza malarkey.</p>
<p>On the topic of 'complicated', this is also a series that, for understandable reasons, I constantly see people wondering how or where to get started with. How do you approach it? Which game should you go with first? The answer, my friends, is simple. You start with Yakuza 0.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza 0: Director's Cut Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156545/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This majestic prequel gives you the Yakuza experience in its most coherent and well-rounded form (at least it did until <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/yakuza_like_a_dragon">Yakuza: Like A Dragon</a> arrived, but that's another story). A properly epic gangster tale of the rise of Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima — two of gaming's great protagonists — as they battle on the mean streets of Tokyo and Osaka circa 1988, it sets the stage for all that follows in the series. Which is a lot. Oh boy, it's a lot.</p>
<p>Everything here, from the neon-soaked streets of its two impressively open locations, to the cast of absolute maniac criminal underworld characters you'll meet (and then likely kill), it feels, as all of these games do, weirdly authentic in its characterisations, and in the bizarre vibe it strikes, even though it's completely off-the-rails bonkers a lot of the time.</p>
<p>If you know Yakuza, you know the deal. It's a bit rough, rude, borderline pervy at times (although the devs have done very well in reigning this side in more recently), and it somehow manages to mix extremely cheesy (in the best way) dialogue, always fantastically acted, with serious real-world issues and the occasional bit of actual emotion.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza 0: Director's Cut Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156549/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Kiryu and Majima are incredibly likeable characters to get stuck into controlling, too. They're cool, funny, dumb as the rest of us, and incredibly desperate to be loved. Just like me. It's a winning combo, especially when they also happen to be quite excellent at beating large gangs of armed thugs in combat that, back in 2015, was the most polished and absorbing the series had seen yet. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, you understand, but it feels slicker, the animations are better, and each of our protags has got three styles to fight in, giving you lots more options in how you want to approach battles than you may expect. This is a very, very well-made brawler, is what I'm saying.</p>
<p>Did you know that one of Majima's fighting stances is breakdancing, by the way? That's a good window into how silly this whole thing manages to be at all times. And who doesn't enjoy the franchise's signature environmental and weapons-based takedowns? Bike to the face, anyone? Traffic cone to the nuts? Come and get it, mate. And bring your pals.</p>
<p>It's also tickled us forever now, how none of these folk, no matter how badly you beat them off a storefront, ever die. It's just that kind of thing. Don't feel bad. They only die during big scenes. You can go ham with that cafe chair, he can't feel it.</p>

<p>The Yakuza games have always chosen a pleasing sort of moment-to-moment depth over sheer size in terms of their open worlds, too. This most likely, of course, originates from technical limitations, but now in the modern-future-terror-world in which we currently exist, they continue to stick with this setup to an extent, and it pays dividends here (as it continues to with more recent entries, and flashy Yakuza spin-offs like the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/judgment">Judgment</a> series). Now I'm not saying the world isn't big and impressive — it is — it's just not gonna make you take a bike and cycle in a straight line for 40 minutes to your next objective.</p>
<p>With Ryu Ga Gotoku, you get locations that, whilst often a little smaller this way, come alive thanks to the fact they're stuffed full of NPCs to talk to, get to know, and have fun with. They've got bars to hang out and get drunk off your ass in. You can go play pool, darts, do some karaoke, hit a disco. And these are things you can get better at, and be rewarded for doing. They open up quests and embiggen your circle of (incredibly unstable and violent) friends.</p>
<p>Or maybe you prefer golf? Poker? Fishing? What about arcades, mate? They've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sega_ages_space_harrier">Space Harrier</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/vcarcade/super_hang-on">Super Hang-On</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sega_ages_out_run">Out Run</a>, to name a few. You might not know this yet if you haven't played the game in the past, but you're about to become fully addicted to the fantastic Cabaret Club minigame here. We won't spoil it.</p>

<p>The main narrative, which sees both our protagonists become embroiled in turf wars that push them into contact with one another, is as excellent as it ever is in these games. Like a great big OTT soap opera stuffed full of psychotic killers, men running around in nappies, a guy called Mr. Libido and...well...let's just say Michael Jackson may or may not show up and need your help killing some zombies.</p>
<p>The majesty (and sometimes surprising grimness) of the main story is offset by a ton of side stuff which, whilst sometimes quite filler-y in nature, is mostly composed of very entertaining and well-written diversions. This melding of kooky comedy, off-kilter weirdness, and serious criminal activity has served the series well for decades, and in Yakuza 0 it's perhaps at its finest, certainly in terms of the franchise before it branched out into the turn-based <strong>Like A Dragon</strong> games, which are now my personal faves.</p>
<p>In terms of this Director's Cut on Switch 2, well, we have been spoiled, my friends. In close-ups, this version looks as good, if not better, than Yakuza 0 running on a PS4. Docked mode sees slick 4K/60fps goodness, whilst in portable it looks pristine in ways I never thought possible. There are volumetric effects, shadows and reflections on advertising boards here that I definitely haven't seen before, and it all looks great.</p>

<p>We also get a new mode in this Director's Cut, alongside a full English dub (it's really not good, with Kiryu being particularly terrible, but hey, at least the option is there!) and some 30 minutes or thereabouts of new story scenes. Nice! All of this stuff really is gravy, too, as this is perhaps the best of all the Yakuza games, certainly pre-Like A Dragon, and it's genuinely never looked or played nicer.</p>
<p>With regards to the new scenes specifically, I'm not gonna say anything about them, because it's spoiler town centre, but it's going to be interesting, to say the least, to see how fans who've played the game feel about the rearrangement of a certain incident. It's not a biggie to me, personally, but there is definitely going to be some push-back on this change, that much is for sure. It doesn't affect things in any way that would have me change my thoughts on the game, though, so don't stress if you're coming in fresh.</p>
<p>The new multiplayer mode, Red Light Raid, has been very quiet thus far when I've tried, but it does allow for solo raids, alongside online with randoms, or with friends locally. It's fine, a basic wave battle-typed affair that sees you earn money, which you then use to unlock and upgrade characters. It's a nice bonus, but it does feel throwaway, unless you decide to commit and rise through the online leaderboards.</p>

<p>Choosing a character (the game gives you a big juicy paycheck to get started, so you can pick a fancy one) sees you then jump into street scraps in a team of four. Enemy groups are impressively large, and there are tough bosses and other aspects thrown at you as you attempt to clear hordes before your timer/health run out. Again, it's <em>fine</em>, but I'm not gonna let it affect my overall opinion of the main game, as that's what we are all here for.</p>
<p>And so with that, it's a big score indeed for a big old package. This is a phenomenal game from opening cutscene to close, a true gangster epic that gives newcomers the perfect place to start with this evergreen series. In it's Switch 2 form, it also now represents my favourite way to play this one, reclining on my sofa whilst kicking Yakuza butt. Just like God intended.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yakuza 0 is the best of the traditional-styled Yakuza games, with the most complex story and interesting characters of the lot. It's also the ideal place for newcomers to get started with this weird and wonderful series.</p>
<p>The new multiplayer mode is a little throwaway, for sure, and the fights do get repetitive (turn-based Yakuza FTW), but otherwise, this is a phenomenal port of an epic adventure that's now my favourite way to get down on the mean streets of 1980s Tokyo and Osaka.</p></section>

<figure><a title="switch 2 battery poll" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/31fdc712f2c15/switch-2-battery-poll.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>With gamers across the globe now settling in to put their <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> consoles through their paces, we've been seeing a bunch of media outlets, alongside eager social media and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/">Reddit</a> users, report in on how they're finding the battery life thus far.</p>
<p>For full transparency, we've yet to run a rigorous battery test here at Nintendo Life, but from this writer's personal experience it's taking around the two-hour mark roughly, to drain things right down whilst playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>. Our editor, Gavin, is getting about the same running <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a>, too.</p>
<p>This may be disappointing, though <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-battery-life-how-does-it-compare">it falls pretty much in-line with what we expected</a> given Nintendo's officially indicated <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250402.html">2-6 hours</a> estimates and roughly the same as Switch 1 (before it saw a few model revisions).</p>
<p>Gamers online are reporting roughly the same figures in some cases. However, there seems to be a growing number of folk saying that they aren't even managing to reach the magic 2-hour mark whilst playing bigger games.</p>

<p>Of course, with the fact Mario Kart World is such a big, beautiful, online sort of deal, we expect the battery to drain faster, but it's not great news to see that, in some scenarios, people apparently aren't getting two hours out of it.</p>
<p>What's more (and we can confirm this one), the battery in standby mode — when you've set your Switch 2 down for the evening — seems to be draining seriously quickly in some cases. It seems it goes from a full charge to 59% on some consoles doing this, (as it has done with mine left overnight).</p>

<p>Judging from some of the responses to the post above, there are a whole bunch of players who are finding that the battery is draining too quickly for their liking. Obviously, there are a lot of factors at work here; screen brightness, downloads running in the background, whether you're using GameChat, and so on, but there's a pattern of complaints developing.</p>
<p>We'll be carrying out some tests of our own and will return with our own official findings in due course. But, in the interim, we'd love to hear how you have found the battery so far. How's it been for Mario Kart? What about 'smaller' games? And, if you've had time to take note, how does the battery do whilst in rest mode?</p>
