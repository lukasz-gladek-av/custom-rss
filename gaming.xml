			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro could come with 2TB of storage, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the Broken Silicon podcast, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a> revealed that they have seen a PS5 Pro devkit and confirmed that it comes with 2TB of storage. While the storage space could be lower for the retail system, the fact that Microsoft is releasing an Xbox Series X with 2TB of storage suggests that Sony could do the same for what is effectively a premium gaming system.</p>
<p>On a related note, the PlayStation 5 Pro is likely to be a quiet console that runs cool. According to Moore's Law is Dead, the devkit uses the same power connector as the base model, meaning Sony is not going to push the system, keeping the same power draw. This, in conjunction with the transistor increase over the base model, should make the system quiet and cool.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has quickly become one of the worst-kept secrets in gaming in 2024. After months of rumors, we ourselves <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-was-an-open-secret-at-gamescom-2024/">heard</a> from a video game developer that the console will run Unreal Engine 5 better, and multiple reports from other sources essentially confirm the system is real and coming. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-launch-this-year/">According to Jeff Grubb</a>, the system is still scheduled for release this year, although the reveal timings are still unknown.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has yet to be officially announced. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

						<h5>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club</h5><p><span>August 29, 2024</span>
					</p></div></div>
					<p>The Nintendo Switch has seen a lot of deep-cut releases over the past year, but arguably none slice quite as deep as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club</a>. A series of surprisingly-mature 8-bit visual novels written by Metroid co-creator Yoshio Sakamoto, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/famicom-detective-club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Famicom Detective Club</a> games gained a certain amount of notoriety over the decades amongst hardcore Nintendo fans who like to keep up with the company’s unlocalized oddities. It certainly came as a surprise when Nintendo brought remakes of the first two Famicom Detective Club titles, The Missing Heir and The Girl Who Stands Behind, to worldwide audiences in 2021. While that was a big deal to a certain niche audience, the remakes didn’t exactly do Mario numbers, so many assumed the series might just disappear again. Thankfully, the surprises kept coming, with the first all-new entry in the Famicom Detective Club series launching tomorrow.</p>
<p>Is Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club a page-turning revival of Nintendo’s cult series? Or is this particular Detective Club not worth joining? Time to investigate…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/WCCFemiothesmilingmanfamicomdetective2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club once again casts players as a rookie investigator (you determine your name) working for the Utsugi Detective Agency, although this time around you also get to step into the shoes of sprightly fellow investigator Ayumi Tachibana for some sections. Your latest case is set in motion when a middle school boy is found strangled to death with a paper bag bearing a creepy scrawled-on smile placed over his head. This bears resemblance to a local urban legend, The Smiling Man, who’s said to strangle teenage girls he finds crying before fitting them for a grinning paper bag so they’ll have a “smile that will last forever.” This legend was bolstered by a spate of actual murders of high school girls 18 years ago that were never solved. Is this new murder a continuation of the earlier crimes? If so, why was a boy killed instead of a girl? Is it a copycat crime? Or is something altogether different happening? It’s up to you to find out.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/WCCFemiothesmilingmanfamicomdetective7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Even though it arrives over 35 years after the last original entry in the series, Emio - The Smiling Man sticks closely to retro visual novel conventions, with most of the game consisting of lengthy dialogue exchanges with various witnesses and other NPCs. Players have standard menu options available to them like “ask” and “show,” as well as the ability to “think” to yourself in order to spark a new line of questioning. You’ll also occasionally have to search the area you’re in point-and-click style for clues.</p>
<p>Despite this old-school approach, squeezing responses out of witnesses is often fairly engaging. Thankfully, Emio - The Smiling Man has been given a significantly better localization than either The Missing Heir or The Girl Who Stands Behind, which were often clunky to the point of being hard to follow. There’s no such issue with Emio, and it feels like efforts have been made to have the game’s story-progressing choices follow a more rational path than in the past. One question leads to the next in a logical way, finding new clues in the environment will spark new conversations, etc.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/WCCFemiothesmilingmanfamicomdetective4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This doesn’t happen all the time, mind you. There are still plenty of moments when progressing in Emio just means exhausting all other options before the game presents a new line of questioning or place to go. Most irritating, there are certain points where it feels like the game is intentionally wasting your time, forcing you to click everything in a scene or jump back and forth between locations multiple times before you’re randomly given a chance to progress. And yeah, this kind of stuff was always a part of old-school visual novels and the simplicity this game means you’ll never get lost for <em>too</em> long, but I would’ve appreciated a better balance between logical and trial-and-error solutions (the split is about 60-40 as is).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/WCCFemiothesmilingmanfamicomdetective5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Of course, a game like this lives and dies based on the quality of its story, and thankfully, Emio - The Smiling Man delivers on that front. Don’t go in expecting the kind of wild, fourth-wall-breaking decadence of more modern visual novel series like Danganronpa, but Emio does a good job of building a solid, absorbing mystery block by block. All this is brought to life via simple-yet-clean visuals that are a subtle yet notable step up over the Famicom Detective Club remakes. The game even offers up a handful of basic cutscenes that deliver a surprising amount of creepy atmosphere.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/WCCFemiothesmilingmanfamicomdetective6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While Emio - The Smiling Man moves at a rather deliberate pace over its 10-hour story, it all builds to a mostly satisfying finale. No, the game’s ending isn’t going to blow your mind with a volley of wild twists and turns, but it delivers the proper tone and largely holds together. If this ending was <em>actually</em> the ending, I would have chalked up Emio as an entertaining, if slightly unremarkable, detective yarn, but Nintendo goes and does something kind of wild after the credits roll.</p>

<p>Without giving anything away, Emio - The Smiling Man expands upon and reframes much of the story you’ve just been through in a surprising, complex, and decidedly dark epilogue.&nbsp;<span>It’s rare that I’m legitimately shocked by a video game that I ask, “Where the hell did&nbsp;<em>this</em> come from?” aloud while playing, but Emio got me.</span>&nbsp;Granted, some of the shock was due to the fact this was coming from <em>Nintendo</em>, but even without that caveat, this is pretty bold storytelling. Days later, the final hours of Emio - The Smiling Man are still rattling around my head, and if this is the direction Nintendo and Sakamoto want to take the Famicom Detective Club franchise in, I very much hope this isn’t their last case.</p>

</div>

<p>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club really sneaks up on you. For much of its runtime the game is a likable, if somewhat by the book, throwback detective visual novel, but Nintendo swings big in terms of narrative in its final hours, ultimately delivering a story that’s much more daring, dark, and affecting than anything this franchise has delivered before. Whether you’re a visual novel nut or just in the mood for a good mystery with some teeth, Emio will leave you grinning.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blue-protocol-canceled-in-the-west-japanese-service-to-end-in-january.965814/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blue-protocol-canceled-west-japan-service-ending<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has announced that it's shutting down action RPG&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol</em>'s service in Japan this January, and as a result, the game will also no longer get a Western release.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blue-protocol.com/news/507" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a news post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>website, Bandai Namco says it's shutting down&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>on January 18th in Japan, and that the Western release of the game, which was planned to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blue-protocol-amazon-games-explains-changes-you-can-expect-in-west-compared-to-japan">handled by Amazon Games</a>, will no longer go ahead.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco goes on to say that both it and Amazon are "disappointed" they won't be able to release&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>globally, acknowledging that there has been "great anticipation" for the game since it was first revealed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-protocol-canceled-combat.jpg?itok=VbCsvoMf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-protocol-canceled-combat.jpg?itok=SVClLNUn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>isn't coming West anymore.</figcaption></figure><p>The developer goes on to say that its goal with&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>was to create an experience "that is like stepping into the world of anime", and one that allows players to become "the main character of the anime".</p>
<p>However, Bandai Namco says it has "come to the conclusion that it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you". The studio signs off by apologizing for its "sudden announcement".</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear why Bandai Namco has chosen to shut down&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol</em>, but if it's anything like a number of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-reincarnation-shutting-down">other</a> live-service <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocket-arena-will-be-officially-shut-down-in-march-2024">games</a> that have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-will-shut-down-echoes-of-mana-mobile-game-year-after-release">shut down</a> in recent times, it's likely due to dwindling player numbers or a lack of profitability.</p>
<p><em>Blue Protocol</em>'s shutdown and cancellation could also be part of Bandai Namco's initiative to refocus its development efforts on quality.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-will-refocus-game-development-on-quality-following-declining-financial">February financial report</a>, a then-new online game released by the studio performed below expectations, and while&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>isn't named, it's likely that's the game to which Bandai Namco is referring.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason might be, unfortunately, if you've been hoping to play&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>in the West sometime this year, you may have to look elsewhere for your anime kicks. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Bandai Namco.</p>

            <p>
Konami has announced the Castlevania Dominus Collection, a re-release of classic games from the series that originally launched on Nintendo DS.
</p>
<p>
As revealed during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-in-todays-nintendo-direct-and-indie-world-showcases">yesterday's Nintendo Direct</a>, the collection features <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/castlevania-dawn-sorrow">Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/castlevania-portrait-ruin">Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/castlevania-order-ecclesia">Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia</a>. In addition, two bonus games are included: Haunted Castle (the arcade version of Castlevania) and Haunted Castle Revisited (a reimagined version).
</p>
<p>
The collection is available now for Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam).

<p>
Dawn of Sorrow was the first of these to be released in 2005, its name a nod to the DS console. It continued the same metroidvania design established by Symphony of the Night and continued on Game Boy Advance with Circle of the Moon, Harmony of Dissonance, and Aria of Sorrow.
</p>
<p>
Portrait of Ruin followed in 2006, and then Order of Ecclesia in 2008.
</p>
<p>
The collection includes quality of life additions like rewind and quick save, plus buttons and layouts for the original dual screens are fully customisable.
</p>
<p>
A gallery mode and encyclopedia include previously unreleased artwork and an exhaustive compendium of information on each game, while a music player features tracks from each game.
</p>
<p>
This Dominus Collection also follows the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/castlevania-anniversary-collection">Castlevania Anniversary Collection</a>, which includes classics from the series, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/castlevania-advance-collection">Castlevania Advance Collection</a>, which includes the three Game Boy Advance games plus Dracula X.
</p>
<p>
Still, when will we get a Castlevania: Symphony of the Night re-release?
</p>
<p>
The series featured last year in the excellent indie roguelite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-return-to-castlevania-expansion-gets-march-release-date">Dead Cells</a>. Further, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylights-castlevania-collaboration-adds-dracula-and-trevor-belmont-later-this-month">latest chapter of Dead by Daylight celebrates the Castlevania series</a>.

            <p>Unionised staff at Raven Software have filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board after claims both Activision and Microsoft are stalling over contract negotiations.</p>
<p>The studio, which is known for its work on the Call of Duty series, filed the complaint last Friday. As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/nintendo-partner-showcase-raven-activision-union?open=false#%C2%A7item-call-of-duty-union-say-activision-is-dragging-its-feet-on-contract-talks">Game File</a>, the complaint alleged "Refusal to Bargain/Bad Faith Bargaining" in relation to ongoing efforts to reach a collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>"After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a>, our members were optimistic that they would progress quickly to a first contract at Raven Software," Communication Workers of America president Claude Cummings Jr. told Game File following the filing. "Unfortunately, that has not happened."</p>

<p>"We encourage Microsoft to address the concerns raised in the Unfair Labor Practice charge and make reaching a fair agreement a priority," Cummings concluded.</p>
<p>While the CWA did not go into detail about the issues raised within the charge, Game File noted other allegations in the public summary include "changes in terms and conditions of employment", as well as "concerted activities (Retaliation, Discharge, Discipline)".</p>
<p>A Microsoft spokesperson further told Game File the company is "committed to negotiating in good faith".</p>
<p>Unionisation efforts within <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>'s Raven Software subsidiary started all the way back in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/qa-testers-at-activision-blizzards-raven-software-announce-intent-to-unionise">January 2022</a>, following strike action that December.

<p>Eventually, in May of that year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/qa-testers-at-activision-blizzard-studio-raven-software-successfully-vote-to-unionise">the vote to unionise was won</a>, despite Activision Blizzard's ongoing anti-unionisation efforts, which included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-sent-anti-union-emails-ahead-of-pivotal-raven-software-vote">sending emails asking recipients to "please vote no"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gamestop-retro-range-launched/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>GameStop has announced the launch of ‘GameStop Retro’, revealing that locations around North America will start selling retro titles from the last forty years of gaming history. The retailer confirmed that the likes of the Game Boy, Wii, PS3, and Dreamcast will be represented by GameStop Retro, but fans have been quick to cast shade at the announcement.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-gouged-to-the-max">Gouged To The Max</h2>



<p>GameStop has just revealed that <strong>some stores </strong>will start selling retro titles once again, but not everyone is pleased about it.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>On social media, some users were quick to stress the price gouging that’s prevalent in the retro gaming community, suggesting that GameStop will be no stranger to this practice. Further, some posters published pictures of GameStop stores selling retro software, highlighting how ‘weak’ the stock was. It was said by some that it’s just a bid to push outdated stock at ‘extortionate’ prices.</p>



<p>In the image posted by GameStop, it was revealed that the following platforms will be supported by the new Retro offering:</p>



<ul>
<li>NES</li>



<li>SNES</li>



<li>Game Boy</li>



<li>GBA</li>



<li>N64</li>



<li>DS</li>



<li>Wii</li>



<li>Wii U</li>



<li>GameCube</li>



<li>Xbox</li>



<li>Xbox 360</li>



<li>PlayStation</li>



<li>PS2</li>



<li>PS3</li>



<li>Dreamcast</li>



<li>Sega Genesis</li>



<li>Sega Saturn</li>



<li>PS Vita</li>



<li>PS3</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s assumed that other platforms that aren’t mentioned will also find a spot in GameStop Retro, such as the PlayStation Portable.</p>



<p>Retro gaming is a huge and lucrative market, and with all the remasters coming back into fashion, gamers have no end to the number of nostalgic experiences they can enjoy. GameStop returning to the sale of Retro software isn’t a massive leap and it might just be a bid to clear out old stock, but it’s a nice bonus for shoppers with a taste for days gone by.</p>

            <p>A number of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-early-access">Star Wars Outlaws</a> players have been advised to restart their game with a new save file to avoid problems with progression.</p>
<p>Ubisoft last night emailed some PlayStation 5 players asking them to update their copy of Outlaws to the latest version, following a chunky bug-busting patch.</p>
<p>"To best experience the Outer Rim, we rolled out a maintenance to make sure everyone is playing the latest version of the game," Ubisoft's email reads. "As one of the players affected who had access to an older version of the game, we are aware you might be encountering some issues after this recent patch. We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused."</p>

<p>Ubisoft asked those affected players to "start a new save to fully enjoy Star Wars Outlaws as our team intended". It noted that if players continue to play on an earlier save file, they will "unfortunately face issues and progression blockers".</p>
<p>Our friends over at Digital Foundry received the above email. Tom Morgan informed me when he captured footage for Star Wars Outlaws a few days ago, his PS5 was on version 1.000.002. On Xbox Series X/S, meanwhile, he was on version 1.0.0.3 (see below).</p>
<p>Please note, this email has not been sent out to all Star Wars Outlaws players - our Guides team and Eurogamer's deputy editor Chris did not recieve it.</p>

<p>This news from Ubisoft has caused some discontent among Star Wars Outlaws players who had paid more to gain early access via the Gold and Ultimate editions of the game.</p>
<p>"I just got this email this morning, wish I knew that [before] I played 5 hours last night. Honestly this game is testing my patience," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsOutlaws/comments/1f2qpau/comment/lk89kra/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">complained</a> one such player over on Reddit. "I'm disgusted. Paid $110 and played all night, 12 hour stretch," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsOutlaws/comments/1f2qnbd/comment/lk8dz37/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">added</a> another. "This is how Ubi thanks us??"</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Ubisoft for further comment.</p>

<p>Due to a day one patch, Ubisoft has asked all Star Wars Outlaws Early Access players to start with new saves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Star Wars Outlaws Early Access has kicked off, with Gold and Ultimate Edition players enjoying three days of early gaming in Ubisoft’s new <a href="https://youtu.be/Nk86fu2BP9c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">open-world</a> title. However, the progress made during this time could be wasted, as the developers have asked players to update the game with the day one patch and start fresh with a new save.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the new patch dropped, Star Wars Outlaws Gold and Ultimate Edition players on the PS5 were sent an email stating that the best way to experience the Outer Rim was to play the “latest version.” The developers added that players on the previous version of the game might be experiencing some issues due to the newest patch.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Hence, they asked the early access Star Wars Outlaws players to update to version 1.000.002 and start with a new save “to fully enjoy” the game. Also, the developers have warned that if players continue to play on the prior save, they “will unfortunately face issues and progression blockers”. </p>



<p>Therefore, the players have to let go of all their progress until now and start again, or else they could face even more significant problems later in the game.&nbsp;However, this could be cumbersome for players as many might have already invested hours in the game. </p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone wants to do a crossover with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, he wants to see Pam - the farming sim's alcohol-drinking bus driver - in the online shooter, though he's "open to anything".
</p>
<p>
Barone discussed the crossover in a Discord conversation shared on X (formerly Twitter) by Panedwards, where he was asked "would you be willing to ever do a Fortnite crossover?"

<p>
"It doesn't have to be Pam though I would be open to anything, Abigail and Sebastian could be good. Stardrop or Joja Cola item? Galaxy Sword or slingshot?"

<p>
Pam driving the Battle Bus sounds like a good - but also bad - idea, depending on the amount of mead she's been gifted.
</p>
<p>
Yet the Galaxy Sword or slingshot could certainly work easily enough, as would items like Stardrops and Joja Cola.
</p>
<p>
Who would you like to see in a possible crossover?
</p>
<p>
Last month, Barone commented that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-will-never-charge-money-for-dlc-or-updates">he would never charge money for DLC or updates</a> "for as long as I live".

</p>
<p>
That wouldn't necessarily fit with the thousands of paid cosmetics available in Fortnite, but the shooter would certainly provide another outlet.

            <p>
Bandai Namco will shut down the servers of its anime MMORPG Blue Protocol in Japan and has cancelled its release in the West.
</p>
<p>
Blue Protocol was released in Japan in June 2023, with the forthcoming western release managed by Amazon Games.
</p>
<p>
However, in a new statement from the <a href="https://www.playblueprotocol.com/en-us/news/articles/the-future-of-blue-protocol">developers on the game's website</a>, the "difficult decision" has been made to end service as "it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you".

<p>

"We know this is disappointing news, and we share your disappointment. We love the world and characters of Blue Protocol, and we were excited to welcome players around the world into Regnas. We join Bandai Namco Online in expressing deep gratitude to the passionate fans who followed Blue Protocol development and participated in the Closed Technical Test."
</p>
<p>

Further, a <a href="https://blue-protocol.com/news/507">statement from Bandai Namco</a> reads: "We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Amazon Games throughout the development of Blue Protocol, and both of our teams are disappointed that we will not be able to deliver the game to players around the world.
</p>
<p>
"We know there has been great anticipation for Blue Protocol since the first announcement of the game. We wanted to deliver an experience that is like stepping into the world of anime, and we have been challenging ourselves to create a world where each and every player can enjoy adventures as the main character of the anime. We have worked hard to prepare for the release; however, we have come to the conclusion that it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you.
</p>
<p>
"We deeply apologise for the sudden announcement."
</p>
<p>
The Japanese servers will remain online until Saturday 18th January 2025.
</p>
<p>
I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blue-protocol-is-amazons-next-punt-on-east-meets-west">hands-on with Blue Protocol last year</a>, which was set to follow the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a> and New World as Amazon Games' next big MMO. However, I had concerns of whether the game could differentiate itself from its key competitors.

</p>
<p>
The game didn't receive a particularly positive response from Japanese players, but it's a shame the game has been cancelled before it really got started with a global audience.

		<p>Bandai Namco has announced that they are shutting down their online action RPG <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/blue-protocol">Blue Protocol</a> in Japan, and cancelling their plans to release the game in the West in collaboration with Amazon Games.</p>
<p>The Japanese version of Blue Protocol will shut down on 18th January 2025.</p>


<p>On the West-facing site for the game, the team behind it said, “<span>We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Amazon Games throughout the development of BLUE PROTOCOL, and both of our teams are disappointed that we will not be able to deliver the game to players around the world.”</span></p>
<p>Bandai Namco’s more general statement reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>We regret to inform you that the Japanese version of Blue Protocol will be discontinued on Saturday January 18, 2025.</p>
<p>As a result, we have also canceled our plans to release a Western version of the game in collaboration with Amazon Games. We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Amazon Games throughout the development of Blue Protocol, and both of our teams are disappointed that we will not be able to deliver the game to players around the world.</p>
<p>We know there has been great anticipation for Blue Protocol since the first announcement of the game. We wanted to deliver an experience that is like stepping into the world of anime, and we have been challenging ourselves to create a world where each and every player can enjoy adventures as the main character of the anime. We have worked hard to prepare for the release; however, we have come to the conclusion that it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you.</p>
<p>We deeply apologize for the sudden announcement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Blue Protocol took an intriguing approach to the MMORPG, featuring a classless character system that would allow a great deal of flexibility for setting your own role within a player group, and a fun anime-styled world that quickly grabbed 600,000 players shortly after the game’s launch in Japan.</p>

<p>Bandai Namco partnered with Amazon Games to bring the game to the West, entering into a degree of co-development that sought to tailor the game through Amazon’s more Western perspective. The game had targeted a 2024 release round these parts, but never got the chance, as Bandai Namco has now pulled the plug on the project as a whole.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/genshin-impact-releases-new-natlan-region<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> 5.0 has brought Natlan, widening the world of Teyvat to include its sixth region, as part of the 'Flowers Resplendent on the Sun-Scorched Sojourn' update.</p>
<p>Natlan is available to everyone who's completed the Mondstadt Archon Quests; meaning, even if you're a Genshin Impact newbie, you can still travel beyond the Sumeru desert to the Nation of Pyro. Though, if you want to explore its storyline, you'll have to be Adventure Rank 28 or higher and have completed all of Liyue's Archon Quests.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Genshin_Impact_Natlan_2.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>HoYoverse</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When journeying across Natlan, you'll encounter the tribes who make their home there and live alongside the Saurians - creatures who are also known as the dragons of Natlan. While there are six tribes in total, only three are available upon Genshin 5.0's release and you'll be able to learn more about them through the Tribal Chronicles. Replacing Story Quests, the Tribal Chronicles offer you the chance to learn more about each tribe through completing a three act quest.</p>

<p>Genshin 5.0's unique feature, however, are the Saurians and how you'll gain the ability to embody the three connected to the tribes released as part of the update - the Tepetlisaurus, Yumkasaurus and Koholasaurus. (Try saying those names three times.) I mean that literally too as you'll physically transform into the Saurian of your choosing; granting you access to both its traversal and combat abilities.</p>

<p>Having been given a preview of Genshin Impact 5.0 during <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> last week, I'll openly admit I spent most of my time messing about as a Saurian; tunnelling up a cliff as a Tepetlisaurus or shooting myself through the air as a Yumkasaurus. These traversal abilities succeed in cutting down the amount of time you'll spend journeying across Natlan. After all, why would you waste time walking up a hill, when you can simply dig to its summit? Fighting as a Saurian does take some getting used to - I kept accidentally burying myself underground as a Tepetlisaurus and you can't switch characters - but, once you find your combat rhythm, you'll find the Saurians to be quite effective. Though keep in mind that, while you travel freely as a Saurian in Natlan, you can only conduct the transformations in specific locations. Due to this, it's worth considering exactly where you are when you return to human-form to avoid spending time hunting down the nearest transformation spot. </p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Genshin_Impact_Natlan_4.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>Finally, as is the way with HoYoverse games, a new update means a new roster of characters for you to pull from Banners. (And spend your real world money on if you really must.) The first half of Genshin 5.0 brings Mualani, a five-star Hydro catalyst wielder, and Kachina, a four-star Geo polearm wielder. Though you can recruit Kachina for free by completing Act 1 of Natlan's Archon Quest. Meanwhile, the second half of Genshin 5.0 sees the release of Kinich - a five-star Dendro claymore user who's mates with a little sunglasses wearing pixel dragon. No. I'm not joking.</p>

            <p>
Final Fantasy 14 producer and director <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has said <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> would like to "further deepen the relationship with Xbox gamers" following the release of the MMORPG on Microsoft's console.
</p>
<p>
The game's arrival on Xbox was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-heading-to-xbox">announced at the Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest in Las Vegas last year</a>, where Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> took to the stage. It then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-gets-official-xbox-release-date">released on 21st March</a>, with latest expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-review">Dawntrail</a> being the first to release alongside PC and PlayStation.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, Yoshida noted players have been "waiting a long time for the Xbox release" but it's had "a really strong response" with communities growing on the platform.

<p>

He then spoke more generally about bringing Final Fantasy games to Microsoft's console.
</p>
<p>
"Of course, when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy 15</a> was released, at that point in time Final Fantasy 14 was not available on Xbox," he said. "And it is a fact that currently, Final Fantasy 16 is not available on Xbox. So with that in mind, it is true that because of the amount of time that has elapsed since then, the Final Fantasy fanbase on Xbox has reduced.
</p>
<p>
"With Final Fantasy 14 as an opportunity, we can take this opportunity to strengthen the community on Xbox towards the Final Fantasy franchise. I think this is where we would take more communication and work on establishing the community moving forward. And this is important, not for Final Fantasy 14, but, I would say, for Square Enix. With Final Fantasy 14's release on Xbox, Phil Spencer spent a lot of his time and a lot of effort and put in a lot of hard work into making it a reality. So we would like to make the best of that and further deepen the relationship with Xbox gamers moving forward."
</p>
<p>
Yoshida noted, as a general argument, that Xbox has struggled in Japan due to the low number of users. "Naturally, because we are Japanese developers, we have a desire for many people in our country to play our games," said Yoshida, adding it's "really a tough point in terms of a business standpoint".
</p>
<p>
He continued: "However, at Square Enix, we have been changing our policy. So now we are moving towards the policy of releasing our games on a multiplatform basis, and we really want as many players as possible to play our titles. So with Final Fantasy 14 as the starting point, we do want to release more Square Enix games on Xbox, and there will be more of our titles released on Xbox. So I hope players will look forward to future things to come on the platform."
</p>
<p>
Back in May, Square Enix released a medium-term business plan alongside its financial report, stating the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">company is "aggressively pursuing" a multiplatform strategy</a> as part of a move to "diversify earnings opportunities".

</p>
<p>
It seems the release of Final Fantasy 14 on Xbox - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-xiv-the-most-profitable-game-in-the-series">company's most profitable game</a> - is a major step forward in this strategy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/28/star-wars-outlaws-002-patch-notes-ps5-save-file-new-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ubisoft has released a hefty patch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> after the game’s Early Access release, and before the full launch on 30th August, and it comes with a big pain point for players on PS5, potentially forcing them to restart the game entirely. Not a good look, Ubisoft…</p>
<p>Version 1.000.002 is out now across all platforms – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> and PC – weighing in at around 8.5GB, and coming with the following, very brief patch notes:</p>


<ul>
<li>Adds 40fps support for compatible displays</li>
<li>Addresses performance issues</li>
<li>Numerous bug fixes across the game</li>
</ul>
<p>Exclusively for PS5, though, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/star-wars-outlaws/article/star-wars-outlaws-issues-with-an-outdated-version-on-playstation-5/000109614?origin=search">Ubisoft note</a> that “We are aware of an issue in Star Wars Outlaws where some players on PlayStation 5 may be playing on an outdated version of the game.”</p>
<p>The only way to resolve this is to install version 1.000.002 update and <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/help/star-wars-outlaws/gameplay/article/starting-a-new-game-in-star-wars-outlaws/000109496">start a new game</a> to avoid “any potential issues and blockers”.</p>
<p>This is so significant for player progression in the game, that they have even been emailing early players of the game to prompt them to make sure they have downloaded the update and restarted the game, potentially wiping out hours of game time. Frustratingly, these emails are <a href="https://x.com/Fabio_vincent/status/1828534168600617187">seemingly coming 4-5 hours into the game</a>, well after the patch has already been applied.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1f2rbpu/just_got_this_email_from_ubisoft_everyone_who_got/">The email reads</a>: “To best experience the Outer Rim, we rolled out a maintenance to make sure everyone is playing the latest version of the game. As one of the players affected who had access to an older version of the game, we are aware you might be encountering some issues after the recent patch. We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused. […] Once you’ve confirmed you have the latest version, please start a new save to fully enjoy Star Wars Outlaws as our team intended. If you continue on a prior save, you will unfortunately face issues and progression blockers.”</p>
<p>Thankfully, we weren’t affected by any issues while reviewing the game over the past week, and it’s possible that not all players are affected. Given the timing, it’s also fairly likely that the most players are already on the updated game before starting their game.</p>
<p>We rather enjoyed our time in the Star Wars universe, with Gamoc saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review/">our review</a>, “Star Wars Outlaws is an open world scoundrel-’em-up that clearly builds on Ubisoft’s familiar format, but that’s not a bad thing. The rep system in particular is interesting, as the constant fluctuations belie any kind of loyalty you might show otherwise, but most importantly, this game lets you just be in the enduring Star Wars Universe. It’s not perfect, but stealing for crime syndicates, fighting the Empire, speeding across alien landscapes, and so much more is a dream come true.”</p>

            <p>Workers at Nacon-owned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/greedfall">Greedfall 2</a> studio Spiders have penned an open letter “to their employer” detailing grievances over a period of several years, and called for a strike in response to “management’s continued refusal” to take their concerns seriously. 44 of Spider’s 95 workers have signed the <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/08/open-letter-from-spiders-workers-to-their-employer/">document, made public through French union Stjv</a> in the hope that it “will finally push management to act in the best interests of employees and the company.”</p>
<!--more-->
<blockquote><p>This document covers several years of known problems, which have been greatly amplified over the past year with the arrival of the current head of the company: instability, opposition to anticipating problems and securing working conditions, global mismanagement, turnover and recruitment problems, unacceptable delays in achieving gender equality and parity, important lack of transparency, denial of problems, refusal to acknowledge worker representation and blocked negotiations.</p></blockquote>
<p>The open letter is the second that unhappy Spiders employees have penned, following an earlier document and related strike on January 19. “Since then,” the workers in question write, “new negotiations have begun on wages, and conditions in the studio have continued to deteriorate.”</p>
<p>The document itself consists of 20 pages outlining the issues, and ends with a list of demands “to secure our lives, our careers and the company in the short and long term.” The listed issues include “a blatant lack of transparency on all aspects of the company”, “A difficult production cycle for Greedfall 2”, and “Management's adamant refusal to acknowledge collective action”.</p>
<p>Their demands, broadly, are greater transparency and worker representation, an end to an “authoritarian and ineffective centralization of power”, greater freedom to work from home, wage increases commensurate with other Nacon studios, and “immediate rectification of all wage discrimination against women and non-binary people”.</p>
<p>The document also features several cartoons featuring characters from Spiders’ games.</p>

<p>“In light of management’s continued refusal to discuss, take the problems raised seriously and act to rectify them”, Spiders staff are calling for a strike to take place next week, starting September 2. “In particular, we will be organising pickets on September 2 and 3 in front of the company’s offices and online on a Minecraft server created for the occasion.”</p>
<p>We’ve had some positive news recently on the labour front. In the same week last month, both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-game-studios-developers-ecstatic-to-announce-a-241-strong-wall-to-wall-union">Bethesda Game Studios</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-500-world-of-warcraft-developers-at-blizzard-have-voted-to-form-microsofts-biggest-wall-to-wall-union">World of Warcraft workers</a> formed wall-to-wall unions.

            <p>There’s nowt more magical than the lambent inscriptions of tangled sigils required to spell places like Ainderby Quernhow, Weedley Copse, or Upper Poppleton. A shiny whippet to the first of you to correctly identify which of these are real, and which were invented for “roguelite word <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>” <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sternly-worder-adventures">Sternly Worded Adventures</a>. Actually, scratch that. I’m not made of whippets, and you can just as easily find out yourself via the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2562130/Sternly_Worded_Adventures/">Steam demo</a>. I think you should, if only because “I killed a slime by spelling out the word Toblerone” is easily in my top ten gaming moments of the year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Wait. What?! What do you shitting mean ‘Toblerone’ isn’t a word?</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/20240828080957_1.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

</figure>
<p>A bloody travesty, is what that is. I’ll show you sternly worded, mate. Here’s how the game describes itself. Although, as we’ve already established, it’s not above lying to your actual face.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sternly Worded Adventures is a roguelite word puzzle RPG inspired by Bookworm Adventures where you travel through a forested peninsula with Yorkshire-sounding place names fighting monsters with the power of words to uncover whatever dark secrets may be lurking beyond.</p></blockquote>
<p>The game also boasts over 8 different classes, 15+ enemies, 180+ items, and the chance to “Spell words with over 25 different letters”. That last one took me a second, but I actually forgive you for the Toblerone affront now.</p>
<p>The demo itself seems pretty generous, giving you a good chunk of adventure, plus “full access [to] both of the Wordle and Minesweeper inspired minigames, without limit.” Big fan of<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wordle"> Wordle</a>, despite never having played it, on account of it effectively allowing me to complain about Toblerones for a living.</p>
<p>I couldn’t end this piece without asking for an opinion from our resident Yorkshireman Edwin, of course. Here’s what he had to say about the game making a mockery of the good people of Wigglesworth: "Wigglesworth is in North Yorkshire, the Oop Northenest of the northern English counties - Durham, Cumbria and Northumberland don't count because they've been infiltrated by the Scots and turned into factories for battered Mars Bars, and don't even get me started about chuffing Tyne &amp; Wear, which sounds like a brand of shaving foam. I used to live on the border of North Yorkshire as a lad. We didn't get any Toblerones in those days, just foil-wrapped pieces of drystone wall, and if we'd seen a slime crossing the green we'd have et it. This game looks daft as a brush."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Cats are meant to have nine lives, but it looks like no-one told a mischievous black tabby named Pluto that. Eviscerated by a careless driver on a rainy night, poor one-life Pluto finds himself stuck in the afterlife. Where, after a comical misunderstanding over a few broken statues, he is commanded to clean cat ‘purr’gatory – cat puns, this review’s got ‘em – for all eternity. Still, it’s not all bad, as this neat storyline set-up sends Pluto on a charming video game adventure, one that is a delight from beginning to end.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crypt Custodian – Release Date Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LSgnBzIrRtI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Played from a top-down perspective, Crypt Custodian mixes an old-school Zelda aesthetic and accompanying sword-slashing gameplay with the labyrinthian structure of a modern-day metroidvania. Pluto searches the afterlife, makes cute friends, solves ingeniously devious puzzles, discovers satisfyingly secret paths, and bashes a fair few brutal bosses for good measure. The narrative accompanying Pluto’s adventures is easy going and genuinely humorous. Indeed, if someone was trying to cram in cat puns, they might even refer to the dialogue as being, ‘hiss’terical. Sorry, I’m just kitten around.</p>


<p>Visually, Crypt Custodian is simple, but simply oozes charm. With just a few frames of animation, Pluto has more charisma than numerous AAA protagonists. The world he explores is equally as engaging; fish can be seen swimming in deep-blue water, haze glimmers across moonlit swamps, and caves glisten with unearthly light. The fact that the whole game was put together by just one guy is frankly mind-blowing, Kyle Thompson must get up very early in the morning to make games this good.</p>


<p>Looking at Crypt Custodian it would be tempting to think that the whimsical visuals and light-weight storytelling would lead to flaccid combat, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Pluto is a dab paw with a broom, so much so that he’d make a Samurai Pizza Cat green with envy. Thwacking a foe will have you feline good. Each strike is cathartic in its impact, with a genuine sense of collision as the unwitting baddie is sent flying. Meanwhile, Pluto can dodge and dash with the agility of a, <em>well, </em>cat. In short, the combat is fast, thrilling and responsive, particularly as the screen fills up with foes to take out.</p>
<p>This is a challenging game, no doubt. And with no easy mode, not necessarily an accessible one either. But, if you like your games tricky, then thanks to some supremely smart design decisions, Crypt Custodian never lurches into frustration. Take the enemy attack indicators, which clearly demonstrate when a cute demon jar thingy is going to attack and where, all you need to do is react accordingly. Soon you’ll be analysing the risks of a room-full of baddies, assessing each upcoming attack to time your dodge, plan your route through the melee, and follow-up with a right good broom bash.</p>

<p>The same applies to the brilliant platforming, which might just be the best example of the jumping art that I’ve ever seen integrated into a top-down game. Leaping from a top-down perspective can be fraught with difficulty, as it’s often impossible for the player to tell if they are going to land safely or not. Kyle’s elegant solution to this conundrum really is the cat’s whiskers. A simple on-screen icon lurks around Pluto’s lower paws, if it’s white in colour you know you will land on solid ground, if it switches to red you know you’re going to plummet to your doom. Then, with a generous dose of mid-air control, the player can correct their landing with confidence. This balance of precision and control has allowed Kyle to really ratchet up the platforming intensity, creating some thrilling set-pieces that will push your skills to the limit, but never your patience.</p>
<p>Crypt Custodian is suitably vast in scale, with huge areas to explore and then re-explore with your new-found abilities. Yet the world is so cram-packed with creatures to meet and secrets to uncover that the enormous environment feel alive. Which is more than can be said for poor one-life Pluto. Yet, when the afterlife is this much fun, perhaps having nine-lives is overrated?</p>

            <p>Exterminatus. Exterminatus. You’re all exterminatused. None of you are free of sin. Except, maybe Focus Interactive are actually? While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> players <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saber-boss-explains-space-marine-2s-microtransactions-people-dont-want-to-be-sold-horse-armour-anymore">extra for cosmetics</a> a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183900/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine_2/">year one roadmap</a> does at least look piously forthright.</p>
<p>Chatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/screw-it-im-building-a-house-of-graphics-cards">made out of graphics cards</a>), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">Oblivion</a>'s infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space game</a>’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-war-z">World War Z</a>,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.</p>
<p>Whether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate. Here’s it:</p>

<p>“The Season Pass has been envisioned as a way to enhance your customisation for your character,” reads the update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183900/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine_2/">on Steam</a>. “All the gameplay additions listed here in the roadmap (including weapons, game modes, and maps) are intended to arrive in *free game patches* and will be accessible to everyone.”</p>
<p>The paid portion of the roadmap is only available to season pass owners. Currently, that means players who purchase either the £80/€90/$90 “Gold Edition” or the £90/€100/$100 “Ultra Edition”. Of the bits listed on the plan, I can see the Dark Angels pack stinging a bit - they’re one of the more visually distinct chapters, all flowing capes and ornate livery. This guy even has a <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-GB/shop/dark-angels-azrael-2023">personal helmet Jawa</a>. For the price of the ultra edition, you could buy three little plastic helmet Jawas <em>and</em> a meal deal <em>and then </em>you could balance your Double Decker on top of the three helmet Jawas <em>and then</em> you could say “render my snack unto me, faithful servants.” It wouldn’t work, but it’d be a good time regardless.</p>
<p>Also a good time - say Edwin, James, and myself - is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-marine-2s-co-op-suggests-it-is-in-fact-jetpacks-that-make-the-dream-work">Space Marine 2</a>, although we did have a few common complaints. What complaints, you ask? They’re in the piece, you aspiring click thief.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
