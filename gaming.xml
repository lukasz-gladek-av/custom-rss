                <p>The next Nintendo Direct might be coming up very soon. That's according to reputable source Nate the Hate, who said during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a> today, July 14, that the next Direct is slated for this month.</p><p>"It is the million dollar question. I have been told there is a Direct this month, the month of July, but that Direct will not take place until after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-release-date-trailer-gameplay-details-and-everything-we-know/1100-6530797/" data-ref-id="1100-6530797">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> releases," he said. "Beyond that, I have no additional information. I do not have information as to the exact timing at this point."</p><p>Bananza launches on July 17 for Switch 2, so a possible Direct would happen after that if this report proves to be accurate.</p><p>That's all he had to say about a possible upcoming Direct. Nintendo could have any number of things to announce at a Direct, like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-movie-team-returns-for-a-donkey-kong-film-listing-reveals/1100-6533131/" data-ref-id="1100-6533131">potential Donkey Kong movie</a> or confirmation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-report/1100-6532372/" data-ref-id="1100-6532372">Red Dead Redemption II for Switch 2</a>. Activision is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-still-coming-to-switch-apparently/1100-6532276/" data-ref-id="1100-6532276">keen to bring Call of Duty to Switch.</a></p><p>There is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-pokemon-presents-livestream-announced-for-july/1100-6531854/" data-ref-id="1100-6531854">Pokemon Presents event slated for July 22</a>. Nate the Hate pointed out that this Nintendo-adjacent event <em>and </em>a Nintendo Direct in the same week is not unprecedented, but he feels safer speculating that the July Direct could happen during the last week of the month instead. If that's true, it would happen just before Nintendo releases its latest earnings results on August 1.</p><p>The latest Nintendo Direct took place on June 18 and was exclusively dedicated to Bananza. Before that, there was the big Switch 2 Direct on April 2 and then a Mario Kart World Direct on April 17. Nintendo did not hold a Nintendo Direct event in July 2024 or July 2023, but that <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-direct/archive/?srsltid=AfmBOoo-X7hRDf7qr3vJ94YQpTr-eGgfDvyx6gP0lkrBREZtbPWVlMDV" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historical precedent</a> might not mean anything. Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p><p>You might also want to keep an eye on the Nintendo Today app, as Nintendo is known to make announcements there just ahead of sharing information in other places.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How The Fallout TV Show Shapes Fallout's Future</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Corden said from what he has heard, part of the forward push for Fallout 5 and Fallout in general came at the expense of ZeniMax Online's next MMO, codenamed Blackbird, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">canceled as part of Microsoft's latest round of layoffs</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">As Corden explains, MMOs are expensive to build and have to compete with established games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> and even ZeniMax's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online/" data-ref-id="5000-140736">The Elder Scrolls Online</a>. With that in mind, Microsoft made the decision to cancel ZeniMax's unannounced project and invest that money into Fallout, an established IP that would more likely be a "surefire win."</p><p dir="ltr">"From what I heard, it was a case of 'Do we want to sink a ton of money into getting this [project Blackbird] to a point where it can compete with the established players in the market, or do we want to allocate that investment towards making Fallout 5?'" Corden said.</p><p dir="ltr">It is worth noting that Corden states that he doesn't have enough information to write a full story about Fallout 5 or who may be developing it, so it's worth taking the information above with a grain of salt.</p><p dir="ltr">Project Blackbird was still in pre-production when it was canceled, but no official details about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-revealed-about-elder-scrolls-online-devs-rumored-canceled-game/1100-6532943/" data-ref-id="1100-6532943">next game from the Elder Scrolls Online dev</a> had been announced. It had reportedly been in development since 2018, ran on a new engine, and was to be a new sci-fi IP. Development on the game was said to have been going well and had begun ramping up, with higher-ups at Xbox seemingly approving of the game just a few months prior to cancellation.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless of who is developing Fallout 5, the fact that it is just now greenlit means it will likely be many years before it releases. However, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-a-fallout-3-remaster-in-the-works-but-its-not-arriving-anytime-soon-report/1100-6530903/" data-ref-id="1100-6530903">Fallout 3 remaster is reportedly in the works</a> that could arrive sooner. Renewed interest in Fallout reached new heights with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-is-more-popular-than-ever-on-steam-thanks-to-the-tv-show/1100-6522828/" data-ref-id="1100-6522828">Amazon's Fallout TV show</a> in 2024, with star Walton Goggins recently offering an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-gets-update-from-walton-goggins/1100-6529385/" data-ref-id="1100-6529385">update on Fallout Season 2</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the next Elder Scrolls game is currently being worked on, with Bethesda Game Studios head Todd Howard recently reassuring fans that it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-obviously-being-worked-on-amid-oblivions-remaster-todd-howard-says/1100-6531019/" data-ref-id="1100-6531019">"obviously" working on Elders Scrolls 6</a> even amidst the release of Oblivion Remastered.</p>

This updated version of the classic real-time-strategy game first released by Relic in 2004 will make the game far more playable on modern hardware and will include widescreen and 4K resolution support, upscaled textures four times that of their original resolution, an improved camera, HUD optimizations, and upgrades to lighting, unit reflections, and shadows.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY_JzB0WxSA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pY_JzB0WxSA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This version of the game has also been upgraded to a 64-bit platform to "support the ongoing efforts of the modding community" and will be fully compatible with existing mods, according to a press release.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3556750/Warhammer_40000_Dawn_of_War__Definitive_Edition/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dawn of War – Definitive Edition</a> will be $30 and additionally include each of the game's three expansions: Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, and Soulstorm. Each expansion added new playable armies, multiplayer maps, and additional campaigns (in the case of Dark Crusade and Soulstorm, non-linear campaigns playable with different armies). Some of the armies added in Dawn of War's expansions include fan-favorites like the Imperial Guard, Necrons, and the Sisters of Battle.</p><p dir="ltr">The definitive edition of Dawn of War will essentially replace a previous anniversary edition released in 2006 that bundled together all of the game's content. Those "loyal fans" who own the anniversary edition will receive a 30% discount on buying the definitive edition, with the discount remaining active "for the foreseeable future," according to Relic. That puts Dawn of War – Definitive Edition's price at $21 for anniversary edition owners.</p><p dir="ltr">To celebrate the release date announcement, Relic dropped a 4K enhanced version of the original Dawn of War's iconic CGI trailer, one that shows the Space Marines of the Blood Ravens engaged in a desperate battle against an Orkish horde.</p><p dir="ltr">While fans seem to appreciate the updated trailer overall, one change--the removal of a Space Marine sergeant's scream and its replacement with voiceover from a well-established character not depicted in the trailer--has ruffled the feathers of some. Relic in a statement to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-dev-says-replaced-space-marine-scream-was-even-more-beloved-than-we-realized-as-intro-cinematic-changes-spark-backlash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> said the Space Marine's original "roar was even more beloved than we realized," and that "we may have something for OG roar enjoyers before long."</p><p dir="ltr">In other Warhammer 40K video game news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2s-new-siege-mode-unleashes-endless-waves-of-enemies/1100-6532761/" data-ref-id="1100-6532761">Space Marine 2 recently received its long-awaited Siege mode</a> update, while the remastered re-release of the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40k-space-marine-pc-remaster-had-so-many-launch-issues-sega-is-offering-refunds/1100-6532885/" data-ref-id="1100-6532885">Space Marine has been mired in so many issues</a> publisher Sega has begun offering refunds.</p>

I’ve been tracking a handful of cards that stood out this month, with some pulling in surprising gains and others dropping harder than expected. Here’s a quick look at which Pokémon TCG cards are crashing and climbing ahead of the final Scarlet and Violet sets release in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-revealed">Black Bolt and White Flare</a>.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/14/pixel-9-55-1752506840543.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been keeping an eye on Scarlet and Violet base set prices lately, and the Psychic-type Illustration Rares seem to be the ones pulling ahead. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXBEO?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ralts 211/198</a> has been quietly climbing. It's sitting around $38.99 now, which is up about 28% this month. For a Basic card with simple art and a single Psyshot attack, that's not something I saw coming. Same goes for <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yDxGw?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kirlia 212/198</a>. It's up to $27.99, mirroring Ralts's percentage jump. That evolution line seems to be gaining popularity as a set, more than just individual play value.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of evolutions, <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpW7v?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gardevoir ex 245/198</a> is definitely riding that same wave. It’s hit $54.99 recently, up from $41.19 just a month back. I don’t play Gardevoir myself, but the Psychic Embrace ability keeps showing up in deck lists, so the price hike makes sense when you look at both collector and competitive demand feeding into each other. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObrgE?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Miraidon ex 244/198</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3Gr1m?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koraidon ex 247/198</a> are seeing their own upticks, both sitting around $23.99 now. Not massive jumps compared to Gardevoir, but steady enough to notice if you’ve been following these since launch. Miraidon especially, thanks to that Tandem Unit ability, looks like it’s still holding value in Lightning-heavy builds.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/14/pixel-9-53-1752506866583.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other end of things, some cards are definitely cooling off. <a href="https://zdcs.link/a03015?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fidough 213/198</a> took a 15% hit, now hovering around $13.74. Cute card, but it doesn’t exactly have a standout ability or attack, so this feels more like a natural correction. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXB57?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Armarouge 203/198</a> dipped too, though only about 11%. I could see it regaining some ground later if Fire decks make a comeback, but for now, it’s sliding. <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEg28J?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pachirisu 208/198</a>’s price drop caught my attention more, which is currently down 19%. I feel like that’s tied to Lightning deck meta shifting around; its no-Paralysis ability isn’t moving the needle price-wise anymore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/znxNBq?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dondozo 207/198</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpW8r?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Starly 221/198</a> both saw the sharpest drops, each now at $9.99. Dondozo lost 30% this month, and Starly even more at 37%. I never really saw much hype for either of these beyond early Scarlet and Violet excitement, so the fall-off doesn’t surprise me. It feels like folks are figuring out what’s actually playable or collectible long-term.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Mega Evolution Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is it, the beggining of a new expansion for Pokémon TCG.

There were discounts on quite a few popular games and many <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">popular jigsaw puzzle brands</a> had all-time low prices. But if you happened to have miss all of those deals, Woot is currently having a small sale of its own that gives you a second chance at savings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There aren't a ton of options in this sale, but there are enough to make it noteworthy. Some of the best deals available here are on 3D puzzles and some lesser known board games, so I'd suggest checking those out first. The popular<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-awesome-board-game-and-lego-mash-up-is-steeply-discounted-for-prime-day"> LEGO board game that was on sale during Prime Day</a> was also included, but has already sold out.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Puzzles and Board Games on Sale Today</h2><div catalogid="94d95da3-c3b8-4ab3-9937-c0c55f9b6dd3" id="225302"><div id="225302" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>See All Puzzle and Board Game Deals</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Woot has a landing page for all of the discounts currently offered in its sale, and I recommend you just peruse it yourself to see if there's anything of interest to you. Like I mentioned above, there aren't <em>that</em> many things available in this sale. The board game side of the discounts are especially lacking in some of our favorite options, but there are still some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family games</a> worth picking up in here. The overall best deals are on 3D puzzle builds that are collaborations with popular franchises like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Marvel, and Star Wars. These types of puzzles are excellent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lego-alternatives">LEGO alternatives</a> that were already fairly affordable before getting extra discounted here.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What is Woot?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you aren't familiar with Woot, the easiest way to learn more about it is through the <a href="https://www.woot.com/about" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about page on its website</a>. In a nutshell, Woot is a daily deals site that was founded back in 2004 and later purchased by Amazon. They offer deals on just about everything that many other retailers don't often have. The products themselves are always high-quality and backed by Amazon, so it's legit. Prime members even get free standard shipping on anything they buy on Woot, so you don't need to worry about hitting a minimum price or total shipping costs if you already have Prime.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 14, 2025 4:41 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/woot-is-having-a-post-prime-day-sale-on-puzzles-and-board-games]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA has confirmed that it will fully reveal EA Sports FC 26, the next entry in its annual football simulation series, later this week, on Wednesday, July 16, 2025. It has also revealed one of the cover athletes for this year to be iconic Swedish player, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who will appear on the cover of the Ultimate Edition of the game. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Zlatan is being added as an icon item in the game, adding him to the roster of legendary footballers to have their careers celebrated in EA Sports FC. Though there's no official release date yet for EA Sports FC 26, veteran players of the series should expect it to fall where it usually does in the year, which is sometime in the early fall, more specifically in September. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>If you want to catch up on the state of the EA Sports FC series, you can try out last year's entry, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-the-alters-ea-sports-fc-25-and-more-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-june/">EA Sports FC 25 on Xbox Game Pass</a>, since it joined the service just last month. Not that EA particularly wants players, or anyone, really, to look back on last year's entry. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ea-ceo-explains-why-fc-25-failed-to-meet-financial-expectations/">EA Sports FC 25 missed its financial targets</a>, a huge blow to the company that relies on its annual sports games to make up the bulk of its revenue. While it saw huge success with the return of <a href="https://wccftech.com/newzoo-july-2024-report-reveals-ea-sports-college-football-25-is-an-instant-hit/">EA Sports College Football</a>, the main breadwinner for EA has always been its football series and the live service side of it, Football Ultimate Team (FUT).</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">EA shut down projects and laid off developers at Respawn</a>, and it <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/">shut down the studio it built to make a new Black Panther game</a>, cancelling the game. It's difficult to imagine that EA wouldn't make more cuts if it goes through another year of its flagship sports game missing its targets.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An unexpected co-op board game has won this year's Spiel des Jahres. The <em>Bomb Busters</em> board game has taken the acclaimed award, one many believed was reserved for the critical and commercial card game darling, Flip 7.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report from <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/07/14/co-op-designs-continue-to-dominate-board-gamings-biggest-prize-as-bomb-busters-seals-spiel-des-jahres-win/" rel="nofollow">BoardGameWire</a>, the <em>Bomb Busters</em> board game winning this year's Spiel des Jahres marked several momentous occasions. It is the first time in the event's 46-year history that the winner came from an Asian game designer. Considering the event is held in Germany, it is a testament to the rising popularity of board games around the world.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bomb-busters-board-game-hisashi-hiyashi-award-image.jpg?itok=XfBbRqL9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bomb-busters-board-game-hisashi-hiyashi-award-image.jpg?itok=mBXZpcj5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game, created by Japanese designer Hisashi Hiyashi, is a reworked version of his 2020 board game, <em>Bomb Squad</em>.&nbsp;This updated version of the game, which was presented to the Spiel des Jahres jury, included 66 different missions.</p>

<p>As the name implies, it is a co-op game where players work together to disarm different kinds of bombs. Different colored tiles represent the wires on each bomb. Those tiles are placed in front of each player, meaning only they can see which wires are a certain color.&nbsp;If both players cut each wire in the correct order, the bomb is disarmed, and they win. If the team messes up, the bomb "explodes" and everyone loses.</p>

<p>The <em>Bomb Busters</em> board game winning this award was also considered an upset for another tabletop critical darling. <em>Flip 7</em>, the press-your-luck card flipping game designed by Eric Olsen, has been winning awards left and right this year. Those include the 2024 Origins Awards Best Party Game, the 2024 Golden Geek Party Game, and the 2024 Board Game Quest Awards Best Game Award.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hayashi stated the main inspiration for his award-winning board game was <em>Babanuki</em>, a traditional Japanese card game. It is also known by another name in the US: <em>Old Maid</em>.</p>

Those were the PS5 Pros which were limited to just 35,000. But the PS1-style DualSense did still sell out quickly, with many missing out once the initial pre-order frenzy subsided. </p><p>The restock may cut down on some of those issues, including problems with scalpers, by requiring every person to have a PS Plus membership. At the same time, the emphasis on “highly limited quantities” makes it sound like Sony is content to still leave some fans out in the cold. Most of the other limited-edition DualSense controllers, like those for <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, <em>The Last Of Us Part </em>2, <em>Helldivers 2</em>, and <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>(lots of sequels this generation!) ranged from underwhelming to ugly. It’s a shame the only one everyone agrees looks awesome is also the hardest to get. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps1-30th-anniversary-ps5-dualsense-stock-pre-order-1851786249]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Official Cinematic Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Black Ops 7 was first announced in June during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. Activision didn't do much in the way of hyping or teasing the reveal beforehand, and that was intentional, as the company was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-will-be-like-a-beyonce-album-release-activision-says/1100-6532275/" data-ref-id="1100-6532275">actively trying to copy Beyonce's approach.</a></p><p>The game is set in the year 2035 and aims to be the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-announced-marks-first-back-to-back-black-ops-release-eve/1100-6532238/" data-ref-id="1100-6532238">"most mind-bending" Black Ops game yet</a>. Black Ops 7 is also notable because this is the first time Activision is releasing Black Ops games in back-to-back years. Treyarch and Raven Software are the main co-developers for Black Ops 7, and these two studios also co-developed 2024's Black Ops 6.</p><p>In addition to Black Ops 7, it's expected that Call of Duty: Warzone will get new updates in the future tied to Black Ops 7. In fact, the Black Ops 7 trailer concluded with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/possible-new-call-of-duty-warzone-map-teased-in-black-ops-7-trailer/1100-6532265/" data-ref-id="1100-6532265">possible tease for a new Warzone map</a>.</p><p>Black Ops 7 stars Milo Ventimiglia (This is Us, Gilmore Girls) as David Mason. The celebrity cast also includes Kiernan Shipka (Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) as Emma Kagan, with Guardians of the Galaxy's Michael Rooker reprising his role as Mike Harper from Black Ops 2.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches later this year for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. There was no announcement about a version of the game for the Switch 2, but Activision and Microsoft have said they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-still-coming-to-switch-apparently/1100-6532276/" data-ref-id="1100-6532276">remain committed to bringing Call of Duty to Nintendo systems.</a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Square Enix is prepping a remake of Dragon Quest VII, according to a new report. The RPG originally launched on PlayStation in 2000 in Japan and 2001 in the US, with this new take supposedly set to arrive sometime in 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/square-enix-developing-dragon-quest-vii-remake-for-release-in-2026" rel="nofollow ">MP1st</a>, the Dragon Quest VII project is labeled as a "remake" instead of an "HD remake," like the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review-history-repeats/1900-6418319/">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> that arrived last year. So the RPG could be receiving much more than just a fresh coat of paint, such as gameplay alterations. Before then, however, Square Enix has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preorders-are-live-at-amazon/1100-6530455/">Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D Remake</a> set to launch on October 30.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake - 7 Minutes Of Playstation 5 Gameplay | Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Interestingly enough, Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake producer Masaaki Hayasaka stated earlier this year that he would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-dev-wants-to-do-final-fantasy-6-next/1100-6527894/">love to tackle Final Fantasy VI next</a>. Hayasake made it clear this was just his personal preference while also noting that the beloved RPG was a major reference point for Octopath Traveler, the first HD-2D game.</p><p dir="ltr">This wouldn't be the first time Square Enix has updated Dragon Quest VII, either. In the mid-2010s, the company released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-7-fragments-of-the-forgotten-past-rev/1100-6443512/">Dragon Quest VII: Fragments of the Forgotten Past</a> on Nintendo 3DS. The revamped version of the RPG sported a new visual presentation as well as visible enemies on the map.</p><p>Square Enix is busy remaking another major RPG franchise's seventh entry, too. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-development-takes-another-big-step-forward/1100-6528974/">The story scenario for the third part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake was just completed</a> at the beginning of 2025. In May, the company confirmed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-confirms-entire-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogy-will-come-to-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6531363/">the entire Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy would come to Switch 2</a>. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (the second part) launched in 2024, and there's no release date yet for the final installment.</p>

		<p>BW Labs has revealed Fold &amp; Fly, a paper plane experience that is not quite what you’re used to. The game of Fold &amp; Fly has you pilot a paper plane through different worlds in the pursuit of getting high scores by collecting stars, and opening portals to other worlds by getting the dragonflies that are spread around those worlds. You can check out the gameplay in the reveal trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fold &amp; Fly Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jh6Byv1pKE0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Fold &amp; Fly will have procedurally generated levels, which means you are unlikely to have the same layouts to fly through during each play session. Additionally, the game will map generator using seed inputs, allowing players to create and save new maps to play through as well. The worlds do feature dynamic weather systems including fog and storms to up the challenge of piloting around the hazards in front of you. The full features listed by BW Labs include:</p>
<p>✦ Intuitive, smooth flying gameplay with paper plane physics<br>
✦ Infinite procedurally generated worlds to explore<br>
✦ Score-chasing action: collect stars and chain near-misses<br>
✦ Glowing origami dragonflies that summon portals to new worlds<br>
✦ A whimsical, handcrafted art style<br>
✦ Easy to pick up, satisfying to master<br>
✦ Great for quick sessions or long flow-state flights</p>
<p>Fold &amp; Fly is going to be released on July 25th for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3812280/Fold__Fly/">Steam</a>, and you can wishlist it now. If you are going to get it the PC specs you need to be aware of are as follows. There has not been any confirmation of Steam Deck compatibility.</p>

			<p>Sony Santa Monica has been working on *something* following the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/">God of War Ragnarok</a>, and co-creator of the God of War series and lead on the 2018 reboot of the series, Cory Barlog, has been leading a new project at the studio for some time. But we're still very short on any details regarding what's next for the studio.</p>



<p>PlayStation has been pretty mute on the subject of Sony Santa Monica's new game, but we do seem to have a small update on how things are going. In a thread on ResetEra, Bloomberg reporter and video game industry insider Jason Schreier responded to a question regarding SSM's next game and Cory Barlog's new project. </p>



<p>"<em>Cory Barlog's game is SSM's next big thing</em>," <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot46-back-to-the-beach.1172010/page-394#post-142651128">Schreier responded</a>. "<em>Last time I spoke to anyone about it (a month or two ago) it was going well.</em>" That doesn't tell us very much at all, but at least its a sign that things are in a good place at Sony Santa Monica regarding Barlog and his team's new game.</p>



<p>Schreier's next comment, however, is what made players raise their eyebrows as to whatever this next game is. The prevailing rumor about SSM's next big game <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-developer-might-be-making-a-new-ip/">has been that it is a brand new IP</a>, a big deal for a studio that has only made God of War games for its entire existence. After his comments on how things are going started to make the rounds on social media, and players expressed their excitement for a new IP from SSM,<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot46-back-to-the-beach.1172010/page-396#post-142655865"> Schreier followed up by asking</a>, "<em>Why does everybody think Barlog's game is a new IP?</em>"</p>



<p>Just asking the question doesn't insinuate one way or the other about Sony Santa Monica's next game being a new IP. But it does leave some doubt regarding previous rumors about Barlog's next project being the studio's first deviation from the God of War series. Ultimately, we'll have to wait and see what Sony Santa Monica and Barlog's team has been cooking, though who knows when PlayStation will be ready to talk about it. </p>



<p>The other major rumor circulating the God of War studio is that there's a <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-2-5d-metroidvania-spin-off-could-be-announced-today/">2.5D Metroidvania-style God of War</a> game coming. That project, supposedly, could be announced any day now, as it was claimed earlier this year that it was due to be revealed. </p>

            <p>You might remember Where Winds Meet as the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-open-world-games">open world</a> Wuxia <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> that mixes scenes of exquisite calligraphy with scenes of hooligan sword masters subjecting blameless bears to sonic bombardment, paralysing whole gangs of chimney sweeps with chained Blink attacks, and getting chased by angry geese.</p>
<p>If you don't, you can watch the below trailer or read Ed Thorn's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/where-winds-meet-is-a-wildly-ambitious-rpg-that-lets-you-yeet-bears">preview from 2023</a>, in which he commented "I'm both excited to see more and a tad worried it could end up being a disjointed, overstretched mash". Then you can consider signing up to the game's next playtest, which runs from July 25th to July 30th.</p><!--more-->

<p>The playtest introduces the city of Kaifeng, "with over one million square meters to discover", plus "10,000 NPCs" to befriend, pickpocket, punch (perhaps because they've witnessed you pickpocketing) and bother for quests. I'm not clear on whether this means 10,000 individually modelled NPCs, or 10,000 NPCs on screen, or just 10,000 NPCs in total. The figure seems meaningless without context. I should probably delete that line. Ah, but then I'd have to rewrite all this. Argh, let's keep going. </p>
<p>Expect "sharp contrasts - from the luxury of Fanlou Golden Street to struggling slums, from grand palaces to the mysterious ghost market". Also, "a range of classic Chinese activities", including bathhouse visits and traditional opera. The city will change in response to your actions: "abandoned wheat fields may flourish again, and rundown streets can become lively neighborhoods". Sounds like a lot of Video Game, but I'm mostly here to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p7Esu6l_9M">mess people up with a brolly</a>. </p>
<p>The developers are Everstone Studio, and the publishers are NetEase, who've been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-publishers-reveal-blood-message-a-naughty-dog-style-singleplayer-action-game-set-in-tang-era-china">making waves recently with their bigger-budget productions</a> and also, with their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-job-cuts-waiting-to-bite-at-netease-studios-according-to-insiders">rumoured layoff plans</a>. Fancy that playtest? It'll run on Steam, but you need to  <a href="https://research.easebar.com/htmls/007fb7/paper.html">sign up via this page</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/open-world-wuxia-rpg-where-winds-meet-is-having-a-city-sized-playtest-this-month]]></content:encoded>

Today, that drought ended with an explosion, as the abrasive Guardian of the Globe known as Rex Splode officially joins the playable roster.</p><p dir="ltr">Rex Splode's intro trailer shows off a few of his main combos and special moves, which utilize his ability to make anything he touches explode with kinetic energy. He's seen throwing exploding projectiles, turning himself into an explosive ball for multiple hits, and shoving two exploding sticks into an opponent's body before sending them off with a "polite" message.</p>

For its part, Iron Galaxy said it doesn't know how this happened, but it will remove it soon.</p><p>Iron Galaxy <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/THPS/comments/1ly2f8i/comment/n2rjhzz/?context=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said in a statement on Reddit</a>, "We have the utmost respect for anyone who makes games, we're investigating how that got in there in the first place."</p><p>The studio thanked fans for bringing this to the studio's attention, adding that the game case in the trash can will be removed in the next update.</p><p>This isn't the first instance of Pro Skater 3+4 causing a stir since launch, as players have also discovered that <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-locks-spongebob-easter-egg-behind-70-deluxe-edition/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">several Easter eggs are only available to see if you pay extra.</a></p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/1900-6418379/" data-ref-id="1900-6418379">Pro Skater 3+4 review</a> and our guide for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-all-secret-characters-in-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4/1100-6533126/" data-ref-id="1100-6533126">how to unlock all the secret characters.</a> The game is available now on Game Pass, or it can be purchased outright on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC, Switch, and Switch 2.</p>

If you're eager to know what's new in EA Sports FC 26, your day is almost here; EA is giving its latest football iteration the full reveal treatment later this week. And it's also unveiled this year's Ultimate Edition cover star, so you got something to look at while you wait.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, EA Sports FC 26's "full reveal" is scheduled to air this Wednesday, 16th July. Proceedings get underway at 5pm BST, so you've got approximately 47 hours at the time of writing to dig out your best hat in anticipation.  And when you're done, you'll be wanting to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSi0iJYSQ24">bookmark the appropriate YouTube page</a>.
</p>
<p>
EA's reveal announcement arrives alongside a <em>second</em> announcement <a href="https://x.com/EASPORTSFC/status/1944774028578684977">confirming</a> one of this year's EA Sports FC cover stars: retired Swedish footballer Zlatan Ibrahimović is EA Sports FC 26's Ultimate Edition cover star, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zlatan-ibrahimovi-accuses-ea-of-using-his-name-and-face-in-fifa-21-without-permission-ea-responds">falling out with the company</a> back in 2020 when he accused it of using his name and face without any agreement in the FIFA games.
