			<p>Later today, <strong>Battlefield 6 Season 2</strong> will kick off in earnest on all platforms. The second season of the military first-person shooter's live service was famously <strong>delayed for about a month</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release-date-january-update-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">causing outrage in the game's community</a>.</p>



<p>Now, in an interview <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/battlefield-6-seasons-shouldnt-face-any-more-delays-like-season-2-1675733/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Gamereactor</a>, producer <strong>Phil Girette</strong> has explained why that happened, while also suggesting it won't happen again following changes made internally across the various departments at <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> (which comprises DICE, Ripple Effect Studios, Criterion Games, and Motive Studio).</p>



<p><em>We came out of the launch from Battlefield 6, and we don't have the best of track records for launches, but it went pretty smooth this time around, so we're happy for that one. But that launch also takes a lot of work and time. We saw the content we had planned for Battlefield 6 Season 2 and we wanted just to give that a little bit more time in the oven to polish things and make sure we hit the expectations that players have.</em></p>



<p><em>Obviously, once you plan out seasons, there's a lot of things that come with that like the marketing work behind it, making sure the timings affect not only the game itself but many, many other things. Future seasons as well. Absolutely, we need to make sure those hit as expected and we have taken quite a lot of different steps in different departments to make sure that the players get the seasons immediately once the season is planned to end.</em></p>



<p>That's certainly music for the ears of active players, although they may be more concerned with Battlefield 6 Season 2 itself. Our David <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-hands-on-preview-is-an-emphasis-on-ltms-enough-to-reinvigorate-eas-2025-hit-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">played a couple of hours of the new content in advance</a></strong> during a press preview event, and <strong>he wasn't exactly thrilled with what he saw</strong>:</p>



<p><em>The reality is that Season 1 was always going to be a tough act to follow for Season 2. Besides the fact that it seems like we're getting one map fewer than we did before, it's not like Battlefield Studios was going to have something as big as REDSEC ready to try and hit the same highs as Season 1. And even if it did, that only passes the buck to Season 3 as the one that is set up to be more disappointing than the last.</em></p>



<p><em>When I look at the Season 2 roadmap, I can't help but feel it's counterproductive to have your biggest attractions also be LTMs, like you're trying to grab players' attention through FOMO. I can understand not wanting to commit to something that players might not love in the long run by automatically making them permanent, but it also doesn't present a strong pitch for why I should care about what's coming in Battlefield 6 Season 2 right now.</em></p>



<p>If you're looking for the <strong>full overview</strong> of what's going to be in this season, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reveals-season-2-of-battlefield-6-packed-with-new-maps-weapons-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jump to this article</a></strong>.</p>

            <p>Do you remember the .hack series? Are you even old enough to know what it is? Don't worry if your answer is negative, as even RPG veterans admit it wasn't particularly big in the West. Still, it remains one of the most fascinating series out there, albeit a hard one to follow due to its complicated titling and transmedia characteristics.</p>
<p>Now, just in time for studio CyberConnect2's 30th anniversary, a new project has been announced out of nowhere: .hack//Z.E.R.O. marks the return of the franchise, which had been dormant on the games front since 2017's .hack//G.U. Last Recode remaster. You can watch the first trailer below:</p> <figure>

<p>"<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bandai-namco-entertainment">Bandai Namco Entertainment</a> has given CyberConnect2 permission to manage the entirety of the project from planning and development to release. It will be a title that is fully self-published by CyberConnect2," <a href="https://www.cc2.co.jp/hackzero/en/">the official website</a> reveals. Yes, <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/19641-cyberconnect2s-30th-anniversary-game-revealed-as-hackzero-action-rpg-for-consoleshttps://www.rpgsite.net/news/19641-cyberconnect2s-30th-anniversary-game-revealed-as-hackzero-action-rpg-for-consoles">it appears Bandai Namco isn't letting go of the IP rights</a> and doesn't want to put money into the project, but thankfully, the entertainment giant has allowed it to happen with the original developers.</p>
<p>Shortly after the reveal, <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202602/66142">Famitsu</a> has published an interview with CyberConnect2's CEO Hiroshi "Piros" Matsuyama, who's serving as executive producer on Z.E.R.O. It's unclear right now if the game will follow an episodic format or happen over several entries in the style of the original series and the G.U. trilogy. However, more details were uncovered.</p><p>First, Matsuyama has said Z.E.R.O. isn't connected to previous entries in the franchise, which should help newcomers jump in without previous knowledge of the universe. The World, the online game inside which the bulk of the stories was set, will also return, but they're pushing 10 years into the future with the setting in order to double down on social media as a central part of our lives. Moreover, there will be a special focus on real drama between humans and "multiple layers of society as the main enemies," including an evil corporation (of course).</p>
<p>You'll have to wait for more details and the first in-game footage, but CyberConnect2 has also stated <a href="https://nichegamer.com/hack-z-e-r-o-announced/">they've been trying to get this game done for nearly a decade</a>, so chances are this is being treated as a big new beginning for the franchise rather than a one-and-done spinoff.</p>

			<p>Cyanide's <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Styx</em> series may not be a household name for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">stealth games</strong>, but it still managed to carve out a niche for itself thanks to its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">solid gameplay</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">personable protagonist</strong>, a rogue goblin called Styx who's never afraid to voice his mind. No one would probably call <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Styx: Master of Shadows</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/styx-shards-darkness-review-crafty/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Styx: Shards of Darkness</strong></a></em> the most accomplished of games, but, at the same time, <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">no one would deny how both games have plenty of heart.</strong></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">For nine years</strong>, Styx and his begrudging companions, including the former goblin hunter Helledryn and the dark elf Djarak, have been <strong>away</strong> from our screens, and for their return, Cyanide planned <strong>something big</strong>. Since the launch of <em>Shards of Darkness</em>, <strong>video games have changed a lot</strong>, and <strong>a linear stealth experience wouldn't have cut it</strong>. </p>



<p>As such, <em>Styx: Blades of Greed</em> overhauls the series' formula with a more&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-wont-be-for-everyone-but-thats-okay-hands-on-preview/">complex world design</a></strong>,&nbsp;sandbox features, and a more open-ended structure that make the experience feel quite modern. Though still a <strong>little rough around the edges</strong>, the game delivers an <strong>engaging stealth experience</strong> without sacrificing the heart that has always characterized the series.</p>



<h2 id="h-an-unquenchable-thirst-for-quartz">An Unquenchable Thirst For Quartz</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Styx-Blades-of-Greed-Story-Screenshot-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Styx is just as charming as eve</em><em>r</em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"> in a very rough sort of way, also thanks to solid voice acting</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Following the end of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Shards of Darkness</em>, Styx returns in a new adventure where he is <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">hunting for Quartz</strong>, a magical resource that is as powerful as it is dangerous for any who can absorb it. This time around, Styx doesn't have to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">rely solely on his wit and caustic humor</strong>. Alongside Helledryn and Djarak, the rogue goblin <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">assembles a crew</strong> to help him secure the Quartz while staying one step ahead of the Inquisition. Their journey provides a front-row seat to the onset of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Great War</strong> and the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">eventual formation of the Black Hand</strong>, the legendary mercenary group first seen in <em>Of Orcs and Men</em>.</p>



<p>Although <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Styx: Blades of Greed</em> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">does not attempt to do anything revolutionary</strong> with its characters and fantasy settings, there's no denying that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Styx remains a compelling protagonist</strong> and the most interesting member of the cast. His trademark <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">caustic humor</strong> is intact, and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">his remarks</strong> on anything that happens around him make the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">adventure memorable</strong>. On the other hand, the game provides <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">a slightly deeper look</strong> at the goblin: every time he absorbs a fragment of Quartz, Styx is confronted by a mysterious entity called the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Flux</strong>, which not only plays an important role in the story, but also offers the<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> chance to delve deper into the goblin's personality and motivations</strong>, painting a slightly more rounded picture of the character.</p>

<p>While the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">supporting cast lacks Styx’s magnetic cynicism</strong>, they are fleshed out enough to feel like functional parts of the machine rather than mere set dressing. Generally,<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> there really isn't anything so memorable aside from Styx</strong> that would get anyone to delve deeper into this fantasy world's lore, but <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">what is there is interesting enough</strong> to provide a decent enough motivation to push towards the next Quartz.</p>



<h2 id="h-just-a-goblin-in-an-open-world">Just a Goblin in an Open World</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Styx-Blades-of-Greed-Gameplay-01-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Styx: Blades of Greed's sandbox experience is one of the game's best features</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As mentioned earlier, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">developer Cyanide couldn't go with the same linear sort of stealth experience</strong> featured in the previous entry in the series for the new game. <strong>The stealth genre has greatly evolved</strong> since the days of <em>Shards of Darkness</em>, with an emphasis on open-level design and sandbox mechanics that simply couldn't be ignored in<em> Styx: Blades of Greed.</em></p>



<p>In this regard,<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"> the new entry in the series delivers</strong>, for sure. <strong>Locations</strong> such as The Wall, the lush orc village of Turquoise Dawn, and the Ruins of Akenash, the elven capital, are <strong>much more open than anything the series has featured to date</strong>, with an open-world sandbox flair that gives the adventure a very personable feel.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Even in the Prologue, this feeling is unmistakable. </strong>Reaching The Wall with their zeppelin, Styx and his gang find themselves stranded in a location filled with all sorts of dangers, ranging from gangs of thieves and marauders and the powerful Inquisition, and it will only be with the help of some new allies that they will be able to take it up to the skies again in search of Quartz. Although in this early segment of the game Styx will have to recruit a new dwarven pilot and save a specific individual from the Inquisition <strong>in a set order</strong>, the <strong>openness</strong> of the experience is evident.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Styx-Blades-of-Greed-Gameplay-2-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The pronounced vertical design elevates stealth gameplay considerably</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">These early objectives may be set, but the options are not</strong>: to infiltrate the tavern where the dwarf pilot resides, for example, players can scale the tavern itself to enter the dwarf's room from a window, or infiltrate it from the main entrances, creating all sorts of distractions for the enemies inside, and so on.</span> Right from the onset, the locations' <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">vertical design is remarkable</strong>, providing so many opportunities for stealth and concealament that make the experience <strong>very engaging from the get-go</strong>, even with the limited tools Styx has at his disposal in the first few hours, which will be later <strong>expanded</strong> via the game's progression system with new gadgets and special powers, including the ability to create clones, improved perception to spot enemies hidden by environmental elements and so on.</p>



<p>Once the first Quartz is absorbed and the crew takes to the skies again, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">the training wheels come off</strong>, and it's here that the experience turns into <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a full sandbox stealth game</strong>. With a compass in tow, Styx will have to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">search for multiple Quartz fragments scattered all over locations in any order the player wishes</strong>, with a challenge that can be greater or lower depending on the unlocked upgrades, with only the occasional forced story quest acting as a progression threshold every now and then. These Quartz-hunting missions are also <strong>quite varied</strong> and are never as straightforward as simply reaching a location. Something unexpected always happens, forcing players to always be on their toes and never grow complacent.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Styx-Blades-of-Greed-Gameplay-03-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Varied mission design is another of Styx: Blades of Greed's best features</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Besides featuring a solid vertical design, the<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> Styx: Blades of Greed</em> maps have a marked <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Metroidvania feel</strong> centered on two of Styx's new tools: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the Grappling Hook and the Glider</strong>. Unlocked a few hours into the adventure, both tools can be used to<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> access previously unaccesible locations</strong>, making not only the entire experience deeper with new stealth options, but also make <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">progression more meaningful</strong> in a very tangible way, especially in light how many of core's upgrades to Styx's toolset are maybe unlocked a tad too slowly, often <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">requiring multiple Quartz shards</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Blueprints</strong> to unlock via the game's skill trees. </p>



<p><span>Still, these unlocks are rather<strong>&nbsp;rewarding</strong>, especially the Quartz powers that give Styx some very powerful tools, such as <strong>Mind Control</strong>, moving at <strong>Super Speed</strong>, and unleashing a </span><strong><span>F</span>lux Blast</strong> to get rid of enemies. These, in combination with the <strong>passive abilities</strong> granted by Runes, give a sort of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">build flexibility</strong> in a game that has no loot whatsoever.</p>

<p>Another <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">core element</strong> that is required for a proper stealth experience is a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">solid enemy AI</strong>, but it's here that <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Styx: Blades of Greed</em> starts to show <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">some cracks</strong>. Although <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">enemy variety is overall decent</strong>, with multiple human and non-human enemies, including stronger enemies that cannot be disposed of with a single stealth kill attempt and require more guile to eliminate, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">their AI leaves something to be desired at times.</strong> Their keen hearing forces players to proceed carefully to avoid tripping over chairs and other environmental elements, making noise, and their reasonable, decent sight, especially at long distances, forces a careful approach. However, there are times when the enemy doesn't see Styx even if he is located nearby and not exactly in concealment.</p>



<p>Thankfully, at the very least, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">enemies are relentless when alerted</strong> and will hunt Styx until he manages to get away, so the experience <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">remains challenging</strong>, even if the AI sometimes falters. Unfortunately, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">it's </strong>during these frantic escapes that the<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> roughness of the experience</strong> is felt the most: the basic control scheme is a little <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">complicated</strong>, and doesn't feel very natural at the beginning, leading to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">wrong action at the wrong time</strong>; <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">melee combat is terribly basic</strong>, limited to a dodge and dagger attack, and requires locking onto an enemy first, which is an unnatural setup for most third-person action games. In addition, there are too many times when Styx is <strong>stuck mid-jump in geometry elements</strong>, which can lead to some undeserved defeats in certain situations.</p>

<p>Luckily, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">any defeat is not the end of the world</strong>, as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Styx: Blades of Greed</em> allows players to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">make quick saves at almost any time</strong>, even with a controller. This is a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">great quality-of-life inclusion</strong> that was essentially required, as the game does often rely on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">trial-and-error</strong>, especially at the beginning, and the experience would have been <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">way too frustrating</strong> without it. Hardcore fans of the series can ignore this feature and even disable it altogether by playing the game at the <strong>highest difficulty level</strong>.</p>



<p>Weighing what the game does well, and what doesn't in gameplay terms, it's clear how <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Blades of Greed</em> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">sits comfortably in the same space</strong> as its predecessors. It doesn't revolutionize stealth gameplay in any way, it's a little rough around the edges, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">lacking</strong> some quality-of-life features such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">a detailed map</strong> that would be essential for a sanbox experience like this (a few times too many I had to look around the map to find a fast travel point that would bring me to the airship), has <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">imperfect enemy AI</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">cumbersome controls</strong>, and maybe <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">too much trial-and-error</strong>, but it compensates this with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">great level design</strong>, and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a lot of heart</strong>, which is evident in its around <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">20 hours long experience</strong>. The total playtime can vary a lot depending on your stealth skills and how much you explore locations for optional items, and if you engage with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">character-focused side objectives</strong> that provide some light development to Styx's crew.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Styx-Blades-of-Greed-Graphics-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Styx: Blades of Greed's visuals aren't exactly cutting-edge</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The convoluted controls, the main character sometimes getting stuck in environmental geometry, and the wider assortment of bugs (including being able to take down enemies by grabbing them through walls), unfortunately, are only the <strong>tip of the proverbial iceberg</strong> regarding <em>Styx: Blades of Greed</em>'s <strong>technical state</strong>. <strong>Given the level of visuals</strong> the game pushes, which are acceptable but far from groundbreaking, <strong>one would expect solid performance</strong>. Unfortunately, <strong>that is not the case.</strong></p>



<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, on PC, the game suffers from the widely known <strong>traversal stuttering issues</strong>, for which nothing the<strong> shader pre-compilation step</strong> can do. They are not terribly frequent, but they happen often enough that it is impossible not to notice them. </p>

<p><strong>General performance does not fare well</strong>, either. On my high-end system (<strong>i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM</strong>)<span>, the game averaged&nbsp;<strong>55 FPS, 27 1% low</strong>, in a benchmark session conducted on The Wall map at&nbsp;<strong>4K resolution with DLSS in Balanced mode, high settings,</strong></span><strong> and no Frame Generation</strong>. Needless to say, the game would be essentially unplayable <strong>without upscaling</strong> on anything but the absolute top-end systems. </p>



<p>Thankfully,<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> hitting close to 60 FPS without any frame generation tech</strong> made the game play relatively smoothly with either DLSS or FRS Frame Generation. As it isn't an intense action title that requires split-second reactions, this is generally more than enough to enjoy it, no matter how technically disappointing this level of performance is. However, since most players don't have a beefy system like mine, I'd suggest you wait for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">more tests on lower-end hardware before committing to a purchase on PC if you</strong> <strong>don't have a top-end machine</strong></p>

				<p>Styx: Blades of Greed is the definition of a solid 'AA' game. It struggles under the weight of its own ambition and some Unreal Engine 5 optimization woes, but its charming main character and quality of its sandbox level design make it a game that those looking for an almost pure stealth experience will love.</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>

<p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Legend of Zelda</a> series celebrates its 40th anniversary this year, and it appears First 4 Figures will be joining in on the fun.</p>
<p>In a new announcement this week, the statue maker has given its followers on social media and YouTube a "sneak peek" of a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> - Link statue. If it looks familiar, it's because the standard edition is already available at "GameStop and other major retailers".</p>
<p>This particular statue, which is limited to the First 4 Figures website, is an "exclusive edition" - so expect it to be a little fancier than the rest and possibly have additional features such as LED functionality. The full reveal of the 9" painted PVC statue will take place "soon", and pre-orders are set to open online on <strong>26th February 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>If you sign up to the First 4 Figures newsletter, you'll also get <strong>$10 off</strong> the full price when pre-orders go live. Pricing and other details will be revealed on launch day, so when we hear more, we'll let you know.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>People started noticing last week that the Steam Deck was <a href="https://kotaku.com/its-becoming-impossible-to-buy-a-steam-deck-sold-out-valve-prices-ram-shortage-2000667790">becoming impossible to buy</a>. Valve declined to comment on the situation at the time but has now updated the PC gaming handheld’s store page to note that, yes, the Steam Deck is currently out of stock and will remain that way from time to time for the foreseeable future due to the AI-fueled memory crisis currently threatening every piece of the economy that relies on computers to run.</p> <p><b>“Note:</b> Steam Deck OLED may be out-of-stock intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages,” reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">new disclaimer</a>. “Steam Deck LCD 256GB is no longer in production, and once sold out will no longer be available.”</p>

 <p>Valve still hasn’t offered any clearer sense of when the $550 Steam Deck OLED will be back in stock or if the price will be going up. The company put the original $400 Steam Deck LCD model on sale last fall until inventory sold out at which point it was discontinued. Arguably the best bang-for-your-buck PC gaming handheld is now just completely unavailable in some regions just two years after the latest version of it launched.</p> <p>It’s the latest victim of the AI arms race in which “hyperscale” companies are investing hundreds of billions in building out data centers in order to supply compute for running models like ChatGPT and Claude Code to churn out everything from meme slop to finished app projects. No one quite knows where it’s all headed outside of promises that one lucky AI company will either create God or pop a 2008-style financial bubble in the process.</p>

 <p>In the meantime, markets that rely on affordable memory, like consumer electronics generally and <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-price-japan-pc-handheld-2000669424">gaming in particular</a>, are getting completely hammered. Sony is reportedly considering delaying the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-delay-memory-price-ai-switch-2-2000669410">PS6 until 2029</a>, the Nintendo is probably going to have to raise the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-tariff-ai-ram-stock-price-2000661382">price of the Switch 2</a> just a year after it launched, and developers behind new blockbusters are already scrambling to optimize their games for PC so players won’t need to spend an extra $200 upgrading to <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-recommended-pc-specs-ram-prices-2000668982">32GB of RAM</a> in order to play them when they come out.</p>

 <p>And of course all of Valve’s own hardware is currently in purgatory. With a new Steam Deck still a long ways off, the <em>Half-Life</em> company’s focus for 2026 was a new compact gaming PC aimed squarely at living room gamers. Valve was supposed to reveal the price and release date by now but had to push <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-release-date-preorder-ai-valve-2000665802">the pre-orders back</a> as it figures out how to source a rapidly dwindling supply of affordable PC components. I’m assured it’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-viral-ai-slop-post-was-made-by-same-guy-from-the-viral-ai-slop-game-2000668276">all for a good cause</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/ubisoft-reportedly-aware-of-rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-ost-requests</link>

<p>The new release comes with a "reimagined" soundtrack</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Rayman officially made a return on the Switch and multiple other platforms last week with the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_30th_anniversary_edition">Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition</a>.</p>
<p>While many fans are glad to see this iconic video game character return, as highlighted by our colleagues at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-is-missing-the-original-soundtrack-and-fans-arent-happy"><strong>Push Square</strong></a>, not everyone is necessarily happy about the original soundtrack being swapped out for a "reimagined" version, composed by Christophe Héral (known for his work on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/rayman_legends">Rayman Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/rayman_origins">Rayman Origins</a>). There's not even an option to toggle between the two albums.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rayman/ubisoft-knows-rayman-30th-anniversary-editions-new-soundtrack-might-not-recapture-the-vibe-for-you-so-its-looking-into-the-suggestion-of-adding-the-old-music-again/">as reported by GamesRadar+</a>, a Ubisoft employee has apparently responded to a fan suggestion via Discord about "adding an option to have the old music again" and claims the "proper team will have a look at this". This could also come down to who holds the rights to the music, as further noted by Push Square.</p>
<p>Although there have been reports that future work on the 30th Anniversary Edition wouldn't be happening, as our pals at <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2026/02/ubisoft-says-rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-support-is-planned-physical-version-skips-xbox"><strong>Pure Xbox</strong></a> highlighted, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rayman/comments/1r5eeso/comment/o5icgv2/?context=3">Ubisoft employee on Reddit</a> has supposedly "shot down" these claims. They noted how previous messages provided to customers were "likely a mistake" and have also reiterated how the company was already monitoring requests for the OST and other issues.</p>
<p>So, hopefully, there's still a chance of the original soundtrack returning in some capacity in a future update. Although the main composer Rémi Gazel passed away in 2019, his name does appear in the 30th Anniversary Edition credits.</p>

<p>Another Fortnite crossover is in the rumor mill, and it’s The Vampire Diaries. The show was a teenage dream with spectacular-looking humans (and vampires), captivating audiences for eight seasons.</p>



<p>It’s conceivable that every franchise in gaming, TV, and movie history could arrive in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fortnite/" id="46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>. That said, a The Vampire Diaries crossover would’ve been quite low down the Fortnite crossover list. Let’s see if there’s any bite to the rumor.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-the-vampire-diaries-come-to-fortnite">Will The Vampire Diaries Come To Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It couldn’t, could it? Credit to Outerbanks Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A Fortnite and Vampire Diaries crossover is a rumor and nothing more right now, and it appears to be one source claiming that it’s happening.</strong></p>



<p>It’s incredible how quickly speculation can spread like wildfire. There are many leakers in the world of Fortnite, but even the major ones, for the time being—haven’t outed a The Vampire Diaries and Fortnite crossover.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-week-11-quests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">All Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 Week 11 Quests &amp; How To Complete Them (February 12)</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Does this mean it’s not happening? Nope, but the evidence isn’t strong enough to confirm the fascinating collaboration.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-fortnite-amp-the-vampire-diaries-rumor">What Is The Fortnite &amp; The Vampire Diaries Rumor?</h2>



<p><strong>Content creator Incitable posted to Facebook <strong>on February 16</strong> saying: “FORTNITE x VAMPIRE DIARIES is COMING!”</strong></p>



<p>Arguably, the biggest sources for Fortnite rumors and leaks are Shiina and HYPEX, neither of which has said The Vampire Diaries is coming to Fortnite; this could be significant.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-has-a-kingdom-hearts-collab-in-development-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Has A Kingdom Hearts Collab in Development, It’s Claimed</a></li>
</ul>



<p>HYPEX has even outed lots of upcoming crossover leaks, but it doesn’t mention anything about vampires.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>EXPECTED FORTNITE COLLABS THIS SEASON</p><p>• LUNA &amp; MAGIK → Likely Valentine's Day<br>• HONKAI STAR RAIL → February 26<br>• RESIDENT EVIL REQUIEM → Early March<br>• SOLO LEVELING → Likely Next Update<br>• KERNEL HEARTS → ??<br>• OLIVIA DEAN EMOTE → ??<br>• 1-3 MORE COLLABS → ?? <a href="https://t.co/Bp1lEG058t">pic.twitter.com/Bp1lEG058t</a></p></div>— HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/2020906649301479642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Incitable says a lot of The Vampire Diaries content is on the way, including Damon Salvatore and Stefan Salvatore skins:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Damon and Stefan Salvatore are officially coming to Fortnite as part of the Fortnitemares update scheduled for Fortnitemares 2026. It was heavily rumored collab, but has seemed to gain traction and it is in the works along with the Twilight collab which many players are hyped for!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The crossover could happen, and it might be confirmed sooner rather than later. Until it is, take the news with a pinch of salt, as no one can confirm if the image is real.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/high-on-life-2-review</link>
            <guid>1437754</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The original <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/high-on-life-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3e46423c-496a-4cd0-b4f9-f8b468a6aa1d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>High on Life</em></a> was a decent enough title, but one that I’d never consider overly memorable. Its humor often missed the mark, with basic gunplay leaving each encounter feeling overly samey. <em>High On Life 2</em> wants to change this, but has it gone far enough?</p><h2>A Familiar Tale</h2><p><em>High On Life 2 </em>takes place years after the Bounty Hunter’s successful journey to stop humanity from being enslaved and smoked by aliens. After a whirlwind victory tour, they find themselves in a rut, going through the motions each day. They even start off in their old home, which has since been converted into a museum exhibit.</p><p>Things go south when their sister Lizzie - now a freedom fighter - gets a bounty on their head. Heading out to save them, it starts another adventure with the lives of humanity on the line.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>You'll meet a bunch of weird and wonderful characters, though most aren't present for very long.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The basic premise is very similar to that of the first game. Take out bad guys, collect new weapons, save humanity. In fact, I’d go as far as to say that it’s basically just a weaker retread when it comes to the serious side of the story.</p><p>At least <em>High On Life 2</em>’s humorous side is a slight improvement, cutting down on some of the forced chatter that plagued the original. There’s still plenty of it, mind you, with lots of jokes that just boil down to a simple bit that’s dragged on for far too long.</p><p>Many of the stronger jokes are ones that make use of this being a game rather than a TV show. Messing with the UI, having you draw your own face (that you’ll never see due to the game being in first person), and letting you find plenty of optional scenes if you walk off the beaten path.</p><p>I wouldn’t say that I find <em>High On Life 2</em> to be laugh-out-loud funny most of the time, but it’s at least bearable even at its lowest. At the same time, the focus on attempting to be funny does mean that any time things are made to be more serious, it falls completely flat.</p><h2>So-So Gunplay, Now With A Skateboard</h2><p>General gunplay is something that I was hoping <em>High On Life 2</em> would massively improve upon. The first game’s combat had little real impact and got incredibly stale by the end. Unfortunately, it’s generally the same in the sequel.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Returning Gatlians play the same, for better or worse.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While your Gatlians - sentient talking guns - take the place of regular weaponry, they don’t actually feel that different from other sci-fi shooters. You have SMG, a shotgun, and burst rifle equivalents to name a few, and they act generally as you’d expect. Each has access to extra abilities such as time stopping bubbles or electric spikes, but I didn’t use them much outside of platforming and puzzles.</p><p>The main issue is that you’re rarely required to switch guns on the fly during a shootout. Enemies don’t require specific strategies (not even boss fights) and all Gatlians have infinite ammo.</p><p><em>High On Life 2</em> tries to shake things up instead with the skateboard, “borrowed” from another bounty hunter early on. While you can sprint around, you’ll usually instead skate from location to location. It moves at a decent speed, and areas feature lots of jumps and ramps to make use of your new mobility.</p><p>While far from a realistic take on skateboarding, it does add a unique dynamic to movement. It serves as a speed boost, wall ride, and even an additional attack during firefights by launching it at your enemies. Outside of fights, you can also make use of it in skateparks and races for some extra cash and collectables.</p><figure role="group">
<picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/high-on-life-2-review-skateboard.jpg?itok=B89VI9GP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="804">

<figcaption>The skateboard is the biggest improvement over the original High on Life.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It can be finicky at times, such as killing your momentum after slightly clipping a rock, but it’s overall <em>High On Life 2</em>’s best addition over the original. Add in the air dashes you unlock later, and it becomes a fun way to get around both in and out of fights.</p><h2>A Buggy Launch, Again</h2><p>The first game’s launch was pretty rough, bringing with it a lot of performance issues and bugs. <em>High On Life 2</em> repeats this once again, with a framerate that goes all over the place and plenty of softlocks.</p><p>Playing on a relatively high end system with an RTX 5070 Ti, it would still struggle to hit a stable 60fps in some areas at 1440p high settings. Frame generation obviously helps, but even then, there’s still noticeable stuttering. Many textures also take a long time to load in, staying partially (or fully) low resolution until a good 10 seconds later.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Textures often take far to long to load in.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The review build also broke on me plenty of times, something that has only gotten slightly better since launch. Crashes are still present, along with other problems like the UI breaking or enemies not spawning in.</p><p>Some of this could be chalked down to the usual issues with <a href="https://techraptor.net/topic/unreal-engine" data-entity-type="taxonomy_term" data-entity-uuid="a875d7da-96c8-4f88-bce3-b2a21ac015b5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Unreal Engine 5</a>, especially the stuttering. However, the current state of <em>High On Life 2 </em>on PC (and likely consoles) is far worse than normal.</p><h2><em>High on Life 2 </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p><em>High on Life 2</em> is a slight improvement over its predecessor in some ways, but it’s hard to recommend right now in its current state.

            <title><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed Shadows Update Finally Lets You… Jump?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-update-jump/</link>
            <guid>1437751</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft isn’t finished with Assassin’s Creed Shadows, which dropped last year to a positive reception and a few controversies, particularly those concerning historical inaccuracies. It became a talking point within the Japanese government, amongst other things, which was pretty insane to see.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, February 17, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/ubisoft/" id="26">Ubisoft</a> will release title update 1.1.8 for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, kick-starting a special, limited-time parkour challenge, and adding a feature that many think should have been there the entire time.</p>



<p>Yes, that’s the ability to <strong>jump</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-manual-jump-coming-to-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Manual Jump Coming to Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<p>Forced automatic parkour will be a thing of the past in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows/" id="1478">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> with update 1.1.8. Ubisoft is encouraging those still playing the game to participate in a social-driven parkour challenge, creating an unedited shot that they can share to showcase their freerunning abilities in Feudal Japan.</p>



<p>There are prizes up for grabs, but only the cleanest routes will be in with a chance of winning.</p>



<p>To facilitate the challenge, Ubisoft has added <strong>manual jumping </strong>to Assassin’s Creed Shadows. That now means that, at the press of a button, you can <strong>jump</strong>. How’s about that for an update?</p>



<p>If you want to enable manual jumping, you’ll need to hop into <strong>Advanced Options </strong>in the gameplay settings menu and switch the feature <strong>on</strong>. Otherwise, you’ll still be locked in a creative box by automatic parkour.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Ubisoft is adding a detailed statistics page <strong>and </strong>new ‘visual feedback’ for crit hits landed in combat.</p>



<p>Next month, Claws of Awaji, the game’s major expansion, will be released on Nintendo Switch 2. Then, on March 20, the game’s first anniversary rolls around, and Ubisoft has promised something of a small celebration.</p>



<p>Tomorrow’s update will drop at 14:00 UTC and will measure up to 15.77 GB for Xbox users, and as little as 1.7 GB for PS5 users.</p>







<p>Are you looking forward to making some sweet parkour content in Assassin’s Creed Shadows with <strong>manual jumping? </strong>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Today marks the 10th anniversary of the launch of the first Layers of Fear, and for fans, developer Bloober Team is celebrating in the best way possible: by announcing a new entry. Layers of Fear 3 is officially on the way.&nbsp;</p><p>A live-action teaser trailer features a man reciting William Blake’s poem <em>The Sick Rose</em>, which is all fans have to decipher meaning from regarding what Layers of Fear 3 entails. The trailer did not reveal gameplay, a release window, or platforms, but we did at least get a logo for the game. Some might say that’s something.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VxU-9A3tw80"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VxU-9A3tw80" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“Layers of Fear is a franchise coming straight from our hearts and a beloved Bloober Team story,” says Bloober Team CEO Piotr Babieno in a press release. “The one that we keep on narrating since decade, it was the project that shaped our studio’s identity and set us on the path of crafting unforgettable psychological horror experiences. Ten years have passed, but we’re far from saying the last word - now we are revealing something new in the franchise. We hope it will plant a seed of excitement for the fans of this title.”</p><p>Bloober Team revealed more 10th anniversary goodies. For starters, the Layers of Fear games are being discounted. The first game is 90 percent off right now, and on Friday, the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2023/04/27/check-out-layers-of-fears-unreal-engine-5-performance-in-new-gameplay-trailer">2023 reimagining</a> will be discounted by 60 percent (but those who own the 2016 game can get this in a bundle for 70 percent off). A series of novels based on the franchise is in the works; the first is written by Marta Bijan and will be released at the end of the year. Fans will also be treated to digital and physical soundtracks for Layers of Fear and other Bloober Team games like The Medium and Cronos: The New Dawn.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to Layers of Fear 3, we also know that Bloober Team is making a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/12/konami-teases-a-remake-of-the-original-silent-hill">remake of the first Silent Hill game</a>. It'll be interesting to see which game arrives first.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Update 16/02/2026 6:00pm ET:</strong> Following the publication of this story, a representative from <strong>Hasbro</strong> sent this statement to Wccftech:</p>



<p>"<em>The Snake Eyes game is <strong>not cancelled</strong>. The team is currently taking time to evaluate the path forward for the game. While decisions haven't been finalized, we're committed to providing updates as soon as we're able</em>."</p>



<p><strong>Original Story 16/02/2026 4:43pm ET:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Atomic Arcade</strong>, the <strong>Hasbro</strong> and <strong>Wizards of the Coast</strong>-owned studio that was making a game based on the iconic <strong>G.I. Joe</strong> character <strong>Snake Eyes</strong>, has reportedly been <strong>shut down</strong>. The news broke from one of the former team members, gameplay programmer <strong>Dominic Braun</strong>, shared on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dominicbraun_opentowork-activity-7429184370877345793-37wz?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">personal LinkedIn account</a> that he had been laid off following "<em>Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast's decision to close Atomic Arcade</em>."</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, there's been no official word from Hasbro, Wizards of the Coast or Atomic Arcade confirming the closure or the fate of the Snake Eyes game. We've reached out to Hasbro for comment and will update this article if/when we hear back or if an official statement is delivered through other verified channels.</p>



<p>We first heard about the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hasbro-has-a-big-budget-g-i-joe-snake-eyes-game-in-the-works/1100-6506502/">back in 2022,</a> with Atomic Arcade seemingly being formed for the purpose of making this Snake Eyes game. While the studio was active in sharing notices that it was looking to grow its team between 2022 and 2025, with the last major update being a sneak peek at the Snake Eyes model from Atomic Arcade back in <a href="https://x.com/AtomicArcadeStu/status/1922305837042991257">May 2025.</a></p>



<p>It's the latest studio shutdown and mass layoff of the year, after <strong>Ubisoft</strong> kicked off 2026 by embarking on a "<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/"><em><strong>major reset</strong></em>"</a> that included multiple studio shutdowns. We've also seen layoffs from <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-shuts-down-deadpool-vr-twisted-pixel-games-asgards-wrath-sanzaru-games/"><strong>Meta</strong> that ended <strong>Camouflaj's</strong> award-winning run of developing VR games</a>, Riot Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-close-to-half-2xko-team/">cutting nearly half of the <strong>2XKO</strong> development team shortly</a> after the game's 1.0 release, and most notably, <strong>Highguard</strong> developer <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-weeks-after-launch-highguard-developer-wildlight-has-already-had-layoffs-reportedly-cutting-most-of-the-team/">cutting "<em>most</em>" of its team</a>, barely two weeks after Highguard launched.</p>



<p>But at least in all of those cases, the studios impacted had gotten a game across the finish line. Atomic Arcade, seemingly, did not get the same chance, and now it seems like G.I. Joe and Snake Eyes fans who have been waiting for a major release based on the iconic ninja will have to wait a while longer.</p>



<p>It's also one less game coming from Hasbro's IPs, as we know that there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-is-making-a-new-game-based-on-one-of-hasbros-tentpole-franchises/">currently several games from Hasbro-owned IPs on their way</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26</a> brings a new MyGM draft format, additional playable GMs, expanded match types, and more, as a deeper level of control takes center stage.</p>



<p>WWE 2K has released a new <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k26/ringside-report/mygm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ringside Report, </a>giving players an in-depth look at the changes coming to the popular game mode. Major changes include more match types for players to select, a longer season mode than ever before, and new choices for the authority figure on your show.</p>







<h2 id="h-default-seasons-are-now-50-weeks-in-wwe-2k26-mygm">Default Seasons Are Now 50 Weeks in WWE 2K26 MyGM</h2>



<p>WWE 2K26 features 50-week seasons by default in MyGM. Also, starting budgets have increased and now range from $3 million to $7 million. Everyone’s budget is $5 million by default. </p>



<p>It is expected that higher budgets will increase the average roster size per brand by up to 35 Superstars. There’s also a new difficulty setting, Immortal, for experienced players looking for a new challenge.</p>







<h2 id="h-players-can-choose-to-double-book-stars">Players Can Choose to Double-Book Stars</h2>



<p>Another new feature is the ability to double-book wrestlers in both promos and matches on a single show. This means players will need to manage their roster members’ stamina more closely and pay closer attention to the show’s format, but it adds more realism.</p>



<p>Speaking of promos, invasion promises are new to WWE 2K26. Players can now send a star to attack the opposing brand when playing against friends. A good promo will earn you fans; a bad promo will make your brand look bad and could cost you fans.</p>



<p>As for match types, players can now book wrestlers for a variety of options, including the new 3 Stages of Hell. There’s also now support for 5-way, 6-way, and 8-way matches.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-legendary-gms-are-added-in-this-year-s-game">New Legendary GMs Are Added in This Year’s Game</h2>



<p>This year, MyGM Mode added new playable general managers, including the legendary Bobby “The Brain” Heenan, Stacy Keibler, and the Anonymous General Manager from 2011. They join Eric Bischoff, Adam Pearce, Mick Foley, and Ava.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/story-about-ai-being-mean-gets-pulled-because-journalist-used-ai-that-made-mistakes/</link>
            <guid>1437676</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>On Friday the website Ars Technica published a story about Scott Shambaugh, a coder who made headlines in the tech world last week <a href="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>with his story</u></a> about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_agent?ref=aftermath.site"><u>AI agents</u></a>, and in particular one that he claims had written what he called <a href="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-gatekeeping-in-open-source-the-scott-shambaugh-story.html?ref=404media.co"><u>a 'hit piece'</u></a> on him and published it for the world to see.</p><p>Shambaugh’s story is as interesting as it was horrifying. Agents are just the latest front in tech's war on our collective sanity, a type of AI that's essentially a glorified autocorrect that in this case has been given a uniform and sent onto the internet to try to do human things like propose code changes and then, when humans like Shambaugh decline them, writing pissy blogs complaining about it.</p><p>Among <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91492228/matplotlib-scott-shambaugh-opencla-ai-agent?ref=aftermath.site"><u>other sites</u></a>, Ars Technica covered this last week with a news story that remarkably appeared to have some AI-created filler of its own, citing quotes from Shambaugh that never appeared in the very blog Ars was linking.</p><p>Not long after readers--<a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/journalistic-standards.1511650/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>including Ars' own community</u></a>--began noticing this, the story was pulled (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260213194851/https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/"><u>though you can still read the archived original here</u></a>). It's general journalistic practice that published stories which contain inaccuracies are edited and updated, not deleted entirely.</p><p>Ars has since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2026/02/editors-note-retraction-of-article-containing-fabricated-quotations/?ref=404media.co"><u>published</u></a> an editorial statement, bylined by EiC Ken Fisher, addressing the story, its deletion and the outlet's policies on AI:</p><blockquote>On Friday afternoon, Ars Technica published&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/?ref=aftermath.site">an article</a>&nbsp;containing fabricated quotations generated by an AI tool and attributed to a source who did not say them. That is a serious failure of our standards. Direct quotations must always reflect what a source actually said.</blockquote><blockquote>That this happened at Ars is especially distressing. We have covered the risks of overreliance on AI tools for years, and our written policy reflects those concerns. In this case, fabricated quotations were published in a manner inconsistent with that policy. We have reviewed recent work and have not identified additional issues. At this time, this appears to be an isolated incident.</blockquote><blockquote>Ars Technica does not permit the publication of AI-generated material unless it is clearly labeled and presented for demonstration purposes. That rule is not optional, and it was not followed here.</blockquote><p>By citing Ars' clear rules, Fisher's statement points the finger for this disaster at the two authors bylined in the piece, with one (Benj Edwards) having since posted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benjedwards.com/post/3mewgow6ch22p?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a statement of his own</u></a>, assuming full responsibility for the incident and saying the other (Kyle Orland) had 'no role in this error':</p><blockquote>I have been sick with COVID all week and missed Mon and Tues due to this. On Friday, while working from bed with a fever and very little sleep, I unintentionally made a serious journalistic error in an article about Scott Shambaugh.<p>Here’s what happened: I was incorporating information from Shambaugh’s new blog post into an existing draft from Thursday.</p><p>During the process, I decided to try an experimental Claude Code-based AI tool to help me extract relevant verbatim source material. Not to generate the article but to help list structured references I could put in my outline.</p><p>When the tool refused to process the post due to content policy restrictions (Shambaugh’s post described harassment). I pasted the text into ChatGPT to understand why.</p><p>I should have taken a sick day because in the course of that interaction, I inadvertently ended up with a paraphrased version of Shambaugh’s words rather than his actual words.</p><p>Being sick and rushing to finish, I failed to verify the quotes in my outline notes against the original blog source before including them in my draft. </p><p>Kyle Orland had no role in this error. He trusted me to provide accurate quotes, and I failed him.</p><p>The text of the article was human-written by us, and this incident was isolated and is not representative of Ars Technica’s editorial standards. None of our articles are AI-generated, it is against company policy and we have always respected that.</p><p>I sincerely apologize to Scott Shambaugh for misrepresenting his words. I take full responsibility. The irony of an AI reporter being tripped up by AI hallucination is not lost on me. I take accuracy in my work very seriously and this is a painful failure on my part.</p><p>When I realized what had happened, I asked my boss to pull the piece because I was too sick to fix it on Friday. There was nothing nefarious at work, just a terrible judgement call which was no one’s fault but my own.</p></blockquote><p>Look, I understand mistakes can happen when you're sick, but Edwards--who it should be noted is Ars' '<a href="https://arstechnica.com/author/benjedwards/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Senior AI Reporter</a>'--has used AI not once but <em>twice </em>here, and in doing so has caused a huge amount of reputational damage for himself and his employer in the process. And it's not like he used it to comb through 800 pages of impenetrable legal documents, either; Shambaugh's original blog was only a couple of pages long (<a href="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me-part-2/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">he's since written a follow-up</a>), and written in plain English, making the AI's hallucinations (and Edwards' use of it) even more damning.</p><p>It's disappointing someone working in this space felt the need to have to use this garbage, particularly when it violates their employer's own policies. As this whole mess has shown, the tech simply cannot do the most basic things the people selling it keep claiming it can. Citing quotes from a blog for your own story is bread-and-butter stuff for a journalist, it's what the job <em>is</em>, and seeing this busted tech worming its way into a profession that should be its sworn enemy– and fucking the whole thing up in the process--is just a huge bummer.</p>
