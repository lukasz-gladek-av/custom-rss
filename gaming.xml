Free Range Games‚Äô survival and crafting game first launched on PC as an Epic Games Store exclusive in October last year, before coming out on PS5 in December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we‚Äôre on The Lord of the Rings, Embracer said Middle-earth Enterprises had a ‚Äúslow quarter‚Äù year-on-year (the July to September Q2), with no notable new partner releases, but a higher film revenue than expected. Embracer said it‚Äôs seen encouraging fan reactions to the marketing it‚Äôs doing for the December release of anime <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim">The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Embracer had a brutal Q2 for PC and console games, with tough comparisons from last year‚Äôs <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/remnant-ii">Remnant 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a>. The most notable new release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a>, late in the quarter, ‚Äúwas well received by players but initial digital sales were slower than expected.‚Äù That‚Äôs corporate speak for a flop. In contrast, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/satisfactory-review">Satisfactory‚Äôs 1.0 launch on PC</a> ‚Äúperformed above management expectations,‚Äù which means it did great. Coffee Stain Studios‚Äô first-person open-world factory building game had over 200,000 concurrent players in September.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embracer has endured a tough time in recent years, laying off thousands of staff (the number of game developers working at the firm has decreased from 10,654 to 6,250) and selling a number of its studios, including Borderlands maker Gearbox and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 developer Saber Interactive. Today, it announced the sale of subsidiary puzzle game mobile developer Easybrain to digital games company Miniclip for $1.2 billion, which should keep the lights on for the foreseeable future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the rest of its financial year, Embracer is pinning its hopes on the hotly anticipated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, which it said was still on track for its February 11, 2025 release date.

However, we acknowledge that parts of our PC/Console and Entertainment &amp; Services segments are still underperforming due to delays and low ROI for primarily small and mid-sized releases. Combined with fixed operating costs this creates unacceptable margins which we are firmly addressing ahead of the spin-offs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other Embracer games in the works include Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core, Fellowship, Gothic 1 Remake, Hyper Light Breaker, Killing Floor 3, REANIMAL, Satisfactory (console), Titan Quest II, Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered, and Wreckfest 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/max-mustard-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>There‚Äôs a fair few VR platforming mascots that have come and gone, the likes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">Astro Bot</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/03/super-luckys-tale-review/">Lucky</a> graduating to broader flatscreen adventure, leaving a gap for new heroes to fill. Enter the quite adorable, yet inexplicably named Max Mustard. Can he make the cut?</p>
<p><iframe title="Max Mustard Official Trailer | PlayStation VR2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q_mfBhTzdAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game begins with a large, tentacle-y alien robot kidnapping a bunch of adorable critters, called Mudpups. Just as it‚Äôs about to get its tentacles on you, Max Mustard turns up and scares it off, so you immediately team up with Mustard to fight off the alien‚Äôs various minions and save the Mudpups. By controlling Max with your robot-VR-controller hands. It‚Äôs a platformer, it doesn‚Äôt need to make perfect sense.</p>


<p>The platforming in Max Mustard is similar to that of his VR platforming predecessors. It‚Äôs essentially a classic platformer but rendered in a world that‚Äôs wrapped around you in 3D, so you can physically move your head to look around and follow the character through the world. There‚Äôs also more player interaction with the levels, whether it‚Äôs shooting guns with your actual hands, peeking around corners for hidden collectibles, that kind of thing.</p>


<p>You‚Äôll accompany Max through four arcs, each of which has its own overworld map to work your way through, freeing Mudpups and collecting coins as you go. The platforming here is good, but not particularly notable. It does everything competently, but it doesn‚Äôt do anything particularly special. However, being a VR game does help make it more notable.</p>
<p>In addition to some of those coins and critters being hidden behind corners or other places that are easy to miss if you‚Äôre not careful, there‚Äôs also things like the plunger gun that you get very early on that turns a level into a platformer/shooting range at the same time, or the vacuum gun that allows you to suck enemies up and launch them at others.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs some nice touches without these specific tools as well, such as one area where two coins were definitely out of reach of Max, but I was pleasantly surprised when my random thought to just reach out and pick them up with my actual hand worked!&nbsp;The game also isn‚Äôt afraid to throw you off ledges mid-level either, or if you are foolish enough to pull the ‚ÄúDo not pull‚Äù cord in the van between levels, it shoots you through the roof for a bit before you fall all the way back down and land back where you started. Things like this just make me smile similarly to when it first handed me a plunger gun. It‚Äôs just fun!</p>

<p>It‚Äôs this combinations of VR and platforming where the game really shines, but there are a few great ideas sprinkled through the levels that don‚Äôt rely on it as well. One level was made of alternating platforms that changed every time I jumped, and another did something similar in time to the music ‚Äì music that could be customised part way through the level with buttons to turn instruments on and off and it stayed that way for the remainder of the level. There‚Äôs also a few mini levels, such as shooting ranges for the plunger gun with some pretty tight time requirements to gain a Gold medal and a Mudpup as a prize, or the coin frenzy where you just jump Max through a stream of coins to try and collect as many as possible in a certain time. This latter one is particularly useful when it comes to buying upgrades, which you can do at an in-game shop and has a selection of upgrades for both Max and yourself. The first one was unlocking snap to turn, so you can turn your view with the controller instead of physically turning in real life ‚Äì honestly quite ridiculous to have an accessibility or VR comfort feature locked behind a game upgrade ‚Äì but then there‚Äôs also the spin attack for Max, faster move speed, an in-the-air dash attack, and so on.</p>
<p>It all looks pretty great, too. On PSVR2 it is crystal clear without a frame drop in sight, not even when you‚Äôre flying through the roof of your van suddenly. There‚Äôs plenty of details in the world and especially on Max, whose ponytail flutters about in their wake. The game‚Äôs aesthetic is pretty much what you expect for a platformer ‚Äì it‚Äôs all bright a cutesy, even the enemies, and it doesn‚Äôt need to do anything more than that really. Most importantly, If you walk Max close to you they‚Äôll look right at you and I challenge you not to say ‚Äúaww‚Äù the first time it happens.</p>

<p>Throughout all this, Max handles almost exactly like Astro Bot, right down to jet boots which let Max float a bit in the air rather than double jump, except Max‚Äôs boots shoot flames rather than lasers. It‚Äôs clear that Astro Bot was a big influence here, but there‚Äôs more as well ‚Äì there‚Äôs critters to rescue ala Sonic, you save them by breaking the under-sized cages they‚Äôre trapped in like Rayman, there‚Äôs bouncy crates with arrows pointing upwards similar to Crash Bandicoot, you choose what level to play via a overworld map with set routes like Mario, Basically, there‚Äôs a love for platformers and you see the breadcrumbs of that appreciation spread throughout the game.</p>
<p>This feeds into the only real problem with the game: it‚Äôs just kind of unremarkable. It plays well, it‚Äôs competently designed, it looks good, and gathers various ideas from other places and blends them into a game that is good and enjoyable enough, but it isn‚Äôt going to blow your mind either.</p>
<p>The only other negative really worth mentioning is that, when moving your head and moving Max at once, you tend to end up walking off in the wrong direction because it can be fiddly to judge the direction, as it changes based on your view. This is easy to adjust your playing style for, and only cost me three deaths.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-gaming-ceo-gives-subtle-dig-at-ps5-pro-price-were-not-growing-the-market-with-1000-consoles/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was featured in several interviews this week. Firstly, he joined Fallout TV creator Jonathan Nolan on a panel at the Paley International Council Summit. During the conversation, the head of the Microsoft Gaming division <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-benefited-from-not-launching-with-a-new-game-says-phil-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> not having a new Fallout game ready for the show's launch was actually beneficial.</p>
<p>The executive then stopped by Bloomberg's New York City office for another interview. As reported yesterday, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> there is effectively no limit to porting Xbox games to other consoles following the launches of Pentiment, Grounded, Sea of Thieves, and Hi-Fi Rush, and the announcement of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. He also confirmed the existence of an Xbox handheld project (which, however, will take years to complete) and suggested more acquisitions might be possible, especially if it is an Asian developer.</p>
<p>In the same <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg interview</a>, Spencer gave a subtle dig at Sony's controversial pricing of the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro console</a>, saying the market won't grow with consoles that cost $1K.</p>
<p><em>I feel pretty good about where this industry is going. To reach new players, we need to be creative and adaptive of new business models, new devices, new ways of access. We‚Äôre not going to grow the market with $1,000 consoles.</em></p>
<p>The basic PS5 Pro costs $699, but if you add the optional vertical stand and the disc drive, the price increases to over $800. That's twice as much as the launch price of the PlayStation 4 Pro, Sony's previous mid-generation console refresh. The PS4 Pro included a disc drive (but not a vertical stand).</p>
<p>Microsoft hasn't mentioned anything about a mid-generation console refresh for the Xbox Series S|X. They did it for the Xbox One, of course; the Xbox One X launched a year after PS4 Pro, offering far better hardware at a slightly higher price ($499). Microsoft probably calculated that due to the rising manufacturing costs, it would have to offer a console with similar, if not even higher, pricing than the PS5 Pro and decided it wouldn't be a good idea to launch such a console on the market.</p>
<p>Besides, Microsoft isn't really focused that much on consoles anymore. While they <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> a next-generation console delivering the biggest leap ever (likely with the help of machine learning), their real approach is fully multiplatform, as evidenced by the push on cloud and other consoles.</p>

            <p>
Hello, person of exceptional musical taste; as you'll already be aware, assuming  you read the headline first and didn't just fall headfirst into this story by accident, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>'s sublime soundtrack is now officially available across all major music streaming platforms, meaning you'll be able cavort along to Divine Beat Dancing Lion's  boss battle music (costume not mandatory) until your extremities start to bleed.
</p>
<p>
Bandai Namco's newly released digital Shadow of the Erdtree OST totals 36 tracks (compared to the 67 tracks found in the base game), and features contributions from long-time From Software collaborators Tsukasa Saitoh, Shoi Miyazawa, Yuka Kitamura, Yoshimi Kudo, as Tai Tomisawa, alongside series newcomer Soma Tanizaki.
</p>
<p>
And as you'll already know, being a person of exceptional musical taste, Shadow of the Erdtree's soundtrack is a <em>treat</em>, featuring some of the best tunes in the entire game. Who can forget the hip-swishing fury of Divine Beast Dancing Lion, for instance, or the thrilling majesty of The Twin Moon Knight, or the sorrowful dignity of The Putresecent Knight? Or how about the cosmic splendour of The Mother of Fingers, the mournful Shaman Village, or even the bowel-loosening terror of the Abyssal Wood? Oh, and the absolutely gorgeous St. Trina's theme, which is fab for all sorts of reasons, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNBpg8Apvvs">especially this</a>.

<p>
It's cracking stuff, and the whole thing is now officially available - in most cases to either stream via subscription or buy - on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6ucsCXHRL0OXnAM51V8Cb9?go=1">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m7ysHzZR8PaDYTXIy6Kk0pOhosGM3Dh8U&amp;src">YouTube Music</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0DM7FNLVJ">Amazon Music</a>, Deezer, Line Music, AWA, Mora, and Recochoku. Full links can be <a href="https://lnk.to/6fGbIkfK">found here</a>. For whatever reason, Shadow of the Erdtree's complete soundtrack is not currently featured on Apple Music or iTunes, but there <em>is</em> a <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/album/shadow-of-the-erdtree/1760572104">truncated variant</a> knocking around on Apple's service.
</p><p>
Sadly, there's no new behind-the-scenes video to accompany this latest soundtrack release, but we can at least still enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIKUzL1cLpA">this performance of The Twin Moon Knight</a> shared a couple of months ago - you know, just to temporarily satisfy those ears of exceptional taste.

<p>Call of Duty: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season 1</a> is bringing a plethora of new content to the game, from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-maelstorm-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new weapons</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-details-on-new-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-maps-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maps</a> to a huge overhaul for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-1-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a> and an exciting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-battle-pass-release-date-season-one-pass-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass</a>.</p>



<p>On top of all that, Zombies fans will be excited to hear that a new map is also on the way ‚Äì Citadelle des Morts. For those eager to find out more about the new BO6 Zombies map, here‚Äôs everything you need to know, including its release date.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-the-new-bo6-zombies-map-have-a-release-date">Does the new BO6 Zombies map have a release date?</h2>



<p>Citadelle des Morts will arrive in the <strong>mid-season update for Black Ops 6 Season 1</strong>. As the new season arrived on November 14, and seasons tend to last around 8 weeks, we expect the Season 1 Reloaded update to arrive on <strong>Thursday, December 12, 2024</strong>.</p>



<p>Take this with a pinch of salt, as this is just speculation and not an official release date. Once Treyarch confirm the date for the mid-season update, we‚Äôll be sure to let you know exactly when the new Zombies map will be arriving.</p>

<h2 id="h-citadelle-des-morts-map-details">Citadelle des Morts map details</h2>



<p>Citadelle des Morts (Citadel of the Dead) is a <strong>round-based Black Ops 6 Zombies map that‚Äôs located in Europe</strong>, specifically the Principality of Avalon. It‚Äôs an <strong>abandoned medieval castle</strong> that is host to ghoulish horrors and hidden secrets. We don‚Äôt know many details, but from the teaser image, we expect the map to be fairly big.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Citadelle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD blog</a>, players will take control of the BO6 Zombies crew, <strong>Weaver, Maya, Carver, and Grey, directly after the events of Terminus</strong>.</p>



<p>This isn‚Äôt the first time players have fought waves of the undead in a castle, as Black Ops 3 brought Der Eisendrache. Hopefully, Citadelle des Morts can live up to the setting, as Der Eisendrache is one of the most beloved maps of all time.</p>



<p>The new map also arrives alongside a new Perk, Wonder Weapon, Gobblegums, Augments, and enemy types.</p>

Black Dragon is Mortal Kombat‚Äôs mercenary clan headed up at various points (the timeline is pretty complicated!) by fan-favorites Kabal and Kano. The lore justification here is Ghostface has been transported to Lui Kang's timeline without his partners from the movies, so recruits two members of the Black Dragon clan to help him out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, Ghostface is actually three characters in one. You can switch to temporarily playing as The Enforcer or The Assassin by holding a button during certain moves. You can tell them apart by their knives, if you look closely. You get 12 seconds to play as an alternative Ghostface before you revert back to the OG, or your opponent lands a hit and triggers the OG to come running back in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have analyzed The Enforcer and The Assassin‚Äôs unique movesets for hints at the Black Dragon characters‚Äô true identities. Already, there are two outstanding suggestions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for the identity of Ghostface in Mortal Kombat 1 follow.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mortal Kombat fans have identified moves that are directly related to Kobra (Enforcer) and Kira (Assassin), two human Black Dragon members who each made their debut in 2004‚Äôs <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-deception">Mortal Kombat: Deception</a>. We also see Assassin do Kano‚Äôs famous roll attack, but Kira does this move as well in both Deception and 2006‚Äôs Mortal Kombat: Armageddon. As you can see from the movesets, this one looks nailed on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction to this revelation has been positive, not only because it‚Äôs a clever way of bringing back two rather obscure Mortal Kombat characters that perhaps would never have seen the light of day otherwise, but also because it leaves the door open for other, perhaps more wanted characters to appear as Kameos or even fleshed out DLC characters with a potential, but so far unannounced Kombat Pack 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Ghostface, the OG version is voiced by Roger L. Jackson, who has voiced the character throughout the Scream franchise. Ghostface joins the Mortal Kombat 1 roster on November 19 as part of the early access period for Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Expansion owners, followed by wide availability for purchase on November 26. Up next is Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 Terminator.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Infinity Nikki, the hotly-anticipated "cosy" open-world adventure from the designer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, now has a release date.
</p>
<p>
Android, iPhone, PC and PlayStation 5 versions of Infinity Nikki all arrive on 5th December, Singaporean developer Infold Games confirmed today, allowing players to dress up, explore and befriend cute pets in an ever-expanding open world.
</p>
<p>
Infinity Nikki is the most ambitious project yet for the Nikki series, which has to date enjoyed enormous popularity in China.

This latest entry boasts involvement from Nintendo veteran Kentaro Tominaga, who worked for 20 years at the Mario maker and served as game designer on Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 
</p>
<p>
Infold's hopes for this new entry are clearly high, with a worldwide marketing push and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-nikki-tops-30m-registrations-and-its-not-even-out-yet">30m registrations for Infinity Nikki</a> already under its brightly-coloured belt. And yes, that is Jessie J singing the song for the game's trailer, above.
</p>
<p>
Infinity Nikki's smartphone predecessor Shining Nikki was downloaded 100m times, though was the subject of a cultural spat in South Korea over traditional costumes - leading to the game's Korean version being pulled, and criticism of the developer's handling of the issue.
</p><p>
At Nintendo, Tominaga served as assistant director on GameCube classics such as Zelda: The Wind Waker, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-twilight-princess">Twilight Princess</a> and Mario Kart: Double Dash. More recently, he worked on Zelda: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-link-between-worlds">A Link Between Worlds</a> and received a special thanks credit in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.

            <p>
There's a lot to love about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, but one of its most impressive and remarked-upon technical aspects is undoubtedly its advanced rendering of characters' hair. 
</p>
<p>
Hairstyles move and sway naturally as you and your party walk, while long hair streams out behind as you run. Your whole hairdo reacts if you are impacted by a sudden force or object.
</p>
<p>
There are up to 50,000 strands of hair on each of Dragon Age: The Veilguard's main characters, powered by something BioWare and EA's Frostbite engine team call Strand Hair technology. It's something originally worked upon for EA Sports FC, but which has been expanded upon greatly here.
</p>

<figcaption>Here's a video version of our Dragon Age: The Veilguard review.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f0BX-JXzek" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"While Strand Hair is present in other EA games, the BioWare team had to push the limits even further for Dragon Age: The Veilguard," EA writes in a new deep-dive <a href="https://www.ea.com/technology/news/strand-hair-dragon-age-the-veilguard">blog post</a> on Stand Hair. "For example, implementing Strand Hair technology for characters who have waist-length hair with horns on their head presented some unique challenges.
</p><p>
"With hair attachments that move seamlessly, and the decoupling of simulation and render tessellation, this is the first EA game to offer such detailed physics-driven long hairstyles. The Frostbite team increased maximum hair length from 63 points to 255, and implemented a new system for complex hair structures like braids."
</p>
<p>
Tomb Raider's TressFX eat your heart out.
</p>
<p>
There's some detailed technical notes on how it all works, though perhaps the most interesting bit here is how BioWare had to overcome difficulties dealing with the wealth of other semi-transparent objects on screen. In EA Sports FC, this hadn't been much of an issue. Here, in scenes frequently enveloped in fog, smog or fire, it was. 
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, BioWare developed a system where each hairdo is rendered multiple times, with opaque and transparent layers rendered and then blended on the fly.
</p>
<p>
"We first render the opaque part of strand hair, and then we render transparent objects," BioWare's senior rendering engineer James Power noted. "The shaders for the transparent objects use the transparent hair depth texture to determine whether the shading pixel is 'under' or 'on top' of the strand hair. If it's below, it renders the hair and marks a stencil bit (think of it as a masking texture)."
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>BioWare</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
There's discussion here too of how Strand Hair's "high memory footprint" is handled without degrading the performance. Dragon Age The Veilguard was never going to have a full squad of 22 characters on-screen all with Strand Hair at once, as is the case in EA Sports FC. But the added complexity of longer hair and more technical environments mean BioWare needed ways to adjust memory usage when multiple characters are shown.
</p>
<p>
For lower quality settings on PC, as well as Xbox Series S, the ability to ditch Strand Hair for more standard hairdo assets is also supported.

		<p>A long-awaited update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-vermintide-2">Warhammer: Verminitde 2</a> is here, with the Versus PvP mode now available to play after a free update. Not only that, but Fatshark has announced another free DLC level pack, Verminous Dreams, will be released starting in December.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer: Vermintide 2 - Versus PvP Mode | Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lpzON3pVSO8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Versus play has been a much requested feature in the Vermintide community, given how close in style it is to Left 4 Dead, which had an excellent take on PvP play.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs roughly what has been translated to Vermintide 2, with two teams of four facing off against each other, taking turns to play as the Ubersreik Five heroes and the Pactsworn, giving players five Skaven beasts to choose from, each of which has a specific ability ‚Äì you‚Äôll know them as the special enemies that you regularly face off against in PvE.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a new set of challenges and rewards to go alongside this, designed specifically for and earned through playing Versus, but letting you show off in other modes as well.</p>

<p>Fatshark has also revealed that a new free DLC pack, Verminous Dreams, will be added to the game. This will feature three new levels, the first of which arrives for all platforms on 9th December, with the remaining two levels coming in early 2025.</p>

<p>While it originally launched in 2018 for PC, and has now been followed by the sci-fi fuelled Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, Vermintide 2 has remained a fun co-op staple. We revisited Vermintide 2 back in 2022 and had a fantastic time once again. Jim said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúOverall, Vermintide 2 offers a brilliant core game bolstered by years of updates, content, and support from its developers. That kind of passion hasn‚Äôt gone unnoticed by the Warhammer community, who eagerly await what may be coming next for the series. That said, those hoping to see Vermintide 3 in the near future may have a long wait ahead of them with Fatshark currently focusing its efforts on taking their four player co-op formula to the far future in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/15/warhammer-40000-darktide-delayed-until-2022/">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>. The team is no doubt hoping lightning will strike twice as they leave the fantasy world behind for this grimdark sci-fi setting.‚Äù</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-2-remake-coming-to-iphone-in-december/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest models of the iPhone are pretty capable when it comes to handling high-end games, and developers are working to take full advantage of Apple's A17 Pro and A18 Pro chips. We are now hearing that Capcom is readying its Resident Evil 2 remake for the iPhone and iPad, with the release date set for December 10, possibly a day after the company releases iOS 18.2 to the public.</p>

<p>To be precise, it will be Capcom's fourth Resident Evil game for the iPhone and iPad and only one of the few AAA games you can play on your iOS or iPadOS device. When Apple announced on stage that it would bring PC games to the iPhone, people presumed that the company would port the titles to a more handheld version. However, the capability of the iPhone's latest chips has proved to be more significant than we previously expected.</p>
<p>The company released a full-fledged version of the PC game for the iPhone and not a stripped-down 'lite' version. The games were brought to the mobile experience without any cuts or edits, and they remained the same as they were on PCs or consoles. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-a17-pro-gpu-features-ray-tracing-metalfx-upscaling-resident-evil-iv-remake-village-assassins-creed-mirage-coming-to-iphones/">Assasin's Creed Mirage</a> was another title that made headlines when the company offered it on the iPhone with full controller support and stunning visuals.</p>
<p>Capcom has confirmed that the Resident Evil 2 remake will be released on iPhone on December 10. At this stage, the company did not mention how much the game would cost, but it did say that it would be just like other titles. You will be able to download the game free from the App Store and play the trial version absolutely free of charge. If you wish to continue playing and move out of the demo version, you must buy the full game.</p>
<p>If we presume that Capcom remains true to its words, we can expect the price of the Resident Evil 2 remake to be between $19.99 and 59.99, similar to its existing titles. If you are excited to play the popular title on your mobile device, it is worth noting that only the latest iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models will be compatible, along with last year's iPhone 15 Pro models with an <a href="https://wccftech.com/ipad-mini-7-decent-gaming-tablet-for-running-resident-evil-4-remake/">A17 Pro chip</a>. If you have a compatible iPad or Mac, you will still be able to enjoy the game and make use of cross-progression to continue where you left off on another device.</p>
<p>You can register for Resident Evil 2 on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resident-evil-2/id1640632432">App Store</a> right now. We will let you guys know when the title hits the App Store. We will be covering the performance of the game on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, so be sure to keep an eye out.</p>

            <p>Epic Games has given the OK for their 1998 shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unreal">Unreal</a> to be hosted on the Internet Archive, essentially making the classic sci-fi alien blaster free, and preserving it for the future. They've also given the same permission for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a> to be hosted there too, making free the multiplayer muckabout that spawned speedier and speedier sequels throughout the early 2000s (not to mention the origin of one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-making-of-facing-worlds-unreal-tournaments-most-popular-map">most memorable multiplayer FPS maps of all time</a>, Facing Worlds). </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Epic gave permission for this very recently, say fan group Old Unreal (as spotted by the folks on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-games-gives-the-thumbs-up-to-archive-org-copies-of-unreal-gold-and-unreal-tournament-goty-free-to-download-for-all.1035414/">ResetEra</a>). That fan site are leading the way in making the now-free games easier to download and install. Archive.org is great, but it's not always the most user friendly of libraries. So the gang of Skaarj custodians have created two installers that will do everything for you. Here's <a href="https://www.oldunreal.com/downloads/unreal/full-game-installers/">one for Unreal Gold</a> and <a href="https://www.oldunreal.com/downloads/unrealtournament/full-game-installers/">one for Unreal Tournament</a>. </p>
<p>These basically slurp the .iso files from the Internet Archive's server and run everything necessary to get the games installed on modern machines. I tested it for Unreal Tournament and, yup, everything looks lovely. You'll still need to do some extra steps to play online with others, though, say the Old Unreal gang. </p>
<p>Epic Games delisted the first Unreal from Steam a couple of years ago, along with all other Unreal games. The reasons for this are obvious, considering Epic has its own store that directly competes with Steam. It still annoyed some people though. Maybe now that two of these games are totally free, no questions asked, that move can be forgiven. We are recently seeing some moves here and there towards game preservation, such as GOG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-are-doubling-down-on-game-preservation-and-making-it-easier-to-see-which-games-run-well-on-modern-pcs">renewing their vows to making classic games playable on modern PCs</a>. And this isn't the first time Epic gave their original shootso <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unreal-free-for-20th-birthday">away for free</a> (although that was a temporary birthday celebration). But yes. All this is generally good. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">Free games</a> are good.</p><p>Unreal, for its part, was an important and impressive bit of blastin' at the time of release. It scared me to death. But that's okay, I confronted those fears years later by asking various members of the development team <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unreal-retrospective-from-the-people-who-made-it">what it was like to make back in 1998</a>. Short answer? People worked 70-80 hour work weeks, and made some nice alien cows. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-%E2%80%93-don%E2%80%99t-sleep-on-the-%E2%80%9Cfight-wisely%E2%80%9D-auto-battle-option.1035534/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-dont-sleep-on-the-fight-wisely-auto-battle-option/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Since the original release of the fourth entry in the series, the Dragon Quest franchise has featured some auto-battle options that let the AI take control of party members and fight enemies in place of the player. While the AI programming has always been on the simple side, it has always worked surprisingly well, so much so that auto-battle options were later implemented in the remakes of the first three entries in the series, working as nicely as they did in the games that were developed with the feature in mind.</p>
<p>As such, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> unsurprisingly features some auto-battle options called Tactics that allow the player to focus on following the story and exploring the world and let the AI handle the fighting. While some players may scoff at the idea of using auto-battle options, you should definitely not sleep on them in the game, especially the Fight Wisely option, as using it can increase your enjoyment of the experience.</p>
<p>Unlike other remakes of older JRPGs, which tone down the encounter rate to offer a more welcoming experience, <a href="https://dragonquest.square-enix-games.com/games/en-us/dragon-quest-123-hd2d-remakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> doesn't do anything of the sort, only allowing players to manipulate the encounter rate by using items and abilities that are not immediately available at the start of the game. This means that most of the time, you will be fighting a lot of enemies as you go on about the Hero's journey to save the world.</p>
<p>After a while, fighting so many enemies just to get from one point to another of the map can get quite tiresome, even though the high encounter rate is a core part of the Dragon Quest experience design. However, this becomes less of an issue if you use the Tactics options appropriately in fights against mobs.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241113235733_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Fight Wisely option, in particular, is a great auto-battle option and the best to use against mobs in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake for a few reasons. In the vast majority of cases, this option truly picks the best possible combat options for both offense and defense, prioritizing taking down the most powerful enemies and groups while also handling healing and support surprisingly well. Few have been cases in my current playthrough where the AI hasn't made the same decisions I would have made, with only some small exceptions, such as making my Priest use an offensive spell when a single enemy was left that could have been taken down with weapons. This effectively saved me a lot of time in mob fights, improving combat pacing a lot and making the experience more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Saving time in battles isn't the only reason you should use the Fight Wisely auto-battle option in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake. Another very good reason is that the AI controlling your characters essentially cheats against the enemies. For example, it handles healing in a way the player never would, healing characters that get at low health unpredictably, something that a human player could never do, also using items when magic spells are not available. In addition, the AI always selects the element an enemy is weak against, and it is also capable of attacking the reinforcements that some enemies call during battle, which is something that is extremely useful against enemies that call healers as backups, such as Healslimes.</p>
<p>Everything considered, you really shouldn't sleep on the Fight Wisely auto-battle option in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake. While not the absolute best choice for bosses, where you want to have full control of your characters, it is a more than viable option to improve your experience and make the high encounter rate less of an issue.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> is clamping down on what it calls "disruptive behaviour" - specifically, players going AFK to boost account levels without playing, or playing on alternative servers via VPNs.
</p>
<p>
The franchise's Ricochet Anti-Cheat technology has been tuned to better detect AFK players who load into matches simply to gather XP without any intention of playing, disrupting team balance and infuriating team mates. 
</p>
<p>
Anyone looking to unlock Ranked Play will now need to win 50 match-made multiplayer matches before doing so, in order to ensure Ranked players are at the correct skill level (presumably, to give less experienced players a chance to improve but also stop sweaty veterans making fresh accounts that get matched with newbies). 
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, this change is also designed to give Ricochet a cache of match history data to "examine", with top players further looked into via a Replay Investigation Tool to ensure everyone's playing by the rules. 
</p>
<p>
These updates will also apply to Ranked Play when it arrives in Call of Duty Warzone, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes">patch notes</a> state.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday we took a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-battle-pass-includes-a-parasite-skin-for-some-reason">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Season 1 battle pass</a>, which includes a parasite skin and what looks like a rip-off of Rocket Raccoon.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warzone-black-ops-6-season-1-release-date-time">Call of Duty Warzone and Black Ops 6 Season 1</a> launches today at 5pm UK time. </p>
<p>"For a series built on high-octane thrills and explosive gratification, its withdrawal to the well-trodden formula echoes the wider industry's continued allergy to risk," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Eurogamer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Marking the 30th anniversary of the Warcraft series, Blizzard has released remasters of the first two games ‚Äì Warcraft and Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness ‚Äì and a big update for the much maligned <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/05/warcraft-3-reforged-review-blizzard/">Warcraft 3: Reforged</a> as well.</p>
<p>Each game is available individually ‚Äì Warcraft: Remastered is ¬£9, Warcraft 2: Remastered for ¬£12.59 ‚Äì or all three within the Warcraft Battle Chest for ¬£35.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warcraft Remastered Battle Chest Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ryZ2jiW95qo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The emphasis for Warcraft and Warcraft 2 has been to bring the games a little more up to date without affecting the original games. Both games have been given a fresh lick of paint with new graphics and widescreen output, but you‚Äôre able to switch between the original graphics and remastered ones in real time ‚Äì I personally think that, however they did them, the new sprites lose a lot of the original charm and look quite mobile game-y.</p>
<p>Both games also have UI and UX improvements, such as tooltips and healthbars, a mission select screen, increased unit selection, redone mission intro screens, and more. Warcraft I in particular gains right-click move, band box selecting and a faster game speed to better match the sequels.</p>

<p>Warcraft 2 will still have multiplayer functionality, with all legacy custom maps remaining playable and compatible.</p>
<p>All of this sounds like Blizzard took on board the sweeping criticism of their last Warcraft remaster, Warcraft 3: Reforged, and they‚Äôve also gone back to Reforged to bring a lot of community requested changes and improvements. Patch 2.0 is out now for Warcraft 3: Reforged, adding hotkey customisation, and updated ladder and more as quality of life improvements. They‚Äôve also retouched the graphics,&nbsp;overhauling the environments, lighting and user interface‚Ä¶ but most importantly adding uprezzed classic Warcraft 3 assets to HD and now letting you pick and choose between settings to get the classic vanilla experience or the updated one.</p>
<p>Long overdue, and what Reforged should have been in the first place, but good to see.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Warcraft universe, Blizzard has started a fresh lap of World of Warcraft, announcing the launch of new World of Warcraft: Classic realms that let you play the classic World of Warcraft: Classic without all the pesky expansions and updates that have been added to it in the last five years. Expect WoW Classic Classic Classic to launch in 2029.</p>

Pok√©mon TCG Pocket's plan to add fresh booster packs before the end of 2024 lines up with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-first-expansion-due-late-january-leak-suggests">recent datamine which suggested at least one additional pack would arrive in December</a>, before a fully-fledged new expansion due on 29th January next year. 
</p>
<p>
That datamine also highlighted in-progress work on a new card rarity and rare card picks being added to the Wonder Pick mechanic. As ever, however, datamined details are subject to change.
</p>
<p>
"We have other new features in development outside of the trade feature," the Pok√©mon TCG Pocket team wrote. "We plan to announce more details about the update as the dates for the addition of these features are finalised, so please look forward to it.
</p>
<p>
"We hope you continue to enjoy Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Pocket. Don't forget to open your packs each day!"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/gog-preservation-program-launched-to-actively-support-golden-oldies-on-pc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The GOG Preservation Program has been revealed by CD Projekt‚Äôs DRM-free digital storefront, the company deciding to take a more active step of ensuring that classic games remain playable on modern systems.</p>
<p><iframe title="GOG Preservation Program - Make Games Live Forever" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IetvbdoeIhg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>At the launch of this program, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program">100 games have been handed a ticket into the Preservation Program</a>, with GOG running it through various quality tests to ensure that it runs well on modern systems. If it can pass those test, it‚Äôs stamped with a Good Old Game status on the store, and if it doesn‚Äôt, then GOG will provide active tech support to help ensure that the game will work again.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe test and update the games so they work flawlessly on the most popular PC configurations ‚Äì now and in the future,‚Äù they write in an FAQ. ‚ÄúThe PC landscape is constantly evolving, with changes like new Windows updates or graphics card drivers occasionally affecting compatibility. If you encounter any issue with a game in the program, please contact our customer support so that we can verify and fix this issue for everyone. This helps us maintain the quality of those titles.‚Äù</p>
<p>GOG, which lest we forget already stands for Good Old Games, was first launched with a library of 90s and early 2000s classic, back when Windows XP was still in heavy use and Windows 7 was a new operating system on the block. Even then, with significant OS changes made in Windows Vista, such as with 64-bit CPUs, it was pretty common to need to run a game in a compatibility mode, but GOG ensured that games added would be playable on the latest OS.</p>

<p>GOG tracks what changes are made to each game in the program, even if it‚Äôs as simple as noting that they have validated stability and compatibility with Windows 10 and 11. Other changes can be more significant.</p>
<p>As GOG has grown, it‚Äôs morphed to be a more general purpose digital storefront, selling newer games, so long as they can be sold DRM-free. Those games are generally outside the purview of this programme, though that doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt some more modern surprises that are featured.</p>
<p>So yes, there‚Äôs 90s classics like the original Fallout, Sid Meier‚Äôs Alpha Centauri and Riven, but there‚Äôs also Alpha Protocol, Fallout: New Vegas, Dragon Age: Origins, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and Mad Max.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: Origins is a key example of what GOG will do, with an update that has added Large Address Aware support for better memory usage, and limited the game to run on 2 CPU cores to boost performance.</p>
<p>However, they will not include community patches, beyond replicated well understood fixes ‚Äì&nbsp;‚ÄúThe GOG Preservation Program aims to preserve the original game and make it playable on modern machines. This means being very careful with any modification that might alter the original experience. We also want to avoid passing the responsibility of maintaining the game‚Äôs quality on to the community, as it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to you.‚Äù</p>
<p>This is a great move by GOG, getting back to their roots, and highlighting game preservation and access once again. This very regularly ends up in the forefront of gaming discussion, as servers are switched off or companies seek to lock up their back catalogues,</p>

            <p>Well, that was quick. After artwork <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warcraft-2-tides-of-darkness-remastered-apparently-leaks-ahead-of-the-rts-series-30th-anniversary-direct-next-week">leaked last week</a> for what looked very much like a remaster of classic real-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warcraft-2-tides-darkness">Warcraft II: Tides Of Darkness</a>, Blizzard sneakily dropped both that and a remaster of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warcraft-orcs-humans">Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans</a> last night. They‚Äôre bundled together with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warcraft-iii-reforged">Warcraft III: Reforged</a> - itself with a new patch - in a 'Warcraft Remastered Battle Chest', which also includes the older versions of the first two games. The chest is available <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/warcraft-remastered-battle-chest?p=1863680">on Battle.net</a>, where it‚Äôll set you back ¬£34.99 / $39.99. If you‚Äôre just after the older titles, they‚Äôre ¬£9 / $10 and ¬£12.59 / $15 respectively.</p>

<p>As for changes to the remasters, there‚Äôs updated controls for Warcraft 1, bringing it more in line with the sequel, along with some customisable UI and UX elements. Warcraft 2‚Äôs multiplayer is apparently fully intact, with legacy custom maps compatible and playable. Both feature remastered assets. Warcraft 3: Reforged got a 2.0 patch, which Blizzard say "includes updated Classic HD assets and improved Reforged environment visuals. Customize your army to play with the visuals you prefer."</p>
<p>Personally? I think the remasters look like dogwater. I‚Äôd say they reminded me of a Newgrounds flash game but I‚Äôm positive I‚Äôve played several that were much nicer. It looks a dentist waiting room pop-up book of itself run through several washing machine cycles then brightened up with an MS paint tool meant to emulate crayons made of the sun. It looks like it's going to try and offer me a discount on an energy bundle so I can run my farms for another hour, but I only if I send an invite to my aunt. If I‚Äôm blinded by nostalgia, then I choose to remain blind forever. Actually, I‚Äôll have ten percent more blindness please. The colours are still too much.</p>
<p>Still, if nothing else, they are now a thing that exists and that Blizzard is selling, so there‚Äôs that. Enjoy, I guess.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Blizzard hosted the Warcraft 30th anniversary livestream a few hours ago, revealing a boatload of information on the franchise's portfolio. Let's start with the original real-time strategy trilogy because Warcraft III Reforged 2.0 is live now, bringing a wealth of visual improvement. To begin with, the developers introduced high-definition versions of the Classic Units, Buildings, VFX, Heroes, Environments, and Icons while allowing players complete freedom to customize between Reforged and Classic HD assets. Moreover, the environments have been improved, ambient lighting has been enhanced, the tone map has been updated, and the bloom removed.</p>
<p>The patch also introduces XP and leveling for Ranked Play multiplayer matches. The leaderboard is based on the amount of XP; if players have the same XP rank, the tiebreaker will be MMR. Level and XP will be reset with each season.</p>
<p>Blizzard also launched the remasters of Warcraft I and II. Players will have the option to switch in real time between the remastered and vanilla graphics. Warcraft I also received a few quality-of-life control improvements, such as faster game speed and right-click to move. Both titles got user interface improvements. Fans can now purchase the updated Warcraft Battle Chest <a href="https://eu.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/warcraft-remastered-battle-chest?p=1863680" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Battle.net</a> featuring all three remastered games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct: Celebrations, Reflections, and a Look Ahead" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0rEfOTxr59o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Blizzard briefly touched upon <a href="https://wccftech.com/warcraft-rumble-launches-november-3-pre-registration-is-open/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warcraft Rumble</a>, too. Since its launch in November 2023, the tower defense/action strategy game saw players beat over 900 million bosses. The development team also announced that the game is coming to PC, with a beta scheduled for December 10.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, there were a bunch of World of Warcraft announcements. The highlight was easily the news that player housing will, at long last, be added to the next expansion, World of Warcraft: Midnight. The game was the only big MMORPG to lack housing, so its many fans will undoubtedly be delighted.</p>
<p>As for the content updates scheduled for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-better-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The War Within</a>, Siren Isle, currently being tested on the PTR, will drop on December 17 on live servers. There will be a new outdoor environment to explore. The World of Warcraft team also shared a detailed roadmap for what's next, starting with the goblin city of Undermine.</p>

<p>For World of Warcraft Classic, to celebrate the 20th Anniversary, fresh realms will go live on November 21. Blizzard also confirmed that Mists of Pandaria Classic will go live in the Summer of 2025.</p>
<p>Over 254 million players have joined the Warcraft franchise throughout its thirty years of history. Moreover, Blizzard says fans have spent over 1 billion days playing World of Warcraft throughout its two decades of life. Hearthstone was also a big success, with 160 billion games without factoring in <a href="https://wccftech.com/hearthstone-battlegrounds-duos-qa-blizzard-talks-about-the-upcoming-2v2-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Battlegrounds</a>.</p>

			<p>Aloft is developed by Astrolabe Interactive and will be published by Funcom. The game, set in a world of floating islands, will offer crafting and survival elements when it launches in a couple of months.</p>
<h2>Aloft, a co-op survival game, is set to launch in January 2025 in Early Access mode and currently offers a free demo on Steam</h2>
<p>Aloft, a co-op sandbox survival game developed by Astrolabe Interactive, will enter Early Access mode on January 15, 2025. The game will be published by Funcom and feature both single-player and online co-op modes.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Aloft-1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Aloft is an indie title that brings the elements such as building, crafting, and surviving together in a world of floating islands. By equipping the players with the ability to build an island into a skyship, the game takes a unique route toward the crafting and survival genre. With lots of side quests, which include stuff like finding lost knowledge, curing fungal corruption, and restoring the ecosystem, Aloft brings interesting gameplay and mechanics.</p>
<p>The game has been in development since 2021 by a dev team comprising 15+ members who have been active in various game projects. While all the content of Aloft will be available on 15th January, the Free Demo is currently available for the players. The demo was launched in 2022 and since then, the dev team has been working on the updates by taking user feedback into consideration.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games has revealed that it‚Äôs testing a new matchmaking system as a major quality-of-life improvement in Escape from Tarkov ‚Äì and EFT: Arena. This testing is taking place on the ETS server, which is an early-access test environment restricted to a specific user base.</p>



<p>It hasn‚Äôt been made clear when these changes will hit the wider audience, but they sound solid at first blush.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-much-needed-changes">Much Needed Changes</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov‚Äôs matchmaking system has long been a thorn in the side of gamers worldwide. For instance, around an Escape from Tarkov wipe, which is the bi-annual global reset event, queues to get into a match can be dragged out monumentally, often hitting ten, fifteen, or more minutes to raid.</p>



<p>Many users have dealt with random disconnects and glitches during the matchmaking process over the years. One issue that surfaced this year was a problem with ‚ÄòScav raids‚Äô, with players hitting never-ending loading screens during the matchmaking process.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1856691016960454986" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on social media</a>, Battlestate Games revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The main goal of the new system is to reduce the raid search time in Escape from Tarkov and matchmaking in EFT:Arena, as well as to reduce the number of errors and disconnects during matchmaking.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Beyond matchmaking, another concern for users is the amount of time it takes to load the map and loot pools and to connect with other players before finally entering a raid. This is one of the reasons why so many people moved to Escape from Tarkov‚Äôs PvE ecosystem, as loading into a PvE raid can take as little as 20 or 30 seconds all-in.</p>

<p>Since 2022, PlayStation fans have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of a Horizon multiplayer game ‚Äì and LEGO Horizon isn‚Äôt about to fill that gap anytime soon. It was claimed in September that Horizon‚Äôs multiplayer project is the next Guerrilla Games deliverable, <strong>not </strong>a ‚ÄòHorizon 3‚Äô.</p>



<p>Per a recent job listing, it looks as though the team will be preparing to release this live-service Horizon title in at least some form next year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-into-the-wild">Into the Wild</h2>



<p>It has been at least two years since the first reports of ‚ÄòHorizon Online‚Äô surfaced. Since then, almost nothing has been divulged by either Guerrilla Games or insiders close to the project. In March 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-multiplayer-game-has-not-been-canceled-by-playstation/">Jason Schreier suggested</a> that the game hadn‚Äôt been shelved amid a restructuring effort at PlayStation, and in September, he outright claimed that Guerrilla‚Äôs next game is this multiplayer title.</p>



<p>In January, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-multiplayer-leak/">leaks revealed</a> alpha footage from a multiplayer-based Horizon title, along with a little key concept art. This content revealed a unique direction for the game, which many claimed ‚Äòlooked like Fortnite‚Äô.</p>



<p>Eagle-eyed users recently <a href="https://x.com/Jorraptor/status/1856757437006827810" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dug up a job listing</a> for a ‚ÄòRelease QA Intern‚Äô at Guerrilla Games.</p>



<p>In this listing, it‚Äôs mentioned that the successful candidate will be working on an ‚Äòonline project‚Äô and that they‚Äôll need to be available in ‚Äòthe first half of 2025‚Äô. In the listing‚Äôs description, it‚Äôs stated that they‚Äôll help ‚Äòto ensure the game is prepared for launch‚Äô.</p>



<p>If we assume that the QA period takes a fair bit of time to complete, we could be looking at a release window ‚Äì or at least an early access window ‚Äì of H2 2025. We almost know that this is a live-service multiplayer title, and it‚Äôs not uncommon that they‚Äôre released in an ‚Äòunfinished‚Äô or beta state.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to a potential Horizon multiplayer game? Let us know in the comments.</p>
