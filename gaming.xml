<p>Supermassive announced Pankhurst's passing on Twitter. A <a href="https://tonypankhurst.muchloved.com/">tribute page</a> from Pankhurst‚Äôs family (spotted by <em><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-dark-pictures-anthology-curator-tony-pankhurst-has-died/1100-6525365/">GameSpot</a></em>) reveals that he died on May 9 and his funeral was held on June 7.

<p>Pankhurst‚Äôs career in the entertainment industry spans over 40 years across films, TV, and radio. In video games, he provided the likeness for the mysterious Curator in The Dark Pictures Anthology games Man of Madan, Little Hope, House of Ashes, and The Devil in Me, although actor Pip Torrens provided the voice and motion capture for the character. Pankhurst did portray a live-action version of The Curator in a trailer for 2021's House of Ashes, which you can watch below.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-london-devs-update-bugs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Last week, Fallout: London was finally released after a lengthy delay and years of development. It emerged as an ambitious and impressive game-sized mod that‚Äôs unfortunately plagued by bugs, crashes, and stability issues ‚Äì plus a complex installation process that can alienate users on some platforms. However, there‚Äôs a dizzying amount of meat on the bones and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm desperate to play in full.</p>



<p>That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm over the moon that Team FOLON has revealed the impending deployment of an update that‚Äôll target the worst issues in Fallout: London.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-wrong-with-fallout-london">What‚Äôs Wrong With Fallout: London?</h2>



<p>Fallout: London is pretty great, but some fundamental issues with the mod‚Äôs stability are making it a nightmare to play. I managed to battle my way through about 20 minutes before I hit a crash loop that never ended. Fortunately, Team FOLON has pledged that an update is coming to tackle these issues:</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/TeamFOLON/status/1817959101441446153">https://x.com/TeamFOLON/status/1817959101441446153</a></p>



<p>This is great news for anyone struggling to play one of the most ambitious mods in gaming history. Fallout: London has hundreds of quests and 20 original factions, and it features an authentic representation of post-apocalyptic London. I <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-london-review-first-impressions/">wrote up a review</a> featuring my first impressions if you‚Äôre interested.</p>



<p>If you‚Äôre having issues with <strong>your </strong>installation of Fallout: London, try following the advice detailed in this lengthy guide.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard Is a Great Start For Newcomers | Summer Game Fest 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Performance director Ashley Barlow added that--in addition to other projects BioWare was working on during the decade between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition/">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> and The Veilguard--part of the reason the game took so long to make was simply due to the sheer number of characters and voice lines.</p><p dir="ltr">"We started casting five years ago," Barlow said. "The team, the talent, has been on for five years. It takes a long time to record [dialogue for] 700 characters, you know--80,000 lines or 140,000 lines with all the Rooks. It just takes time to make [it] good."</p><p dir="ltr">The game features seven romanceable companion characters, and the player-character--who BioWare has nicknamed Rook--has four voices for players to choose from (two feminine voices and two masculine voices). That brings the total number of voice actors for main characters alone to 11. Add in Varric (who will accompany the player in certain parts of the game) and the game's main antagonist, Solas, and you're looking at 13 voice actors who absolutely <em>must</em> get their lines right.</p><p dir="ltr">Given the fact that the total number of characters is 700 (with all of them <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/">voiced by actual humans</a>), it's no surprise that the game took significant time to make, especially considering the varying dialogue branches that have become commonplace in most RPGs. They even got Alex Jordan, who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/actor-who-voiced-baldurs-gate-3s-kissing-noises-announces-charity-stream-with-hilarious-tiktok-video/1100-6521395/">provided all of the kissing noises</a> for Baldur's Gate 3, to pitch in for one of Rook's voices (it's unclear if he also provided smooching sounds for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-gonna-show-a-lot-of-skin/1100-6524909/">The Veilguard's spicier scenes</a>).</p><p dir="ltr">"I sit on a throne of moans," Jordan <a href="https://x.com/AlexJordanVO/status/1815478891693101081" rel="nofollow ">joked on Twitter</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">But all the time in the recording booth was worth it, according to Epler, who says the newest entry in the Dragon Age franchise is "the best version" of the game that it "could possibly be."</p><p>BioWare still hasn't announced an official release date, but the game is currently slated for release sometime in late 2024.

One such benefit is "recall rights," wherein companies are required to offer to bring back employees they laid off if they need to refill their role two or three years after they're dismissed from the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mitchell explained that she'd seen these terms in other tech industry contracts, and their inclusion is a boon for employees and employer alike. "We're talking about eliminating that 'revolving door' at least to some degree," she said, alluding to the fact that high turnover obliterates institutional knowledge.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In other words, the industry's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/humble-bumble-shuts-down-game-publishing-label">swaths of layoffs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> could potentially be alleviated by studios having a fast method to re-hire new talent after their finances are stabilized.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fellow Bethesda developer Chris Lusco highlighted other unionization gains, such as converting some freelancers to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-incorporates-contract-workers-into-zenimax-union-offers-some-full-time-roles">full-time</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/zenimax-union-secures-juneteenth-holiday-for-all-zenimax-staff">paid holidays</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and pay bumps for contractors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If developers are concerned their employer is about to reduce benefits or implement unpopular policies, racing to unionization can be a tool to slow them down. Per Mitchell, union recognition immediately guarantees the "status quo" condition. Under it, changes to current work policies have to be bargained for first, which is particularly helpful for things such as a return-to-office mandate.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When the QA-focused </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/qa-staff-at-zenimax-studios-unanimously-votes-to-unionize">ZeniMax Workers Union</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was recognized last year, some staff were working from home‚Äîand were able to keep doing so even after the company began rolling out return-to-office policies.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/capcom-games-sales-down-by-44-during-q1-fy25/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Capcom has released its financial report for the first quarter of the financial year, which ends on March 31, 2025. The report shows that sales have dropped considerably compared to last year's period.</p>
<p>Despite the significant drop in sales, the publisher says that "all business segments outperformed the company's plan." Net sales were down by 32.5% this year, with digital content net sales being down by 43.5% year-on-year.&nbsp; Their net income is down by 45.1% year-on-year, for a total of $64.7 million.</p>
<p>In terms of their <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-7-ios-launch-did-not-break-30000-sales-for-capcom/">digital content net sales</a> being down, the company responded by saying that its sales were "dominated" by titles released in previous years, such as Street Fighter 6 and Dragon's Dogma 2, with their new releases for 2024 due for release in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Capcom sold 9.53 million copies of its games during this time, compared to 13.5 million in the same quarter last year. However, Street Fighter 6 was released during this time, giving Capcom a massive boost to its sales.</p>
<p>Although game sales dipped significantly, they were compensated by Arcade Operations' upturn of 18% and Amusement Equipment's skyrocketing of 147%.</p>
<p>Despite being released in 2021, Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin continued to sell very well in this financial quarter. Capcom saw the game reach two million units sold in this quarter, and it commented that the Monster Hunter franchise has sold over 100 million copies globally.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Now, developed in conjunction with Niantic, has performed very well, with over 15 million downloads.</p>
<p>Capcom has said its "progress toward achieving the full-year plan was generally in line with plans," specifically regarding the sale of digital content.</p>
<p>Recently, Capcom saw the release of Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, a game that has a very similar feel to their game Okami. Overall, the game has received highly positive reviews from the audience.</p>
<p>Looking into the future, Capcom expects to reach $1.07 billion in net sales for the fiscal year ending 31 March 2025, which will give the company an 8.3% growth year-on-year.</p>
<p>Capcom has <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/product/en-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming releases</a> such as Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, which was previously a Japanese exclusive. The Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is slated for October 2024. Additionally, games such as Monster Hunter Wilds are set for release in 2025 and have the potential to be one of Capcom's biggest releases, especially given the number of units for the franchise that have already been sold over the years.</p>

The international sports tournament, which happens every four years, has made us all patriots once more (at least temporarily) as we root for Team U.S.A. to clean house. While you may catch some basketball and soccer at the Olympics, the best part of the event is tuning in to the more niche sports that people mostly only talk about when the Olympics are happening.<br></p><p>Gymnastics, archery, and breakdancing (making its Olympic debut this year) are all suddenly topics your average joe is likely to bring up in conversation. If you‚Äôve suddenly fallen in love with a new sport during the Games, then you will be happy to hear that there are plenty of video games to feed your new obsession. That goes for events big and small. Here are ten of our video game recommendations based on your Olympic sport of choice.</p></div></div><div><p>OK, real talk. You should be locked in to Olympic fencing. It is one of the most exciting sports you can watch, and the Paris games are filled with incredible matchups. If you happened to miss it, I recommend watching the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhhRb2kgFSs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhhRb2kgFSs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finals of Women‚Äôs Foil</a></span>, which saw defending Olympic champ Lee Keifer put on a masterclass in fencing. Once you realize how great the sport is, you might want to try a game that will give you the experience of being just as good at swordfighting as Keifer. For that you‚Äôll want to try out<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-womens-day-sale-signalis-unpacking-1851320438/slides/2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-womens-day-sale-signalis-unpacking-1851320438/slides/2"><em>En Garde!</em></a></span></p><p>The 2023 swashbuckling adventure game puts you in the shoes of a dashing swordswoman fighting off a horde of enemies through the streets of a gorgeous Mediterranean city. <em>En Garde! </em>lets you thrust, slash, and cut your way through your opponents in cartoonish but still strategic bouts of action. It might not be as serious as Olympic fencing, thanks to the ability to throw enemies off buildings or into traps, but it feels amazing to wield a sword regardless.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369"><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em></a></span> is for the horse girls‚Äîalways has been. As the best cowboy game ever made it‚Äôs no surprise that Rockstar‚Äôs stunning epic about the end of the wild west is also a phenomenal horse game. In it you can find different types of horses with different stats, build your relationship with said horses, and brush and dress them up to look their best. It‚Äôs what Equestrian events are all about, at least as far as I‚Äôve gathered from my Olympic viewing.</p><p>There is really no better game for the horse-obsessed, as you can roam the beautiful frontier on your steed of choice. Run through the wilderness and jump over obstacles or trot along city streets, the choice is yours. You can also name your horse, and to get the full experience I suggest following the American Quarter Horse Association‚Äôs <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.aqha.com/-/naming-your-aqha-foal&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.aqha.com/-/naming-your-aqha-foal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official naming rules</a></span> ‚Äî there are a lot of them. </p></div><div><p>If you like watching athletes beat the crap out of each other in the ring, then there really isn‚Äôt any other option than <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-punch-out-two-2-player-cheat-mode-snes-nintendo-1849387561&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-punch-out-two-2-player-cheat-mode-snes-nintendo-1849387561"><em>Super Punch-Out!!</em></a></span><em> </em>The boxing game lets you work your way through a series of progressively tougher matches in order to become the world champion. </p><p>In each match, you choose your strategy, adapting to your opponent‚Äôs technique as you decide what type of punch to throw and when to dodge and block. It‚Äôs a simple set of mechanics but one that feels endlessly enjoyable to master. Play your cards right during the game and you too can learn what it‚Äôs like to knock out your opponent and take home the title.</p></div><div><p>After making its Olympic debut at Tokyo in 2021, skateboarding is back for the Paris Games. If you happened to catch the Women‚Äôs Street finals over the weekend you may have seen skating legend Tony Hawk in attendance, and he‚Äôs who we have to thank for our game recommendation.</p><p>Both the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-the-kotaku-review-1844937925&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-the-kotaku-review-1844937925">first and second iconic <em>Pro Skater</em> games</a></span> got an amazing remake in 2021, and they remain probably the best skating games ever made. If you noticed how laid back the skating competition has been despite being an Olympic competition, you‚Äôll love the <em>Pro Skater </em>games. Vibe out with good music while you shred in a set of awesome venues. Pull off flips and twists or just speed along the course; whatever you do, you‚Äôll be sure to have a great time.</p></div><div><p>A few games may come to mind when you think about sailing. Perhaps it‚Äôs <em>Wind Waker</em> or <em>Sea of Thieves </em>you think of first, but I think <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-the-kotaku-review-1453735783&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-the-kotaku-review-1453735783"><em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed IV: Black Flag</em></a></span> is the best game for the sport. In addition to letting you command the crew of a large pirate ship on the open waters, you can sing sea shanties! </p><p>Now I don‚Äôt know if they do that at the Olympics (though I would like to dream) but in <em>Black Flag</em> the singing of your crew makes the sailing experience an absolute delight. For fun you can create your own racing challenges in the game‚Äîsee how fast you can sail across the game‚Äôs map or make little courses to maneuver through. The ocean is your oyster!</p></div><div><p>In addition to boxing, Judo and Taekwondo bring martial-arts flair to the Olympics and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-march-2024-games-sifu-destiny-2-ps5-ps4-1851294301&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-march-2024-games-sifu-destiny-2-ps5-ps4-1851294301"><em>Sifu</em></a></span> does them both justice. While <em>Sifu</em> doesn‚Äôt exactly use either as the basis for its complex martial arts combat, the ability to combine different kicks, punches, throws, and more makes for perhaps the best approximation of such fighting you can find in games. </p><p>To tailor the game to whichever Olympic martial art you prefer, you could limit your options. Maybe try to do an all-kicking run to get the Taekwondo feel. Whatever you choose, mastering the game will surely make you feel like a pro.</p></div><div><p>No, I didn‚Äôt pick <em>FIFA</em> for soccer, sue me. Maybe that would have been the most accurate representation of the sport, as it literally bears the name of soccer‚Äôs international governing body, but it‚Äôs not the most fun version. That‚Äôs all that matters to me personally, hence <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-strikers-battle-league-nintendo-switch-review-rou-1849035907&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-strikers-battle-league-nintendo-switch-review-rou-1849035907"><em>Mario Strikers</em></a></span>! So enjoy kicking the ball around as Nintendo‚Äôs iconic characters, with the added addition of special powers.</p></div><div><p>Both beach and indoor volleyball are big events at the Summer Olympics. To cover both of those, why not play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/windjammers-is-still-just-as-good-23-years-later-1802908500&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/windjammers-is-still-just-as-good-23-years-later-1802908500"><em>Windjammers</em></a></span>? The retro classic is available for Nintendo Switch and lets you face off against opponents in a volleyball-like sport. As opposed to the real sport, <em>Windjammers</em> includes throwing discs around and using special skills depending on your character, bringing some arcade fun to beach-set competitions and making for a great title to play in handheld mode while you watch the real deal on your TV. </p></div><div><p>Last year‚Äôs indie darling <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jusant-dont-nod-indie-zelda-botw-assassins-creed-1851093233&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jusant-dont-nod-indie-zelda-botw-assassins-creed-1851093233"><em>Jusant</em></a></span>, a game about climbing to the top of a massive peak, was all about minute control over movement. It requires you to press, hold, and release triggers to move the protagonist‚Äôs feet and hands along the sheer surface of a cliffside, making it perfect for fans of Sport Climbing. </p><p>The Olympic version of rock climbing is a spectacle to behold, as its competitors scale surfaces with impressive speed. <em>Jusant</em> isn‚Äôt necessarily about speed but it is about making smart placements to climb up the wall, and when you do reach the top of even the shortest obstacles you get a welcome sense of accomplishment. </p></div><div><p>There are a lot of different cycling events at the Olympics but<em> Rider‚Äôs Republic </em>is squarely for fans of mountain biking and BMX. The Ubisoft open-world sports game lets you ski, snowboard, and even wingsuit your way around the massive map, but the main event is biking. </p><p>With such a gorgeous world filled with varied environments to explore, there‚Äôs never a dull moment as you bike across <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/so-far-ubisofts-extreme-sports-game-riders-republic-1847586967&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/so-far-ubisofts-extreme-sports-game-riders-republic-1847586967"><em>Rider‚Äôs Republic</em></a></span>. On top of riding your way through the rough terrain, you can also pull off some sick tricks and get big air, all without any risk of breaking your bones.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Microsoft's vision for the future of Xbox goes beyond its own hardware--as the company looks to extend into streaming and mobile--but that doesn't mean Microsoft is abandoning Xbox hardware--far from it. The company has said, time and again, that it aims to offer a range of ways for people to become Xbox customers, and that includes via Xbox consoles.</p><p dir="ltr">But what's coming next after the Xbox Series X|S? The future is still fuzzy, but Microsoft has dropped clues and made statements about what's next. In this post, we're rounding up everything we know so far about the next Xbox console.</p><p dir="ltr">Keep checking back for more, as we will update this post with new details as they become available.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Next_Xbox_release_date__price_speculation"><strong>Next Xbox release date, price speculation</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The next Xbox has not yet been announced, so it's too soon to say what it could cost or when it may release. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-next-gen-plans-leaked-cloud-hybrid-console-planned-for-2028/1100-6517814/">major leak from the Microsoft vs. FTC court case</a> revealed some of Microsoft's plans for the next Xbox, including a heavy focus on "cloud hybrid" technology, machine learning, and AI. The leak also pointed to a potential 2028 start-date for this next console generation. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer responded to the leak and said at least some of the information was out of date.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've seen the conversation around old emails and documents. It is hard to see our team's work shared in this way because so much has changed and there's so much to be excited about right now, and in the future. We will share the real plans when we are ready," <a href="https://x.com/xboxp3/status/1704233222752571842?s=46" rel="nofollow ">he wrote.</a></p><p dir="ltr">When this next Xbox is announced, what could it be called? We don't know yet, but Microsoft had talked about how its console platform is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-its-just-called-xbox-actually-more-c/1100-6472320/" data-ref-id="1100-6472320">known as just "Xbox,"</a> and that things like Series X|S denote the specific models underneath that umbrella. Whether or not Microsoft sticks with this for its next console remains to be seen, however.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Next_Xbox_potential_specs"><strong>Next Xbox potential specs</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">In February this year, Xbox president Sarah Bond confirmed Microsoft was making new Xbox hardware and went on to make a bold statement about what it could deliver. Bond said this next Xbox, whatever it turns out to be, will offer the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-talks-next-gen-hardware-teases-new-console-controller-for-this-fall/1100-6521133/">"largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."</a> That's a bold claim, for sure. Bond didn't offer anything else, like how Microsoft might achieve this, nor did she provide any timetable for the console's release.</p><p dir="ltr">Also this year, Bond said the next Xbox will focus on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-talks-the-future-of-its-hardware-and-the-importance-of-backward-compatibility/1100-6523373/">"power and performance"</a> to create the "biggest leap ever," but again, Bond didn't go any further than those lofty claims.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Next_Xbox_backwards_compatibility"><strong>Next Xbox backwards compatibility</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Bond has also discussed how Xbox is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-talks-the-future-of-its-hardware-and-the-importance-of-backward-compatibility/1100-6523373/">ensuring backward compatibility will be a part of its next-gen hardware.</a></p><p dir="ltr">"It's also about the ability to be able to play all of the games. I mean, we have people who've been playing on Xbox for decades and invested thousands and thousands of dollars and hours with us. And [we want to enable them] to take all those games with them into the hardware of the future."</p><p dir="ltr">Bond went on to explain that when she became president of Xbox in 2023, one of the first things she did was create a team dedicated to backward compatibility. She then went on to say that the Xbox team is committed to the idea of being able to play their games wherever they are.</p><p dir="ltr">"So our long-term commitment to cross-play is part of that and our commitment to cross-progression and cloud saves. So you can pick up on one device and you can play on another is a part of that."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Next_Xbox_news"><strong>Next Xbox news</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Those same leaked documents revealed a trove of insights into what Microsoft may be cooking up for the future, but again, some or all of this information could be out of date. The documents showed that Microsoft was considering switching to an ARM64 CPU, like the Nintendo Switch uses. The leak also revealed that Microsoft is targeting DirectX ray tracing for its next-gen consoles, as well as machine-learning-powered graphical enhancement.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft seems to be putting a lot of focus on AI and machine learning for its next generation, touting its use for "optimization and acceleration of game performance, operations, and development for players and creators." Microsoft said AI and machine learning could help with things like matchmaking and player-discovery, while AI could also be used for game-testing and to optimize monetization strategies.</p><p dir="ltr">Also listed in the leak as a "key innovation" coming with the next generation of consoles from Xbox is an "immersive game and app platform" that will allow anyone to develop their own games--possibly similar to Roblox's development platform. This seems to play into what Xbox executive Sarah Bond said recently about the potential for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-sarah-bond-says-ai-will-be-great-for-game-development/1100-6517653/">AI to further enable players also becoming game developers</a> within the Xbox ecosystem.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft said in the leaked documents that its aim was to develop a "next-generation hybrid game platform" that taps into the "combined power" of local hardware and the cloud. The end result? Microsoft believes this could result in "deeper immersion and entirely new classes of game experiences."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Beyond_Xbox"><strong>Beyond Xbox</strong></h2><p>While Microsoft is working on new hardware, it's just one piece of the puzzle for Microsoft as it looks to the future and seeks out ways to find more Xbox customers. Recently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cloud-gaming-now-works-on-4k-fire-tv-sticks-which-are-up-to-50-off-at-amazon/1100-6524775/" data-ref-id="1100-6524775">Xbox cloud gaming came to Amazon's Fire Stick devices</a>, and Microsoft launched an ad campaign telling people they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiVHc3UBJFk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don't need to buy an Xbox</a>. Indeed, Microsoft has been saying for years that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-kinda-doesnt-care-if-you-buy-an-xbox-ser/1100-6481227/" data-ref-id="1100-6481227">kinda doesn't care if you buy an Xbox</a>. Thanks to cloud streaming, the phone in your pocket or the TV in your living room is an Xbox device.</p><p>Xbox CFO Tim Stuart said during the <a href="https://event.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1643204&amp;tp_key=6a9bad458f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wells Fargo TMT Summit</a> that the goal is to make first-party games and Game Pass available on "every screen that can play games," and this includes rival consoles.</p><p>"It's a bit of a change of strategy. Not announcing anything broadly here, but our mission is to bring our first-party experiences [and] our subscription services to every screen that can play games," Stuart said. "That means smart TVs, that means mobile devices, that means what we would have thought of as competitors in the past like PlayStation and Nintendo."</p><p>In addition to streaming, Microsoft has discussed plans to launch its own mobile game store. Recently, a <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/mobilestore" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">landing page on Xbox.com for the mobile store appeared</a>, telling people it is "coming soon." This mobile store for Xbox games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-talks-xbox-mobile-store-planned-for-2024/1100-6512489/" data-ref-id="1100-6512489">could launch in 2024</a>, and given that Microsoft owns juggernauts like Candy Crush and Call of Duty, this could end up being a big deal, though time will tell if that comes to fruition.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/throne-and-libertys-beta-is-fun-but-doesnt-do-enough-to-stand-out<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I‚Äôve done my time in major MMOs like Final Fantasy 14 and World of Warcraft, but outside of that I‚Äôve only dabbled in the various other  forms this subgenre can take. So when I say that Throne and Liberty isn‚Äôt quite rising to my past experiences with massively multiplayer dungeon-diving, loot-grinding, and boss-slaying, it‚Äôs an opinion coming largely from a ‚Äúnormie.‚Äù That said, both FF14 and WoW have big expansions launching the same year as this, NCSOFTs Guild Wars 2 follow up, and though its world is beautiful and its combat grows into a compelling and active ballet of skill interactions, the largely boring story and repetitive quest design I experienced in my 10 or so hours with the Open Beta makes me worried for Throne and Liberty‚Äôs chances at unseating the kings of the genre.</p><p>It is a great-looking game, though. The character creator lets you customize your avatar with some commendable levels of detail. And no matter what you put together, the end result will look fantastic, and shows no signs of the sort of player character uncanny valley that some games suffer from, where the overall quality of your PC is lower than the handcrafted NPCs from the developers. The world is pretty stunning, too. Once you see the huge flying whale for the first time, you‚Äôll go quite a few hours before you see something that majestic again, but the environments you‚Äôll travel through on your journey are rich in color and detail. I really loved the swampy forest overrun by spiders and the colorful plains with giant wild birds that are Definitely Not Chocobos. Even better, all of this runs remarkably smoothly. Becoming your own mount and morphing into a wild cat to sprint through cities or fast traveling from location to location loads lightning fast and in real time no matter how many people are on screen.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Throne and Liberty Early Images</h3></div></output><p>You‚Äôre going to do quite a lot of traveling from place to place, guided around by a completely unremarkable story about magically blessed youngsters growing into warriors of destiny, and the various factions in the world of Solisium that want to use them for their own gain. I didn‚Äôt get too far into it ‚Äì only around chapter 5, which is halfway through the available content at the time ‚Äì but none of it stood out as compelling. Thanks to a reliable narrator that recaps important parts of the story I did soon after doing them, I found myself skipping through much of the bland dialogue in non-cinematic exchanges. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The bulk of the quests both on the main path and side missions are pretty run-of-the-mill MMO fare. </p></div><p>The bulk of the quests both on the main path and side missions are pretty run-of-the-mill MMO fare. You‚Äôre gonna be collecting pieces of the local wildlife to make a potion, find missing people, do a stint as a mail carrier, etc. There‚Äôs a steady pace of new things to learn and do as you go along, but Throne and Liberty treating the main story as an elongated tutorial gave me a bit of anxiety about how to use all of the random stuff I was getting as rewards, to the point where I was very conservative with how I spent any loot because I didn‚Äôt what to spend it on upgrading something if I was only going to learn that I could have spent it on something else in the next couple of quest phases. Every region of the map has its own specific side tasks, which are worth completing for their rewards even if you aren‚Äôt usually the type to make sure all of their boxes get checked. These are more likely to feature more interesting missions or puzzles to solve than the main quest, but there‚Äôs plenty of ‚Äúkill X of Y‚Äù here, too. I didn‚Äôt get to see too many of these myself, but I chatted with a few folks in my travels who described some more complex platforming missions in instances that I definitely wanted to try out myself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>You‚Äôll do a great deal of fighting on your journey, of course, and its active combat is Throne and Liberty‚Äôs standout feature. Players aren‚Äôt restricted by classes. The pair of weapons they choose to wield determines what abilities are available to them. Similar to NCSOFT‚Äôs other big MMO, Guild Wars 2, fights require lots of positional awareness, and skills have lots of synergies with one another both within and across weapon types, and encourage lots of trial and error to figure out the best combinations for getting the most out of them. Every weapon has an auto attack pattern and can parry enemies' big attacks so long as you hit the button prompt just right, and each weapon has their own set of follow-up attacks that take great advantage of the opening you made. This mechanic seems ancillary against smaller foes, but against bosses and other strong enemies, defense is a must if you‚Äôre going to make it out of their clutches alive. Mastery of it was an absolute must in the Bloody Palace-style boss rush mode where you face off one-on-one with tough foes that have lots of power and small margins for error.</p><p>I used the greatsword and the staff, giving me lots of power and health in melee and also some escape tools and long-range magical options. I used them mostly to charge into close combat, blast all of my abilities, then use a magical freezing cloud to leap me away from enemies and blast them with fire and lighting bolts until they closed the distance. These abilities have more direct synergies, too. Greatsword players have access to a skill that can stun targets, and can follow it up with another skill that does bonus damage to stunned foes. The staff can put burning conditions on your opponents, and a second bigger fire spell will do more damage to enemies with burning stacks on them. Late in the beta I experimented with some cross weapon synergy with other weapon options like the wand, which focuses on debuffing and healing, with some promising results.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Most of the stuff I got up to like big world events where I had to race other players to collect the most macguffins from orcs, or smaller, more simple fetch quests, rewarded me mostly in money and gear upgrade materials. . It‚Äôs a double-edged sword, because though much of the source of your ever-growing power outside of your characters leveling up also comes through leveling up your gear, but a lot of that gear is bland and boring through much of your climb. I was around the mid-to-late 20s in level when I logged off for the last time from the beta, and I had only picked up two different swords ‚Äì neither particularly impressive in looks or stats. Armor was a bit more dynamic, but I had almost no connection to the loot I was grabbing at all outside of making the numbers go up. I can‚Äôt speak to how that shakes out towards the higher levels, where one would expect equipment to get more exotic, but trudging there means that the only things you're slaying are bad guys.</p><p>Overall, I certainly enjoyed most of my time with Throne and Liberty. There are big, late-game things that I want to come back and participate in, like large-scale PVP battles between guilds and raid dungeons. The story and quests won‚Äôt upend any long-standing MMO conventions. The inner voice that usually commands me to make sure every task that can be done must be done very quietly let me skip through slow dialogue and turn a blind eye to many menial side tasks. I never skipped an opportunity to fight, though. The parry system mixed with the joy of discovering sick skill combos across the various weapons available to you was by and large the most fun I could find in my time with it, and might be enough for me to come back to test my mettle against the cream of the crop when Throne and Liberty finally launches in September.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/29/24208741/super-nintendo-upgrade-voultar-edge-enhancer-mod<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo sold over 49 million Super Nintendo consoles, but not all of them were created equal. A later hardware revision improved the quality of the SNES‚Äôs video output, and over three decades later, one modder has come up with a way to bring those same improvements to nearly every Super Nintendo ever released.</p><p>Zach Henson, a console modder <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23630417/wii-u-system-error-160-0103-bricking-nand-memory">who also goes by the name Voultar</a>, has created a DIY modification kit for older Super Nintendo consoles called the Edge Enhancer. Expected to sell for around $60, the mod kit upgrades the console‚Äôs video output, making graphics appear much sharper and colors more saturated.</p><p>Although Nintendo made many revisions to the Super Nintendo‚Äôs hardware during the console‚Äôs production run, for retro gamers, there are essentially two versions of the SNES that matter. The original, which is now referred to as the SHVC or two-chip model, and an upgraded version that came later, known as the 1CHIP model based on how Nintendo labeled its motherboard.</p><p>The two-chip SNES featured a video digital to analog converter in its picture processing unit (PPU) that gamers have since discovered wasn‚Äôt able to quickly transition between different colors. This resulted in video output that tended to look soft or blurred because the graphics appeared to have a halo or shadow around them.</p><p>The problem wasn‚Äôt as noticeable in the ‚Äô90s when everyone played on CRT TVs, but with a Super Nintendo connected to a modern display, the differences are more prominent.</p><div><figcaption><em>A comparison between the quality of the video output on the two-chip Super Nintendo (left) and one-chip model (right).</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: Macho Nacho Productions</cite></p></div><p>For the later 1CHIP version of the Super Nintendo, the company merged the original‚Äôs two video chips and CPU into a single chip. It was a cost-cutting move to make it cheaper to manufacture the console, but the new components also resulted in video output that was much sharper with noticeably improved colors.</p><p>For retro gamers who prefer to play on original hardware, the 1CHIP Super Nintendo consoles are now very much sought after and can sell for well over $200. But demand could soon be waning, thanks to this new upgrade kit.</p><p>Installing Voultar‚Äôs Edge Enhancer mod isn‚Äôt for beginners, as Tito Perez from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%40MachoNachoProductions">YouTube‚Äôs Macho Nacho Productions</a> recently demonstrated in a video. Not only does the SNES have to be completely dismantled, but there‚Äôs quite a bit of soldering required, and you have to remove the original transistors, capacitors, and resistors from the console‚Äôs motherboard.</p><div><figcaption><em>Onscreen text looks incredibly crisp on a two-chip Super Nintendo with Voultar‚Äôs Edge Enhancer installed.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: Macho Nacho Productions</cite></p></div><p>A lot could go wrong when installing the various components needed for the mod. So while <a href="https://voultar.com/">Voultar</a> plans to eventually sell a DIY Edge Enhancer kit once the documentation and tutorials are finalized, it will initially only be available as part of a more expensive installation service that will ensure the upgrades are done correctly.</p><p>Pricing hasn‚Äôt been revealed just yet, but given that 1CHIP Super Nintendo consoles are becoming increasingly rare, the Edge Enhancer mod could still be much cheaper, even with the cost of shipping a Super Nintendo‚Äôs motherboard off to be upgraded.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, Plaion (formerly <a href="https://wccftech.com/koch-media-changes-name-to-plaion-decision-made-independently-from-embracer-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">known</a> as Koch Media) and Skydance announced a global publishing deal for the single player action/adventure game Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra.</p>
<p>Klemens Kundratitz, CEO of PLAION, stated:</p>
<p><em>We are proud to partner with Skydance Games and industry legend Amy Hennig on what is one of the most anticipated AAA games currently in development. This partnership between two ambitious independent companies is a testament to PLAION‚Äôs ongoing mission to become a global force in videogame publishing.</em></p>
<p>Julian Break, Co-President at Skydance Games, said:</p>
<p><em>We believe PLAION is the perfect publishing partner for the multiplatform, worldwide release of MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra. For our studio‚Äôs debut title, we‚Äôre crafting an original Marvel story directed by Amy Hennig. We‚Äôre thrilled to have found a global publisher that shares our ambitious vision for the project.</em></p>
<p>Haluk Mentes, Head of Marvel Games, added:</p>
<p><em>MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra is an exquisite and bold take on some of our most beloved and timeless characters. The world-class development talent of Skydance Games and global publishing capabilities of PLAION are an excellent team-up to ensure we deliver on the massive promise this game has. We‚Äôre excited to collaborate and bring MARVEL 1943 to players around the world.</em></p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/1943-rise-of-hydra-amy-hennig-2025-unreal-engine-5-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled </a>in March, at GDC 2024, with a stunning trailer that showed its impressive Unreal Engine 5-powered visuals. Players will control an ensemble of four characters: Steve Rogers (Captain America), Azzuri (Black Panther), Gabriel Jones (a member of the Howling Commandos), and Nanali (a leader of the Wakandan spies).</p>
<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is slated to launch at some point next year. Platforms haven't been announced, but PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X are a safe bet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-xbox-360-marketplace-is-officially-closed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The Xbox 360 Marketplace is <a href="https://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">officially closed</a>. It‚Äôs shut down. It‚Äôs gone for good.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs a day we <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/say-goodbye-to-the-xbox-360-store-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">knew was coming for a while</a>, but now that it‚Äôs finally here, it doesn‚Äôt feel real. Gone is nearly 20 years of gaming history for players. Gone is the first online console store that many used as Xbox 360 quickly became <em>the </em>console to have in the mid-2000s. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Almost 19 years on, all good things must come to an end. We are in the final 24 hours (or so) of the Xbox  360 Marketplace. </p><p>It was my pleasure sharing all the thousands of marketplace sales and updates I‚Äôve given over the years. </p><p>Thank for having fun, playing fair and filing‚Ä¶</p></div>‚Äî Larry Hryb, Gamer Emeritus üì±‚å®Ô∏èüñ±Ô∏èüéÆ (@majornelson) <a href="https://twitter.com/majornelson/status/1817696501558317267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 28, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>But just because the marketplace is gone, that doesn‚Äôt mean playing on the 360 is gone with it.</p>



<p>You‚Äôll no longer be able to buy games, DLC, or other content for the system any more via the store nor will the Microsoft Movies &amp; TV app&nbsp;no longer works. However, if you happen to own and play games on the console, you can still play them as you‚Äôd like. Online services such as multiplayer will also continue to function. You‚Äôll also be able to download any content previously purchased and installed on your system.</p>



<p>So at least that all still exists. But for how long?</p>



<p>The Xbox 360 launched in November 2005. Almost 20 years for a console that many refuse to admit is retro at this point. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before servers for the system are taken offline. Whether it‚Äôs a year or five years from now, that day is coming.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs pretty sad to think about.</p>

But we do know that Plaion, which counts Deep Silver as one of its brands, will publish it.</p><p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra hit the headlines earlier this year after an eye-catching trailer revealed as part of Epic Games‚Äô State of Unreal event at GDC. It‚Äôs in development at the Skydance Games team, which is led by Hennig (Uncharted) and co-president Julian Beak.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Plaion boss Klemens Kundratitz commented: ‚ÄúWe are proud to partner with Skydance Games and industry legend Amy Hennig on what is one of the most anticipated AAA games currently in development. This partnership between two ambitious independent companies is a testament to Plaion‚Äôs ongoing mission to become a global force in video game publishing.‚Äù</p><p>Beak said Skydance believes Plaion to be ‚Äúthe perfect publishing partner‚Äù for the game. ‚ÄúFor our studio‚Äôs debut title, we‚Äôre crafting an original Marvel story directed by Amy Hennig,‚Äù Beak said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thrilled to have found a global publisher that shares our ambitious vision for the project.‚Äù</p><p>Hennig‚Äôs Skydance team is also working on an <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-amy-hennig-skydance-new-media-project">untitled Star Wars game</a>, which has yet to be fully revealed.</p><p>Embracer has endured a torrid time of it recently, with thousands of staff laid off, multiple studios closed or sold off, and various video game flops, such as Starbreeze‚Äôs co-op shooter Payday 3. In June, Embracer shut down <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/alone-in-the-dark"><u>Alone in the Dark</u></a> developer Pieces Interactive after the game failed to meet expectations. It <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-buys-gearbox-from-embracer-confirms-development-on-new-borderlands-game"><u>sold the likes of Borderlands developer Gearbox Software</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saber-interactive-splits-from-embracer-taking-38-video-game-projects-with-it"><u>Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic remake studio Saber Interactive</u></a> ahead of announcing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embracer-splitting-into-three-companies-middle-earth-enterprises-friends-coffee-stain-friends-and-asmodee-group"><u>a split into three separate companies</u></a>. Specifically on Plaion, it reportedly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embracer-studio-was-working-on-a-brand-new-red-faction-game-before-layoffs">rejected a Red Faction sequel pitch</a> from the Embracer-owned developer of Galaxy On Fire and Chorus before it was hit by layoffs.</p><p>However, Plaion, via sub-brand Deep Silver, has published some successful video games in recent years, such as Dead Island 2. It is also set to publish <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> later in 2024.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>By now you've probably heard that Robert Downey Jr. is returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, not as Iron Man, but as masked <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/robert-downey-jr-returns-to-the-mcu-in-avengers/1100-6525361/" data-ref-id="1100-6525361">villain Doctor Doom</a>. This is not the first time he's been tapped for the role, as he was considered to play the menacing physician before Iron Man even entered pre-production.</p><p>This information was first revealed a little over a year ago, when Marvel Studios released promotional material celebrating the first Iron Man movie's 15th anniversary. In a conversation between director Jon Favreau and producer Kevin Feige, Favreau recalled, "You had all met with him already for like Doctor Doom or something, on another project... so everybody sort of knew who he was." Feige apparently confirmed with a simple "right." Model and actor Julian McMahon played Doctor Doom in the original two Fantastic Four films, both released before Iron Man.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bx4O7Ub1GY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="278">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-bx4O7Ub1GY?start=278" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Robert Downey Jr. won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, as well as a Golden Globe and a BAFTA, for his portrayal of Lewis Strauss in Oppenheimer. At San Diego Comic Con, Marvel announced the titles of the next <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/san-diego-comic-con-2024-biggest-news-announcements-trailers/2900-5626/" data-ref-id="2900-5626">two Avengers movies</a>: Doomsday and Secret Wars. The Russo brothers, who directed two Captain America films, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame, are also returning to direct the next two Avengers films.</p>

		<p>Last month, Nightdive Studios confirmed it was working on The Thing: Remastered, a remake of the 2002 game that was based on the 1982 classic sci-fi horror film. While details are scant on the release date for The Thing: Remastered, Nightdive Studios has released a new developer diary which focuses on the game‚Äôs artwork and design, showing some of the differences from the 2002 game.</p>
<p><iframe title="How Is The Art Progressing on The Thing: Remastered? Full Deep Dive Interview with Joel Welsh" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kzvs7EXgCxw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Thing: Remastered deep dive on the artwork is conducted by Locke Vincent and he is joined by Joel Welsh, the studio‚Äôs art lead, who explains some of the decisions being made. For example, in the screenshots of the The Thing: Remastered we are shown that there is more detail, like tiles on the floor and additional signage compared to the original game. Joel also confirms that some of the development team of the original had been able to supply information for Nightdive Studios to use and work with, allowing for a smoother development process for this remaster. A lot of the assets remain the same, but in a higher resolution. Each change is being done on a case by case basis, with care being made that any changes fit with the scenes of the game and the film.</p>
<p>It has to be said that all of the work shown by Nightdive Studios is still a work in progress, and that there will be further changes to the visual design of the remaster. As said, we do not yet know when The Thing: Remastered will be released though we do know it is expected for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

It was all right there in the name, and for as many faults as the game might‚Äôve had, it was at least always honest. However, that may not be the case anymore, because according to the game‚Äôs latest plot developments, we may not have actually killed the Justice League. Now how‚Äôd Task Force X fuck that up?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196394" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="97" data-playlist="196394,195719,196191" data-current="196394"><div><p>The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21942.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="9b140b5128943deef31107021017c7a3" data-recommend-id="image://9b140b5128943deef31107021017c7a3" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spoiler warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A spoiler warning." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Graphic<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9b140b5128943deef31107021017c7a3" data-recommend-id="image://9b140b5128943deef31107021017c7a3" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spoiler warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Suicide Squad</em>‚Äôs second season has apparently revealed that the previously thought dead superheroes are maybe very alive. At least, one of them is. In a cutscene following the conclusion of the second season‚Äôs story, and yet <em>another </em>Brainiac boss fight, The Flash miraculously manages to escape the villain‚Äôs clutches and is in fact <em>saved </em>by the Suicide Squad.</p><p>The Flash had one of <em>Suicide Squad</em>‚Äôs more dramatic arcs, so it‚Äôs only fitting that he be brought back to kick off this latest wave of its story. At the outset of the game, he‚Äôs actually one of the few members of the Justice League that hasn‚Äôt been corrupted by Brainiac, and he even helps the team get out of a mind-controlled Green Lantern‚Äôs clutches. Eventually, he‚Äôs captured by a brainwashed Batman who then converts The Flash into another one of Brainac‚Äôs minions.<br></p><p>Considering he was one of the holdouts, and was only captured due to his heroics, players felt especially bad about having to kill The Flash, whose underwhelming death is further ruined by the scene‚Äôs tacit confirmation that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ERiJETeUJg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ERiJETeUJg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Captain Boomerang is packing a huge dick</a></span>. This fucking game, man‚Ä¶but at least folks don‚Äôt have to feel too bad about it anymore, since it turns out The Flash that died was a clone!<br></p><p>This latest twist seems to confirm the fan theory that the versions of the Justice League in the game were clones. If The Flash is any indication, the other Justice League members‚Äîsave for Wonder Woman, who never gets mind-controlled/cloned and is actually offed in a fight against Superman‚Äîseem like they‚Äôre being held captive by some of the multiverse‚Äôs Brainiacs. Considering the post-game DLC has been following the Squad‚Äôs attempts to kill the rest of the 13 Brainiacs that are working in tandem to control the multiverse (this game is <em>a lot</em>), you can bet that we‚Äôre probably going to run into the rest of the Justice League and actually <em>save </em>them this time around.<br></p><p>That means that at least Superman, Green Lantern, and Batman are due for returns in the near-future. That last comeback could be particularly noteworthy, due to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kevin-conroy-batman-arkham-animated-series-voice-dies-1849772983&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kevin-conroy-batman-arkham-animated-series-voice-dies-1849772983">passing of Batman‚Äôs most famous actor, Kevin Conroy</a></span>, who voiced the character since <em>Batman: The Animated Series </em>premiered in 1992. After his death, fans of Conroy and Batman got uncomfortably weird, combative, and possessive over his performance in <em>Suicide Squad</em>, which they quite rudely deemed unworthy of being Conroy‚Äôs last turn as the Caped Crusader. They were especially upset at the very unceremonious and abrupt way in which Harley Quinn executes him.<br></p><p>Though <em>Suicide Squad </em>is Conroy‚Äôs final video game performance as Batman, his actual final words are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kevin-conroy-batman-last-performance-justice-league-1851595361&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kevin-conroy-batman-last-performance-justice-league-1851595361">apparently much better and are in an animated movie</a></span> which released earlier this month. Now, fans are wondering if Conroy didn‚Äôt record more dialogue that they might hear in a DLC if Batman is also revealed to have survived the events of the game.<br></p><p>The game‚Äôs remaining players seem on-board for this twist in the narrative, though some have expressed they might‚Äôve preferred it being delivered upfront rather than post-launch. After a muted reception to the first season, which introduced an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-joker-season-grind-battle-pass-unlock-1851374999&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-joker-season-grind-battle-pass-unlock-1851374999">alternate universe Joker</a></span> as a playable character, the second season‚Äôs done little to win players back outside of this potential plot twist.<br></p><p>Will this twist be enough to save <em>Suicide Squad</em>, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league-warner-bros-flop-1851281580&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league-warner-bros-flop-1851281580">disappointed its publisher</a></span> earlier this year? Absolutely not, but it‚Äôs an interesting (and very comic-book-inspired) wrinkle that should freshen things up while Rocksteady <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-season-2-release-date-roadmap-freeze-1851529893&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-season-2-release-date-roadmap-freeze-1851529893">closes out this story</a></span>. Hell, this move got me to reinstall the game and dedicate part of my weekend to it, so it‚Äôs doing something right. Sure did take it long enough.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
