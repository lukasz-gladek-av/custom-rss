			<p><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/life-is-strange-double-exposure-drawn-out-murder-mystery/">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a></strong> developer <strong>Deck Nine Games</strong> will reveal the next <strong>Life is Strange</strong> game next week on <strong>January 20, 2026,</strong> in a live stream that will kick off at <strong>10am PST / 1pm EST / 6pm GMT / 7pm CET.</strong></p>



<p>The news was revealed in a short teaser video posted to the official Life is Strange X (formerly Twitter) account, which seems to tease the return of series protagonists <strong>Max Caulfield </strong>and <strong>Chloe Price</strong>, who walk across the frame in the teaser.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>2024's Double Exposure was the last game in the series, and one that carries its fair share of controversy with it among fans of the series. Not because it was an overall poor game - Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/life-is-strange-double-exposure-drawn-out-murder-mystery/">gave it a 7.7/10 when we reviewed it when it launched</a> - but because of the ways in which it impacts the storyline of the series, and how it makes players retcon the ending of the previous game right at the beginning.</p>



<p>This next game could be a major turning point for the series and a major point for Deck Nine Games, which experienced <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-devs-deck-nine-lay-off-more-staff/">two rounds of layoffs in 2024, the second coming after the release of Double Exposure</a>. </p>

<p>Hopefully, this new title will be a solution to Deck Nine's woes. We'll see how next week's reveal goes over with fans.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has famously endured struggles when it comes to running well on PC since release. Capcom have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patches-will-keep-coming-if-almost-as-slowly-as-the-game-still-runs">tried relentlessly</a> to improve that situation, with varying results. Cue today, and a Reddit scientist coming to the conclusion that overtly aggressive DLC checks might be a key factor in the game's woes. Another modder has subsequently put out a work to combat the issue with the checks, but they reckon fixing this problem isn't necessarily a cure-all.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/mh_wilds_bad_performance_mystery_solved/">original thread</a> looking into these DLC checks was penned by Reddit user de_Tylmarande. Having played around with versions of the game on two Steam accounts - one with all of the Wilds' DLC bought and one running the DLC-less base version - they observed that the former seemed to benefit from better FPS numbers. Reaching the hypothesis that the discrepancies in frame rate they report experiencing in the two versions might be down to the DLC-less version of the game being throttled by regular behind-the-scenes checks as to which DLC was active, they did some testing.</p>
<p>"I quickly made a small 'mod' that made the game think I have all DLC present...And yes - performance went through the roof. Yes, without any CPU boost, in Balance mode. On any settings. The game literally flies," they wrote, emphasising that the mod was simply one that convinced the game they had all of the DLC installed, rather than actually giving them it. So, they said they've reached out to Capcom's support with their findings, suggesting "it's just a bug in the code they need to fix" rather than any maliciou bit of design.</p>
<p>Cool. Naturally, this being modders, one of their brethren has already looked into the situation and put out a work which <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/3798">limits Wilds' DLC checks</a> on Nexus Mods (as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dominictarason.com/post/3mchsumduun24">spotted</a> by friend of the Treehouse <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/authors/dominic-tarason">Dominic Tarason</a>). According to this second modder, Vaeux, the DLC checks do seem to have some impact on performance, but only in certain areas of the game:</p>
<blockquote><p>As discovered by de_Tylmarande, who documented it in a Reddit thread, depending on which DLCs you own, Monster Hunter Wilds may perform dozens of checks for DLC ownership every frame. This can easily add up to thousands of (relatively) computationally-expensive checks every second, significantly reducing your framerate if it's bottlenecked by your CPU.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like this only happens when you're close enough to a Support Desk Felyne (the ones that handle bounties and have a DLC menu) to see an exclamation point on its map/world icon, which pops up if you purchase DLC, so you know to go and redeem your new DLC. So, it only matters while you're standing in/near a Base Camp. Not quite as game-changing as some were hoping, but better than nothing.</p></blockquote>
<p>We'll see whether Capcom, having seen all of this experimentation, end up being able to nail down any extra fixes/improvements to Wilds beyond what they've already done or <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/2011732622435557475">have planned</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Everything To Know Before Jumping Into Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ 3.0 Update]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-tips-guide-2000660180</link>
            <guid>1407190</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span>‘ 3.0 update is live, and lapsed players are rushing back to their near-abandoned islands. The update is technically two parts—the free part, which everyone will get, and the paid part, which is only for Nintendo Switch 2 players. Most of the content is tied to the free update, like Kapp’n’s seaside hotel which has been constructed on island piers. For existing owners, the Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade is $4.99; Nintendo says it’s got an “enhanced resolution,” as well as mouse control support and larger multiplayer sessions.</span></p> <p><span>Though Kapp’n’s hotel is the big, main content piece of the big 3.0 patch, there’s a lot of little details to love in both the free and paid updates.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000658997" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658997"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658997">Image: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <h2><span>You can decorate two rooms per day at Kapp’n’s hotel</span></h2> <p><span>Isabelle will announce that the hotel is open, so head right down to the pier to check it out. Kapp’n and Tom Nook will be inside to give you the rundown on what’s going on. Basically, the hotel is already entirely built, but they’re looking for someone to help Kapp’n’s wife, Leilani, decorate the rooms. You’ll be prompted to decorate a room, and Leilani will walk you through it. She wants it to be themed, but you don’t </span><i><span>have</span></i><span> to follow that. You’ll get 200 tickets for doing so! You’ll continue to get prompted for a couple days to decorate rooms and help out with unlocking other features around the hotel.</span></p>

 <p><span>But, at max, you’re only able to decorate two rooms per day. Once you decorate a room, tourists will start showing up. You can keep helping with the hotel, though, by taking on tasks at a DIY requests stand on the pier, which will be unlocked as you proceed.</span></p>

 <h2><span>Tourists will roam your island</span></h2> <p><span>The animals that show up to rent the rooms on your island can be found wandering around, exploring the sights. They’ll interact with your residents, but can’t be asked to move onto your island, like with the campsite.</span></p> <h2><span>You can decorate your pier</span></h2> <p><span>All of the wooden parts of the hotel pier can be decorated as you please. It’s not a ton of room, but it’s enough to bring in some extra flair. It works exactly the same way as decorating anywhere else, but you’ve got to work around some of the permanent fixtures.</span></p>

 <p><span>The hotel’s facade can’t be customized, but it is decorated seasonally, it seems—there’s snow on the roof in winter, and an adorable little snowman outside.</span></p> <h2><span>Save up your bells for Resetti’s pricey service</span></h2> <p><span>Resetti will be wandering around your island when you update to 3.0. He’s able to quickly reset portions of your island, but it’ll cost you 60,000 bells per day. The good news is that it’s </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> 60,000 bells per portion of land—it’s a daily rate, so you can keep calling Resetti back for an entire 24 hours at no extra cost.</span></p>

 <p><span>Of course, the first use of the service is free, so you’ll have time to save up if you want to give it a try but can’t afford his hefty fee. Here’s how it works: You first go tell Isabelle you want to use the service, and Resetti will be wandering your island. He’ll give you three options: to reset either the whole island, your beaches, or specific areas. If you choose the third option, you can go and choose the area and summon him.</span></p>

 <h2><span>New movement actions make decorating and terraforming more precise</span></h2> <p><span>This is a super small detail, but makes a huge difference. There are new movement options in </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span>. It’s easy: You just need to tap and hold the L button to move precisely in different directions. Basically, it’s movement on a grid—up, down, left, and right. When you press the L button and don’t hold it down, you can do a little, cute jump.</span></p>

 <p><span>This is particularly exciting for me, because it drives me crazy to be trying to dig up something and accidentally dig the wrong area. By being able to make precise movements, I can more easily position myself in the correct spot. It’ll help with placing items in the world, too, I think.</span></p> <h2><span>Craft without having resources in your pockets</span></h2> <p><span>Empty the sticks and rocks out of your pockets, because crafting now pulls from your home inventory! If you </span><i><span>do</span></i><span> have materials in your pockets, crafting will use those first, then move to home storage. You can do this from any crafting bench on your island, but it won’t work if you’re crafting on someone else’s island.</span></p> <h2><span>Bulk crafting limited to 10 items</span></h2> <p><span>Crafting that pulls from home storage is particularly helpful now that bulk crafting is a thing. However, bulk crafting is limited to making 10 of a certain item at once—no more than that. Ten is still a lot, and will certainly make life easier for people who are furiously crafting.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/what-even-is-a-video-game-backlog-in-2026-2000659435</link>
            <guid>1407187</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/that-s-a-wrap-on-backlog-month-1846849615">We’ve written a lot about backlogs on this site.</a> Those long lists of games we want to play or finally get around to finishing. I have a backlog. It’s very big. It’s scary to think about. And I also recently realized, after returning to <em>Diablo 4</em>, that in 2026, a backlog is becoming an outdated concept as forever games take over the industry and live-service titles get killed, making it harder and harder to actually finish a game, cross it off your list, and walk away.</p> <p>For decades, competitive multiplayer games have existed, and the concept of a game that can’t be “finished” has been around for about as long as games themselves. But when I talk about the games that undermine the very concept of a backlog, I’m not talking about online-only PVP titles like<em> Arc Raiders</em> or <em>Team Fortress 2</em>. I’m instead talking about the growing list of live-service games, many of which can be played solo, that have campaigns with “endings” but also keep growing, that are all fighting for your attention and receiving an endless wave of updates and expansions.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-open-beta-review-rpg-rogue-build-barbarian-1850244422">I finished <em>Diablo 4</em> in 2023</a> and really enjoyed it. With that completion, it was crossed off my backlog. But since then, it has received numerous seasonal updates, adding new content and narrative elements. It has also received an expansion and <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4s-second-expansion-adds-new-classes-and-big-changes-2000652722">is getting another one later this year</a>. I booted the game up last week to check it out again and realized that, well, shit,<em> Diablo 4</em> is <em>back</em> on my backlog. I completed <em>The </em><em>Division</em> <em>2</em>‘s main campaign once upon a time, but since then, it’s expanded into a bigger game with more missions to finish and more story to experience. That one is probably never leaving my backlog, despite me having over 300 hours in it at this point.</p>

 <p>Then there are those live-service games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964">like BioWare’s <em>Anthem</em></a>, which I had on my backlog for years, always telling myself I’d get to them and finish up the main story one day. Well, in&nbsp;<em>Anthem</em>‘s case, I waited too long, and now the game is dead, the servers permanently shut down. And while I could just scrub it from my mental backlog of games, I know it will linger around like a ghost. A memory of what I could have done. There are a lot of live-service ghosts hanging out in my mental backlog these days. It’s getting crowded.</p>

 <p>A part of me wonders if the entire concept of backlogs is pointless now. Even single-player games that aren’t technically live-service titles, like Ubisoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-impressions-review-ubisoft-1851077773"><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em></a>, are often updated with <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-pandora-cheap-third-person-new-game-1851786644">new features and content</a>. It might just be time to try to build a new backlog in my head and reserve it only for offline single-player experiences that I’m confident won’t be expanded upon or killed in the future.</p>

 <p>At the very least, if I do rebuild my backlog, I’ll have a more manageable one. I mean, it will still be <em>extremely</em> long and nearly impossible to complete. But at least this new list–which will be devoid of live-service titles and “forever games” that, ironically, can go away forever with little warning–won’t be literally impossible to finish. And that’s nice. I guess.</p>

<p>Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<p>A new developer diary video from Marathon provides players with a deep dive into the game’s Runner Shells. </p>



<p>With Bungie’s next first-person extraction shooter, Marathon, releasing in March 2026, the developers have been slowly sharing more details about the game. Last month, players were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-devs-reveal-pricing-battle-pass-details-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">informed</a> about pricing details, battle passes, new features, weapons, improvements, and more. Now, the developers are going straight into Runner Shells, the biosynthetic bodies you will be playing as. </p>







<h2 id="h-each-marathon-runner-shell-has-its-own-archetype">Each Marathon Runner Shell Has Its Own Archetype</h2>



<p>In the universe of Marathon, players are transferred into biosynthetic shells known as Runner Shells to navigate the Tau Ceti system. Each Runner Shell has its own archetype, which may include roles such as intel gathering, combat disruption, or combat healing. Additionally, these shells are designed with distinctive silhouettes, allowing players to identify them from a distance and strategize accordingly.</p>



<p>Players can experiment with different playstyles using the game’s cores, implants, weapons, and mods. Additionally, players can look forward to visual customizations that will be revealed at a later date.</p>



<h2 id="h-runner-shell-cores-and-impants">Runner Shell Cores and Impants</h2>



<p>Players can use Cores and Implants to customize their Runner Shell’s playstyles in Marathon. Cores are designed for one Runner Shell, mostly, where they can “buff or modify” the shell’s ability. Implants, on the other hand, can be used by any Runner Shell, and they grant additional stats and a random perk. Higher-tier implants also feature a bonus fixed perk. </p>



<p>For example, if players are going for a mobility build, with cores they can turn the Vandal’s double jump into a triple jump, and with implants they can increase its base movement speed, jump height, and heat capacity. Cores, implants, weapons, and mods can be combined with Runner Shells in Marathon to create unique play styles that best suit the player. Players can check out the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFzR8bN13FA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dev diary</a> to learn more about these systems. </p>

<h2 id="h-marathon-runner-shells-archetypes-and-abilities">Marathon Runner Shells Archetypes and Abilities </h2>



<p>Bungie has provided details on the base archetype and abilities of Runner Shells in Marathon. You can check them out below: </p>



<p><strong>Destroyer</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Combat specialist</li>



<li>Armed with a personal defense barricade, missile systems, and movement thrusters, Destroyer shells are designed to bring the fight to enemy threats.</li>
</ul>



<p>Assassin</p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Shadow agent</li>



<li>Synthetic smoke deployment and camouflage technology allow Assassin shells to plan unseen strikes or take cover during hostile engagements.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Recon</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Intel specialist</li>



<li>Recon shells excel at identifying threats and tracking movements using echo pulses, tracker drones, and holographic footstep trails.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Vandal</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Combat anarchist</li>



<li>Vandal shells traverse ground at incredible speeds, using their advanced movement and knockback cannon to disrupt combat.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Thief</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Covert acquisitions</li>



<li>With enhanced visors and piloted butterfly drone, Thief shells can locate and acquire loot, then use their grapple to push an advantage or make an escape.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Triage</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Field medic</li>



<li>Triage shells help keep themselves and allies alive using deployable healing drones, onboard reboot abilities, and combat buffs.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Rook</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Scavenger</li>



<li>The Rook frame is designed for scavenger mode, a unique way to play Marathon. As Rook, you’ll drop into a match that’s already in progress as a solo player. You won’t be able to bring a loadout, but you also aren’t risking anything, which makes Rook an excellent option for scavengers.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It's a big week for Amazon Prime's slate of video game adaptations. First, we got <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/2025/12/24/the-fallout-tv-shows-second-season-is-slower-but-still-good" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="41adec97-ae90-4508-b394-7a3719ca6cdb" data-entity-substitution="canonical">a new episode of the<em> Fallout</em> series</a>.

And now there's news on the Tomb Raider front – we got our first look at Sophie Turner's portrayal of Lara Croft. See it for yourself below.</p>

      <p>Sophie Turner as Lara Croft. The image was originally uploaded to Amazon Prime Video's social media with the caption "Get your artifacts out. Lara's on her way… #TombRaider #WardrobeTest"</p>
  
</article>

<p>It's a relatively classic take on the character, as opposed to the recent reboots (known as the survivor trilogy). Turner wears shorts, pistol holsters on each hip, a teal tank top, and even Lara Croft's sunglasses (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9yxzDDvAm8&amp;pp=ygUdZ2FtZSBpbmZvcm1lciB0b21iIHJhaWRlciBuZ3Q%3D">which appear on the cover of Tomb Raider III</a>), complete with red, circular lenses. As is often the case with live-action adaptations, Turner's initial casting as the character was met with skepticism from some, but now that she's in the wardrobe, you can't deny she looks the part. We'll just have to wait and see if her performance holds up as well.</p><p>The Tomb Raider series is created by Phoebe Waller-Bridge (known for <em>Fleabag </em>and <em>Solo</em>), who serves as both showrunner and writer. The show's cast also includes Martin Bobb-Semple, Sigourney Weaver, and Jason Issacs (<a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2023/2023/06/08/baldurs-gate-3-gets-lucius-malfoy-actor-as-a-bad-guy" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f702c8e0-a49a-4402-b9f0-e4d417704f26" data-entity-substitution="canonical">who <em>Game Informer</em> readers might know as Gortash in Baldur's Gate 3</a>). The show is currently in production.</p><p>This shift back towards the classic Lara Croft look is a move the entire brand is making in 2026, which is the 30th anniversary of the first game's launch. This year, we can expect to see <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-is-a-remake-of-the-first-game-in-the" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="22919195-3e7d-45ff-9ee7-9d0fc3924b8d" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, a reboot of the original game</a>, while 2027 will bring <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/tomb-raider-catalyst-takes-lara-croft-to-northern-india-in-2027" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="00d416d9-e569-40af-805a-22822aae745c" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Tomb Raider: Catalyst, a wholly new adventure</a>.

<p>Posted across all of its relevant social media channels with the caption "Get your artifacts out. Lara's on her way...", the accompanying image showcases Turner donning the classic Tomb Raider costume from the earlier days of the franchise.</p>
<p>We can even see she's sporting those classic sunglasses and dual handguns, so this is a proper throwback!</p>

<p>There's no release date for the new series yet, but we've already had confirmation that Turner will be joined by the likes of Sigourney Weaver, Jason Isaacs, Martin Bob-Semple, and Bill Paterson. Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who notably co-wrote <strong>No Time To Die</strong> and starred alongside Harrison Ford in <strong>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</strong>, is credited as the series' main writer and as executive producer.</p>
<p>Lara Croft is also set to return in two new games in 2026 and 2027. The first, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tomb_raider_legacy_of_atlantis">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a>, is a reimagining of her first adventure, while <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tomb_raider_catalyst">Tomb Raider: Catalyst</a> will be a brand-new story in the chronology. Sadly, neither have been confirmed for Switch 2 at the time of writing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After revealing who will be stepping into the role of <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/"><strong>Kratos</strong> in <strong>Amazon's</strong> upcoming <strong>God of War TV show</strong> adaptation yesterday</a>, the company is back with another reveal today for one of its other video game adaptation TV series. This time, it's not a casting reveal, but more of a costume reveal, as we have our first look at <strong>Sophie Turner</strong> as one of video games' most iconic characters, <strong>Lara Croft</strong>, for the upcoming <strong>Tomb Raider</strong> series.</p>



<p>"<em>Get your artifacts out. Lara's on her way</em>," reads the caption of the post on the official <a href="https://x.com/PrimeVideo/status/2011800568835051933">Prime Video X (formerly Twitter)</a> account that first showed off Turner's new look. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Turner was confirmed to be the latest actress stepping into the role <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/">back in September 2025</a>, at which point Amazon also confirmed that filming for the series would begin sometime in <strong>2026</strong>. Just last week, several more casting choices were announced, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-tomb-raider-tv-show-adds-sigourney-weaver-jason-isaacs-to-the-cast/">including <strong>Jason Isaacs</strong> as Lara's uncle, and <strong>Sigourney Weaver</strong></a> as a mysterious new character who is looking to put Lara's unique set of skills to use.</p>



<p>The rest of the cast is rounded out by <strong>Martin Bobb-Semple, Jack Bannon, John Heffernan, Bill Paterson, Paterson Joseph, Sasha Luss, Juliette Motamed, Celia Imrie </strong>and<strong> August Wittgenstein</strong>, all of whom  (save for Peterson, Isaacs, and Bobb-Semple) are playing brand new characters in the series.</p>



<p>This is the same adaptation that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/">first announced back in <strong>May 2024</strong></a>, with the award-winning <strong>Phoebe Waller-Bridge</strong> signed on as a writer, executive producer, and showrunner for the series. Hopefully, as filming starts later this year, we'll begin to learn more about the story and the approach the adaptation is taking with the show.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marathon-runner-shells-trailer-abilities-bungie-2000660170</link>
            <guid>1407118</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’m not one for video game marketing drip-feeds, but everything we’ve <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-runner-extraction-hardcore-1851775956">seen of <em>Marathon</em></a> since it emerged from its 2025 playtest delay has had me more and more excited. The latest trailer from Bungie provides developer breakdowns of each of the extraction shooter’s classes, and while I have no idea if they’ll be interesting in practice, the footage sure looks cool.</p> <p>“Each Runner shell is built around a different gameplay archetype, such as intel gathering, combat disruption, or combat healing,” reads a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/dev-insights-runner-shells-new-video">new blog post</a> from the <em>Destiny 2</em> maker. “With distinct silhouettes, shells allow you to evaluate player threats and strategize your next steps on the fly. Each Runner shell’s playstyle can be customized using the cores, implants, weapons, and mods you bring on your runs.”</p>

 <p>Even before getting into each of the six character classes and their abilities, the new gameplay footage <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-visuals-art-bungie-updated-director-2000655713">has would-be fans impressed</a>. “<span dir="auto" role="text">It is insane how much better this looks than the alpha test,” read one of the top comments on YouTube. “This game looks better than every extraction shooter,” wrote a viewer on X. Whether it actually plays better than every other extraction shooter, including <em>Arc Raiders</em>, will be the big test.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p>There are seven runner shells with the following main abilities:</p> <blockquote>  <ul data-offset-key="54lu5-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="54lu5-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="54lu5-0-0">Archetype: Combat specialist</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="3oeqb-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="3oeqb-0-0">Armed with a personal defense barricade, missile systems, and movement thrusters, Destroyer shells are designed to bring the fight to enemy threats.</span></p> </li> </ul>  <ul data-offset-key="79let-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="79let-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="79let-0-0">Archetype: Shadow agent</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="4t9ge-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="4t9ge-0-0">Synthetic smoke deployment and camouflage technology allow Assassin shells to plan unseen strikes or take cover during hostile engagements.</span></p> </li> </ul>  <ul data-offset-key="apkkd-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="apkkd-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="apkkd-0-0">Archetype: Intel specialist</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="7rb4a-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="7rb4a-0-0">Recon shells excel at identifying threats and tracking movements using echo pulses, tracker drones, and holographic footstep trails.</span></p> </li> </ul>  <ul data-offset-key="b8atk-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="b8atk-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="b8atk-0-0">Archetype: Combat anarchist</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="20tdg-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="20tdg-0-0">Vandal shells traverse ground at incredible speeds, using their advanced movement and knockback cannon to disrupt combat.</span></p> </li> </ul>  <ul data-offset-key="doq0a-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="doq0a-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="doq0a-0-0">Archetype: Covert acquisitions</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="n6b7-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="n6b7-0-0">With enhanced visors and piloted butterfly drone, Thief shells can locate and acquire loot, then use their grapple to push an advantage or make an escape.</span></p> </li> </ul>  <ul data-offset-key="5o05o-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="5o05o-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="5o05o-0-0">Archetype: Field medic</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="fdthu-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="fdthu-0-0">Triage shells help keep themselves and allies alive using deployable healing drones, onboard reboot abilities, and combat buffs.</span></p> </li> </ul>  <ul data-offset-key="f4h8h-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="f4h8h-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="f4h8h-0-0">Archetype: Scavenger</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="1f1uu-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="1f1uu-0-0">The Rook frame is designed for scavenger mode, a unique way to play Marathon. As Rook, you’ll drop into a match that’s already in progress as a solo player. You won’t be able to bring a loadout, but you also aren’t risking anything, which makes Rook an excellent option for scavengers.</span></p> </li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>Each runner can be outfitted with cores and implants to augment abilities and stats. Cores will be unique to each runner class, while implants can be mix and matched across all types. The idea is that different builds will push runners into unique playstyles. For example, Vandal could equip a triple jump and speed boosts for more mobility, or go with an arm cannon that can be used to launch players into the air and ground-stomp for AOE damage for a more offensive-leaning shell.</p>

 <p>Bungie isn’t ready to spill the beans on how cosmetics will work just yet. Fashion has become a pillar of modern multiplayer shooters, as well as the microtransaction lifeblood that fuels their ongoing development. “We’ll talk about the ways you can customize your shells visually in the future, including more details on the earnable cosmetics you’ll unlock through the Codex and other ways,” the studio wrote today.</p>

 <p>But over 50 apparent early cosmetic shell options for each runner have <a href="https://thegamepost.com/marathon-leak-first-look-55-runner-skins-deluxe-edition/">reportedly already leaked</a> from a recent test build, including some that will be exclusive to the Deluxe Edition. The base version of <em>Marathon</em> is priced at $40 and coming sometime in March 2026. We don’t have the specific release date yet, either. For now, the drip-feed continues.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a post on social media, the teams at Deck Nine and Square Enix announced the impending reveal of the new Life is Strange game. Just days ago, it was discovered on a ratings site that this game will be titled ‘Life is Strange: Reunion’, but the post on socials contains a cryptic message that might <strong>debunk that</strong> in some way.</p>



<p>The team wrote, ‘Separate the real from the rumor,’ but it’s not clear if they’re talking about the content of the game or the suggestion that the plot for the game has already been uncovered.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-life-is-strange-reunion-the-next-game">Is Life is Strange: Reunion The Next Game?</h2>



<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure was the <strong>last </strong>game in the series, released in 2024 to a mixed reception. It told the extended story of Max Caulfield, returning to the fray and being voiced by the instantly recognizable Hannah Telle for the first time in almost a decade.</p>



<p>The short teaser released by Deck Nine in anticipation of the upcoming reveal of the next Life is Strange game didn’t give much away, but we at least know that Max Caulfield <strong>is returning</strong>. That was a point made at the <strong>end </strong>of Life is Strange: Double Exposure, so that’s hardly a surprise.</p>



<p>What <strong>was </strong>a surprise was when the world learned that Life is Strange: Reunion, the rumored next game, would see <strong>Chloe Price </strong>make a grand reappearance.</p>



<p>In the original Life is Strange game, released in 2015, players joined Max and Chloe as they explored a mystery taking over the small coastal town of Arcadia Bay. Over five episodes, Life is Strange unravelled, packed full of teenage angst, emotional sequences, and huge twists.</p>



<p>The game’s ending represented a fork, with players deciding to <strong>let Chloe die </strong>or to sacrifice the <strong>entire town </strong>and drive off into the sunrise. Years later, the canonical ending was made clear, as the story of Double Exposure confirmed that Chloe Price was alive.</p>



<p>We’ll know what the next Life is Strange game looks like in just a few days, when Deck Nine and Square Enix unveil it during a livestream on January 20th at 1 PM EST.</p>

Well, if you didn't get the chance to play it when it came out, then you never will, because it has been shut down forever.</p><p>According to <a href="https://x.com/TheNathanNS/status/2011478101419544964/photo/1" rel="nofollow ">a Discord post by a moderator named Yubari</a>, everything--the Bully Online project, the official Discord server, script development, source code, webpages, launcher, and all Bully Online account data--has been permanently deleted as of January 14. The YouTube video announcing the project's release has been privated, the Ko-Fi page has been removed, and any other Bully Online-related material is also unavailable. The ship has faded into the fog, if you will.</p><p>There's no explanation for why this happened just yet. However, Yubari noted that "this was not something [the team] wanted." YouTuber, developer, "massive Bully fan," and Bully Online project lead, SWEGTA, <a href="https://x.com/SWEGTA/status/2011478849431687225" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on X on January 14</a> that he'll "make a proper statement on the situation" in a YouTube video he'll post on January 21.</p><p>The speculation among fans of Bully Online, though, is that the team may have received a cease and desist from either developer Rockstar Vancouver or its parent company, Take-Two Interactive, perhaps for attempting to monetize assets created by Rockstar. We'll find out when SWEGTA comments on the situation next week.</p><p>Bully Online was a mod for Rockstar's 2006 high school menacing sim Bully. The mod allowed you to play minigames, role-play, compete in races, fend off against NPCs, and more--all with your friends and strangers online. It also featured free-roaming, a "fleshed-out" inventory system, and in-game currencies so you can buy goodies like housing, items, and vehicles. It essentially resembled GTA Online and RDR Online, but in an unofficial capacity. And now, it's gone forever. RIP.</p>

                <p>Bad news for fans of The Jumping Burger: the PlayStation Store has excised the game, along with over 1,000 similar titles published by the same developer, in what appears to be an effort to clear the storefront of shovelware.</p><p>German publisher ThiGames had its <a href="https://www.thigames.de/links" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">entire catalog</a> of at least 1,196 games silently delisted. The company, as pointed out by streamer and "trophy hunter" <a href="https://x.com/robthanatos/status/2011487254724952207" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">RobThanatos</a> on X, published the fourth-highest number of titles on the PlayStation Store.

A totally separate game called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ6XQmH_-PE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Jumping Burger: Turbo</a> shortened this process down to less than a minute and a half.</p><p>ThiGames had an entire cafeteria selection of jumping-food games, including The Jumping Taco, The Jumping Pizza, The Jumping Churros, and The Jumping Nuggets.

For the latter, Kunes said the companies take "appropriate enforcement actions for violations," which include restricting players from using services for misconduct, with escalating restrictions for "egregious or repeat violations."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Responsibility, according to the update, also extends to complying with all applicable laws in the places the companies do business and responding to legitimate requests from law enforcement.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I’m a massive fan of extraction games, just not the ones that everyone seems to be playing. The general gaming public has been obsessing over <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>,&nbsp;wincing at the impending launch of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/maratho">Marathon</a>,&nbsp;and hunkering down for their 2000th hour of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/escape-from-tarkov">Escape From Tarkov</a>&nbsp;playtime. Meanwhile, my first exposure to the genre and my favorite game of 2025 was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/synduality-echo-of-ada">Synduality: Echo of Ada</a>.&nbsp;It’s not a smash hit or a majorly well-known game, but it’s full of enough heart and charm that it had me overlooking and even appreciating it’s flaws for the sake of enjoying the full experience. I’m also a huge, huge fan of the game&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/let-it-die">Let It Die</a> –&nbsp;it’s a world I think of often, and a soundtrack I listen to regularly. So all those qualifiers meant I was dropping everything to excitedly play&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/let-it-die-inferno">Let It Die: Inferno</a>&nbsp;as soon as I could, I just wish that excitement was rewarded with a game worth playing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Let it Die: Inferno - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v6Nlb1WnSoY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Let It Die: Inferno&nbsp;is a huge departure from the first game, and an equally experimental shift from the now non-existent second game, Deathverse: Let It Die. The former was an inventive mix of dungeon-exploration, single player Souls-like combat, and Metal Gear Solid V’s asynchronous base raids. You never directly battled people, but still felt their presence. Let It Die: Inferno&nbsp;is a different beast. Instead of climbing a tower of Babylon, you’re descending into an endless pit in search of treasures. While combat is the same as the original game, your goal now is to race a timer to explore your randomised drop point, gather goods, and find a randomly positioned escape rocket or die trying and lose everything.</p>


<p>At first, I was in love with this genre blend. A melee focused extraction shooter meant that I was always on edge in an exciting way – every encounter requires me to get head-on with my enemy and face them directly, constantly risking my death if I mess up a single attack input. Some cracks in the foundation appeared pretty quickly. Your map is almost indecipherable thanks to how dense with winding paths and verticality each map is, frequently frustrating me when I was tight on time and trying to locate an exit. As I got further into the game and moved beyond the starting areas, the cracks grew wider. Difficulty ramps up almost arbitrarily between sections of the map, as well as types of enemies. In the starting area, monsters are pretty easy to deal with while humanoid NPCs are just kind of engaging. Move into the second area, though, and all of a sudden those same human NPCs can shred through you in almost one hit.</p>


<p>When you die, you lose everything you were carrying as well as your currently equipped body – one of several archetypes that you can level up across successful runs to unlock special enhancements and abilities for. Annoyingly, you’re locked into one body at a time and can’t swap until your current one dies, even if you’ve paid for the more premium editions of the game that give you multiple body types to choose from at the start.</p>
<p>Even more frustrating, though, is that your slow and steady progression through the game ultimately won’t matter. For some reason, Let It Die: Inferno has built a server wipe into its seasonal structure, just as the extraction shooter genre is coming to favour making these optional. When the next season of the game begins, every players progress in the game will be fully reset. Not just items, gear, and body levels, but even story and mission progression will be reset. Server wipes in extraction shooters stemmed from the regular meta resets from Esc</p>
<p>can help in maintaining consistency of experience, especially for games going through early access updates, but more broadly in the extraction shooter for maintaining power balance between players. In Let It Die: Inferno, these wipes seem designed as a way to encourage repeated play, but all it makes me want to do is stop playing before I’ve even gotten all that invested.</p>

<p>Another element of Let It Die: Inferno is PvP. Like other extraction games, you can run into other players during your run and either peacefully let them be or engage them in battle. In other games of the genre, the reason to fight another player is to steal their items upon victory. In this game, though, players are tuned to have incredibly low carrying capacity, which means players are rarely carrying a large amount of items on them at all. As a result, the risk of PvP far outweighs the reward, so the rare times I did come across other players in-game, they spammed crouches and hops to signal non-combativeness and I happily obliged and went in the other direction. It’s my only other option, after all – unlike most games in the genre, there’s no way to directly cooperate or buddy up with encountered players if you aren’t planning on fighting them.</p>
<p>I would have likely given up on this game a lot sooner if it weren’t for the incredible, jaw-droppingly beautiful art and visuals. The world that&nbsp;Let It Die: Inferno creates is truly magical, and taps into so much of the same wild spark that made Suda51’s vision for the original game so strong and unforgettable. The dungeons you explore are always a strange hybrid of specifically Japanese interiors ripped out and slapped down onto overgrown, outdoor marshes and mazes. The result is a beautifully alien experience where a path through a dark cave will lead into the basement of a Japanese arcade, or a door covered in bloody thorns and fire will suddenly lead you to an abandoned festival ground full of food stalls and discarded toys.</p>

<p>It’s a shame, though, that this same creativity and flair isn’t reflected in the games music. One of the things that the original&nbsp;Let It Die&nbsp;is best known for is it’s soundtrack – which was iconic for featuring over 100 different songs from various underground Japanese punk and rock bands that were all titled some variation of “Let It Die.” The blend of Japanese rock and grim dungeon exploration was incredible, and that killer contrast is missing entirely from Let It Die: Inferno.&nbsp;In my time playing the game I only noticed a couple of ambient background tracks, and the ones that specifically played during missions were grating, inconsistent, busy, and annoying.</p>
<p>According to the developers, Let It Die: Inferno used generative AI for several elements in the game, and one example they gave was that there is AI-generated music in the game. Go figure. The other disclosed areas of AI use include some parts of the background signboard textures, Records images, InfoCast videos, and even some voices.&nbsp;<i></i></p>

            <guid>1407070</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161476/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>It’s tough to consider that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> came out almost six years ago, and even tougher to get over just how good it looks on Nintendo’s first hybrid system. Switch 2 hasn’t been left behind, though - now it’s got its own version of the game, but if I’m being honest, it's not really bringing all that much to the table.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:97166 @ 1768496404 -->
<p>The most notable change is the bump in resolution. It was pretty before, but now everything is rendered at a resolution much more befitting the Nintendo Switch 2, although some jagged pixel edges are still present. They’re oddly softer, though, which to my eye (which is admittedly only made of meat) suggests that one of the primary sources of the bumped-up res is Nintendo’s own flavour of DLSS upscaling. As I said, though, meat eyes.</p>
<p>Whatever the tech, the result is noticeable, especially when you get up close to your TV in docked mode. Realistically, the original still looked excellent, so it’s not a glow-up of epic proportions or anything. If you didn’t see a stark difference when you booted it up, I’d forgive you wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>But that’s with HDR off. If you turn it <em>on,</em> you’ll see a bigger difference than I was expecting. Colours are that much more vibrant, and colour banding on things like environmental shadows in water is almost entirely diminished. ACNH has always been a game with colours worth popping, and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 Edition</a> makes said popping even poppier.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you’d missed the previous reveal, it’s still 30fps, unfortunately. Probably something to do with one of the game’s mechanics being tied to the frame rate, but a shame nonetheless.</p>
<p>And that’s not all! Although there isn’t an awful lot more left to discuss. Mouse controls allow you to decorate and arrange furniture within your home, the hotel, or the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/animal_crossing_new_horizons_-_happy_home_paradise_dlc">Happy Home Paradise</a> with a bit more ease, although it’s hardly a ‘power tool’. Bringing up <em>any</em> menu requires you to navigate with the standard controls again, which is a crying shame as we feel the ability to quickly whip through lists and drag and drop items into position would’ve been an easy win.</p>
<figure><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161473/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You can also use the mouse controls in custom designs, and those posts you can stick up outside Resident Services if you want. It’s nice that it’s been included, and if mouse controls were omitted, it definitely would’ve felt like a missed opportunity. But truthfully, Nintendo hasn’t realised the potential that mouse controls could have brought either.</p>
<p>You can have 12 people on your island in multiplayer now instead of the original’s eight, which is certainly an improvement - and now with GameChat and CameraPlay support. But personally I don’t think I could sit through that bloody plane landing sequence 11 times in a row for a single session.</p>
<p>That being said, loading times are certainly improved over the Switch 1. I’m not sure I’ve seen a single loading screen that hasn’t been shorter, though — for me — they felt just as they were when playing the Switch 1 version on Switch 2 before this 'Edition' dropped. I wasn’t able to see any significant difference between either on Switch 2, which makes sense at the end of the day, but if that’s all you care about, then you might not need to drop the cash for the upgrade any time soon.</p>
<figure><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161475/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Testing among Team NL, we found minor improvements, but also significant variations between our S2 load times (almost certainly down to how much each person has on their island), so your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>The final inclusion is the megaphone, making its somewhat triumphant return from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">New Leaf</a> on the 3DS, and it’s <em>fine</em>. You hold the 'A' Button, yell the name of a resident at your console, and if it understands you correctly, they’ll yell out in response, giving you an idea of where on your island they are, assuming they’re not indoors somewhere. It works fairly well, but it has to be said, it’s not exactly an exciting inclusion. Functional, yes, but do your neighbours really need to hear you scream "ANCHOVY!" at all hours?</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is perfectly fine. It makes things a bit prettier, has a few more options to take advantage of the console’s new features, but all in all, it’s not an especially exciting upgrade.</p>
<p>If it were free, I don’t think anyone could reasonably complain, but even at the relatively low price, it’s only <em>just</em> scraping by to be worthwhile. It’s far from an essential purchase, but if you’ve got credit on your account and you’re a fan of the game, you could do worse.</p></section>

			<p>After announcing several of the titles that'll be joining <strong>GeForce NOW</strong> throughout the <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-kicks-off-2026-14-new-games-added-throughout-january/">month of <strong>January 2026</strong> right at the start of the new year</a>, we have <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-quarantine-zone/">a new batch of games revealed today</a> for yet another GeForce NOW Thursday that will be joining the service. Some, like <strong>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check</strong>, which leads the group this week, have previously been announced. Others, like <strong>Star Wars Outlaws</strong> and <strong>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon</strong>, are new reveals joining NVIDIA's cloud streaming service.</p>



<p>This week's new batch of games sees a total of <strong>nine titles</strong> entering the GeForce NOW library, including the aforementioned three titles, the first two games in the <strong>Styx</strong> franchise, both of which will be free on the <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> starting today, <strong>Guild Wars: Reforged</strong>, and <strong>Tavern Keeper</strong>.</p>



<p>The headliner for this week, Quarantine Zone: The Last Check, is the latest game published by renowned indie publisher <strong>Devolver Digital</strong>, the team known for publishing the likes of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/heart-machine-next-game-possessors-release-date-november-pc-ps5/">Possessor(s)</a>,</strong> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-extra-premium-december-2025-games/">Skate Story</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened,</a></strong> and <strong>Cult of the Lamb</strong>, to name a few. It sees you stepping into the shoes of a checkpoint officer, scanning people into the Quarantine Zone, acting as the last line of defense for the people in the zone. If you mistakenly let someone sick into the zone, you could set the plague loose on an already crumbling society.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games joining GeForce NOW this week:</p>

<p>As we noted at the start of the year, we still have no word on some of January's bigger releases, like <strong>Code Vein II</strong>, joining the service. There's still time, though, before its release at the end of the month, so hopefully, we'll see it added either later in the month or at least sometime soon this year.</p>



<p>If you're looking forward to Code Vein II, you should <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-hands-on-preview-kill-the-past/">check out our preview of the upcoming Souslike from Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto</a>. For even more on the game, Kai and Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo got to speak with the game's producer, <strong>Keita Iizuka</strong> and director <strong>Hiroshi Yoshimura</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-interview-time-travel-partner-system/">and you can read that interview here</a>. </p>

            <p>I only have to skate a few meters before the piercing drum of rifle fire fills my ears. Armed with my trusty can of spray paint, I cover the hostile soldiers in splotches of bright colour while rollerblading circles around them. They stumble about, trying to keep me in their sights. Stopping to complete an unfinished bit of graffiti on one of the walls, spreading colour between gaps in a template, the soldiers gather around me. Unable to target me, they mill about in the way as I try to finish, making it a touch more difficult to work out if I've left any blank spaces.</p>
<p>I'm playing an early version of Palestine Skating Game, which offers a test of its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jet-set-radio">Jet Set Radio</a> and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater-inspired rollerblading and painting amid a stylised rendition of war-torn Gaza.</p>

<p>Palestine Skating Game has been in the works for a number of years, but it came to my attention via Amaar Chowdhury's recent interview with its developers for <a href="https://www.huckmag.com/article/palestine-skating-game-rollerskating-resistance-video-development-graffiti">Huck</a>. Rather than summarise the excellent article, which I recommend reading in full, I'll focus on my impressions of the game's 0.8 demo.</p><p>After finishing the mural while watched by the paint-covered guards, I spent some time railgrinding through this early demo's version of the West Bank separation wall. The space is a recreation of a few city blocks, filled with real world artworks and murals emblazoned across the looming concrete facade. You pass drawings of <a href="https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/sets/hdYTtJwekUCU6HVVKREssg/political-graffiti-takes-over-the-west-bank-wall">Trump and Netenyahu kissing</a>, Morgan Freeman's face alongside a quote from Nelson Mandela, murals dedicated to both <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/6/israeli-court-acquits-officer-of-killing-autistic-palestinian-man">Eyad al-Hallaq</a> and <a href="https://www.plutobooks.com/blog/leila-khaled-the-poster-girl-of-palestinian-militancy-international-womans-day/">Leila Khaled</a>.</p>
<p>The reality of the environment grounds the otherwise loveably janky splattering of paint globs. The experience feels deeply unnerving, but I'm glad of that discomfort. Playing left me  aware of the real suffering the game's aiming to convey through the backdrop to its carefree sliding around. After respraying a massive tank as it fired booming shells my way, I returned to the wall. The structure makes me think how this wall, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2020/7/8/in-pictures-israels-illegal-separation-wall-still-divides">declared illegal many years ago by the International Court of Justice</a> impacts the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/documents/droi/dv/905_impact_/905_impact_en.pdf">Palestinans living in its shadow</a>.</p>
<p>In its final form, the developers plan to include an electronic score, but currently Palestine Skating Game has no soundtrack. A cold silence is punctuated only by the discharging of weapons. I'd argue this makes those sounds hit harder than they might in the final version. For now, it remains a work-in-progress blend of video game silliness and brutal reality, made by a team who know that day-to-day of that brutality firsthand, some still living in the West Bank to this day.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the most recent prototype of Palestine Skating Game a go, you can find it on <a href="https://palestineskatinggame.itch.io/prototype3">Itch.io</a>. The game's developers have <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/palestine-skating-game-fundraiser">GoFundMe</a> and <a href="https://www.launchgood.com/v4/campaign/palestine_skating_game__grind_shoot_paint__do_graffiti_to_arabic_electronic_music">LaunchGood</a> open to raise money for their Gazan staff, though the latter looks like it may be closed for donations as of writing.</p>

              <p>I’m having a lovely time playing the early access release of&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>. But then of course I am: I love playing&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>. So I’m enjoying building a pretty little log cabin, exploring underground caves for precious ores, battling skeletons with a bow and arrows, and travelling far from spawn to visit distant biomes. Because that’s what I do when I play <em>Minecraft</em>. What I’ve yet to figure out is why&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em> exists as anything other than a texture pack for Microsoft’s behemoth.</p> <p>There&nbsp;<em>are</em> differences. But when I describe them to you, they’re going to sound so minuscule. For instance, <em>Hytale</em> has a much better jump: you can jump two blocks high, and you can mantle up from four blocks below. I love that. That would make <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/bukkit-plugins/highjump">a good&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em></a><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/bukkit-plugins/highjump"> mod</a>.&nbsp; And there’s the slightly improved combat in which enemies actually block and you need to time your attacks. Then again, I can just add the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/smart-mobs">Smart Mobs</a> option to Mojang’s game. And you can <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/realistic-mc-graphics">see where I’m going</a> when I point out that <em>Hytale</em> is a far prettier game with gorgeous sunrises.</p>

 <p>Ten years in the making, and famously cancelled by Riot in the middle of last year <a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-riot-minecraft-hypixel-revived-cancel-shutdown-2000645248">before being revived in November</a>, this early access build of&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em> is unquestionably a really good reimagining of <em>Minecraft. B</em>ut in its current form, as released this week for a minimum of $20, that’s <em>all</em> it is, and I’m left pretty bemused how that can be the case.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000660163" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660163"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660163">© Hypixel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>To give you an idea of how peculiarly the two games overlap—even beyond the core concept of a procedurally generated world made of cubes in which you dig, chop, mine and shovel to gather materials for crafting tools, construction materials and decorating items—let’s just look at the mobs. The main ones you’ll encounter at first are skeletons and spiders. Big, chunky spiders that are two blocks wide. It didn’t need to be skeletons and spiders, but it is. Are there zombies? Yes there are zombies. But surely not golems? I’m afraid there are golems. There <em>are</em> other mobs in there, with pillagers replaced by goblins and Outlanders, and villagers swapped out in favor of Ewok-like Kweebecs, as well as the most astonishingly overpowered underground-dwelling giant frogs. But then there’s also a place called the Void which I read contains a Void Dragon. Seriously?</p>

 <p>The other aspect I can imagine an angry person on Reddit bringing up in response to accusations of cloning is crafting. It’s…it’s a lot worse. While it’s true that <em>Minecraft</em> has a fairly broad array of workbenches, for the most part people are using the basic crafting table and then an anvil and enchantment table. Sure, there’s the cartography table, the loom, the stonecutter, but these aren’t exactly core to the game. In <em>Hytale</em>, within the first couple of hours, I had needed to build a Workbench, Furniture Workbench, Blacksmith’s Anvil, Tanning Rack, Armorer’s Workbench, Builder’s Workbench, Furnace, and Campfire. I had to upgrade my main workbench to be able to then build the Chef’s Stove and Salvager’s Workbench, but still haven’t crafted the Alchemist’s Workbench and Arcanist’s Workbench because I don’t have enough gold or thorium. Each is enormous, meaning I’ve twice had to add sizable new wings to my cabin just to fit them all in the same location. It’s bonkers!</p>

 <p>Legitimately great is that if you have chests directly next to workbenches, it’ll recognize their contents when showing what can be constructed. (Less great is the need for a small auditorium to fit all the benches in, and so of course not being able to have them all adjacent to the necessary chests.) This is a huge improvement, and I really appreciate it.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000660164" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660164"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660164">© Hypixel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But the more I try to allow <em>Hytale</em> to be its own game in its own right, the more it fights back against that. When you pick up items from the ground, which bob up and down floating in the air, they emit a little “pop” sound, exactly like in <em>Minecraft</em>. Put two one-tile chests next to each other and they’ll ping into one double-width chest. Let alone that you already know what every block type is likely to be, given its visual similarity to the source. And the thing is, it’s necessary! This game both looks and feels so much like <em>Minecraft</em> that any time it does behave differently, it feels wrong.&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em> is such an unabashed clone that it’s backed itself into a corner of needing to do everything the same way&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>does. From the nine-box inventory along the bottom of the screen with a space for a shield to the left to how chest inventories appear, it’s just the same designs. It feels like playing the same game, in the same way, with the same goals.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000660166" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660166"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660166">© Hypixel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This&nbsp;is supposed to change, when&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em> adds its Adventure Mode, which will offer RPG-like storylines and quests to solve, and that sounds great! It’s something I always longed for in the earliest days of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> and that still only exist today through mods, and usually ones that eschew a lot of the core nature of <em>Minecraft</em> to do so. There are hints of this in place, like the Forgotten Temple which will teleport you to a peaceful hub-like area, almost entirely consisting of buildings with “Under Construction” signs over their doors, and a statue which catalogs every mob type you’ve encountered so far. It’s a cute idea, and unlocks more crafting options when you ding specified numbers.</p> <p>Adventure Mode should add in “Alterverses” and bespoke quests and all that good stuff that will make <em>Hytale</em> distinct from the game it’s so wantonly copied. You know, if it happens. Clearly none of us knows what happened over the last five years at Riot, and whether the Hypixel team had developed huge sections of this before Riot pulled the plug, forcing the developers to revert back four-and-a-half years for this early access version. Or perhaps even then the game was so much like a <em>Minecraft</em> texture pack that Riot couldn’t see a way to release it.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000660165" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660165"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660165">© Hypixel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>As I said at the start of this, I’m having a lovely time! There are a whole bunch of balancing issues, but that’s entirely expected at this point. (Those toads, man, with the tongues that grab you. And iron is wildly too rare just now.) But I’m not having as lovely a time as I do when I join my son on his <em>Minecraft</em> Realm, or <a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-donut-smp-server-farm-notch-2000656412">goof around on DonutSMP</a>, because, you know, it’s the OG.&nbsp;<em>Minecraft </em>has&nbsp;had 17 years to make itself buttery smooth, balanced to complete perfection, and at the same time old enough to engender nostalgia and comfortable familiarity.&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>is an awful lot prettier (albeit still in pixelly blocks), but right now it’s in no important way <em>better</em>. I mean, the jumping and mantling is great! But, you know, it needs to offer an awful lot more than that. I’m still left just wondering&nbsp;<em>why</em>? Why fight so, so hard to make the same game that already exists?</p>

 <p>I’ll happily keep playing it for a little bit, see what the biomes I’ve yet to reach have to offer (the one where everything’s on fire is pretty fun), but I fear that in its current state I won’t be the only one quickly drifting away.</p>
