            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/27/foamstars-is-going-free-to-play-in-october/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Square Enix has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/foamstars">Foamstars</a>, their foam party multiplayer shooter, is going free-to-play in October.</p>
<p>Launched in February as a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly game and PS4 and PS5 exclusive, before transitioning to being a moderately priced premium game in March. However, it seems that this hasn’t given the game a large enough community, pushing Square Enix to shift business models. An additional benefit of this change is that, as a free-to-play game, Foamstars will no longer require a PS Plus subscription in order to play online.</p>


<p>The price change will come into effect at 1AM UTC on 4th October, after which the game will be free-to-play.</p>
<p>Anyone that bought the game or grabbed it from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/16/foamstars-february-playstation-plus-monthly-game-confirmed/">PS Plus in February</a> will receive a “Legacy Gift” which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>12 exclusive color-variant Bubble Beastie skins</li>
<li>1 exclusive Slide Board design</li>
<li>1 title: “Legacy”</li>
</ul>
<p>Foamstars was quickly pegged as a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splatoon-3">Splatoon</a> copycat by gamers, but introduced some quirky ideas alongside, such as being able to build up the foam into 3D structures, instead of just blanketing the level in your team’s colour.</p>

<p>Looking back at our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/12/foamstars-review-ps4-ps5-ps-plus/">Foamstars review</a>, Jim said, “Foamstars is a vibrantly inventive take on the hero shooter and Splatoon, though the bubble will quickly burst for those who can’t gel with its floaty, fluid-based gunplay.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/members-of-spiders-go-on-strike-due-to-issues-within-the-company/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Spiders company, known for creating games such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/greedfall-spiders-levelling-up/">Greedfall</a>, Steelrising, and Of Orcs and Men, has released a letter calling for action and asking members to support its decision to strike. The Spiders company is owned by Nacon and is now taking action against issues that it has been facing for several years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/08/open-letter-from-spiders-workers-to-their-employer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This letter</a> comes after the company consistently refused to take action after many employees' pleas for aid against psycho-social issues and disrespect for the CSE and STJV union sections that represent Spiders employees.</p>
<p>In an open letter posted online, they announce that this call for action follows a previous open letter sent in January, in which they stated that management had continued to ignore them and their propositions. Since that letter was posted, new negotiations have been underway regarding important topics such as wages and working conditions. Spiders hope that speaking out publicly will force management to take them seriously, consider their propositions, and act in the employees' best interests.</p>
<p>A 20-page document lists all of the issues that Spiders members have been experiencing, including denial of problems, global mismanagement, lack of gender equality, and blocked negotiations. This is just the tip of the iceberg on a much bigger problem at the company, and they plan to take strike action the week of September 2.</p>
<p>Although Spiders has created some fantastic games over the years, management continues to do the company a disservice by not being able to ensure that staff members are safe and secure in their jobs. Employees have been denied the right to work from home or to adapt their working schedules when issues arise and are unwilling to budge on their viewpoint. With the main office in the heart of Paris, the cost of living for those working at the company is increasing, and Spiders members are now unsure how they are meant to keep living in Paris when they don't have any financial security in their job.</p>
<p>For additional context, Spiders has had a limited amount of employees since 2020, with no growth happening between then and now.&nbsp; At the time, only 40 salaried workers were at the company and worked on one game at a time. Since then, the amount of workers has more than doubled, and they have opened additional lines of production to work on more projects. However, there has been no shift in management, and what management there is makes hasty decisions, causing rollbacks in production without consulting the developers. This has led to unhealthy work habits for many Spiders' members, as it means that when they go on vacation, they are afraid of what they will face when they return.</p>
<p>It is hoped that by releasing yet another open letter and officially standing on the picket line come September 2, management will listen to Spiders members and begin to take them seriously, helping them continue to provide great content to gamers worldwide without risking their financial security or their health.</p>

<p>Announced during the Indie World Showcase and Nintendo Direct, Balatro will be teaming with several other games for a collaboration.</p>



<p>The four games announced to be collaborating with Balatro were The Switch 3, Among Us, Vampire Survivors, and Dive the Diver. The update will be free and arriving later today. You can watch the announcement trailer below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>According to the announcement, the collaboration will be nothing more than cosmetic.</p>



<p>Balatro is one of 2024’s stellar releases, selling over two million units within six months. According to critics, the game is likely to be in the running for becoming at least The Game Awards’ Indie Game of The Year, with some, including myself, believing that it’s solely a Game of The Year contender, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-arkham-shadow-the-first-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Many gamers understandably felt a rush of excitement when they heard that a new Batman: Arkham game was in development, followed quickly by disappointment after learning that it would be a VR game exclusive to the Meta Quest 3. I get it. VR has been in our lives for the better part of a decade now, and not even a full-blown Half-Life game could get core gamers interested. So what hope does Batman have?</p><p>That’s ultimately for the market to decide, but what I can confidently say after playing the first 45 minutes of Batman: Arkham Shadow, out this October from Camouflaj Studios, the folks responsible for Iron Man VR, is that it’s a “real game.” Meaning, it’s not a 90-minute tech demo, like Rocksteady’s 2016 PSVR1 launch game Batman: Arkham VR clearly was (though it was quite enjoyable). And I had a really good time that was just getting interesting when my demo ended.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Arkham Shadow is set between the events of Origins and Asylum, with the latter being the Camouflaj team’s primary inspiration. This extends to the physical structure of the campaign; this isn’t an open-world game like City or Knight, but instead a series of larger but ultimately confined play spaces you can move freely around. Given the technological and gameplay constraints in VR compared to a flat-screen game, this makes sense. But how does it actually play?</p><p>Pretty well, it turns out! I’ll be honest: I was skeptical coming into this demo. Though I had fun putting on Batman’s cowl in the aforementioned Arkham VR, there wasn’t much of a real game there. Camouflaj promises that Arkham Shadow is the biggest and longest game they’ve ever made, and thus far I’m inclined to take them at face value there. In fact, if anything, the onboarding takes too long. I get that players have to be taught how to execute the familiar gameplay mechanics of the Arkham series all over again in VR, but I was ready for more freedom in combat sooner than Shadow was ready to let me loose.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Batman: Arkham Shadow Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>I learned how to sneak up on bad guys from behind, how to punch, how to counter, how to do finishing moves, how to throw batarangs, how to glide down from above, how to drop smoke bombs, how to grapple up to ledges, how to activate Detective Mode, how to hang upside down, and how to tie up bad guys from perches. It really is most of the stuff you do in the other Arkham games, but you get to perform the actions yourself, with your hands. </p><p>And you know what? It’s pretty fun. At least, once you’re taught all the moves and get to start stringing attacks together. Was I breaking a sweat? No, this is no Beat Saber. But you do get to throw some punches as Batman in a first-person perspective in VR and enjoy the thrill of taking down a mob of bad guys all attacking you at once. It feels cool to jab an arm out to counter a bad guy approaching from the weak side. It feels cool to grapple up to a vantage point. It feels cool to beat the ever-loving tar out of the dredges of Gotham.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But this isn’t just a VR punch-fest. Myriad bat-characters are here, from Jim Gordon to Harvey Dent and many others – and it’s all in service of a story revolving around the Rat King, a new foe in Gotham who wants to bring down the city’s elites. And herein lies my biggest unknown with Arkham Shadow so far: its story. It’s not that the story is bad, it’s that I really didn’t see any of it in the first 45 minutes of the campaign. In fact, my demo ended just as I was about to talk to Commissioner Gordon and really get the plot moving forward. The Camouflaj crew told me that they’d skipped me past a prologue that would’ve helped set things up for me. And I don’t know about you, but when I think of the Arkham games I think of two things primarily responsible for making each one memorable: combat and story. The combat is there in a uniquely VR way, yes, but the jury is still out on the story. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’ve played enough to call this a real Arkham game. </p></div><p>Still, I’ve played enough to call this a real Arkham game. There are tons of collectibles scattered around to find, from Rat King transmitters to rip off the wall and smash to homemade Rat King Statue of Liberty figurines, plus others Camouflaj wouldn’t reveal yet. Unfortunately, as expected, the visuals in the Meta Quest 3 are so-so – they’re nowhere near as pretty as Rocksteady’s Arkham trilogy. That’s to be expected in lower-power tech like this, but it’s nevertheless a bit disappointing. I wouldn’t say Arkham Shadow looks bad, by any stretch, but this isn’t a gorgeous Gotham like we’ve seen in the rest of the series. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>So where do I stand after 45 minutes of Arkham Shadow? Besides the other side of the room where I started, I mean, thanks to all of my punches, turns, crouches, and stealth grabs? I’m quite optimistic, honestly. I really wanted to keep playing when they took the Meta Quest off my head, as the campaign really seemed to be just starting to hit its stride. Should you go out and buy a Meta Quest 3 just for this game? It’s too early to make that call, but at the very least, it has the potential to tempt a lot of people.</p><p><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/first-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-trailer-introduces-keanu-as-shadow.964569/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-sonic-hedgehog-3-movie-trailer-keanu-shadow<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paramount Pictures has released the first&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3&nbsp;</em>movie trailer, and just as we suspected, none other than Keanu Reeves himself has indeed been cast as antagonist Shadow the Hedgehog.</p>
<p>The trailer begins with James Marsden's Tom telling Sonic he's finally found his family, before we cut to the emergence of Shadow the Hedgehog from a testing facility. Team Sonic - that is, Sonic, Tails, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/knuckles-series-release-date">Knuckles</a> - are enlisted to help defeat him.</p>
<p>It looks like the story is playing up the parallel between Sonic and Shadow; a voiceover tells us that Shadow's story began in much the same way as Sonic's, but where Sonic found friends and family, Shadow found "only pain and loss".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-trailer-shadow-maria.jpg?itok=yNS_LcdY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-trailer-shadow-maria.jpg?itok=0LlrZ8uE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3&nbsp;</em>takes inspiration from&nbsp;<em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, but it won't feature the same exact storyline.</figcaption></figure><p>We only hear two spoken lines from Shadow. In his first, he describes Sonic and friends as a "colorful bunch", and in the second, he tells Sonic he did "what [he] had to", although naturally, the context for that exchange isn't clear yet.</p>
<p>Still, as if one of the trailer's hashtags didn't already make it explicit, the two lines are enough to make it abundantly clear that it's Keanu Reeves voicing the hedgehog.</p>
<p>As the trailer progresses, Sonic and his friends attempt to fight Shadow, but are obviously outmatched. They're forced to seek the help of none other than Jim Carrey's Dr. Robotnik, who's likely cooking up a plan of his own.</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer here, which features some fun audio callbacks based on&nbsp;<em>Sonic</em>'s "Green Hill Zone" and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-hedgehog-3-movie-teaser"><em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>'s "Live and Learn"</a>, right here.</p>

<p>During the closing moments of the trailer, we also see Robotnik coming face to face with a figure who is presumably his grandfather Gerald, although we don't get to hear his name.</p>
<p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3&nbsp;</em>hits movie theaters on December 20th. We'll likely learn more about its narrative and cast in the intervening months, so stay tuned for more.</p>

The first trailer for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/9/23297992/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-live-action-movie-december-2024-release-date"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em></a> is out, giving fans a first listen of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/15/24131385/keanu-reeves-shadow-the-hedgehog-sonic-3">Keanu Reeves as Shadow the Hedgehog</a>.</p></div><p>Reeves doesn’t put too much spin on his interpretation of Shadow, sounding very much like himself. But considering fans were hype as hell that he was doing Shadow’s voice, I think Keanu doing his best Keanu will go over fine with audiences. The trailer sets up Shadow the Hedgehog as the toughest enemy Team Sonic has ever had to face, requiring them to call in outside help. Jim Carrey returns as Dr. Robotnik, who has apparently let himself go. For <em>Sonic 3</em>, they’re not wasting a drop of Carrey’s comedic talent, having him play not one Robotnik but two. </p><p>Shadow’s arrival was teased at the end of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23014568/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-review-movie-jim-carrey"><em>Sonic 2</em></a>. Although we didn’t get to hear him then, various outlets later reported that Reeves had been cast as the black-furred, gun-toting hedgehog with an attitude problem. Yesterday, Paramount began teasing the trailer’s imminent arrival by projecting images of Sonic, Shadow, and perennial baddie Dr. Robotnik <a href="https://twitter.com/DorianParksnRec/status/1827935480648020008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1827935480648020008%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc">on buildings all over the world</a>.</p><p>Judging from the trailer’s sad narration of Shadow’s life of pain and suffering, <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em> is definitely taking its broader plot points from <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em> — the 2001 game in which Shadow made his first appearance. We also got a glimpse of Maria, the girl Shadow befriends during his time as a lab hedgehog, and it’ll be interesting to see how the movie treats her fate. </p><p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em> chaos controls into theaters on December 20th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A new trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> has been released, giving us a proper look at Shadow the Hedgehog and a chance to hear his voice for the first time. You can check out the trailer below.
</p>
<p>
Shadow's voice actor, confirms <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-trailer-shadow-keanu-reeves-1235852090/">Variety</a>, is Keanu Reeves (The Matrix, John Wick), as heavily rumoured.
</p>
<p>
Back in April, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-reportedly-casts-keanu-reeves-as-shadow">rumoured Reeves would be voicing Shadow</a>. And the end of the second Sonic film heavily hinted at Shadow's inclusion.

<p>
So what else was shown in the trailer?
</p>
<p>
As expected, Shadow will be the main nemesis wrecking havoc Sonic, Tails and Knuckles will have to join forces to beat.
</p>
<p>
It includes the return of Jim Carey as Dr. Robotnik - and another intriguing character too. There's no sign yet of who Krysten Ritter will be playing.
</p>
<p>
I'll admit I was hoping for some more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-sa2-dc">Sonic Adventure 2</a> references, though the night-time metropolis setting of much of the trailer could at least be a nod to Radical Highway. I need the truck chase! There's even an Akira motorcycle slide, of course.
</p>

<p>
The music, too, reorchestrates both the classic Green Hill Zone and Sonic Adventure 2's theme Live &amp; Learn.
</p>
<p>

Did you spot anything? Let us know in the comments.
</p>
<p>
The release of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 on 20th December will round off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-declares-2024-the-year-of-shadow-the-hedgehog">Sega's Year of Shadow</a>, which also includes Lego sets, a tour of the Shadow motorcycle, and the release in October of Sonic x Shadow Generations.

</p>
<p>
I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-is-the-best-of-00s-sonic-with-a-big-dash-of-nostalgia">hands-on with that game's Shadow campaign</a> a couple of months ago and enjoyed its big dash of nostalgia.

            <p>
Join us to watch today's Indie World &amp; Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, live at 3pm UK time. (That's 7am Pacific, or 10am Eastern.)
</p>
<p>
Stand down your expectations of seeing more Zelda or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime">Metroid Prime</a> - or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>. Today's event will instead spotlight upcoming Nintendo Switch games from third-party publishers, as well as indie developers. The show is set to run for around 40 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Will Silksong be there? Probably not. But we're hopeful we may see more of The Plucky Squire, out in September. What else could we see? Other upcoming titles set for Switch include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> in October, plus the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a> in September.

			<p>What do you get when intelligent toys turn on their creators? Humanity’s extinction. That’s the scenario you’re thrust into when Gori: Cuddly Carnage starts off. It’s been a little while since all the humans were killed by AI-powered intelligent toys, but not all the toys became bad. Gori, a bipedal cat, along with allies FRANK the potty mouth hoverboard, and CHIP, a rather depressed AI, set out to destroy the evil toys in as efficiently chaotic way as possible.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gori: Cuddly Carnage - Meow Release Date Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YA61jRAZlK0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Gori: Cuddly Carnage’s narrative is decently written but a pretty by-the-numbers plot. However, the comedy is on point. Yes, it’s juvenile and reliant on lots of swears, but the delivery is great, with the factory mission and the manager standing out as a fun comedy highlight. The delivery of lines just sounds like the team is having a fun time with the script. It is silly but it will make you laugh. It’s worth mentioning that finishing all the levels will get you one ending, but to get the proper ending you do need to find all the key pieces and rescue every single unicorn.</p>


<p>Gori: Cuddly Carnage is an action game which is split into eight main levels plus 14 challenge missions. Each main mission gives you a star ranking based on how long it takes to beat it, the top combo you can put together, the total score, and the difficulty level. Challenge missions also have a three-star rating, though the measuring stick for these varies from combo scores to time remaining on the clock. Gori: Cuddly Carnage’s difficulty ranges from Indoor Cat, aka easy, all the way up to Cuddly Carnage, the ultimate difficulty.</p>
<p>I played through the levels twice, first on House Cat (Normal) and then Cuddly Carnage to gauge the difficulty jump. Aside from enemies dealing more damage and bosses having a couple more attacks, I didn’t really notice a huge step up in challenge. However, that’s more than likely down to the fact I had unlocked the majority of upgrades giving Gori more health, stronger attacks, and more fuel to move faster and perform special attacks for my second run.</p>


<p>FRANK is more than just a hoverboard. FRANK is Gori’s weapon, equipped with blades and a whacking attack, with both used in motion as the pair speed around environments. Gori also gets a grenade launcher to hit big groups from range. In each mission you’ll move between arenas filled with enemies before coming up against mini bosses and final bosses. The enemies start off as basic unicorns but evolutions of the mythical horned horse are gradually introduced as you move through the game. There’s a decent variety of enemy types from blade-wielding melee attackers to flying bomb-droppers, and larger ones that can perform high powered attacks. Yet, even with this range&nbsp;of enemy, combat boils down to a handful of attacks.</p>
<p>That said, combat itself is enjoyable and rewarding as you pull off combos using the different attacks, and while there’s an extensive move list there is generally enough fuel to use the special slash and whacking attacks near-constantly. While it is satisfying to wipe out masses of enemies using these moves, it can get a bit repetitive and going back to normal moves feel slow in comparison. Enemies can be relentless, swarming towards Gori with lethal intent so the thankfully-slick movement is paramount to survival. There are occasionally issues with judging distances between jumps in platforming sections, and some combat areas can work against the power moves due to there being so many places to fall off the edges.</p>
<p>Gori: Cuddly Carnage is full of bold and bright colours, and some of the level designs are packed with excellent ideas. The arcade level in particular, as you jump into different machines, is a great imaginative experiment. Enemy designs are fun too and you can tell the designers have thought of lots of different ways to turn childhood toys into nightmarish creatures. The bosses are also well-designed, but suffer from having very obvious weak points highlighted.</p>

<p>While Gori: Cuddly Carnage is a fun game there are a couple of downsides. The camera can be finicky at times which isn’t helpful when the action is so fast-paced. There’s also a lock on for enemies so the camera follows them, but it is hit and miss with the angles it chooses to use. During my playthrough the game did also crash a couple of times back to the PS5 homescreen, though this can hopefully be ironed out in an early patch.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Gori Cuddly Carnage is a really fun game that offers a decent mix in its levels and challenges. I did play through levels a couple of times because I enjoyed the gameplay and the humour of it. While there are some issues, namely the camera and a couple of platforming bits, overall Gori Cuddly Carnage is a fun, gory, time.	</p></div>

			<p>While The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria has been out on the Epic Games Store for a while, those who prefer to use Steam or play on Xbox Series X|S will finally be able to have their own dwarven adventure. This is the only survival crafting game that is set in the Fourth Age of Middle-earth, a rich expansive universe full of different stories to be told. If you want to get your hands on The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria on either <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933130/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Return_to_Moria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> or Xbox Series X|S, it is currently available for a discounted price of $19.99.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria™ Steam and Xbox Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cnt7N3H49IE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Previously, the developers of this game were working on an update for the Beta and Epic Games Store version which would allow crossplay. As the game has just released on new platforms, that update will automatically be available to those who are just getting stuck in now. All platforms will be able to take part in crossplay, meaning you can play with friends who are on PlayStation 5 even if you're on PC or Xbox.</p>
<p>This update is named "<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-is-out-october-24-for-pc-ps5-features-john-rhys-davies-as-gimli/">The Golden Update</a>" and includes a myriad of new features as well as crossplay. This includes a Sandbox mode, for those who prefer to play without a challenge present. For those on Steam, there is also the option to purchase an exclusive bundle, which will include the game, the official soundtrack comprised of 34 unique tracks, as well as an art exhibition, which is also discounted for a limited time.</p>
<p>The Golden Update was previously only available on the Epic Games Store but is now widely available across all platforms. It allows Steam and Epic Games users to host 8-player gaming sessions in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, regardless of what platform the other players are joining from.</p>
<p>In addition to crossplay, there are now over 100 new decorations for players to choose from to customize their base how they like, to make it look as earthy or cozy as they like. One of the main features added that will benefit people who play the game solo is now the option to pause the game. To be able to pause the game, you just need to hit Escape or open the settings menu, and you'll be able to return to the game without fear of consequences.</p>
<p>New difficulty settings also allow players to fine-tune the experience to their liking, such as changing the aggressiveness of enemies, combat, and the frequency of drops.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-palace-of-drow-queen-and-lair-of-drider-review-new-shade-of<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Drow have a tumultuous history in fantasy TTRPGs. They are a staple of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, a group of subterranean elves characterized by ruthless ambition, cruelty, and sharp cunning. They have been the source of controversy given their potentially problematic design and coding, as well as the source of iconic heroes like Drizzt Do'urden. Now, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/steamforged-games-local-legends-ttrpgs-and-adaptation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steamforged Games</a> has their own take on these long-lived warriors in <em>Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen</em> and <em>Lair of the Drider</em>.</p>

<p>In <em>Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen</em>, your adventuring party attempts infiltrate the underground city of the drow. This is done by the group sneaking into the city by boat. As for whether or not the party fights or talks their way through customs is for the dice to decide. From there, it escalates into storming the titular palace.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-palace-of-the-drow-queen-miniatures-screenshot.jpg?itok=DyS7OhYq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-palace-of-the-drow-queen-miniatures-screenshot.jpg?itok=F99aWpAL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It ain't Menzoberranzan, but it's still lethal.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, the drow or more than prepared for any opposition. The enemies contained within the box are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>4x Drow Warriors</li>
<li>4x Drow Crossbowmen</li>
<li>2x Lizard Cavalry</li>
<li>2x Drow Whirlwind</li>
<li>3x Oneiromancer</li>
<li>1x Drow Queen</li>
</ul><p>In broad strokes, <em>Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen</em> is an enclosed, uphill battle. The party starts the first map on a boat surrounded by guards, are bottlenecked by a gate, and are overwhelmed by lizard-riding cavalry at the docks. The second map, continues this push into the palace with traps and strategically placed units. Much like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-camp-of-bandit-twins-and-cave-of-manticore-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bandit Camp</a> encounter, the Drow intelligently leverages a homefield advantage against the players at every turn; making every inch of progress feel earned.</p>
<p>This is also the first <em>Epic Encounters</em> box I have used where the different Drow statblocks have scaling rules. Every <em>Epic Encounters</em> box has different difficulty numbers and damage dice based on your group's play tier. Level 1-4 characters have environmental hazards that deal damage in D4s, and Level 10+ characters get hit with d10s from their surroundings. The enemy scaling does something similar, adjusting ACs, attacks per turn, available spells, and health.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounter-palace-of-the-drow-queen-palace-battlemap.jpg?itok=z_7iBUr8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounter-palace-of-the-drow-queen-palace-battlemap.jpg?itok=VbMgZVUu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Oneiromancer doesn't attack, it just makes it hard for you to hit anything else.</figcaption></figure><p>This is great since the enemy placement in <em>Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen</em> is very deliberate. The module as written is light on monster closets or incoming waves of enemies. This is good because each Drow enemy poses a challenge in their own right.</p>
<p>Steamforged Games manages to put their spin on the Drow in this box. In addition to the more familiar trappings: matriarchal society, gothic architecture, lizard mounts, etc., they have traits connecting them to spiders and drider monsters. It isn't completely gratuitous body horror, but it does give the Drow more distinct physical characteristics. There's even a unique bit of culture with mind and memory magic with their oneiromancers. It all blends into this wonderfully macabre take on the underground elves.</p>
<h2>What is in Epic Encounters: Lair of the Drider?</h2>
<p>Rounding out <em>Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen</em> is the boss box, <em>Epic Encounters: Lair of the Drider</em>. Like other box boxes in this line, you get one gigantic drider miniature, a double-sided battlemap, and some minion tokens.</p>
<p>As an extension of the mental magic and low-key body horror elements in the first box, <em>Lair of the Drider</em> is a daunting boss encounter. Its different lair abilities and spells are a potent combination of area control and debuff. Faerie Fire, Dancing Lights, Cone of Cold, Web, all and more are present.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-palace-of-the-drow-queen-drider-screenshot.jpg?itok=ZqldNORR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-palace-of-the-drow-queen-drider-screenshot.jpg?itok=3OvGlZl7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Arachnophobes beware. Also adventurers that want to live.</figcaption></figure><p>The arena itself is even more brutal, There are known hazards such as getting caught in webbing, as well as dangerous tactical hazards like crystals that gush poisonous gas and geographically confusing tunnel passages. For especially sadistic DMs, there are even cracks in reality that form during the fight. If a character fails their save against that, it is an instakill.</p>
<p>What keeps <em>Epic Encounters: Lair of the Drider</em> from turning into a tedious slog of overlapping inconvenience is the nature of the drider boss. The booklet expressly states, as a result of its creation involving mental magic and body grafing, the Drider can't commit to a single idea or plan. This scatterbrained mentality is not just a great worldbuilding detail, it is something the players can use to their advantage.</p>
<p>My one critique of the encounter plagues all official <em>D&amp;D Fifth Edition</em> adventures. While the Drider can cover the area in darkness, webbing, teleport, and mess with the environment, it is only on one axis of terrain. If you're a DM that allows aarokocra or owlin PCs in an adventure, they may trivialize this boss encounter through air superiority.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-palace-of-the-drow-queen-drider-battlemap.jpg?itok=uNVbejrJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-palace-of-the-drow-queen-drider-battlemap.jpg?itok=pDR0wdL0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Watch your steps, heroes....</figcaption></figure><h2>Should I Pick Up Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen and Lair of the Drider?</h2>
<p>Overall, I love Steamforged Games' grotesque and esoteric take on drow in <em>Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen</em> and <em>Lair of the Drider</em>. The encounters in the former are brilliantly crafted with solidly scaled threats and the latter is a nail-biting exercise in resource and mobility management. If you want to spice up an underground encounter, you can't go wrong with either of these boxes.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>
<p>
Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen and Lair of the Drider is a great, grotesque, and mesmerizing interpretation of the drow. Well worth a look for fans of underground fighters. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

The dwarven engineers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria">The Lord Of The Rings: Return To Moria</a> have formally entered the Golden Age of Steam. The game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933130/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Return_to_Moria/">now available on Valve's digital storefront</a>, after a year in the comparatively barren underdark of the Epic Games Store, and developers Free Range Games have also released a Golden Update, which adds offline single player pausing, around 100 building objects, and a sandbox mode allowing for non-story-led excavation and settlement of the game's procedurally generated mountains. Plus, new hats and axes! Try not to get dragon sickness.

I haven't played Return To Moria since October last year. Back then, it was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-review">comfortingly vast survival game</a> with crunchy torch-lit aesthetics, many gorgeous biomes to uncover, and a fair amount of jank. (For the purposes of Immersion, please find on the right an image with a translation of "jank" into Khuzdûl, the ancient runic language of the Dwarves, care of <a href="https://tengwartranscriber.github.io/">Tengwar Transcriber</a>.)</p>
<p>I'm definitely up for another crack at this particular seam of lore-digging, as long as they've fixed that thing where all your interior decorations end up at tortuous 45 degree angles to the layout. Here's an 11-minute talkthrough video from game director, detailing both what's in the Golden Update and what they've added since launching on EGS.

<p>
If you don't have time for a video, here's my own breakdown of the Golden Update. Let's start with the sandbox mode, which has already been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-morias-next-major-update-adds-a-sandbox-mode-and-single-player-pause">available in beta on EGS</a>. This lets you generate worlds from "a wide variety of random seeds, meaning each playthrough can vary significantly in layout and difficulty". There are "minimal tutorials" in sandbox, and as such, the devs recommend that you only play if you're familiar with the game's campaign or with other survival sims. Sandbox brings with it crafting recipes for 14 new kinds of weapon and armour. These include the Wolf Skin Hat and the Barôkamlut, or mithril battleaxe. You will probably find the Barôkamlut useful when seeking to acquire the materials for Wolf Skin Hats.
</p>
<p>
The update also adds crossplay functionality, allowing the proud longbeards of PC to mingle with the upstart stonelords of PS5 and Xbox in sessions of up to eight players. If you'd rather excavate Khazad-dûm on your lonesome, you can now pause the game by hitting escape while playing offline. 
</p>
<p>
As for the new building objects, these range from rugs and banners to light fixtures, tavern signs and chairs. The improvements to the building system itself are probably of greater interest to players re-Returning to Moria. "Restoring Moria is now easier than ever with the changes made to the stability system as well as improved object snapping," explains the press release. "The pre-placed buildings throughout Moria are now stronger than ever, expanding players' ability to build expansive bases wherever they choose."
</p>
<p>
They've also expanded the game's difficulty settings, with options for enemy aggression, the frequency of hordes, sieges or patrols, and the abundance of mining drops. Add in the promise of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2933130/view/4241914673865774571?l=english">Steam Deck compatibility</a>, together with new ambient music, and you have a game I'll try to carve out some fresh hours for this weekend. It's no <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dwarf-fortress-steam-review">Dwarf Fortress</a>, but it's got charm.

The team remarks that he’s the most powerful foe they’ve ever faced, and we see him absolutely pulverize the trio. It’s unclear at this point if Shadow will team up with Robotnik (even temporarily) as he does in the games, or if the movie will start with him already at odds with the doctor. </p><p>One of the big reveals is that Gerald Robotnik, the ol’ Egghead’s grandfather and the creator of Shadow, makes an appearance at the very end, also played by Robotnik actor Jim Carrey. </p><p>Check out the trailer below:</p><p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>is set to debut in theaters on December 20. It jumps off the second film’s post-credits cliffhanger, which shows Shadow waking up in a secret facility, having been kept in cryostasis for over 50 years. That’s par for the course for the character and matches his backstory from his debut in <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>. <em>Sonic 3 </em>isn’t a 1:1 adaptation of the Dreamcast game, but is clearly borrowing some elements from it. Alyla Browne (who played the young Furiosa in the early stretch of this year’s <em>Fury Road </em>prequel) plays Maria Robotnik, a key figure in Shadow’s origin and a major character in the events of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, so it’s clear the movie is drawing heavy inspiration from the 2001 platformer.</p><p>Reeves and Browne are making their series debuts with <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>, but returning cast members include Ben Schwartz as the titular speedy hedgehog, Colleen O’Shaughnessey reprising her role as Tails both from the previous two movies and the video games, and Idris Elba as Knuckles.
