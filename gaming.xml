                <p>Microsoft has announced that it has collaborated with LG to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to select internet-connected vehicles. By using LG's webOS Automotive platform, passengers will be able to stream and play games directly from the Xbox app. Players will need to have an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription and an automotive data plan to access their gaming library, but Microsoft says that it will give them instant access to hundreds of games via Game Pass as well.</p><p>A new video showed off how this works, with the footage specifically focused on people in the rear enjoying some games--just in case you were worried that this partnership could lead to some IRL Forza Horizon from the driver in the front.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPlEDcuirA4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GPlEDcuirA4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's not unsurprising to see Microsoft expand its cloud gaming initiative to cars, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/">as the company's marketing for its gaming brand in 2025</a> has been focused on how you don't need to own an Xbox console to play Xbox games. "This Is An Xbox" has been the primary slogan for this advertising campaign, which emphasizes how the Xbox ecosystem can be accessed through a wide variety of devices.</p><p>Next Generation at Xbox VP Jason Ronald also recently spoke about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-console-aims-to-put-players-first-says-microsoft/1100-6534059/">Microsoft's plans for its next-gen Xbox console</a>, explaining that the company envisions players having options to play games while they're out and about and then pick up from where they left off by using dedicated hardware. "It's really just focused on how players like playing games in the current environment and just designing and building a platform with them at the center," Ronald said.</p><p>While an LG car equipped with internet functionality and dedicated monitors will <em>probably </em>be more costly than an Xbox console, it does make the upcoming ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X mobile gaming PCs a more palatable option in comparison. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-handheld-launch-date-set-for-october-features-steam-deck-style-compatibility/1100-6534120/">Set to launch on October 16</a>, pricing for them has not yet been revealed, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wont-or-cant-reveal-rog-xbox-ally-x-price-yet-but-report-says-it-could-be-900/1100-6534122/">but it's rumored that the most expensive device</a> could cost up to $900.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <p>There is a new patch for co-op climbing caper Peak, which adds a colour blindness mode as well as a number of fixes and balance tweaks.</p>
<p>The colour blindness mode, which has long been requested by the Peak community, adds patterns to the game's different coloured berries. This, the developer says, will help "further differentiate them", and make the berries more readily able to be told apart.</p>
<p>On the balance side of things, the Peak team has among other things made Nest Eggs heavier.</p>

<p>You can check out the latest patch notes for Peak below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Colour Blindness Mode! This adds patterns to differently-colored berries to further differentiate them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Balance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced the maximum time before the first tornado can spawn.</li>
<li>Slightly increased the minimum time before a tornado can spawn again.</li>
<li>Slightly reduced the commonness of the "Tornado Hell" biome variant,</li>
<li>It is now wayyy less likely that the maze is blocked after entering the TOMB.</li>
<li>Nest Eggs now weigh more to match the weight of the Egg inside.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Major fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where players would be unable to obtain the Endurance Badge!</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where The Scoutmaster couldn't climb walls. This went unnoticed for a while because he can jump pretty high, but now he should be even scarier.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Scrolls and Berrynanas and other objects that change form when used would drop the new item instead of putting it in your hands.</li>
<li>Fixed a potential issue where playing a vanilla game after previously having visual mods installed (or playing with a modded player while not having their same mods installed) could cause a variety of visual and functionality issues. This could include, but was not limited to, players permanently showing up as a default skin in the endgame screen even if not wearing modded cosmetics, as well as the endgame report breaking entirely and preventing certain achievements from being obtained.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, rarely, getting caught in a tornado would cause the game to freeze on the loading screen upon failing a run.</li>
<li>We gave the backpack new physics that should prevent more cases where people would lose their backpack.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minor fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Magic Bugle and Scoutmaster's Bugle play at a strangely low volume. (its not too loud now I promise)</li>
<li>The Guidebook renders at a higher resolution if you set the Render Scale to low.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where placing a Scout Cannon atop a jellyfish could cause a softlock.</li>
<li>A missing treetop has been added to a branch on the giant tree.</li>
<li>Removed the annoying flicker on the end game countdown.</li>
<li>Removed Scoutmaster grain effect in Photosensitive Mode.</li>
<li>Rainbow stamina bar is now slower in Photosensitive Mode.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where it said "Move" instead of "Interact" on a prompt in the Controls page.</li>
</ul></blockquote>

              <p>Those first couple of boss fights that have been taking people down are to get slightly easier in <em>Silksong</em>‘s first update. As ridiculous as it may be, there really are few more contentious topics in the world of gaming than <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-difficulty-hard-damage-criticism-2000624031">difficulty</a>, and that topic is riding high once again with the release of <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, a single-player game that’s proving so enormously popular <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hits-over-half-a-million-players-on-pc-alone-after-crashing-steam-2000623193">it’s routinely hitting half a million concurrent players</a> every day on PC alone. But among them, many are really struggling, demonstrated by <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksongs-most-popular-mods-make-it-easier-too-hard-boss-fights-2000624107">the most popular mods all helping lower the challenge</a>. Now, developers Team Cherry are joining in too, with the game’s first patch also set to make the earliest stages of the game easier, including making Moorwing and Sister Splinter slightly less monstrous.</p> <p>In what’s surely to be a controversial move, the game’s <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159519774039622/">first set of patch notes</a> detail a range of bug fixes and tweaks that are due to arrive “mid next week,” and among them are “some slight balance adjustments early in the game.” However, PC players can access the patched version straight away by <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159120097716330/">opting into the public-beta branch</a> on Steam and GOG.</p> <p>After a list of fixes for glitches that players have found since launch, the update provides a little detail on what’s been made easier. “Slight difficulty reduction in early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter,” is the first, and an awful lot of people will be breathing a sigh of relief. If you can hear past the tedious roar of the “git gud” assholes, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1nb6u1r/my_wife_has_been_waiting_for_years_for_silksong/">an awful lot of people</a> are reporting that Moorwing was the very early point in the game they were desperately looking forward to that ended their option to keep playing.</p>

 <p>Next up is a “reduction in damage from Sandcarvers,” a “slight increase in pea pod collider scale,” and a “slight reduction in mid-game Bellway and Bell Bench prices. Added to that you’ve got a “slight increase in rosary rewards from relics and psalm cylinders,” and finally an “increase in rosary rewards for courier deliveries.”</p> <p>Oftentimes, especially when a game’s development goes on for as long as&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>‘s, the people creating the game can forget they’ve had seven years’ experience playing it more than the soon-to-arrive audience, and as such elements that will prove especially challenging near the start of a game can be lost sight of. So it’s extremely normal to use data from players to make such adjustments for how the game is being widely received. There will always be voices who respond in disgust, furious that others might not have to achieve the same challenge as they did, or declaring humanity redundant as a result of the tweaks that place all others beneath them, but they’re a tiresome minority and safely ignored.</p> <p>Here’s the full list of changes in the patch, due to arrive on PC and consoles next week:</p> <blockquote><p>– Fixed situation where players could remain cloakless after Slab escape sequence.<br> – Fixed wish Infestation Operation often not being completable during the late game.<br> – Fixed wish Beast in the Bells not being completable when Bell Beast is summoned at the Bilewater Bellway during the late game.<br> – Fixed getting stuck floating after down-bouncing on certain projectiles.<br> – Fixed courier deliveries sometimes being inaccessible in Act 3.<br> – Fixed craft bind behaving incorrectly when in memories.<br> – Fixed Lace tool deflect soft-lock at start of battle in Deep Docks.<br> – Fixed Silk Snippers in Chapel of the Reaper sometimes getting stuck out of bounds.<br> – Fixed Claw Mirrors leaving Hornet inverted if taking damage during a specific moment while binding.<br> – Fixed Snitch Pick not giving rosaries and shell shards as intended.<br> – Removed float override input (down + jump, after player has Faydown Cloak).<br> – Slight difficulty reduction in early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter.<br> – Reduction in damage from Sandcarvers.<br> – Slight increase in pea pod collider scale.<br> – Slight reduction in mid-game Bellway and Bell Bench prices.<br> – Slight increase in rosary rewards from relics and psalm cylinders.<br> – Increase in rosary rewards for courier deliveries.<br> – Various additional fixes and tweaks.</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Years before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/animal-crossing-gcn">Animal Crossing</a> became a global success, Nintendo warned its localisation team how "difficult" it would be to make the game work outside of its native Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-we-did-try-to-keep-forest-in-the-name-how-mario-64s-princess-peach-helped-bring-animal-crossing-to-the-west" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time Extension</a>, Nintendo localization manager Leslie Swann said bosses cautioned that the English-language launch of Animal Crossing, then titled Animal Forest, would be a huge job due to the sheer amount of in-game text within the title, as well as its numerous Japan-specific cultural references and items.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Swan remembered then-Nintendo president Satoru Iwata discovering her team was working on bringing the notoriously odd and text-heavy game would be launched outside of Japan — something that left him in disbelief.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We knew of Animal Forest, but we hadn't really dinked around with it — we usually would get the Japanese versions of games and play through them," Swann recalled. "But we hadn't really messed around with that one very much. So, anyway, [Takashi Tezuka, Nintendo executive officer] basically said to me, 'We'd like to have you localize it' and I said, 'Sure.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But then he said, 'No, Leslie, I'm not sure you understand, it's going to be difficult.' And I kept having to assure him that we would make it happen."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Animal Crossing's earliest incarnation, known as Animal Forest, launched for N64 in April 2001 and never made it outside of Japan. It was only when the game was given an expanded GameCube launch that the decision was made to localise the title elsewhere — and even then, its arrival around the world took years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A month or two later, I was in a meeting with Mr. Iwata and some other heads of the development group," Swan recalled, "and we were just kind of going around saying, 'Here's what we're going to be working on,' and I just said, 'Well, Mr. Tezuka is asking us to work on Animal Forest' and he just burst out in laughter. He just laughed and said, 'I don't know how you're going to do this.' And it's true, just everything in that game was so specific to Japan."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/09/gettyimages-81942145-1757414619829.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The late Satoru Iwata reportedly laughed at the idea of bringing Animal Crossing to the west. Photo by GABRIEL BOUYS/AFP via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Swann's team had to rename every character, determine each character's catchphrase and localise the game's calendar of in-game events to make sense to a more global audience. Other work involved sifting through the game's inventory of items to ensure everything made sense for players outside of Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can't tell you the number of hours we spent on that game, all hands on deck," Swann continued. "We were so lucky at that point that we didn't have other big projects, as we pretty much had the entire staff dedicated to that game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Everybody would get together in a room and we would say, 'Okay, today we're going to rename all the furniture in this set,' or 'Today we're going to work on names for these characters and their catchphrases.' Then, after this, we would submit all this stuff to our legal department who had to clear everything because our thought from the beginning was if this is big, then we're going to want to make merchandise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the game's name, Animal Crossing, went through various changes before launch — with some suggestion it might include 'Forest' in the title before it was ultimately dropped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It must have been at least six months or maybe a year for us to clear the name Animal Crossing," Swan concluded. "I remember we had so many other names that we were in love with and then we would be crushed when they would be rejected. My favourite was 'Animal Acres,' because the grids of the town lent themselves to being called acres. But again, that didn't clear."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from Swann on her career, including her work on Nintendo Power magazine and how she ended up voicing Princess Peach for years, the full <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-we-did-try-to-keep-forest-in-the-name-how-mario-64s-princess-peach-helped-bring-animal-crossing-to-the-west" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time Extension</a> interview is well worth a read. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

On September 5, Kamiya <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1963791553694220633" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted,</u></a> “if it’s impossible to resurrect P.T., Kojima should make a new game in the same style,” adding: "if Kojima doesn’t do it, maybe I’ll give it a go. I hate horror though, so it wouldn’t be horror... plus, I have no ideas.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems that Kojima’s upcoming experimental horror game OD might go some way to plugging the P.T.-shaped hole. First teased back in 2023 via a mysterious trailer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-compares-od-to-boktai-says-it-will-be-just-as-different">OD promises to</a> “explore the concept of testing your fear threshold, and what it means to overdose on fear.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like P.T., OD is also a collaboration with a filmmaker, this time with Jordan Peele of Get Out fame. Hideo Kojima <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-will-read-your-initial-responses-to-his-mysterious-xbox-game-od-but-insists-the-real-evaluations-come-after-10-or-20-years-from-now"><u>previously promised</u></a> that OD will be something that “no one has seen before,” although details still remain scarce. Kojima will be holding <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kojima-set-to-offer-glimpse-at-future-projects-during-event-celebrating-10-years-of-independence-from-konami"><u>a special event in Tokyo</u></a> later this month to celebrate 10 years since his break with Konami, where he is likely to reveal more info about future projects (possibly including more about OD).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Devil May Cry and Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya kicked off his career at Capcom working on the original Resident Evil and its sequel, he has never made a modern, photorealistic horror game akin to P.T. In a series of tweets last October, Kamiya observed that P.T.’s delisting left a gap in the market, which Japanese indie hit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-exit-8">The Exit 8</a> stepped into. “The Exit 8 went viral, but it’s basically just a watered-down P.T.,” Kamiya opined.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Exit 8 is far less gory and objectively less scary than P.T., however it does share the delisted demo’s looping corridor mechanic, building a sense of dread in the player as they try to spot anomalies in its subway passage. Selling fast on Steam upon its release in November 2023, The Exit 8 has grown into such a phenomenon that it has even spawned a film adaptation (which recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-exit-8-the-live-action-horror-movie-adaptation-of-the-hit-indie-game-has-sparked-a-backlash-in-japan-over-its-tsunami-scene"><u>generated some controversy in Japan</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1844064525647216826" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>saying</u></a> that he can’t play P.T. alone because it is “too scary,” Hideki Kamiya is full of praise for Kojima and del Toro’s demo. He even went so far as <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1844214379350471060" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>to say that</u></a> the ‘8-like’ sub-genre (games with similar settings and mechanics to The Exit 8, which proliferated in the wake of its meteoric success) should really be called ‘P.T.-like.’ “P.T. was really that revolutionary - with an unparalleled uniqueness, and I think it has strongly influenced subsequent game creators,” said Kamiya.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Kamiya, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/okami-2-capcom-hideki-kamiya-and-machine-head-discuss-hotly-anticipated-sequel-in-exclusive-interview">he's busy working on Okami 2 for Capcom with his new development studio, Clovers</a>.

"But that was something that was a little bit too much, so we decided to skip that one. But that whole scene when you can see his weakness, I think, is very important, in combination with the ruthlessness and how vicious [the Nazis] are."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The concept around Hitler was that he was going to be extremely physical," Matthies added, picking up the story. "Like, the opposite of spiritual, basically. If you have a Nazi enemy – or, in this case... the ultimate Nazi – how do you make something unique out of it? How do you make it interesting and something they haven't seen before?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This resulted in the darkly comic scene where Hitler gets increasingly irate, eats, vomits and has to urinate. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Wolfenstein's Most Insane Moments</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I had this idea that... 'Oh, maybe we just see it,'" Matthies laughed. "Y'know? I was Slacking with Todd Vaughn, VP of Production at Bethesda at the time, and I was like: 'Er, you think that would be a problem if we see Hitler's penis?' He was like, 'Yeah, I don't advise doing that.' I was like, 'Ah, you're probably right, maybe that's too much...' We all need to be saved from ourselves sometimes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of that decision, or perhaps because of it, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus landed as another strong entry in the studio's beloved shooter series — and hopefully not the last. As part of the same interview, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/machinegames-teases-were-not-done-with-wolfenstein-yet">MachineGames suggested its team were still keen for a third entry to round off the trilogy</a>, as they still had "story to tell".</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>The iPod age of gaming came and went fairly quickly during the two-decade lifecycle of Apple's signature brand of music players. Apple released 54 games for the iPod clickwheel that could have been lost to time if not for the efforts of game preservationists. It took a lot of effort to bring all of the games back together, but the complete lineup of iPod clickwheel games has now been preserved. </p><p>As reported by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/all-54-lost-clickwheel-ipod-games-have-now-been-preserved-for-posterity/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ars Technica</a>, iPod Clickwheel Games Preservation Project founder Olsro recently completed the collection by tracking down a copy of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/real-soccer-2009/" data-ref-id="5000-40149">Real Soccer 2009</a>. Preserving the titles meant finding people who still had the original games downloaded on their iPods and syncing them up to a Virtual Machine master library that lets other iPod owners access the games at their leisure. Olsro also expressed relief that the completed project "means this whole part from the early 2000s will remain with us forever."</p><p>The Virtual Machine titles are compatible with iPod Classic 5G, 5.5G, 6G, 6.5G, and 7G, iPod Nano 3G or 4G, and iPod Nano 5G. Olsro has shared detailed instructions for how to access the Virtual Machine on <a href="https://github.com/Olsro/ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject/tree/main" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GitHub</a>. Once those steps are followed, players should be able to enjoy those titles on their own iPods. </p><p>The complete list of preserved iPod clickwheel games is reproduced below.

            <p>Konami has released a patch for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> on Xbox Series X/S and PS5, which among other things will update some of those wonky textures during certain scenes.</p>
<p>This update will also be coming to Steam, though for now we don't have a date, with Konami merely saying it will be "soon".</p>
<p>In addition, Konami has promised stability improvements are being investigated, along with an option to select a preferred rendering mode on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>. However Konami still needs "some time to review and address" these issues.</p>

            <p>Feeling spritely? This shouldn't help: the original PlayStation console was released 30 years ago today in the United States, on 9th September 1995. It was a machine that would change gaming forever.</p>
<p>We celebrated the 30th anniversary of PS1 last December because that's when it was first introduced, in Japan, on 3rd December 1994. Sony's debut console was released in Europe at a similar time to America, on 29th September 1995.</p>
<p>It's such a momentous milestone we dedicated a week to it, writing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-30th-anniversary">a collection of articles</a> about the grey, oversized Discman-style box. The articles ranged from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/writing-wipeout-one-of-gamings-most-enduring-vivid-worlds">love-letters to WipEout</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-playstation-propelled-tekken-into-the-big-time">Tekken</a>, to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-playstation-30th-anniversary-interview-with-shawn-layden-it-was-a-fight-to-get-the-sony-name-on-the-machine-they-didnt-want-to-be-associated-with-it">interviews with former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden</a>, who was there at the time (which is why his photograph is in black and white).</p>
<p>We also asked for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tell-us-your-favourite-playstation-memory-and-win-a-games-worth-of-ps-store-vouchers">your memories of PS1</a>, which you provided in abundance - there were more than 300 comments. And I read them all. And they're all lovely; funny, heartfelt, poignant. Prepare yourself: it's an emotional ride.</p>
<p>As the regional reverberations of the PS1 anniversary are felt again, I thought I'd resurface some pieces you've maybe not read.</p>

            <p>The notes for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s first proper post-release patch have arrived. Team Cherry have been busy fixing bugs and making some "slight balance adjustments in the early game", which you can now give a go early via beta branches on Steam and GOG.</p>
<p>That'll mean you're testing the changes ahead of the update's planned full deployment next week, with Team Cherry aiming for a mid-week arrival "barring any unforeseen issues". Now you know that, let's get into the changes, which the studio have outlined in a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159519774039622/">post on the Steamy platform</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, the bit that might prove controversial among hardened Skongers. As part of those early game balance tweaks, Team Cherry have opted to roll out a "slight difficulty reduction" for the boss fights against Moorwing and Sister Splinter. How you feel about that will likely depend on whether you've spent the past few days yelling at folks for seeking out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-early-mods-sand-off-its-more-annoying-edges-including-double-damage-and-distant-spawns">mods</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">guides</a> to help make their path through the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> a bit less stressful.</p>
<p>Outside of that, the balancing's also seen Sandcarvers have their damage reduced, plus increases in the rosary rewards dished out by relics, psalm cylinders, and courier deliveries. The prices of bellways and bell benches you run into around the game's midway point have also dropped a bit. Oh, and there's been a "slight increase in pea pod collider scale".</p><p>That's it for the balancing, with the rest being bug fixes for problems like "getting stuck floating after down-bouncing on certain projectiles", "courier deliveries sometimes being inaccessible in Act 3", and that "situation where players could remain cloakless after Slab escape sequence" I mentioned in the strap. No prolonged Hornet nudeness for the horn-dogs. Well, coatlessness really, but either way she might have gotten a bit cold, so an important fix.</p>
<p>I'll list the rest of the fixes below, so you can scan through to see if anything you've run into crops up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed wish Infestation Operation often not being completable during the late game.</li>
<li>Fixed wish Beast in the Bells not being completable when Bell Beast is summoned at the Bilewater Bellway during the late game.</li>
<li>Fixed craft bind behaving incorrectly when in memories.</li>
<li>Fixed Lace tool deflect soft-lock at start of battle in Deep Docks.</li>
<li>Fixed Silk Snippers in Chapel of the Reaper sometimes getting stuck out of bounds.</li>
<li>Fixed Claw Mirrors leaving Hornet inverted if taking damage during a specific moment while binding.</li>
<li>Fixed Snitch Pick not giving rosaries and shell shards as intended.</li>
<li>Removed float override input (down + jump, after player has Faydown Cloak).</li>
</ul>
<p>"All fixes will apply retroactively, so players who've hit a significant bug that prevents progress may want to switch over to public-beta to receive the fix," Team Cherry wrote. "Further fixes are already being worked on for a second patch. If you have an issue and you don't see the solution in the list above, we may be working on it."</p><p>If you're planning on jumping into the patch's Steam beta, instructions for getting access can be found here. Just remember that you'll likely need to disable any mods, such as these <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-multiplayer-mods-are-already-starting-to-arrive-and-its-not-even-been-a-skonging-week">freshly released multiplayer ones</a>, that you've got installed first.</p>

                <p>Combining cute Japanese vending machine aesthetics with classic management sim mechanics, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/vending-machine-co/" data-ref-id="5000-681731">Vending Machine Co.</a> is on its way to help you build a passive income empire. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-simulation-games/2900-6819/" data-ref-id="2900-6819">simulation game</a> will release in full later this year, but is currently previewing its kawaii aesthetic with a free <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3622640/Vending_Machine_Co/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam demo</a>.</p><p>Japan is well-known for its vending machine culture, and this new management sim is putting you in charge of your own Japanese vending machine empire. You can choose which neighborhood to put your machines in, and what to stock them with, with different demographics of customers likely to purchase different stock.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBY62FhhbJc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RBY62FhhbJc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While Vending Machine Co. follows the classic management sim formula, its cute illustrative style and satisfying restocking gameplay is reminiscent of cozy indie hit Unpacking. Managing your machines will initiate other little mini-games along the way, from repairs and upkeep to sorting and counting your cash.</p><p>Vending Machine Co. is due for a release at an unspecified date later this year, but has a free demo available now. The demo just got a handful of upgrades, including two new neighborhoods to explore and set up your vending machines in, as well as some standard bug fixes and balance updates.</p><p>When the full release drops later this year, it will include a bunch more neighborhoods, including a salaryman-centric business district, a temple area frequented by tourists, and a youth-focused university ward. The full game will also include more items, minigames, and collectables, and will encourage players to explore its curious neighborhoods outside of building their vending machine business.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <p>A number of in-game websites and apps which may well be a part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> have leaked, and they appear to parody the likes of Uber and WhatsApp.</p>
<p>A post on the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1002286-gta-vi-general-speculation-discussion-vice-city-baby/page/51/#comment-1072587065">GTA Forums</a> from insider Tez2 (known for their Rockstar tips) revealed they had come across "domains all registered on May 27 under Take-Two's nameservers" which they believe relate to Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>
<!-- code from Primis - Eurogamer.net - eurogamer.net -->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>"These domains could be in-game sites that [Rockstar] may redirect to 6's page later on, like what we've seen with 4 and 5," they wrote.</p>
<p>These sites are:</p>
<ul>
<li>what-up.app</li>
<li>rydeme.app</li>
<li>buckme.app</li>
<li>leonidagov.org</li>
<li>brianandbradley.com</li>
<li>hookers-galore.com</li>
<li>wipeoutcornskin.com</li>
</ul>
<p>What-up.app is a name you may recognise. This chap was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-acknowledges-gargantuan-grand-theft-auto-6-leak">uncovered in the GTA 6 leaks from 2022</a>, and is supposed to be the copycat for Whatsapp.</p>
<p>Some in the GTA Forums have surmised that rydeme will be an Uber-like app, and buckme could be something along the lines of a Patreon or PayPal equivalent (though, my first thought was some kind of deliverable bucking bronco like rodeo stall you find in Western bars). Hookers-galore seems pretty self explanatory.</p><p>Some have speculated that brianandbradley.com, meanwhile, is a spin on Florida law firm Morgan and Morgan, which despite where my Rockstar trained mind went, is unrelated to Red Dead's Arthur Morgan. Anyway, I had a quick google, and apparently historically Morgan and Morgan is considered a firm focused on personal injury, medical malpractice and class action lawsuits. Personal injury sounds like something many GTA characters will be dealing with, so that would fit.</p>
<p>Again, there is nothing official to say these apps and websites will definitely appear in GTA 6, but it doesn't seem unreasonable to imagine Jason and Lucia using an app to call a car to take them across Vice City.</p>

<p>The game was originally announced all the way back in 2018 alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/panzer_dragoon_remake">the remake of the first game</a>. The latter launched in 2020 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/panzer_dragoon_remake">wasn't quite the slam dunk</a> that many hoped it would be, with the sequel then languishing for several years.</p>
<p>It's back, though! And while no release date has been provided at the time of writing, we can at least seek comfort in the fact that, yes, it's real and it's coming. We can't imagine a release will be too far off, as Forever Entertainment has already confirmed that it'll be priced at <strong>$24.99</strong>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ygznum&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

Paste a map of Uppsala, Sweden to the bottom of your bathtub, fill your bath with extra-bony gumbo, then strap on a scuba mask and rhythmically stick your head beneath the surface, and you'll have something like the experience of playing Solbrand - "a slow burn pseudo-historical puzzle-adventure that'll take you back, down, and more than a little out there." For best results, conduct your bath tub experiment on a day so hot that the sun is literally shrieking. Don't have access to a bath, gumbo, a map of Uppsala, or a shrieking sun? Hey, no shame. That's what videogame trailers are for.

<p>
It's been a while since I've laid eyes on an interface 'em up as swish as this. The gist is that you're the "Spook" in charge of a small marine research vessel, sometime in the distant future. You're navigating a sunken city awash with "scientific breakthroughs and mad eccentrics, restless sea monsters and evil doctors, mythical poetry and long-forgotten gods".</p>
<p>You are here because you need to debunk a rumour about some kind of never-ending bike race, on behalf of "influential offshoots of the first champion", whose "spandex pockets run surprisingly deep". I enjoy this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZeWp1D8MlU">Belleville Rendevous</a>-esque daftness inasmuch as I can't figure out how it synchs with the more familiar cosmic horror devices above.
</p><p>
Based on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3772990/Solbrand/">the Steam description</a>, Solbrand plays a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/in-other-waters">In Other Waters</a> and, argh, this other underwater mech-based exploration sim with a top-down view that I can't remember - something-naut? Handles a bit like Steel Battalion? Please figure this out in the comments. Anyway, like that, but with sporadic first-person diving bits. 
</p>
<p>
By default, you'll drift across a mildewed expanse of streets and buildings such as the Imperfektum - a real-world student housing complex, apparently - and the Blackened Cathedral. The map nests within a sort of Clancified geode of light-up dials and buttons. You can initiate scan waves that ripple and cleanse the parchment, and adjust depth of field to bring objects into focus. When you want to investigate a location, you engage probe view to swoop in and behold it as a ghostly 3D expanse. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps you'll find a document or artefact of some kind, like a semaphore codex or an advert for velocipedes (primordial bikes). If you find human remains, you can "tune into" them to discourse with restless spirits. "Get to know their fates, make bonds, quibble about metre, catch them in lies, and tease out forgotten truths," the Steam page adds. 
</p>
<p>
You've also got a surface-level support crew of living human characters, including a Tinker, Worder and Shimmer. I like this game's language. Here is another excerpt from the lore: "Earth is sunk 'neath the boiling sea, and the sun has made many a mind unusual." That would be the sun that won't stop screaming.

Solbrand doesn't have a release date as yet - no big surprise, given that the project began in April this year. Development studio Dead People Dreaming are actually based in Uppsala, and consist mostly/entirely of Mattias Astenvald, former art director for Indiana Jones And The Great Circle.</p>
<p>This is Astenvald's debut indie release, and a project close to his heart. He himself was born in Skogstibble, a village outside Uppsala, and the game channels his enthusiasm for local history.
</p>
<p>
"There is an unending list of interesting, meaningful, funny, touching, or inspiring marks made by real people and events but that I believe very few know about," Astenvald <a href="https://deadpeopledreaming.com/">writes on the official site</a>." It strikes me how strange it is that in this digital age I can know so much about the goings-on across the globe, yet almost nothing of where I actually live -- despite there being so much that would evidently enrich a life!" The blog includes a chunk of locally-brewed runic verse. I fear I must interview this man. Amongst other things, I'm curious to learn about possible connections with the gaudier archaeology of the Indiana Jones game.
</p>
<p>Closing note: Solbrand reminds me somewhat of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stasis-bone-totem">Stasis: Bone Totem</a>, though it doesn't seem nearly as icky.</p>

Somewhat coincidentally, Tencent had actually reached out to see whether we be interested in discussing how the company is attempting to create original franchises with global appeal.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was a compelling pitch. Tencent, after all, has acquired and invested in a litany of major studios such as Riot Games, Supercell, Frontier Developments, Paradox Interactive, Ubisoft, Epic Games, Remedy Entertainment, and more—but the company is evidently keen to start producing more widely recognized titles in-house.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company's Tencent Games division, which shelters its publishing arm and internal studios, debuted a number of original projects at Gamescom itself including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Delta Force</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fate Trigger</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Honor of Kings: World</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Project Spectrum</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Tencent hopes those titles and others will coalesce to create an original catalog that allows its internal teams to work on projects they're furiously passionate about while catering to different player communities around the world.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-need-to-pick-our-battles-the-chinese-room-boss-says-cost-conscious-development-holds-the-key-to-the-future" target="_self" data-discover="true">'We need to pick our battles:' The Chinese Room boss says cost-conscious development is the future</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's an approach that sounds solid on paper, but how is Tencent actively working to turn that vision into reality—and, perhaps more pertinently in the wake of Sony's lawsuit, ensure its original franchises actually innovate?&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Tencent exec says internal studios don't harbor ambitions of creating&quot;derivative&quot; titles">Tencent exec says internal studios don't harbor ambitions of creating"derivative" titles</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Zhu, who oversees operations, strategy, and compliance across Tencent's global portfolio of studios, Tencent believes it is vital to match developers to projects they actually care about. "I think one of the things we look at a lot is, not just the IP itself, but more the talent within the studio," explains Zhu. "For us we ask 'what are they able to do and what are they passionate about?' One of the big things we look to do is make sure the studio and the scope and ambition of the project fits within he context of what [the team] is able to do.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Take studios like Sharkmob with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Exoborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It's a relatively newly-formed studio, but they have launched a game previously and so for us the ambition is quite big. Also, we believe the market is there for the taking—and they are passionate about making first-person shooters."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Passion, of course, is probably the one resource that remains abundant within the game industry. In an era of studio closures, financing woes, and widespread layoffs, converting passion into a tangible products that can deliver sustainable returns remains a huge challenge. To minimize the inherent risk that comes with making video games in 2025, Zhu explains Tencent has adopted a data-driven approach that attempts to break down market trends and player expectations.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/evil-empire-tells-devs-to-avoid-early-access-unless-their-project-is-90-percent-complete" target="_self" data-discover="true">Evil Empire tells devs to avoid early access unless their project is 90 percent complete</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We support [our teams] with data," he continues, explaining that Tencent pulls information from a "bunch of different places" including video game data platform Newzoo. "We consolidate all of that and then we internally have data scientists that work with us to do some predictive modelling to provide an understanding of where the market and trends are. We also have a group within Tencent that looks at game research. They are experts on games. They look at trends and what people are interested in. So, there's the game part, the data part, and then the audience part that we're building in as well—which is 'how do we engage with player bases earlier on to test an idea?'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zhu says connecting with audiences prematurely, however, can be "dangerous." Especially when a studio is trying to create something new. It might be safe to bring players into the loop early if you're looking to make inroads into an established genre or market, but if a studio is eager to stray from the well-trodden path that feedback might become less valuable.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/frost-giant-ceo-tim-morten-says-layoffs-are-possible-after-stormgate-underperforms" target="_self" data-discover="true">Frost Giant CEO Tim Morten says layoffs are possible after Stormgate underperforms</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On that note, we ask Zhu how Tencent distinguishes between inspiration and imitation? We acknowledge Tencent can't comment on Sony's ongoing lawsuit, but feel its important to understand how the company is working to marry its data-driven approach to franchise developments with its desire to create truly original titles that resonate.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think most of the developers that we work with are confident in their abilities," says Zhu in response. "They are always looking to create something new and different. Their first thoughts are not 'what is derivative?' In fact, I think some of the research that we give them covers [...] features or UI that are a bit more technical or specific, versus IP itself. I don't think we, and a lot of the studios that I work with personally, have that ambition of 'we want to create a derivative IP from something else.'"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Tencent believes mitigating risk is about &quot;matching the pitch to the market&quot;">Tencent believes mitigating risk is about "matching the pitch to the market"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Taking big swings also requires financial risk. Tencent evidently has plenty in the coffers, but Zhu explains the conglomerate is strict about moderating its investment level to ensure those risks feel sustainable. "When there are big challenges and unknowns on a project, we control our investment level. We answer all of the [pressing] questions first before going big," he continues, noting how Tencent works to garner a deep understanding of gameplay elements, narrative beats, and the potential for fun (which feels like the big one) before pulling the trigger.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zhu feels risk mitigation is also about "matching the pitch to the market." Certain genres, he explains, are always going to be more risky. "If you look at an open-world game, the investment into that before you even get to a minute of gameplay is going to be much bigger than if you were to look at a PvP shooter where you can quickly iterate," he adds. "The bar for investing into different types of games is going to be different, and the number of games we greenlight in certain genres versus others is going to be proportional to the risk level."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those projects that do make it through the production slalom at Tencent are expected to deliver. Zhu explains the ultimate goal is "evergreen" growth, and while that phrase will undoubtedly mean different things depending on the size and scale of individual titles, the company's aim is to cultivate franchises capable of matching its own long-term vision.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When you talk about growth [...] I think our ultimate goal is evergreen, right? You look at League of Legends, you look at PUBG Mobile, you look at even Fortnite. These are long-sustaining products that are always in the ecosystem," he says. "That doesn't mean it will limit growth, though, because that creates opportunities to build out other things. Look at League of Legends and how its gone into Arcane and other genres. I think that's one example, and we're definitely look to do the same thing."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for the projects that fail to reach those heights, Zhu claims any cancellation is the result of a thorough vetting process as opposed to knee-jerk reactions. "We take our time [when making those calls]. It's years. It depends on the game, depends on the team, and depends on the genre—but ultimately we give the teams the opportunity to go back out to the player base and test again, and repeatedly do that, to understand how we are course correcting towards that north star.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Some ideas you know early on. You're like 'this doesn't make sense' and you probably have to kill that idea and move onto the next one. That doesn't mean that dev teams don't have a ton of other things in the pipeline. Other games, you do have to make tough decisions because, even with games in development, because you feel they'll maybe never reach the level of ambition that we have. But for the most part we greenlight games because we truly believe in those teams."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer attended Gamescom 2025 via the Gamescom Media Ambassador Program, which covered flights and accommodation.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>
Team Cherry has revealed details of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s first patch, which will make the early game a little easier.
</p>
<p>
That will be welcome news to those playing the game, as it's proven to be extremely challenging. And not just for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-developers-are-trolling-players-with-a-seemingly-safe-haven">its trick bench</a>.
</p>
<p>
In particular, a couple of early bosses will have "slight difficulty reduction", on top of other enemies receiving damage reduction, and some increases in rosary rewards.

<p>Who's the boss of Uranus?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>We've spent a whole big chunk of time reviewing and playing through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> over the past month or so (let this writer tell you) and we thought — we genuinely absolutely thought — we'd seen it all.</p>
<p>However (and thanks to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2025/09/08/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-has-an-insane-secret-boss/">Forbes</a> for the hot tip), it seems one very, very, very...very well hidden boss escaped our metallic clutches on our playthrough. Yep. It's one of those ones where you wonder just how on earth anyone ever actually found it.</p>
<p>Indeed, by travelling eight hours — that's eight human hours in the real-life world, not video game hours, or even dog hours — straight upwards at Uranus (heh) Tower in the game's Forest region, you'll find another great big Arsenal (heh) battle on a platform that is in with a shout as the highest in any video game. Surely?</p>
<p>Now we haven't tried this yet, because it'll take ages, and we can just watch the video at the top of this very article. Honestly, having already beaten the biggest bosses in the main game, and upon hearing there's nothing special in terms of drops for your trouble on this one...well, how about <em>you</em> go fight it and report back? How does that sound?</p>
<p>If you're game, all you need do is head to the forest region, and take the door in the top right area that leads to an elevator for the tower. However, you're gonna have to manually fly up, which is the bit that takes so long. Once you've done the tricky bit (and those fine folk over at Forbes do suggest letting your Switch 2 go into sleep mode so you can have a break), you'll face off against the All-Seeing One.</p>
<p>Sounds like a right nosy arse, so best let them have it, all guns and/or laser swords blazing.</p>

            <p>Ok, that was quick. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has been out less than a week, and no less than two modders have already had a crack at getting multiplayer working in it, so you can take on those pesky bosses with some co-op moral support.</p>
<p>Maybe I shouldn't be surprised. After all, the Skong modding scene has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-early-mods-sand-off-its-more-annoying-edges-including-double-damage-and-distant-spawns">exploded out of the gates</a> with the same level of gusto folks have had for just playing the base version of the long-awaited metroidvania. Then again, it's one thing for folks to be putting out a bunch of smaller scale tweaks that can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-tips-and-tricks">help make things easier</a>, and another for them to turn a one player game into a more than one player game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These first two Skong multiplayer mods to hit the Nexus are the wonderfully named <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/73?tab=description">SilklessCoop</a> (if you get <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/while-you-wait-for-an-official-update-elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-a-two-player-co-op-mod">the reference</a>) by Nek5, and the more 'does what it says on the tin' <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/90?tab=description">Silksong Steam multiplayer mod</a> from 233xvx233. Both aim to accomplish the same thing: letting you and a friend load into the same version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> for double the Hornets, and at least be able to see each other as you work your way through the game.</p>
<p>As you can see below, both mods' authors have posted videos proving that you can use their works to do that at the very minimum, though it appears taking on bosses together might still be beyond the early proofs-of-concept. 233xvx233's work does promise "basic pvp" in its description, but the sole clip they've shared thus far doesn't feature any fighting.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Nek5 has shown off some battling, with a 'main' Hornet and their less saturated buddy jumping around near a spear-chucking foe, but I can't make out the second Hornet actually landing any hits or taking damage. Regardless, even being able to bounce around with your mate's pretty impressive at this stage.</p><p>In terms of setup, SilklessCoop relies on the <a href="https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/">BepInEx modding framework</a> and a server utility being <a href="https://github.com/nek5s/echoserver">hosted on GitHub</a>. Judging by the comments section, getting a server up and running for you and your friend can be as tricky a task as playing Skong, even with the description's instructions. Given that, I'd maybe steer clear for now or take it slow if you're a relative modding novice. </p>
<p>As you'd expect at this early stage, the modder also notes some teething issues, like disconnecting mid-session leaving "unmoving duplicates" of Hornet that only disappear when you chance scenes, plus some attack animations going a bit weird. They're also planning to flesh it out with better sync, an arrow to indicate when one of your duo wanders off sceen, and "public servers hosted by me". Though, they do describe that last one as "scary + expensive", which makes it sound like more of a maybe.</p>
<p>The instructions for 233xvx233's mod are a bit more brief and vague, with a BepInEx folder only mentioned in passing amid some game file messing around and the pinging up of an interface that'll allow folks with an official Steam copy of Skong to set up and join a session together.</p>
<p>There's a good chance the folks behind <a href="https://github.com/Extremelyd1/HKMP">the original Hollow Knight's multiplayer mod</a> might be working on their own more advanced version of co-op Skong, but until then it's cool to see other modders experimenting early doors.</p>
