                <p>In honor of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/">Minecraft's </a>15th anniversary, Mojang <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/the-future-of-minecrafts-development" rel="nofollow ">released a blog post</a> revealing how the studio plans to support the game in the future. This includes bringing in a new PlayStation 5 version, regularly adding new content for players, the fate of the mob vote, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Although the post didn't go into too much detail, it did mention that the studio is actively working on bringing a "version of Minecraft" to the PlayStation 5. It's also worth pointing out that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-is-finally-getting-a-native-ps5-version-today-and-heres-how-to-try-it/1100-6524436/">PS5 users can play the native current-gen version of the game</a>, but to do so, they must go into the game setting and select "Preview" to test it out.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In addition to the PS5 version of the game, Mojang ensured fans that the studio plans on "releasing a number of free game drops throughout the year," as opposed to the one free update players would get during the summer. However, not all of them will be as big as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-1-21-update-officially-named-tricky-trials-adds-a-new-weapon/1100-6523003/">Tricky Trials update</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The studio revealed that it plans to retire the Mob vote, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-minecraft-community-is-boycotting-this-years-mob-vote/1100-6518305/">which has been controversial within the Minecraft community for some time</a>. Instead of having the yearly vote as it used to, Minecraft Live will now be "a more focused broadcast, and it will happen twice per year."</p><p dir="ltr">Just the other day, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-movies-first-trailer-has-arrived-and-its-incredible/1100-6526254/">Minecraft movie trailer was revealed</a>. On top of showing off the cast, it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/a-minecraft-movie-trailer-breakdown-easter-eggs-game-references-story-details-piglins-and-more/2900-5751/">riddled with various Easter eggs from the game</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">With the next phase of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>, Bungie is looking to make its flagship MMO a little easier to understand, making big changes to how you find and play its activities and adding additional levels of rewards to make it worth playing and replaying them.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie dropped details about how it will be altering Destiny 2 in a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/new_frontiers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">series of blog posts</a> that gave an overview of major changes coming in 2025 with Codename: Frontiers, the next "multi-year saga" for the game. The adjustments are pretty widespread, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-is-changing-destiny-2-approach-to-content-as-it-begins-a-new-multi-year-saga/1100-6526354/" data-ref-id="1100-6526354">starting with a move to two "medium-sized" yearly expansions</a> instead of one, which appear to be paid content, alongside four "major updates" throughout the year, which will be free.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside those changes in how new content will be released, Bungie is making adjustments to the core activities of Destiny 2 in ways that should help keep them fresher and more interesting for players to return to over and over again. The first stop on that journey is the Portal, a new menu screen that will lay out more clearly which activities are which, while also allowing you to adjust their challenge level and see what rewards they offer.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Destination map, also called the Director, is Destiny’s venerable activity browsing and selection screen. Over the years it has grown to be very unwieldy, making it harder to find specifically what’s current and worthwhile to play, and requiring ever more expert knowledge to navigate to find what you are looking for," Bungie wrote in its Portal-focused blog post.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364036-portal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364036" data-ratio="0.5524948024948" data-width="1924" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364036-portal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364036"></a><figcaption>A work-in-progress mockup of the Portal menu.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364036-portal.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Portal screen divides activities into several different categories, and Bungie hinted at some new activities that will fill out a few of those new lists. Some categories are familiar: Fireteam Ops are three-player matchmade activities that will include things like Strikes, Onslaught, and The Coil, while Pinnacle Ops are tougher three-player matchmade game modes, including dungeons and Onslaught runs through its 50 levels of horde-defense gameplay. New categories, include Solo Ops, activities that support 1-3 players and which Bungie says will include new activities geared at Guardians who are playing alone, and Flashpoint Ops, which are larger six-player activities. Flashpoints will also see new activities created for the list, and can include Offensives, which are larger battles that have appeared as seasonal activities over the years.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's Bungie's rundown of the Portal's six categories:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Solo Ops: 1-3 player activities requiring very low time or social commitments. These activities are designed for solo players, yet are still fun with a fireteam, and are easy to pick up and play for a quick session. Solo Ops will also feature a new activity type which will get a deep dive soon.</li></ul><ul><li dir="ltr">Fireteam Ops: Three-player activities for matchmade or premade groups. Designed for fireteams with more cooperation and coordination, these will feature activities like Strikes, Onslaught, The Coil, and new types in the future.</li></ul><ul><li dir="ltr">Flashpoint Ops: Six-player activities for matchmade or premade groups. Planned for a future Season, this category will be introduced later next year. It will feature more chaotic six-player combat like Offensives.</li></ul><ul><li dir="ltr">Pinnacle Ops: Three-player activities featuring some more challenging content, including Dungeons, Exotic missions, and full-length Onslaughts. Pinnacle Ops have an exclusive reward pool to claim, but success is not guaranteed.</li></ul><ul><li dir="ltr">Crucible: A selection of core Crucible playlists for solo players and fireteams, providing an opportunity to test your mettle against other Guardians. An exclusive reward pool is available to claim, with the same depth of tier as other Categories.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The major focus of the Portal is to make it easier to find relevant content quickly, so it'll include things like the latest expansion and whatever major update activities are freshest, so you'll have a clearer jumping-in point whenever you pick up the game. You'll also find things like a selection of bounties and seasonal rewards on the Portal screen, with the idea being to lessen the amount of time you need to spend completing "chores" like running around the Tower, talking to different vendors, before you can actually start playing an activity.</p><p dir="ltr">Some content, like raids, will stay separate from the Portal, and it sounds like how you approach them probably won't change much. You'll also have expansion or more recent update content set to its own node so it's easy to find. And in each category, some activities will dish out bonus rewards, like specific guns, armor with particular stat focuses, or high-level upgrade materials, if you play them, encouraging players to jump into everything Destiny 2 offers. The activities that give out bonus rewards will change each day, Bungie writes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364038-challengecustomization1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364038" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364038-challengecustomization1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364038"></a><figcaption>A mockup of the challenge customization menu in the Portal.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364038-challengecustomization1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In addition to the streamlined aspect of the Portal menu, Bungie is also introducing major changes to Destiny 2's core activities to make them more engaging. For example, Strikes currently offer multiple difficulty settings and some opportunities to earn different rewards based on the difficulty you set. You'll find even more granular menus on the Portal, where you can set the base difficulty, various modifiers or changes to enemy types and abilities, and more--all with an eye of allowing you to increase the challenge of a Strike and make it fresher.</p><p dir="ltr">How those changes will affect matchmaking sounds like it might be a bit of a pain, though. Matchmaking will include several preset difficulties, but if you want to make finer adjustments to the challenge, you'll need to bring a team of your own. Bungie write that relatively new Fireteam Finder, Destiny 2's internal "looking for group" feature, should help pick up some of the slack.</p><p dir="ltr">Your rewards for those changed activities are then calculated through your performance. You'll get a team score, which might be similar to systems like your Nightfall score in some cases, but which won't have you competing against your team. Added to that will be an individual score based on your own performance. Together, that'll dictate your reward score, which then determines what kinds of drops you get.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364039-swordy_tier5_tooltipdetails.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364039" data-ratio="0.45154962730483" data-width="2549" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364039-swordy_tier5_tooltipdetails.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364039"></a><figcaption>A mockup of a new tiered Legendary weapon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364039-swordy_tier5_tooltipdetails.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The rewards themselves will also see adjusting. Legendary weapons will offer more tiers, similar to the way you can currently get either base versions or Adept versions of some weapons. Right now, Adepts offer some stat bonuses and specialized perks that make them worth chasing, and you can expect multiple tiers of Legendary guns that add more possibilities and encourage you to play activities at higher difficulties. Other reward possibilities include armor that's tuned toward specific stats.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, weapons and armor for the current season in which you're playing will be marked with a visual flair, making it clear that those items are New Gear. The marking is meant to show what loot is current in the game, taking advantage of things like the season's Artifact mods and bonuses, and it sounds like "old gear" won't do that, making it worthwhile to chase whatever loot is current to the season you're playing. Bungie clarified that New Gear won't replace any older weapons or armor, so it sounds like this stuff will just be part of whatever is happening currently in the game, and the system will make it easier to identify so you can create builds and choose weapons that take advantage of the current season.</p><p dir="ltr">For the most part, Bungie's changes sound like they're meant to shore up the more confusing elements of the game, particularly for new or returning players who might struggle to find which activities are current and what they should be focusing on, or what rewards they need to chase to improve their characters. Taken together, though, they may well greatly shake up the experience of Destiny 2, especially when taken alongside the new approach to expansions that sounds like it'll focus on non-linear stories and experiences that could mix new gameplay genres into Destiny 2, like roguelikes, metroidvanias, or survival games.</p>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When it comes to what these new mini-expansions will look like, game director Tyson Green said Bungie is looking to move away from the existing model of a story campaign that players quickly exhaust and move on from in favor of something less linear, more repayable, and that brings some mystery back to the <em>Destiny </em>universe. “We are actively prototyping non-linear campaigns, exploration experiences similar to the Dreaming City or Metroidvanias, and even more unusual formats like roguelikes or survival shooters,” he wrote. “Each expansion will present a new opportunity to try something different.”</p><p>With that in mind, the studio is referring to the first of these new expansions, <em>Apollo</em>, as a “nonlinear character-driven adventure.” While <em>The Final Shape</em> concluded players’ 10-year struggle against The Darkness and eventual face-off against The Witness, the next era of the game, codenamed <em>Frontiers</em>, will focus on new threats. ”This next saga is also based around a core theme, much like Light and Darkness did,” wrote narrative director Alison Lührs. “It will introduce plenty of new characters, factions, twists, and more. There’s a lot more here we will say eventually, but we don’t want to spoil the journey for you. This will be a multiyear journey, one we can’t wait to take you on.”</p><p>It sounds like what <em>Destiny</em> has needed for a while, and a smart way to keep the game more engaging without burning through ever ore resources and content. But the proof will be in how it’s executed, and whether the more modular stories feel meaningful and rewarding or just another way to stretch out the player grind between updates. <em>Destiny 2</em> is getting major overhauls in three other areas as well, including a massive change to how loot works.</p><figure id="" data-id="3f7d0bc568ff4b06cb1b815d6dffe49b" data-recommend-id="image://3f7d0bc568ff4b06cb1b815d6dffe49b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1924" data-height="1063" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bungie shows a new Portal screen for Destiny 2" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bungie shows a new Portal screen for Destiny 2" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>A mockup shows what the Portal screen might look like next year in Destiny 2.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3f7d0bc568ff4b06cb1b815d6dffe49b" data-recommend-id="image://3f7d0bc568ff4b06cb1b815d6dffe49b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1924" data-height="1063" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bungie shows a new Portal screen for Destiny 2" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The first is the cosmic map players have traditionally launched activities from called the Director. It will be superseded by a one-screen menu <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/theportal&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/theportal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called the Portal</a></span> that is aimed at making it easier for players to understand what activities they need to complete next and what rewards they get for doing so. It seems like a smart idea to help onboard new players, something <em>Destiny 2</em> is uniquely bad at, though I’m unclear on whether the original map is going away or players will effectively just have a second screen to contend with. </p><h2 id="h6230"><a id=""></a><em>Destiny 2</em> is getting rarer forms of loot</h2><p>Another big shakeup is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/coregame_activities&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/coregame_activities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coming for  Core Game activities</a></span>. Instead of having a very basic set of difficulties with slightly better rewards for each, a new system will let players customize the challenge and modifiers for each PVE activity in the game. The idea is to mix things up more and make loot feel more rewarding the higher up the challenge ladder you go. The hope is players will experiment more with different playstyles and buildcrafting, as well as calibrate the difficulty of an activity more closely to what is right for them. </p><figure id="" data-id="717dca4306bdfbde7ae8c63a6e061ab9" data-recommend-id="image://717dca4306bdfbde7ae8c63a6e061ab9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2549" data-height="1151" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a stat menu for weapons.

The bulk of the loot chase in recent years has resolved around finding weapons with “god rolls,” sets of perks that are largely considered the best for that particular piece of gear. Moving forward, loot will instead drop across various tiers, with higher-tier, rarer loot having higher stats, enhanced perks, and other bonuses that distinguish them from “standard” versions of that weapon. “The baseline tier of Legendary weapons and armor will be equivalent to current day Legendaries, with higher tiers being generally equivalent to Adept weapons in terms of upgrade,” the development team wrote.</p><p>The devil with<em> Destiny </em>is always in the details, however, and a big part of whether these changes work or not is how grindy they end up feeling and whether the time players put into chasing particular high-tier loot feels worth it or not. I can imagine a system where it feels great to slowly get better and better at a specific activity, overcoming various challenge modifiers and increasing the quality of rewards until you finally get that coveted highest-tier drop for the gun you love and it feeling great. I can also imagine a version where, unless you play dozens of hours a week, you never get to see the good stuff and none of this means anything for you. </p><p>Things that Bungie didn’t talk much about in today’s big future of<em> Destiny 2</em> preview are things like power leveling, drop rate RNG, or onboarding new players when it comes to all of the story content that explains the game’s world but which has disappeared over the years. PVP modes like Crucible and Gambit also didn’t get much attention, with their status likely to get previewed at a later date. But for now the message from Bungie was clear: <em>Destiny 2</em> isn’t going anywhere, and in fact the studio is looking to make the future of it potentially more interesting, approachable, and sustainable than at any time in the recent past. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/carmen-sandiego-game-announced-for-netflix-steam-playstation-xbox-and-nintendo-switch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Where in the world is...oh, she's right here on Netflix.</h2></div><section><p>Gameloft and HarperCollins Productions have announced Carmen Sandiego, a new single-player puzzle-adventure game relaunch of the popular edutainment hit from the 1980's and 1990's. This one will be based on the original 1980's IP (though it visually resembles the recent Netflix animated series that ran from 2019-2021 – and on a related note, the publishers note that a live-action Carmen Sandiego movie is also in the works at Netflix), and it will launch first on Netflix in Q1 of 2025, and will follow later in the same quarter for PC (via Steam), PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. Gameloft and HarperCollins say there will be a story-driven campaign and "classic modes" (more on that below). Check out the first trailer above and the first screenshots in the image gallery below.</p><p>You'll get to play as Carmen Sandiego in this game, complete with espionage and using high-tech gadgets in the effort to defeat the evil VILE. "In this game, you’re no longer chasing Carmen—you are Carmen," the publishers told us. "The shift from being the pursuer to being Carmen herself offers a fresh take on the gameplay, allowing players to fully engage with her world of espionage and globe-trotting adventure. The other character you see at the start of the trailer is 'Player' from the Netflix Series, who is also a reference to the unseen live-action figure from the 1994 animated series Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego? Player now serves as Carmen's sidekick. This means you experience the game entirely from Carmen's perspective, with Player assisting you in navigating missions, solving puzzles, and outsmarting VILE operatives." </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Carmen Sandiego - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>We asked about core gameplay and potential Easter eggs, and the team told us, "It features all of the investigative fun of the original core game loop (collecting clues &amp; tracking VILE operatives around the world) combined with brand new on the ground immersive exploration of cities," they told us. "We have also included a classic mode called 'The Acme Files,' which is a heartfelt tribute to the Carmen Sandiego games of the '80s. Nostalgic players as well as fans of the Netflix series will also find hidden Easter eggs throughout the game’s locations—little surprises we are excited for the community to discover!"</p><p>Stay tuned for more on the new Carmen Sandiego game as its Q1 2025 release date gets closer.</p><p><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our occasional interview show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <p>
A month after Bungie acknowledged player "uncertainty surrounding the future of Destiny" following mass layoffs at the studio, the developer has announced "major changes for the future" of its live-service shooter, which will now receive multiple paid expansions a year.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s overhauled release model, announced to coincide with the series' tenth anniversary, will see two "medium-sized" paid expansions release annually, alongside four "major" free content updates. All this will form a "new multi-year saga" (the first since Destiny 2's Light and Darkness saga concluded with its The Final Shape expansion earlier this year) promising new characters, factions, twists, and more.
</p>
<p>
Things kick off next summer with Destiny 2's first new expansion, Codename: Apollo, described as a "non-linear character-driven adventure". Elaborating on Bungie's new "non-linear" direction in a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/new_frontiers">blog post accompanying today's news</a>, game director Tyson Green explained the studio believes Destiny 2 has become "too rigid", and that its annual expansions "have started to feel too formulaic and are over too quickly with little replay value".
</p>

<p>
As such, Bungie is currently exploring non-linear campaigns "similar to the Dreaming City or Metroidvanias, and even more unusual formats like roguelikes or survival shooters". Green says Destiny 2's new expansion plans give the team a "new opportunity to try something different", although he insists, "departing from one-shot campaigns doesn't mean we are turning away from great story telling".
</p>
<p>
Starting with Codename: Apollo, each new Destiny 2 expansion will mark the start of a new season, arriving alongside a "major" free Episode update for all players. A second Episode will arrive three months later as part of the current season before everything changes with the next expansion's release.

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
Each Episode will "refresh the core game with new and reprised content", introducing new activities (such as Strikes, Exotic missions, or new modes like Onslaught), new rewards, weekly events, features, and combat meta and balance changes. Green teases players can expect an overhauled activity UI as part of plans to improve approachability, as well as a "greatly improved" Challenge Customisation system, and new rewards including higher tiers of legendary gear. More will be shared in developer Deep Dives due in the "coming months."
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny_10_anniversary">second blog post focusing on Destiny's 10th anniversary celebrations</a>, Bungie unveiled a new set of Destiny 2 armour for each class inspired by the series' original concept art, plus new challenges, starting today, offering the Legend title and seal as rewards. Additionally, Cayde 6's Hand Cannon is being turned into a real-life Nerf gun, for fans of high-speed sponge violence.
</p>
<p>
Today's news - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2s-post-final-shape-future-includes-vampire-hunting-and-the-dreadnaught">second revised release model</a> Bungie has announced for Destiny 2 in less than three months - follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-acknowledges-uncertainty-surrounding-the-future-of-destiny-following-layoffs">assurances to players</a> back in August that despite "recent changes", the studio remained "committed to Destiny, to supporting our community with transparency, and to delivering regular updates about the game." Those "changes" were, of course, an allusion to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">sweeping layoffs</a> that saw 220 Bungie staff lose their jobs back in July, just nine months after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">100 employees were laid off</a> at the studio.
</p>
<p>
 GameFile journalist Stephen Totilo later reported July's layoffs had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-leadership-reportedly-overstated-studios-financial-prospects-to-sony-leading-to-need-for-layoffs">long been planned</a>, and "couldn't be avoided" even if this year's Final Shape expansion had seen "blockbuster performance". Bungie management was said to have concluded last year - amid poor sales and a dwindling Destiny 2 player base - it would need to "make deep cuts to show Sony's executives that it was taking its finances seriously", with the studio's autonomy - and management jobs - seemingly on the line if it failed to meet its targets. July's layoffs were met with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inexcusable-current-and-former-bungie-employees-react-to-sweeping-layoffs">calls for Bungie CEO Pete Parsons to resign</a>.
</p>
<p>
 Since then, Bloomberg has reported Destiny spin-off Payback is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-destiny-project-payback-no-longer-happening-senior-execs-depart">no longer in development</a>.

The film sees the return of Michael Keaton as the ghost with the most and Winona Ryder as Lydia. It also stars Jenna Ortega as Lydia’s daughter who ends up following in her mother’s footsteps and getting involved with Beetlejuice. And it seems a lot of people were very excited to watch this legacy sequel, as the movie is making bank at the box office. <br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-2-opening-day-1236135898/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-2-opening-day-1236135898/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In its opening weekend</a></span>, <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> brought in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt2049403/?ref_=bo_se_r_1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt2049403/?ref_=bo_se_r_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$145.4 million globally</a></span>, with $110 million of that coming just from the United States.

The sequels’ “definitive editions” were added new story and characters interwoven into the original plot, requiring you to rebuy and replay the game to see what was new.

But as a coda to <em>Persona 3</em>, I’m still drawn in by how <em>The Answer</em> unpacks the less glamorous realities of what the original game had to say. Spoilers for the original game follow.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h3164"><a id=""></a><strong>How do you follow up an ending as good as <em>Persona 3</em>’s?</strong></h2><p><em>The Answer </em>begins weeks after the end of <em>Persona 3</em>, during which the protagonist, Makoto Yuki, gave his life to defeat Nyx, a malevolent entity hellbent on destroying the planet. The epilogue starts fairly quiet, as the demon-fighting high school students of the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad are barely able to look at each other. They turn in their Persona-summoning tools, grieving not only the loss of their leader and friend but also the time they spent with one another in the Iwatodai Dormitory in the past year.</p><figure id="" data-id="a349d61a4f20ab61e650d4119839bd34" data-recommend-id="image://a349d61a4f20ab61e650d4119839bd34" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Akihiko and Ken stand ready for battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Akihiko and Ken stand ready for battle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a349d61a4f20ab61e650d4119839bd34" data-recommend-id="image://a349d61a4f20ab61e650d4119839bd34" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Akihiko and Ken stand ready for battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The original ending of <em>Persona 3 </em>is so spectacular because it ends with a group of friends joyfully coming together, proclaiming that their love for each other has given them each purpose throughout their journey, all while their leader slowly falls into a deep sleep never to wake up again. It loudly declares that human connection makes life worth living while underlying its impermanence, as the centerpiece that ties them all together is drifting away before their eyes. On its own, it’s a perfect encapsulation of everything <em>Persona 3</em> has to say, but one naturally wonders how a group so invigorated would react to such a devastating blow. <em>The Answer </em>thoughtfully explores this question and is careful not to undo something that was already perfect.<br></p><p>Aigis, the Persona-using android of the group, was the last person to speak to Makoto before his passing, and she is taking things particularly hard. She thought she’d found a reason to live in protecting their team leader, and now that he’s gone, she’s trying to find a reason to keep living with all these human emotions she’s taken on. She’s the star of <em>The Answer</em>, but everyone in SEES is processing this differently. While some are trying to find reasons to bring the group together as the school year ends, others are actively avoiding the friends they’ve made so they don’t have to face the pain of having lost another piece of their collective puzzle. But circumstance brings these teens together and forces them to face each other and their grief once more.</p><p>SEES finds themselves in a time loop within their dorm as a new, shadow-infested dungeon opens up below the building. The phenomenon is similar to the base game’s Dark Hour, in which the real world is overtaken by a paranormal horde of demons. They can’t leave the boundaries of their old home until they face the horrors below, now with the help of a new android named Metis claiming to be Aigis’ sister. The time loop mostly gives a reason for <em>The Answer </em>to boil down the <em>Persona </em>formula to its barest core parts, shaving off the life simulation and time management elements for a much more streamlined story. But ironically, the time loop is an appropriate framing considering how repetitive and grindy <em>The Answer </em>feels compared to the main game.</p><figure id="" data-id="4dc809b5a34bcd6483742c6af37337f2" data-recommend-id="image://4dc809b5a34bcd6483742c6af37337f2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Aigis casts an ice spell on a shadow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aigis casts an ice spell on a shadow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4dc809b5a34bcd6483742c6af37337f2" data-recommend-id="image://4dc809b5a34bcd6483742c6af37337f2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Aigis casts an ice spell on a shadow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Aigis and company spend most of <em>The Answer </em>going through procedurally generated dungeons fighting high-level shadows. As a combat skill check, <em>The Answer </em>is a solid, often challenging, occasionally monotonous test of your understanding of <em>Persona 3</em>’s systems. While you can technically access <em>The Answer </em>without a save file from the base game, it assumes you have knowledge not only of the story of <em>Persona 3</em>, but also the intricacies of its turn-based battles. Aigis gains Makoto’s ability to collect and summon multiple Persona, but you’re starting from scratch with her. Without the social links and other real-world elements to fall back on, <em>The Answer </em>is all dungeon crawling and shadow slaying.<br></p><p>If, over the years, that part of <em>Persona </em>has taken a back seat for you compared to the social elements, <em>The Answer </em>may not scratch an itch for you. Its dungeons are much more repetitive than the base game’s, but it is a concentrated, challenging combat check that will appeal to those who like to get their hands dirty building an arsenal of demons to fight with. Though the difficulty spike in the eleventh hour is just as jarring now as it was in the original, <em>Reload</em>’s quality-of-life improvements do make it at least more tolerable this time around. That isn’t to say that there aren’t still great character moments to be found between dungeons, however, and despite my grievances with <em>The Answer</em>’s structure, I was truly enthralled by the story building between the margins.</p><p>At the end of each dungeon, one of the members of SEES is confronted with a moment from their past. For some, this is recent, with a few of these flashbacks occurring during <em>Persona 3</em> proper. For others, it’s years before meeting their teammates. These memories are put on display for all to see, and in most cases, it’s from a painful time in their lives. The members of SEES have all lived through tragedy, and that pain has brought them into this line of demon-hunting extracurricular activities.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="2b11db18276eb342ca34de57faea795d" data-recommend-id="image://2b11db18276eb342ca34de57faea795d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A young Akihiko says &quot;Sorry, but I don't see any reason to attend a school that places second,&quot; to a scout." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A young Akihiko says &quot;Sorry, but I don't see any reason to attend a school that places second,&quot; to a scout." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2b11db18276eb342ca34de57faea795d" data-recommend-id="image://2b11db18276eb342ca34de57faea795d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A young Akihiko says &quot;Sorry, but I don't see any reason to attend a school that places second,&quot; to a scout." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Persona 3 </em>posits that human connection helps us carry our burdens, but throughout each of these memories, we see how those same bonds open us up to more hardship. Before any of them had even met one another, most of the members of SEES had either lost someone important to them, whether it was a parent or a sibling, or they felt like they had someone to cherish in the first place. And then they faced more loss throughout their quest to stop the Dark Hour as the broody loner Shinji died protecting one of their own. Then, when all was said and done, they saved the world, but at the cost of their leader. How many times do these kids have to lose someone just to keep on living?<br></p><p>Well, the hard truth is, they will continue to lose people. Death is a natural fact of life, and every time that you’re reminded of that, it never stops hurting. <em>Persona 3</em>’s entire deal is that even though death comes for us all, life has meaning because we find people who make even the hardest day worth living through. <em>The Answer </em>is <em>Persona 3</em> having to push its team to its limit and put that belief into practice.</p><h2 id="h3165"><a id=""></a><strong><em>The Answer</em> can be frustrating, but its message is worth the grind</strong></h2><p>There’s a (compelling) argument to be made that <em>Persona 3 </em>didn’t need an epilogue. It’s still fascinating to look back on the original game’s ending and find <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/psp/971508-shin-megami-tensei-persona-3-portable/answers/342360-did-mc-die&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/psp/971508-shin-megami-tensei-persona-3-portable/answers/342360-did-mc-die" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forum threads</a></span> of people trying to figure out what happened before <em>The Answer </em>wrote it in stone. But after the original strongly asserted that even in the face of death our bonds to one another give life meaning, it’s perhaps necessary for <em>The Answer </em>to show the work.</p><p>If you’ve lost someone important to you, whether through death or circumstance, you know that grief is not linear. We learn lessons each time it happens, but it doesn’t take away the new pain we feel when we lose someone once more. Shinji’s death could not prepare SEES for Makoto’s just as every other person they lost could not prepare them for the new, altogether different pain they’d feel each time someone slipped through their fingers into whatever comes next. No matter how many times you accept that loss is just part of life, you fall into the same stages of denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. <em>The Answer </em>gives <em>Persona 3</em>’s cast and the player some grace to feel these emotions, dive into the ugliness of the worst of them, and come back on the other side ready to heal and move forward.<br></p><p>Structurally, <em>The Answer </em>is an often frustrating epilogue that shaves off some of the best parts of <em>Persona </em>games. Thankfully, <em>Reload</em>’s quality-of-life updates make the grind more tolerable and the remake adds enough small social elements like reading books and watching movies with your friends that it doesn’t feel like it’s all business. But as a meditation on grief, it feels like a kindness afforded to characters who once had to rile in the ambiguity of the original ending. It would have been easy for <em>Persona 3 </em>to end on a nihilistic note, showing the entire group fall apart without their leader and denying all the lessons they learned. But grief never really goes away. We just learn to help each other live with it a little more each day.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Sonic Squishmallow is on sale for only $15 at Amazon, down from $25.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4364020-this-is-fine.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364020" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4364020-this-is-fine.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364020"></a><figcaption>You can't outrun our hugs, Sonic.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4364020-this-is-fine.jpg"></figure><p>Returning to Tubbz, the company has produced quite a few Sonic duckies that are designed for bathtub sessions.

                <p dir="ltr">It's funny to think that, despite the cutesy aesthetics and family-friendly appeal, the two longest-running multiplayer Mario franchises seem specifically designed to promote conflict amongst groups of friends. From blue shells to King Boos, Mario Kart and Mario Party have spent decades seemingly committed to fostering as much division among their players as possible--my wife once exclaimed, "I do not love you" when I beat her to the finish line of a flagpole minigame in 2018's Super Mario Party. We are, as of the time of writing, still together.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-party-jamboree/" data-ref-id="5000-632917">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>--Nintendo's latest attempt to drive families apart through play--is the third Mario Party game to release on Nintendo Switch, and the first to combine both traditional and motion controls. At a preview event last month, the key word Nintendo used was "more"--more boards, more minigames, more characters, more modes--and as such, there are more ways to drive your loved ones up the wall, too.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Super Mario Party Jamboree Offers Many More Ways To Fall Out With Your Friends</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The nastiest of these is the new Star Steal Trap, an item that turns any chosen space on the board into a veritable landmine, stealing a Star from any player who happens to be unfortunate enough to stop there. This is Mario Party in a nutshell--a game that is, at any given time, simultaneously exhilarating and cruel, glorious and devastating, all at the mercy of a dice roll.</p><p dir="ltr">The main offering in Super Mario Party Jamboree is, of course, Mario Party mode. The long-established format of board-game traversal interspersed with minigames remains more or less unchanged from the original offering on the N64 some 26(!) years ago. This time around there are seven boards to choose from, including two returning favorites: Mario's Rainbow Castle from Mario Party and Western Land from Mario Party 2.</p><p dir="ltr">In our demo, we played around 30 minutes (or five rounds) of Mario Party mode on Mega Wiggler's Tree Party, a new forest-themed board, with one route taking players across a giant sleeping Wiggler at its center. Landing on an Event Space rings a bell that briefly wakes Wiggler from his slumber, sending him charging around in a circle and changing the layout of the board. Items such as special dice and warp pipes return, alongside some new additions, but it's essentially classic Mario Party as you know and love/hate it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4364022-mario2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4364022" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1552" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4364022-mario2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4364022"></a><figcaption>Plenty of fan-favorite maps make their return.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4364022-mario2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Also returning is a dedicated minigame mode, this time called Minigame Bay to match Jamboree's island theme. Here, players can take on various combinations of minigame challenges and playlists, as well as enjoy a Free Play mode for people who want to pick and choose their favorites from the collection of new and returning minigames.</p><p dir="ltr">Returning from Mario Party Superstars is a Daily Challenge mode, which collects three minigames in a playlist centered around a theme--we played Minigame Munchies, featuring three food-based minigames, and Master Strategist, made up of games that encouraged tactical thinking. Completing the challenges earned some kind of currency or score called Party Points, but it's unclear from our preview what these points are used for.</p><p dir="ltr">Jamboree also adds two new entries to its suite of modes: Koopathlon and Bowser Kaboom Squad. Though it's possible to play these modes with CPU opponents, they are clearly designed with online play in mind, though this also means only one player can play per console.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4364023-mario3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4364023" data-ratio="0.56258064516129" data-width="1550" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4364023-mario3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4364023"></a><figcaption>Over 110 minigames are playable.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4364023-mario3.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Koopathlon sees 20 players competing to earn coins in minigames to propel their character around a board, with the novel touch that the board progression and minigame play happen simultaneously via a split-screen layout. Though this feels a bit cluttered on-screen, the board essentially acts as a live leaderboard of players ranked by their coin-collecting prowess and can largely be ignored. The overall impression is of a kind of Fall Guys-esque battle royale game shot through a Mario Party lens, though from what I saw, no one gets eliminated, and players are only ever competing indirectly.</p><p dir="ltr">Koopathlon's minigames are specifically designed for that mode and feel a bit slight in comparison to the Mario Party suite of minigames--the three we played included using cannons to collect coins, hopping over spiked poles, and a Temple Run-esque endless runner. After three of these minigames, a special Bowser-themed minigame begins, featuring all 20 players, offering a prize item for victors and a penalty to their board position for losers. The Bowser minigame we played involved carefully jumping over fireballs and, once again, felt slight, though there was at least some chaotic fun in watching all 20 players on-screen at once.</p><p dir="ltr">Much stranger is Bowser Kaboom Squad, where eight players work cooperatively to collect bombs and load a cannon, all while avoiding a kaiju-sized Impostor Bowser. After the cannon is loaded, it blasts Bowser and knocks a chunk off his health bar, and players have five 90-second rounds to defeat him. Every 90 seconds, a cooperative minigame offers up the chance to gain items to help the group.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4364024-screenshot2024-09-09095650.png" data-ref-id="1300-4364024" data-ratio="0.56245954692557" data-width="1545" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4364024-screenshot2024-09-09095650.png" data-ref-id="1300-4364024"></a><figcaption>They are here to observe the mayhem between friends.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4364024-screenshot2024-09-09095650.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">It is an utterly bizarre mode that feels half-baked, with a selection of prefab-looking maps and uncharacteristically clunky movement for a Nintendo game. It's hard to imagine Bowser Kaboom Squad diverting anyone's attention from the other modes for very long.</p><p dir="ltr">Though, in one sense, it's admirable that Nintendo keeps adding novel modes to the Mario Party franchise, it's difficult to understand the value of single-player-per-console modes like Koopathlon and Bowser Kaboom Squad in a Mario Party game. It's hard to escape the feeling that the core appeal of Super Mario Party Jamboree is in competing with, and screwing over, your friends, preferably when they're sitting in the same room.</p><p dir="ltr">Based on this preview, Super Mario Party Jamboree won't change anybody's mind about the franchise. With the right crowd, however, it's as much fun as Mario Party has ever been, and with seven boards, 20 characters, and over 110 minigames, it looks set to be the most Mario Party for your money on the Switch to date.</p><p dir="ltr">Super Mario Party Jamboree launches for Nintendo Switch on October 17.</p>

                <p>Carmen Sandiego is back in her first game since 2015's Carmen Sandiego Returns. For the first time in franchise history, you'll play as the super thief, instead of those pursuing her, in a reimagined new game simply called Carmen Sandiego.</p><p>However, Sandiego has given up a life of crime and works as a counter-thief, tracking down V.I.L.E. operatives across the globe. The game takes style and plot cues from the Netflix animated show, which started in 2019.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dtqooGHYeQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9dtqooGHYeQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As for the gameplay, you'll control Sandiego herself, utilizing gadgets like a hang-glider and grappling hook to get around. Carmen Sandiego appears to have a more 3D-platformer flavor than the original games. The trailer shows Sandiego pickpocketing a man, so there may be some stealth elements. As you obtain clues and information, you can identify and capture V.I.L.E. operatives.</p><p>How much "edutainment" will be a part of the game remains to be seen. However, you will explore many locations across the world. Confirmed locals include Iceland, Ghana, Egypt, India, Japan, and Australia.</p><p>Carmen Sandiego has no release date yet--just a window of Q1 2025. When it drops, it will release on PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Playstation, and mobile. It will be included on the Netflix app. You can wishlist the game now.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">After 10 years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> will no longer see one big expansion per year, nor the seasonal or episodic content drops in between--in 2025, it'll get <em>two</em> expansions, with four "major updates" per year.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside some of its plays to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-is-celebrating-10-years-of-destiny-2-with-a-long-unattainable-armor-set/1100-6526351/" data-ref-id="1100-6526351">celebrate Destiny's 10-year annivesary</a>, Bungie laid out some of the details for Destiny 2's future in a series of new blog posts outlining plans for Destiny 2: Frontiers, the next phase of the game now that its current story is being wrapped up in The Final Shape expansion and the three Episodes that follow. As <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/new_frontiers">game director Tyson Green wrote</a>, in 2025, Destiny 2 will see two "medium" expansions instead of one big one, which was the approach Bungie has stuck with ever since the release of the Forsaken expansion in 2018.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364001-d2_frontiers_roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364001" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364001-d2_frontiers_roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364001"></a><figcaption>Destiny 2 roadmap for 2025.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364001-d2_frontiers_roadmap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We’ve loved creating annual Expansions and are especially proud of The Final Shape. But the truth is that they dominate almost all our development effort," Green wrote. "We need to free ourselves up to explore and innovate with how we deliver Destiny 2 content so we can invest in areas of the game that will feel more impactful to players."</p><p dir="ltr">The blog post also included a roadmap that gives an idea of what we can expect from Destiny 2 as it moves forward into Frontiers. The first of the two expansions, Codename: Apollo, is slated for Summer 2025. Codename: Behemoth, the second, will launch in Winter 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside each expansion will come a "season," though not as we previously knew it. That season will last the six months between one expansion and the next, although Bungie shared no details about how the season might go about including additional stories to tell beyond the expansions--so don't take this to mean that Bungie is returning to the old model of four seasons year, each with its own linear story.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, the seasons will include two major updates--one with the launch of the expansion, and one three months later. It sounds like the idea here is that the first major update with an expansion will introduce new content that goes with that expansion, while the second three months later will "refresh the Core Game with new and reprised content." That content could be activities like Strikes or Exotic missions, new activities, weekly events, meta and balance changes, and rewards. Seems like the plan here is for Bungie to hit Destiny 2 with some kind of significant refresh every three months. Each major expansion is also slated to come with a new reward pass, which is likely to be fairly similar to what's in the game now.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4364002-apollo2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364002" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2688" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4364002-apollo2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364002"></a><figcaption>Codename Apollo concept art.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4364002-apollo2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Bungie's roadmap details that all four major updates will be content that is free to everyone, and that leaves the implication that expansions, on the other hand, will be paid content, as usual.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the expansions, they may be very different from what we've seen in the past as well. The expansions are also looking to move away from the previous "one-shot" campaign structure that Destiny 2 is known for; instead of a new expansion telling a new story, Bungie is looking for the expansions to provide different experiences, and maybe to even explore different game genres within Destiny 2.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are excited to try new things that challenge your idea of what a Destiny experience can be," Green wrote. "We are actively prototyping non-linear campaigns, exploration experiences similar to the Dreaming City or Metroidvanias, and even more unusual formats like roguelikes or survival shooters. Each expansion will present a new opportunity to try something different."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364003-apollo1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364003" data-ratio="0.4" data-width="2400" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364003-apollo1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364003"></a><figcaption>Codename Apollo concept art.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364003-apollo1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Non-linear campaign" is another buzz phrase that Bungie describes as a big departure for Destiny 2. As narrative director Alison Lührs details, Codename: Apollo is a "nonlinear character-driven adventure." In it, you'll see a campaign that includes multiple available story threads, which you'll then pick your way through, rather than just going from mission to story beat to mission to story beat.</p><p>"And the options you didn’t choose? Don’t worry, those other options are still open for you to go back and play through. You’ll need to!" Lührs wrote.</p><p dir="ltr">Lührs says Codename: Apollo will also kick off a new "multi-year saga" for Destiny 2, similar to the Light and Darkness Saga that just wrapped up with The Final Shape, although that story won't be quite so linear as "the Darkness is coming and we have to fight it." Instead, Lührs describes a series of stories that are thematically wedded together, and that will have a core concept similar in simplicity and expansiveness to Light vs. Dark.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie was very light on details about what that new story will look like, though, or what we can expect for the future of Destiny 2 in terms of where the game will take players and what it'll actually feel like. Bungie also has plans to make major adjustments to how players approach Destiny 2's content and how they earn rewards, with additional blog posts running down all the changes that are coming to the game in the future. If nothing else, Codename: Frontiers sounds like it'll be a major departure for Destiny 2 from what players are used to, and with the developer struggling through major layoffs over the last two years, those may be necessary to keep the game alive.</p>

			<p>Today is a momentous occasion for Bungie and Destiny fans, as the franchise is officially 10 years old. On September 9, 2014,<a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-3-was-never-in-development-bungie-will-now-be-run-by-playstation-studios-head-say-insiders/"> Bungie</a> released Destiny, a sci-fi MMO where players could become Guardians and explore the online universe. Just three years later, Destiny was closed down and replaced with Destiny 2, where the game was initially released as a pay-to-play game. However, it soon became free-to-play in 2019, where the game has received many expansions, such as Curse of Osiris, Warmind, Forsaken, and The Witch Queen, to name a few. The most recent expansion was called The Final Shape, which became the fuel to change the seasonal model. To celebrate the anniversary of Destiny as a franchise, players will be able to get nostalgic in-game armor and physical products and look at some art to revel in the nostalgia. Additionally, Bungie has provided details on Codename: Frontiers, the future of Destiny 2.</p>
<p>Major changes are coming for Destiny 2's future. The game will receive two medium-sized expansions and four major free content updates annually. This change hopes to enhance the player experience by introducing a non-linear story, meaning players won't be forced into purchasing expansions if they don't want to. In addition, there will be improvements to the core game activities and the reward system.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Players will be able to see these changes that utilize the new model starting with Codename Apollo, a nonlinear character-driven adventure and the first edition of the new expansion model, set to release in the Summer of 2025.</p>
<p>To help keep the community informed, Bungie will release a Developer Insight Deep Dives series over the coming months. Bungie has also <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny_10_anniversary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a blog post</a> explaining Destiny's long history and an art exhibition in LA, New York City, and London. The exhibition entrance is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>In addition to this, players will be able to experience the nostalgia of Destiny by obtaining a new set of armor for each class, which is inspired by the original concept designs from Destiny. Players must go to the Tower in the Lost City in The Pale Heart to get hold of these armor sets.</p>
<p>For those who did buy The Final Shape, players can earn the Legend title in Destiny 2 by completing The Final Shape Legendary campaign, wearing the anniversary armor during specific activities, exploring the Pale Heart, and completing specific objectives. If you manage to earn the title before September 24, you'll be given early access through Bungie Rewards to purchase the new NERF LMTD Destiny 2 Ace of Spades Blaster before its official release on October 8.</p>
<p>While Destiny has been around for ten years, this new expansion model could see it last another 10.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fantasy-life-sim-mirthwood-delayed-to-november.976029/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-sim-mirthwood-delayed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Bad Ridge Games and publisher V Publishing have announced that upcoming fantasy life sim&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>has been delayed by a couple of months.</p>
<p><em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>was originally due to arrive on PC <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mirthwood-release-date">on Wednesday</a>, but it's now set to arrive on November 6th instead, representing a delay of around two months. Time to dig out that old Shigeru Miyamoto quote, I suppose.</p>
<p>Bad Ridge's Daron Otis says that the delay has been put into effect in order to let the team ensure&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>is "the best it can be on day one", which is a pretty difficult goal to argue with, all things considered.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mirthwood-delayed-combat.jpg?itok=I2K9pEUi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mirthwood-delayed-combat.jpg?itok=AZ0z10Bk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's going to be a little longer before you can play&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Otis says that the team working on&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>is a "small, passionate" one, and that although the team has worked "tirelessly" to create a world players will love to explore, there are still "key areas" that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>According to Otis, those key areas include "performance optimization, localization, and some of the systems" that power&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>. All of these features need to be given "more attention" prior to launch.</p>
<p>Extra development time will, according to a press release, allow&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>'s developers to fine-tune the game, improve its performance, and ensure it's "fully localized for players worldwide", which, again, is a pretty noble goal.</p>
<p>Otis concludes by saying that making&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>'s fans happy is "more of a priority than hitting a date", which is a sentiment I think a lot of major triple-A publishers could still learn from.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>is, it's a fantasy life sim that casts you as a refugee from a continent torn apart by war. You must start again in an "immersive medieval fantasy world sandbox" that features plenty of opportunities to explore, trade, and do battle with its inhabitants.</p>
<p>After it launches, Bad Ridge has a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mirthwood-roadmap-post-launch">post-release roadmap in place</a> for&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>, and it's promising multiplayer, mod support, and family dynamics, plus lots more.</p>
<p><em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>launches on PC via Steam on November 6th. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272900/Mirthwood/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist the game right here</a> if you want to keep up with it.</p>

            <p>
I recently moved to a suburban neighbourhood where there is lots of relatively "wild" parkland and a few raggedy patches of woodland. I like to walk in the woods around evening time, after a hard day of writing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/12-things-to-do-while-youre-a-meatshield-in-black-ops-6">stupid listicles about Call Of Duty</a>. Forests are a critical preoccupation of mine, actually - check <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-is-an-amazing-finnish-fairytale-at-the-heart-of-alan-wake-2s-forests">this lumpen thinkypiece I wrote about Alan Wake 2</a> - but they're also spaces for retreat and reflection, where I can shrug off the angst and lose myself in the spectacle of sycamores and silverbirch, arching over the path. Except. Except that sooner or later I start thinking about the roots. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The roots are everywhere, and unseen. I can trace their presence through the differing acoustics of the soil beneath, but I can't map them precisely. I never quite know whether there's one underfoot, at any given moment. According to my layman's understanding of tree physiology (there is probably a more precise term than "tree physiology"), roots drink up water and soil nutrients. Sounds harmless, but drinking is an open-ended practice. A root that drinks up water may surely drink up other fluids. Blood, for example, or tears. The liquefied substance of the human spirit. The direful drippings of bad dreams.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
I'm entertaining these fears because I've just been reading the blurb for Roots Devour. It's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> management experience and a card game in which you play a really awful eldritch tree, which is trying to become top Elder God of a forest full of equally awful creatures. This is to be achieved within 30 in-game days by spreading out your roots and "organs" (do trees have organs?), harvesting the blood of other organisms, and dealing with unspecified threats. You can also, seemingly, earn the devotion of wild-eyed human tribes or mastermind their fates from the shadows.
</p>
<p>
The whole thing is presented as the act of spreading cards across a tabletop, which I like inasmuch as I'm now thinking about other card games as secret forests, hopefully not carnivorous ones. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2612690/Roots_Devour/">read more and watch a trailer on Steam</a> - I think there's full English localisation on the way. For a real-time spin on the idea of being a ravenously expanding morass of tendrils, sink your teeth into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/carrion">Carrion</a>.

And it’s mostly that. But it’s also a Ubisoft game filled with missions that force you to be sneaky and careful. And sneaking around in <em>Outlaws </em>is very inconsistent and enemies can spot you quickly, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-stealth-bugs-ubisoft-1851637931&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-stealth-bugs-ubisoft-1851637931">leading to a lot of frustration</a></span>.

This is more of something that crept in in the last week or so.” </p><p>Gerighty says that in the next “10 days or so” a patch will arrive for <em>Outlaws </em>that will tweak this early mission and hopefully make it less annoying. And he further explained that he and the team behind the game are open to tweaking later missions, too. </p><p>“If you tell me today that that’s a blocker for people enjoying the game, then we’re going to tweak the narrative context, right? We’ll have an announcement on the PA saying <em>[does pretend PA voice</em>] ‘Well, stormtroopers have gone down to Toshara and now we have the skeleton crew on site.’ The context will change, just so that we can get people to enjoy those moments as much as possible.”<br></p><p>Sounds good to me! I didn’t find the stealth in <em>Outlaws </em>to be horrible or a dealbreaker, but I’ve talked to plenty of people who are unable to move forward or enjoy the game because of some wonky and overly tough stealth sections. So hopefully this helps people stop failing and lets them enjoy the wonderful <em>Star Wars </em>vibes <em>Outlaws </em>offers. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That being said, there are ways to regain health. The first is by killing other players, because you’re evil now.

While in the air, you can Dive Kick towards anyone near you. On top of that, Doom has the ultimate sprint.<br></p><p>Perhaps the most important thing to know is, if you die as Doom, you won’t be able to come back as him, <em>ever</em>. So be mindful of how aggressively you’re playing, because once Doom is gone, he’s gone. Make the most of your moment.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Every game feels pretty close to their arcade equivalents,, though they obviously pop a bit more on modern screens capable of higher fidelity.<br></p><h2 id="h4681"><a id=""></a><strong>Modern classics</strong></h2><p>There are various small settings that can be tweaked/optimized in the <em>Arcade Classics</em> compilation, like the difficulty of your AI opponents, the base speed of the game, and even the starting stage on some occasions. Additionally, training mode can be entered from the game select screen, or when waiting for an online lobby, and showcases all the frame data one could possibly need, as well as a log of inputs.<br></p><p>In action, controls are pretty simplified and each fighting game has a single button, often on the left trigger, which lets you unleash hyper combos easily, kind of like modern controls in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a></span>. This setting can be toggled in offline and casual play, and cannot be used in ranked, making mastery of the game less intimidating for novices while refraining from stepping on the toes of competitive players.. Speaking of, the fighting games also come with casual and ranked online matchmaking, though I had difficulty finding anyone to play online with during my preview period due to low player count. To complement the preservation and further propagation of these legendary titles, Capcom has even thrown in some very neat behind-the-scenes features.</p><p>For example, you can view the marquee of every title almost all the time from the menu, which displays the instructions that would’ve been printed onto the actual arcade cabinet, complete with the original diagrams of the joystick and face buttons that come with them. It’s a handy tool tip to have right in the menu, but for the most part it feels like a piece of history you get to carry with you, which extends to a ton of other features here, too. You can freely dip into a museum mode that features concept art and hundreds of music tracks across the seven games, like <em>MvC2</em>’s iconic character select song, individual character themes, as well as opening and ending songs, and you can even skim through all of it while waiting to connect to an online match. The most exciting bit is the scanned design documents that show some of the developer’s processes when making the games—considering how much is done digitally these days, and how secretive the games industry is, it’s astonishing to see handwritten-and-drawn notes and diagrams that lay out the mechanics and layout of the levels of some of these games, like a sequence on a moving vehicle in the port of <em>The Punisher</em> that remained mostly intact from its accompanying design doc.<br></p><h2 id="h4682"><a id=""></a><strong>An oldie gets its time in the spotlight</strong></h2><p>On that note, <em>The Punisher </em>is the significant outlier of the collection, since it isn’t a traditional fighting game like the other titles included. Instead, it’s a 2D beat-em-up and its presence here is a pretty big deal: <em>The Punisher </em>is a beloved classic game that never quite made a successful jump to consoles. There is a Sega Genesis port that is widely believed to be inferior to the original arcade version, which has finally now been faithfully ported for the first time ever in this collection .It is also the first game collaboration between Capcom and Marvel Comics, which eventually gave us the rest of the games in this collection (namely the acclaimed <em>Marvel vs. Capcom </em>series), so it’s a significant piece of gaming history, too. And it rips.<br></p><p>I don’t tend to play beat-em-ups (which are deceptively difficult games) often, but after playing through <em>The Punisher</em>,<em> </em>I can understand the hype behind it. The aesthetic of these arcade games has always felt much more in line with the original visions and interpretations of the comic book characters upon which they’re based, and <em>The Punisher </em>certainly has that going for itself. If you were looking for something that looked and felt like a <em>Punisher</em> comic, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better adaptation. Frank Castle <em>looks</em> like the version of him featured in early comics, and he and the game are as gratuitously violent as ever in alignment with their vision. As you wield axes and knives to cut down enemies, it’s refreshing to see them actually bleed, which is otherwise absent from most other beat-em-ups I played growing up, like the <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles </em>series, but feels tonally pitch perfect here.</p><p>In terms of controls, <em>The Punisher</em> is pretty straightforward, but it also has some features that were advanced for its time. For example, Frank and Nick Fury (who’s the second playable character in co-op) don’t quite have a dash, but they do have a directional dodge roll that works along the X-and-Y axis. Upon grabbing an enemy, you can do any one of about three different techniques depending on your inputs, and they each can pick up screen-clearing grenades that saved my life on more than one occasion. When I felt backed into a corner, I could do a spinning leg sweep that worked as an effective parry and doubled as armor for a few seconds. The most stylistic addition comes by way of <em>The Punisher</em>’s firearms, which are only drawn when enemies with guns appear onstage. In these moments, <em>The Punisher </em>automatically locks onto enemies in your vision and lets you unload on them as the game transforms into a shooting gallery, and most of the action is accompanied by comic-accurate onomatopoeias. </p><p>I came away from this collection in awe of the historicity of it all and the bang-up job Capcom’s done preserving these seven titles. And I think that’s the ultimate goal of a project like the <em>Capcom Fighting Collection</em>, right? Yes, I’m obviously going to get mileage out of whooping people and being whooped in return as I take my fights online across the fighting game catalog featured here, but I’ve come away with something new and special and I now get to hold onto it in perpetuity. And now games like <em>The Punisher </em>get to live on outside of someone’s faint memories of playing it more than 30 years ago at an arcade. Now, someone who grew up playing and loving that game and others like it can feasibly share it with someone they love. That ought to be true for more games, and hopefully efforts like this <em>Arcade Classics </em>collection help ensure that eventually comes to pass. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Yu-Gi-Oh fans have been underserved when it comes to replaying some of the best games from the franchise's heyday, but that's all changing with the upcoming <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9PKCT42?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yu-Gi-Oh: Early Days Collection</a>. What's most exciting about the upcoming compilation is that it includes Game Boy games that didn't release outside of Japan the first time around. Yu-Gi-Oh: Early Days Collection doesn't have a release date, and Konami hasn't revealed the full list of games, but from what we know so far, fans will want to keep this on their radar.
