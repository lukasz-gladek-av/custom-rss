<p>The big new release of the moment, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, has sold a smashing 127,905 units in the week of 14th July to 20th July, but can't quite take the number one spot from the Switch 2 launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, which shifted another 135,370 copies. DK, of course, was only available for part of the week, so we'll see how far its legs carry it over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>For comparison's sake, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/donkey_kong_country_tropical_freeze">Tropical Freeze</a> debuted on Switch with 88,421 physical sales, and on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/donkey_kong_country_tropical_freeze">Wii U</a> it debuted with 35,717 sales.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4rnumkp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The only other new release of the week that cracked the top ten is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hunter_x_hunter_nen_x_impact">Hunter x Hunter: Nen x Impact</a>, a fighting game based on the hugely popular manga and anime series. However, at least in terms of physical sales, it only managed to shift 3,174 copies on Switch, with other platforms outside the top ten.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tamagotchi_plaza">Tamagotchi Plaza</a> continues to do very well, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> remains in the top five with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> joining it — incredibly impressive given that we have that new Mario Kart. Nothing will stop it, eh?</p>

<p>On the hardware side of things, Switch 2 sales continue to climb as the new console has sold an extra 20k+ units this week compared to last — it shifted 152,165 this week compared to 128,643 last week. That's a nice boost thanks to DK, we reckon.</p>
<p>Once again the Switch OLED and Lite have outsold the PS4, with only the OLED managing to sell above 5,000 units. It's a bit of a drop from last week, but as more new games come to the Switch 2, we're sure more people will move over.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-ports-nintendo-switch-2-ps5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/expect-xbox-to-port-more-games-to-ps5-and-nintendo-switch-2-as-analyst-says-%E2%80%9Cwe%E2%80%99re-way-beyond%E2%80%9D-players-jumping-platforms-for-exclusive-games.1252221/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox has been in third place behind PlayStation and Nintendo for years now, and the recent wave of Xbox releasing games that would have previously been platform exclusives on PS5 and Nintendo Switch/Nintendo Switch 2 has only further solidified that Xbox isn't trying to move up the ladder; it's just trying to hang on to some level of market share.</p>



<p>And you should expect more ports, according to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/bringing-your-games-to-other-platforms">The Game Business</a> and Circana executive director and video game industry analyst, Mat Piscatella. Piscatella spoke to The Game Business founder and editor-in-chief Christopher Dring about video game and hardware sales for June 2025, which saw the Nintendo Switch 2 become the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-us-history/">fastest-selling video game hardware in US history</a>, and, importantly for Xbox, saw Forza Horizon 5 be one of the top-five selling games on PlayStation in the US. </p>



<p>In fact, according to data firm Alinea Analytics, Forza Horizon 5 has become the<a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/"> best-selling game on PS5 for 2025 so far</a>, and that kind of sales success is exactly what Xbox needs right now, even if it has to come from other platforms. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="&quot;Bringing your games to other platforms is how you’re going to win&quot;" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rVynmmmM4FA?start=1497&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>People who buy a hardware system these days, they’re doing it because of the ecosystem, because of their friends list. You’re not going to get people to transition consoles because of exclusives anymore. We’re way beyond that point</em>,<em>"</em> Piscatella told The Game Business. "<em>People are entrenched into their systems. And bringing the content to them is the only way to win. And that is what everyone is doing, except for Nintendo they tend to do their own thing. Even they could benefit from it, but of course they won’t, that’s not their MO."</em></p>



<p>Piscatella continues to say that because the biggest live service games are so dominant on the charts tracking player engagement, it's key for publishers and game makers to go where players are, and unfortunately for Xbox, the majority of them aren't playing on a Series X/S console. </p>



<p>"<em>In the US at least, the Top Ten live service games suck up half of all gaming time every month, and every other game has got to fight for the remainder. So, bringing that content to where people are is the only way you’re going to be able to win in an environment like we’re looking at right now</em>,<em>"</em> Piscatella adds. "<em>Forza being this strong… that’s great. That really bodes well for its next iteration, if they come out day one across systems. Every game finding its way to more stores and ecosystems… that is how you’re going to survive and win.</em>"</p>



<p>And it's not just in the US that live service games dominate player engagement. We see it every month in <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">Newzoo's reports</a>, how new releases have the potential to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-rematch-newzoo-june-2025/">crack the top-10 list of best-selling games</a>, but the top-10 games for player engagement are pretty much always the same, only ever swapping places with each other from time to time.</p>



<p>The fact of the matter is that Xbox has not been able to get players to buy into its platform this console generation, so it's trying to go where players are, instead of trying to convince players to spend hundreds to buy a console to play a new exclusive blockbuster. Even PlayStation has had to lean into the idea of going to where players are, with its recent efforts to port its games to PC. Nintendo is the last platform standing that can still convince players to buy into its platform for exclusive games, and that's probably going to be the case for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>Dring, for his part, adds that Xbox is "<em>expected</em>" to port more games to Nintendo Switch 2 and PS5 "<em>in the coming weeks</em>," which can be read as a tease for announcements he might have a heads-up on, but it's also just the common-sense expectation to have, as we head into the next wave of announcements with Gamescom 2025 around the corner. </p>



<p>Xbox porting more of its games to other platforms is practically one of the few surefire predictions you could make about the upcoming show and the future of Xbox in the video game industry.</p>

(A group of tabletop game makers filed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/656074/trump-tariffs-lawsuit-tabletop-game-companies-stonemaier-princess-awesome">a lawsuit in April</a> in an attempt to stop them.) While the current status of the tariffs <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5460936/trump-tariffs-economy-china-policy">remains fluid</a>, people are still backing games. Per dePontbriand: “Gamefound hasn’t seen a drop in US backer activity or overall campaign funding.”</p><p>As part of the acquisition, Indiegogo will change its pricing to be in line with Gamefound’s, which is “a flat 5 percent fee” and “no additional fees for any promotional placements” on Indiegogo and its newsletters, dePontbriand says. That change will be going into effect “immediately.”</p><p>Indiegogo will also follow Gamefound’s tipping policy, which gives 100 percent of tips directly to a creator “outside of the checkout flow,” dePontbriand says. This change is in the works, and “we’ll provide an update on timing as soon as possible.”</p><p>Both platforms will continue to exist separately, though Gamefound campaigns will be featured on both Gamefound and Indiegogo “for added exposure,” per the press release.</p><p>dePontbriand says she will remain the CEO of Indiegogo, while Gamefound CEO Marcin Świerkot will “take on the role of Group CEO.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/712733/indiegogo-acquired-gamefound-crowdfunding]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you're partial to a bit of sticking a thing on top of another thing, then having little people live in those things while you lord over them as an omnipotent and potentially wrathful god that's busy listening to yoga class music, pay attention. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pile-up">Pile Up!</a>, which is about strategically building cities on little islands, has just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094910/Pile_Up/">emerged from early access</a> and gotten a bunch of new additions.</p>
<p>One of these fresh things comes with an insistence from Turkish developers Remoob that you "try fearmongering". Bold of them to assume I'm not already covertly steering the world around me towards a state of rabid paranoia.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The devs kicked off the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2094910/view/496076123863515253?l=english">patch notes</a> for Pile Up! by giving themselves a "great" rating in terms of how they handled its two year-long early access period, during which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-micro-citybuilder-is-a-high-rise-delight">our Katharine dived in</a> and found the game to be more up her alley than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/townscaper">Townscaper</a>.</p>
<p>Then, they get into the new stuff. A fresh mechanic's been added to the houses you place on your little island, meaning that if you stick one "directly in the middle of different buildings", it'll gain more population. The devs say this is inspired by a certain game they won't name, and I'm drawing a blank, so I'm just gonna assume it's somehow <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>.</p>

<p>Then, we get to the fearmongering. Remoob have added in three new types of building to increase the combos and strategies on offer in your stacking. Utopia buildings will help keep your people happy, Fundamentals can help drive a baby boom, but if you want to "destroy your buildings to panic people and win", the devs are clear. Try fearmongering. Do it.</p>
<p>Whether you've used the new islands the update also adds to Pile Up! in order to build your city on an unstable ruin, over a constantly travelling whale or at a very high altitude, it doesn't matter, you've got to try fearmongering.</p>
<p>Ditto if you're trying the new passive upgrades, playing through the new missions to pile up more lore knowledge, or hopping into the reworked chill mode which eliminates the need to care about buildings with different mechanics. Try fearmongering.</p>
<p>Remoob say they plan to keep on updating the game going forwards, and will have more info on that soon. In the interim, why not try fearmongering?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/chill-micro-citybuilder-pile-up-just-emerged-from-early-access-and-its-devs-want-you-to-try-fearmongering]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I keep coming back to the same question with Killing Floor 3: where's the rest of it? I comfortably spent the last week teaming up against waves of mutant clone zombies, and mindlessly hacking and slashing through these Zeds was a lot of fun. But more than once, my teammates and I – many of whom enjoyed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/killing-floor-2-review">Killing Floor 2</a>, myself included – found ourselves asking one another, "Is this the final release, or is it just Early Access?" Whether you like to play online or if you just prefer to go it alone, Killing Floor 3's singular Survival mode is generally a good time, but it’s also a much simpler, more tightly-woven shoot-em-up compared to its predecessors. The weapons and classes it does include are at least a blast to use, and its enemies are perfectly balanced; they're dangerous when you let them swarm you, but boy do they die good. But all this fast-paced action loses its luster once you've seen everything it has to offer, which doesn’t take long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Killing Floor 3's moment-to-moment action follows the same formula as the first two games, just streamlined for a snappier, more live service-oriented delivery. That includes quicker movement that feels great immediately, letting you dash from side-to-side, mantle up surfaces, and powerslide from sprint to crouch. You’ll still be slashing and blasting your way through waves of enemies, setting up defenses and earning currency to spend on upgraded weapons, armor, ammo, grenades, self-heal refills, and so on between each assault. There’s no linear campaign to break up that chaos, and a relatively limited selection of options at launch: just six playable classes called Perks, 30 weapons (plus the knife), 13 enemy varieties, eight maps, and three total bosses. That does make this a good entry point for anyone just trying to get into the series compared to the infamously bloated Killing Floor 2, but a tougher sell to series veterans who have come to expect a higher level of complexity and tactical depth.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Killing Floor 3 - Screenshots and Specialists</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, its lone Survival mode stays fun thanks to the off-the-wall combat system. The mode itself is pretty self-explanatory: the only goal is to survive five increasingly deadly waves of Zed and then fight one of the bosses at the end, like the Zerg-like Queen Crawler or the rhinoceros-horned Impaler. According to one of my teammates, who managed to get into a full group with over five players (we only managed to play together in smaller groups of three due to time constraints), these bosses will spawn in clusters as the team fills up – this is meant to keep everything balanced, in theory. You can get pretty creative with how you take them out as Killing Floor 3 hands you an arsenal full of deadly armaments, even down to the basic starting weapons for each class. That could be the Engineer's versatile Krait submachine gun, the Ninja's Kiba and Shuriken combo, or even just the knife that every class gets, which is delightfully overpowered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are always a few other tactical considerations at play too, adding layers of variety to the carnage. For example, timing your special ability – like the Ninja's shocking Hebi-Ken, or the Medic's area-denying and team-healing Sanctum – so that you use it on more powerful opponents like the Scrake or the Siren, or landing enough headshots at the right moment to activate Zed Time, aka sparkling slow-mo, to make wave after wave of these satisfying-to-kill enemies pass by pretty quickly. Class interplay in multiplayer, while still pretty simplistic on paper, can also get interesting when it works well. For instance, the Sharpshooter can turn a group of foes into ice sculptures with her Cryo Grenade, so the Ninja can quickly get in and shatter them with his sword.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The eight maps are decently unique in layout and aesthetic design.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Killing Floor 3's 13 monster types are way more believable-looking and just plain fun to fight, leaving behind puddles of gore and lasting destruction to the environment, and also responding to your attacks in ways that look and feel more realistic thanks to the new and improved physics system. They die quickly enough to make you feel powerful, but the real challenge is in making sure you manage your resources – ammo, health, grenades, trade tools, and your class's special ability – while providing enough of a fight to keep them from overwhelming you in numbers. Acid-spewing Bloats and sonic boom-launching Sirens show up way more often in Killing Floor 3 than I recall them showing up in Killing Floor 2, as do most of the other sub-boss type enemies – including the series-classic Scrakes, which now don cybernetic augmentations, heavy armor, and a fearsome combination of chainsaws and grappling hooks. Just be prepared for a lot of realistic-looking blood effects. More Zed blood flows across your screen in any given frame than water in a typical Final Fantasy X cutscene.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The eight maps you’ll fight them on are also decently unique in layout and aesthetic design, but there's nothing particularly different about each to set them apart. The main differences are in tactical advantages, like Convoy's generous placement of turrets or the height brought by R&amp;D Lab's different floors, where you can use zip lines to quickly get away from enemies in the main atrium but mantling over the guardrails will drop you to your death. Radar Station is my personal favorite, since I like its spooky central Washington backdrop, complete with mist-cloaked forests under a full moon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from Normal difficulty, there are two harder difficulty variants to further test your reflexes across each map, as well as your tactical understanding of class, weapon, and monster mechanics. Plus, there's a pretty cool Weekly Mutation option in the world map menu that throws you into a match with randomized modifiers that work in favor of the Zed swarm. My party and I haven't managed to beat one of these tougher matches yet, so it's safe to say they provide a good challenge. I don't doubt that putting more time into Killing Floor 3, leveling up my characters a bit more, and getting even better with the mechanics will feel rewarding when I'm finally able to beat a boss on the Hell On Earth difficulty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The six classes are distinct enough that playing each one feels like a meaningfully different experience. You've got the versatile small arms-wielding Commando, pyrotechnics-obsessed Firebug, crowd-controlling Sharpshooter, close-quarters combat-focused Ninja, utility and heavy-weapons-savvy Engineer, and a Medic who wields SMGs that shoot healing darts. These classes are pretty standard fare on the surface, and it’s nice that you can mix and match weapons between them, but they all feel unique thanks to meaningful skill progression, as well as their special abilities and unique grenades. Each one also starts with a different trade tools; for instance, the Engineer has the Multi-Tool, which can conveniently activate points of interest around the map, like automated turret installations, armor lockers, and zip line routes. Meanwhile, the Medic starts with a Syringe Bag, which allows players to load up on an extra self-heal syringe mid-battle instead of waiting to buy them at the end of a wave.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Class customization feels deeper, but it comes at the expense of weapon progression.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Tripwire Interactive took the between-match skill-based progression from previous entries and made it way more accessible by having it come into play earlier on – it now starts when you hit level two with a class instead of level five, a la Killing Floor 2, and then rapidly increases in complexity by unlocking new options every two levels instead of every five, up to what appears to be a level cap of 30. Since leveling up is so quick between sessions, it can feel overwhelming (in a good way) to head back to the hub area after a long series of back-to-back attempts to select a ton of new skills for a given character class.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that's all fine, because skills provide modest bumps in tactical performance in various areas, each one pushing your character in the direction of a specific playstyle but never doing so much as to completely redefine a class's appearance or role. For example, the Ninja is a clear predecessor to Killing Floor 2's Berserker, wielding melee weapons like the Kiba, Shurikens, and the dual-Katanas while exploiting enemy movements with shock traps. I've decked out my Ninja to heal himself by landing parries while increasing the damage of his heavy attacks, which incentivises me to stick to his starting Kiba longer, rather than invest in his Bow or Tanto weapons at the Trader between waves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My Sharpshooter is the exact opposite, with skill progression that positions her as a stationary combatant by, for instance, giving her boosts to damage while crouching in place or freezing foes with her Cryo Grenade. This makes her tactically advantageous no matter which weapon she's using, just as long as I keep her far away from the action. This is a great amount of meaningful choice, letting me decide how I want to engage with the carnage ahead of time, without getting lost in the skill menu. My only issue here is a weird bug that caused my UI to completely lock up whenever I hovered above a skill choice for too long, forcing me to completely reboot my game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Class customization feels deeper than before, but it comes at the expense of Killing Floor 3's weapon progression system. My main gripe is that the tier system feels completely backwards. First off, there is both persistent progression and mid-match progression to consider. Persistent progression takes place in the hub area, where you use the Armory system to set up custom loadouts for each main weapon and sidearm for each class, which exist in addition to fully decked-out default weapon loadouts that are immediately accessible mid-match – assuming you earn enough currency in a given match to afford those upgrades.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those predetermined weapons scale from grey to purple, but the tier system only seems to make sense when you consider default loadouts. The basic weapons you start with can be permanently upgraded in the Armory to extremely powerful levels, and it only takes a match or two to earn enough crafting resources to do so. The higher-tier weapons do offer a boost against the default loadouts for lower-tier weapons, but my teammates and I kept finding that our upgraded starter weapons consistently outperformed the expensive purple-tier gear we had to save up for. It creates this weird economy where you're better off ignoring half the weapon selection entirely – since, with enough (easily obtainable) crafting materials you can craft every mod for every weapon from the very start – giving you the option to create an OP and relatively inexpensive grey weapon for any class, grab it near the beginning of any session, and stick to just that. This can make each match’s mid-game progression feel dull, since the expensive stuff you're meant to be working toward feels like a downgrade at that point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At least the weapons across each of the four tiers all feel good to use, regardless of raw damage output, adding to each class's style and strategy when wielded with the right skill boosts and player tactics. That could be the Engineer's deadly Ifrit plasma cannon or the Firebug's explosive Dragonbreath shotgun, which is a total blast against bigger foes like the jetpack-wearing Husk or the aforementioned Impaler boss.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The hub genuinely feels like you are a part of Killing Floor 3's world.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I love that the well-designed Stronghold hub area gives you a place to relax between matches and during Killing Floor 3's brief but helpful tutorial. This is the central spot to mess around with class and weapon modifications, try different weapons in the shooting range, play with cosmetics, dig into the Season Pass, and pick your next mission. Standing at the mission terminal and plotting a course from the world map genuinely feels like you're part of Killing Floor 3's world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to Killing Floor 2's Objective Mode, which is absent in the third outing, there are some basic side missions to complete for extra story flavor bits that are built directly into the Survival mode. Those missions have objectives like "scan all the cargo crates at a location on X map," or "kill 10 of X enemy type," or "run 2,000 feet," – you probably get the gist by this point. These reward crafting supplies, Battle Pass points, and experience points that later become useful when unlocking crafted weapon mods, Battle Pass rewards, and class skills in the hub. It's worth noting that you can also get more crafting supplies by taking out random pieces of equipment, like surveillance cameras and vending machines, which is a small but fun touch.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Gabriel's Favorite First-Person Shooters</h3><p>A top 10 list of Gabriel's all-time favorite first-person shooters.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The missions are all easy to complete in large batches during routine gameplay, but they don't do much more than add lore flavor and loot. In fact, Killing Floor 3's story is entirely forgettable. If not for its rather hefty Codex explaining all the important details about these characters, weapons, enemy types, background stories, and so forth, I probably wouldn't even consciously realize there's any semblance of a narrative at all. But I already knew what I was getting myself into, and sometimes, as in the case with a series that's this irreverent, action-packed, and unapologetically gory, less is more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hub is also where you'll encounter the usual live-service stuff that comes with modern multiplayer shooters. Here, you can set up cross-platform multiplayer, which is a welcome inclusion that works well. And then there's the microtransactions store. It seems to have a small revolving selection of cosmetics for now, kinda like what Diablo 4's cosmetic store looked like during that game's launch. I only looked at it once or twice before moving on, so it's safe to call it an afterthought and not essential to gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of live-service checklists, I barely touched the Season Pass or messed with the limited cosmetic customization of my characters – you can only change headgear and armor skins, nothing else. Just expect to spend the equivalent of $4.99 for 500 in-game store points for aesthetics that don't really matter or differentiate your character too much. Are these microtransactions burdensome? Probably not. Marginally annoying? Definitely.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Killing Floor 3 is a polished sequel that feels both smartly streamlined and somewhat hollow. Its co-op shooting feels great, the classes are distinct, and my teammates and I had a good time blasting through Zed hordes together while the fun lasted. But with only eight maps, six classes, and a backwards weapon progression system that’s already in need of some tweaking, this comes across more like a solid Early Access build than a full release. The foundation is there, and if Tripwire keeps adding content like it did with Killing Floor 2, this could become something special. Right now, though, there’s at least enough for a weekend's worth of fun.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/killing-floor-3-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">2025 has not been the best year for Xbox. Microsoft’s recent massive company-wide layoff impacted up to 9,000 employees, nearly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff"><u>half of whom worked at Xbox</u></a>. Multiple games were cancelled, “AAAA” studio The Initiative was shut down, and countless talented staff lost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a strange and uneasy contrast, then, to see that Xbox has actually had a pretty good year when it comes to games. Its biggest first-party releases so far this year have been Obsidian Entertainment’s Avowed, Compulsion Games’ South of Midnight, Bethesda’s Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, and id Software’s Doom: The Dark Ages. The company has also pushed forward its multiplatform plans with a few ports for the PlayStation 5, including the previously Xbox and PC exclusives Forza Horizon 5 and Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That good chain of games looks set to continue as many developers and studios at Xbox continue their hard work. There are numerous video games in development at Xbox across multiple divisions today, from Bethesda, Activision Blizzard, and Xbox Game Studios. To help keep track of them all, we’ve collected everything we know about every Xbox studio and their current projects below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Arkane Studios</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Arkane Studios, the developer behind the Dishonored series, was previously spread across two locations: one studio in Austin, Texas, which developed Prey, and another in Lyon, France, which most recently released  Deathloop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On May 7, 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda"><u>Xbox closed Arkane’s Austin branch</u></a> following the tepid release of its horror co-op shooter, Redfall. However, Arkane Lyon remains open and continues work on the studio’s next game, Marvel’s Blade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced at the 2023 Game Awards, Marvel’s Blade is an upcoming action-adventure game starring the iconic vampire hunter who’s on a mission to protect Paris from an oncoming vampire invasion. And in a big departure from the first-person games Arkane is typically known for, Blade will be playable in the third-person perspective. Deathloop director and studio head Dinga Bakaba will co-direct Blade alongside Arkane’s long-serving art director, Sebastien Mitton, and Bakaba has said he’s excited to bring Arkane’s unique take on Blade to life. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Arkane’s financial statements for 2024,<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/timur222.bsky.social/post/3ltlhwfmlac2i" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> Blade entered full production</u></a> at the end of last year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bethesda Game Studios</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, Bethesda Game Studios has one big game on the horizon: The Elder Scrolls 6. The next mainline game in the beloved fantasy RPG series was announced way back in 2018 at a long-forgotten <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/11/e3-2018-the-elder-scrolls-vi-announced-at-bethesda-press-conference"><u>event called E3</u></a>. Crucially, the announcement came simultaneously with the reveal of Starfield, and Bethesda was hard at work creating the space-faring RPG. The developers reiterated to the public many times that The Elder Scrolls 6 would not enter full production until after Starfield was released.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, following the launch of Starfield in 2023 and the expansion DLC Shattered Space in 2024, Bethesda is finally all-in on The Elder Scrolls 6. As part of The Elder Scrolls' 30th anniversary on March 25, 2024, Bethesda announced that the next <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-the-elder-scrolls-turns-30-bethesda-issues-brief-the-elder-scrolls-6-update"><u>Elder Scrolls was fully in development</u></a>, and that there are even early builds of the game up and running.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While The Elder Scrolls 6 is officially Bethesda’s only project, Windows Central’s Jez Corden <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DDr2ZSFIEXk?t=3845s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reports</u></a> that the next Fallout game has also been greenlit. If that’s true, it comes with many questions, including if the new Fallout is being developed by Bethesda Game Studios or handled by another developer, much like how Obsidian Entertainment developed Fallout: New Vegas.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Blizzard Entertainment</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard Entertainment remains focused on three core franchises: Diablo 4, Overwatch 2, and World of Warcraft. Following the cancellation of an unannounced fantasy survival game codenamed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-team-working-on-blizzards-now-canceled-survival-was-seemingly-gutted-amid-xbox-mass-layoffs"><u>Odyssey back in 2024</u></a>, Blizzard has narrowed its focus to concentrate on improving its most popular games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch 2 is still receiving regular updates. After Blizzard cancelled the planned PvE story mode back in 2023, much of the focus has been on improving the PvP competitive modes. Since the launch of Overwatch 2, Blizzard has released an average of three new playable heroes per year. The next hero coming to Overwatch 2 is a new support character named Wuyang, who is scheduled to be released as part of Season 18. And earlier this year, Blizzard released a new competitive multiplayer format called Stadium, where teams of five fight in a best-of-seven series, and in each new round players can purchase new upgrades for their heroes, similar to Riot’s Valorant.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Diablo 4 operates on a seasonal update schedule, with larger DLC expansions that add more significant upgrades and story content. The first expansion, titled Vessel of Hatred, released on October 7, 2024, added a massive new jungle region called Nahantu as well as a new Spiritborn character class that controls the ancient powers of the jungle to wield both long-range and melee abilities. The latest season, Sins of the Horadrim, launched just last month and adds Nightmare Dungeon upgrades and Horadric Spells, among numerous other new additions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for World of Warcraft, Blizzard did something unprecedented at BlizzCon 2023 and announced not one, but three expansions for the popular MMORPG. Starting with The War Within, released on August 26, 2024, Blizzard kicked off the Worldsoul Saga, an overarching story that will unite the three expansions. The next expansions in the  Saga are titled Midnight and The Last Titan, but so far, we don’t know when these entries will launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, Blizzard has committed to supporting World of Warcraft Classic, which recreates World of Warcraft at earlier release states. WoW Classic is currently on Cataclysm Classic, the fourth expansion ever released for WoW.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Compulsion Games</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following We Happy Few in 2018, Canadian-based Compulsion Games released its newest game, South of Midnight, on April 8, 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">South of Midnight is an action-adventure game set in a fantastical version of the Deep South. The game follows a young mystic named Hazel Flood on her journey to become a Weaver, a magical mender of broken spirits. Along the way, Hazel encounters numerous mythical creatures and enemies based on Southern Gothic folklore. IGN gave South of Midnight an 8 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-review"><u>our review</u></a>, calling it “a straightforward but well-executed action-adventure game on the surface, with a simple but satisfying mix of combat and platforming.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s been no word yet on what Compulsion Games is working on next.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Coalition</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox’s dedicated Gears of War studio has quite the busy schedule ahead of it. Canada-based The Coalition is <em>gearing </em>up for the release of Gears of War: Reloaded, a 4K remaster of the original Gears of War game. Reloaded is set to release on Xbox Series X and S, PC, and – for the first time ever – PS5 on August 26, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this is just an appetizer for Gears of War: E-Day, the next mainline Gears of War game set 14 years before the events of the original. Marcus Fenix (John DiMaggio) and Dom Santiago (Carlos Ferro) will return in a prequel that finally tells the full story of Emergence Day,  when monstrous creatures known as the Locust emerged from underground and destroyed the planet Sera. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gears of War: E-Day is currently scheduled to release sometime in 2026.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Double Fine Productions</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Double Fine had been keeping quiet following the release of Psychonauts 2 in 2021, but all that changed when the studio announced its next game, Keeper. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeper was first revealed at this year’s Xbox Summer Game Showcase and will be released on October 17, 2025. Described as a “story told without words,” Keeper is a puzzle adventure game starring a sentient lighthouse and a spirited seabird as they make their way through a magical realm. If you saw the trailer for Keeper and thought it was breathtaking, you should know that Double Fine’s Lee Petty, the art director on Brutal Legend and Broken Age, is the creative lead on Keeper.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Halo Studios</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo Studios, formerly known as 343 Industries, is currently working on multiple new Halo projects, including an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/future-halo-games-moving-to-unreal-engine-as-developer-343-industries-officially-changes-its-name"><u>unannounced game made in Unreal Engine 5</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite working on perhaps the most significant Xbox series of all, Endgadget <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/even-before-the-xbox-layoffs-there-was-tension-at-halo-studios-002031995.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reported</u></a> that Halo Studios was impacted by the company-wide layoffs at Microsoft and that, behind the scenes, there are tensions over the direction of the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Provided things all remain steady, the current plan is for Halo Studios to reveal its new game at the Halo World Championships in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-teases-more-halo-news-this-october"><u>October 2025</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Id Software</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Texas-based id Software has already released one of IGN’s favorite games of 2025, Doom: The Dark Ages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Released on May 15, Doom: The Dark Ages is a heavy metal, dark fantasy prequel to 2016’s Doom. Id Software intentionally went for a slower, tankier approach to combat with The Dark Ages, taking away some of the Doom Slayer’s speed and agility. In exchange, he has access to heavier weapons like a flail and shield he can throw at enemies, a la Captain America. There’s also our new favorite weapon, the skull-crushing Pulverizer, which uses enemy bones as ammo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN gave the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-review"><u>newest Doom game a 9</u></a>, calling it “a new flavor of the legendary shooter series that’s heavier and more grounded, but no less energetic and exhilarating.” If you haven’t played Doom: The Dark Ages yet, it’s worth checking out for sure. Naturally, considering The Dark Ages was only released this year, there’s no word yet on the studio’s next game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Infinity Ward</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision maintains a continuous development cycle to uphold an annual Call of Duty release cadence. That means the franchise’s key studios – Infinity Ward, Treyarch, Raven Software, and Sledgehammer Games – each trade off lead development duties on the newest Call of Duty game. The studios not working on this year’s installment will be working on either next year’s game or the year after.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last Call of Duty title Infinity Ward led development on was 2022’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. The studio then assisted Sledgehammer Games on 2023’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, and Treyarch with last year’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. This year’s entry, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, is co-developed by Treyarch and Raven Software, meaning the studios will have been lead developers two years in a row. It’s unknown whether Infinity Ward is assisting on Black Ops 7 or working on another Call of Duty project.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Inxile Entertainment</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After being acquired by Xbox in 2018, the RPG specialists at InXile Entertainment are finally getting ready to release their first game under the Xbox Game Studios banner, Clockwork Revolution.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first-person RPG is set in a vibrant, steampunk version of the 19th century where crime and violence thrive. Amid an escalating turf war between local gangs, criminal kingpins, and the local government, you gain the ability to manipulate time, which will surely come in handy during the ensuing conflict.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clockwork Revolution was first announced in 2023, and InXile says it’s the studio’s biggest game to date in terms of scope and budget. Based on the most recent gameplay trailer from Xbox’s Summer Games Showcase, it certainly appears to be a deep RPG with multiple dialogue options that affect the outcome of certain situations, a deeply customizable character creator, and numerous weapon modifications. However, Clockwork Revolution still doesn’t have a firm release window.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">King</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Sweden-based mobile game developer King remains in charge of one of the most successful mobile games of all time, Candy Crush. While King has taken brief detours away from the series, working on mobile games like 2021’s Crash Bandicoot: On the Run and 2020’s Knighthood, King continues to release new Candy Crush games, most recently Candy Crush Solitaire in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite its flagship series’ continued success, King was affected by the Microsoft layoffs, with 10% of its total workforce cut.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MachineGames</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Swedish developer MachineGames blew everyone away with its stellar reboot of Wolfenstein back in 2014, and most recently surprised everyone with the announcement that it was making a new Indiana Jones video game – a totally different style of experience, aside from all the Nazis, of course.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starring the famous archaeologist in a new, globe-trotting adventure, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was critically acclaimed thanks to its fantastic mix of first- and third-person gameplay, an uncanny performance by Troy Baker that sounds almost exactly like Harisson Ford circa-1980, and ultimately its ability to capture the exact tone of the better Indiana Jones movies in video game form. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">MachineGames is following up its hit release with the first story DLC, The Order of Giants, which was announced at this year's Xbox Summer Games Showcase and will be released on September 4, 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mojang Studios</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sweden-based studio behind Minecraft continues to release regular updates for its massively popular crafting game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most recent update for Minecraft, titled “Chase the Skies,” was released on June 17, 2025, and adds 60+ biomes, new buildable structures, and the ability to explore the overworld from the skies with a new mount called Happy Ghast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition, Mojang produced a live-action Minecraft film, which was released earlier this year. Starring Jack Black and Jason Mamoa, A Minecraft Movie is currently the third-highest-grossing film of 2025 and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-blows-past-700-million-at-the-box-office-in-its-quest-to-be-the-highest-grossing-video-game-film-ever"><u>second-highest-grossing video game film of all time</u></a> after 2023’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ninja Theory</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">UK-based Ninja Theory released Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 on May 21, 2024, the long-awaited sequel to 2017’s Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice. With Senua’s story wrapped up, Ninja Theory could be shifting focus to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-theorys-project-mara-is-set-in-a-single-incredibly-realistic-apartment"><u>Project: Mara</u></a>, a horror game the studio first teased back in January 2020. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Ninja Theory hasn’t shared too much information about the upcoming horror game, the studio explained in a video diary that Project: Mara will be a “real-world and grounded representation of mental terror.” This is an area that’s of great interest to Ninja Theory, as both Hellblade and Senua’s Saga also examined mental health in great detail by combining binaural audio effects for the psychosis-inflicted voices in Senua’s head with actress Melina Juergens’ powerful performance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/making-video-games-is-difficult-ninja-theory-studio-head-talks-at-the-fore-of-senuas-saga-hellblade-2s-xbox-and-pc-launch" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Windows Central</u></a> reports that Xbox has greenlit another game from Ninja Theory alongside Project: Mara, but nothing else is known about that game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Obsidian Entertainment</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian Entertainment is having itself a very busy 2025. Earlier this year, the studio released Avowed, a fantasy RPG set in the Pillars of Eternity universe. In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-review"><u>IGN’s review</u></a>, we gave Avowed a 7, calling it a reminder of why we fell in love with Obsidian’s RPG but ultimately a game that plays it “quite safe” overall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Up next is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grounded-2-first-hands-on-preview-bigger-than-before"><u>Grounded 2</u></a>, a sequel to the 2022 online co-op game about a group of kids who are shrunk down to miniature size by a science experiment gone wrong and must survive the dangers of their suburban backyard. Grounded 2 will hit Early Access on July 29, 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the biggest game on Obsidian’s calendar is The Outer Worlds 2. The first Outer Worlds game was a sci-fi RPG co-directed by Leonard Boyarsky and Tim Cain, the creators of the original Fallout series, and shares much of Fallout’s morbid humor and world-building sensibilities. The Outer Worlds depicts a retro-futuristic version of outer space that’s been poisoned by unchecked capitalism. All that may sound a little too much like VaultTech, but it’s certainly got its own distinct flavour. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first Outer Worlds became a sleeper hit, selling over four million units and receiving numerous Game of the Year award nominations, and the sequel looks to expand on that success. Based on our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-the-first-preview-ign-first"><u>IGN First previews</u></a>, The Outer Worlds 2 maintains the irreverent tone of the original game, while greatly expanding upon the game’s combat and exploration. It’s set to release on October 29, 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Playground Games</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The UK-based Playground Games is best known for its work on Forza Horizon, an open-world arcade racer spinoff of Xbox’s more serious racing-sim, Forza Motorsport. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, in 2020, Playground Games was officially announced as the developer behind the upcoming Fable reboot. In the years since, we’ve sadly learned very little about it, despite a handful of trailers showcasing the comedic tone, semi-realistic art style, pre-alpha gameplay, and celebrity cameos from famous UK comedians like Matt King and Richard Ayoade. Originally planned to launch this year, Fable was recently delayed into a 2026 release window. We hope to see much more of the game in the coming months.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rare</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rare was deeply impacted by the recent company-wide layoffs at Microsoft. The famed developer behind games like Goldeneye 007 and Banjo-Kazooie has spent the better part of the past decade releasing regular updates for its popular online pirate game, Sea of Thieves. However, Rare was also working on Everwild, a third-person fantasy adventure game that was first announced in 2019. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At some point in 2021, it was reported that Everwild was experiencing development difficulties and underwent a complete reboot. However, following the layoffs at Microsoft, Xbox announced internally that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rares-everwild-reportedly-canceled-as-microsoft-layoffs-sweep-across-xbox"><u>Everwild would be canceled</u></a>. In addition, longtime Rare director Gregg Mayles, who had reportedly been lead on Everwild following its reboot, resigned from the studio he first joined in 1989.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While work on Sea of Thieves will likely continue, it’s unclear what the next steps are for the venerable British studio.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Raven Software</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Raven Software is part of Activision’s stable of dedicated Call of Duty developers and is the co-developer of the upcoming Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which it is working on alongside Treyarch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two studios previously led development on 2024’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, with Raven developing the single-player campaign. In our review, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review"><u>IGN gave Black Ops 6 a 9</u></a>, calling it “the best Call of Duty campaign in many, many years.” Will Raven and Treyarch be able to follow up on their prior game’s success when Black Ops 7 is released later in 2025? We’re excited to find out.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Sledgehammer Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">California-based Sledgehammer Games is another Call of Duty studio working under the Activision umbrella. It previously led development on 2023’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, and before it, Call of Duty: Vanguard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Sledgehammer was listed as an assist studio on 2024’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, it was also reported that the studio<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-at-toys-for-bob-and-sledgehammer-games-affect-between-30-and-40-of-staff-insider-says" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> lost 30% of its staff </u></a>in a round of layoffs back in 2024, and it’s unknown whether Sledgehammer will be able to lead development on a new Call of Duty game going forward.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Treyarch</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Raven Software, Treyarch is the co-developer of the upcoming Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As one of the longest-running developers at Activision, Treyarch has worked on Call of Duty games since as early as 2005’s Call of Duty 2: Big Red One. Treyarch is responsible for founding the very popular Black Ops sub-series, and is also responsible for developing Call of Duty’s Zombies – most recently for 2021’s Vanguard, 2023’s Modern Warfare 3, and last year’s Black Ops 6. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Turn 10 Studios</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Washington-based Turn 10 Studios was once the home of Xbox’s racing sim Forza Motorsport, but all that appears to have changed following the recent layoffs at Microsoft. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bloomberg’s Jason Schrier</u></a>, Turn10 reportedly lost nearly 50% of its staff in this year’s layoffs, and the studio is effectively “shuttered.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Further reports suggest that the Forza Motorsport series will no longer be supported, and remaining Turn 10 staff will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-motorsport-team-is-no-more-former-developer-claims-with-remaining-turn-10-staff-left-to-support-the-horizon-side"><u>serve as an assist team</u></a> on the spinoff series, Forza Horizon.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Undead Labs</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Seattle-based studio Undead Labs has been working on State of Decay 3 for the past several years. The third game in the popular zombie survival sim series, it was officially announced in 2020. However, there have been multiple reports of behind-the-scenes trouble at the studio leading to its slow development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, studio founder Jeff Strain left Undead Labs in 2021 to start up a new studio, Possibility Space (which faced its <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/possibility-space-shuts-down" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>own internal struggles</u></a>). This was followed by a 2022 investigation by <a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-decay-3-xbox-series-x-s-sexism-microsoft-undea-1848728682" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kotaku</u></a> into a toxic work environment at the studio, which resulted in an internal Microsoft investigation and the departure of studio HR boss, Anne Schlosser. These issues have reportedly contributed to the delay of State of Decay 3, which still doesn’t have a release window.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">World’s Edge</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">World’s Edge was established by Xbox Game Studios in 2019 to be the stewards of the Age of Empires real-time strategy series. Since its inception, World’s Edge has released a number of remasters, starting with Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition in 2019, and the most recent being Age of Mythology: Retold. A remaster of the original Age of Mythology, it focuses on ancient civilizations and the gods they worshipped. It was released on September 4, 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">World’s Edge isn’t solely dedicated to remasters, though; it also released a new entry into the series, Age of Empires 4, back in 2021 to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/age-of-empires-4-review"><u>positive reviews</u></a>. It’s unclear if its next step will be to continue working on its remasters (AoE2: Definitive Edition continues to receive expansion packs) or develop an entirely new project. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">ZeniMax Online Studios</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Maryland-based ZeniMax Online Studios has been releasing continuous updates to The Elder Scrolls Online since the game’s launch in 2014. The MMORPG spinoff of Bethesda’s popular Elder Scrolls RPG series has quietly grown to become one of the biggest MMOs in the world, alongside games like World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 14. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Behind the scenes, it was reported that ZeniMax Online Studios was also impacted by the recent Microsoft layoffs. Not only has veteran studio boss Matt Firor stepped down from the company, but an unannounced game known only as Project Blackbird was also canceled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Bloomberg reported that Xbox executives were<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-03/microsoft-s-xbox-cancels-blackbird-an-upcoming-game-that-impressed-executives" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> “blown away”</u></a> by Project Blackbird, Xbox still announced internally that it was cancelling the game. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-unannounced-mmo-was-doing-well-and-even-scaling-up-as-xbox-cancelation-blindsided-staff-sources-say"><u>Reports</u></a> have since come out with more details about Project Blackbird. The game was set to be a new sci-fi MMO where players would navigate the politics of warring gangster factions on an alien planet where one side of the planet is engulfed in fire and the other covered in ice. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">ZeniMax Online Studios was reportedly staffing up to begin full production on Project Blackbird before it was canceled. And while work will continue on The Elder Scrolls Online, developers have shared online how devastating the news of Project Blackbird’s cancellation has been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fallout of the Microsoft layoffs is still being felt throughout the industry and will likely shape Xbox as it heads into the next generation. Not only have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/canceled-video-games-2025">games been canceled</a>, but entire studios, like The Initiative, have been shut down, and games like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">Perfect Dark reboot have gone with them</a>. While there are still Xbox games to look forward to on the horizon, the future of Xbox remains an open question.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-the-state-of-every-first-party-developer-summer-2025-update]]></content:encoded>

And as revealed in the production video below, players won't have to transverse all of that distance by foot. Instead, they can ride in style with a supernatural motorcycle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBteyC_OrA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gpBteyC_OrA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the video, producer Keita Iizuka explains that the Revenant Hunter's motorcycle isn't actually a motorcycle at all. It's a spell used to manifest a physical vehicle as needed. That means it won't need any conventional fuel or spare parts. However, it's unclear if players will need to provide anything to keep the motorcycle powered.</p><p>Iizuka added that when the player is accompanied by a companion character, they will ride on the back of the motorcycle with the Revenant Hunter. The motorcycle itself is being used to promote Code Vein 2 at San Diego Comic-Con this week with a recreation of the game's supernaturally charged vehicle. Fans will be able to take pictures with it there, or catch it at PAX West and New York Comic Con later this year.</p><p>Earlier this year, Bandai Namco teased that the story of Code Vein 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/code-vein-2-seeks-to-expand-the-souls-like-genre-without-reinventing-it/1100-6532365/" data-ref-id="1100-6532365">will force the Revenant Hunter to team up with Revenants</a> to face something that threatens to destroy their entire world. The game is also introducing a time-travel element that lets players go back to the past and make changes that affect the world in the present.</p><p>Code Vein 2 will hit Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC in 2026.</p>

For any hardcore wrestling fan, creating--as well as downloading--custom superstars is one of the biggest draws. However, players quickly noticed that the Switch 2 version of the game doesn't have the image-uploader feature.</p><p>As frustrating as that is, there's a good reason: WWE 2K25 isn’t compatible with cross-platform community creations. While the latest DLC pack features the late ECW legend New Jack, recent acquisition Penta, and Japanese women's wrestling icon Bull Nakano, players who want to import logos or textures from wrestlers that aren't in the game won't be able to on Switch 2. That means Switch 2 players will be left with the default images featured in the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeVVwhKOhMk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eeVVwhKOhMk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It might not be a dealbreaker for some, but it feels like the game is at a disadvantage if you want the full experience.</p><p>This installment of the series makes its return to Nintendo consoles after eight years, with WWE 2K18 being the last. Players might remember, though, that the port of that game is also <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/wwe-2k18/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered one of the worst of the entire franchise</a>.</p><p>2K has implemented some restrictions on the content that can be uploaded, and the game's moderation team is usually quick to remove offending content, be it images or people themselves. However, there are times when things slip through the cracks momentarily, but that's because of the sheer volume of uploads.</p><p>In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wwe-2k25-review/1900-6418343/" data-ref-id="1900-6418343">review</a>, we considered WWE 2K25 to be one of the strongest games in the series, given the massive creation suite, new additional match types, and a deep roster of 300+ current top stars and iconic legends, which even includes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-2k25-dlc-adds-shaq-tyrese-haliburton-and-more/1100-6532729/" data-ref-id="1100-6532729">NBA legends</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Hasbro's recent Magic the Gathering Final Fantasy crossover card set made $200m sales in one day.</p>
<p>This comes courtesy of Hasbro CEO Christian Cocks, who yesterday revealed the figure <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/events/event-details/hasbro-second-quarter-2025-earnings-conference-call">during a Hasbro earnings call</a>. This staggering figure eclipses that milestone set by prior sets, including an earlier Lord of the Rings set, which according to Cocks passed the $200m mark a while after its initial release.</p>

<p>Cocks stated: "Lord of the Rings took six months to deliver $200 million of revenue, Final Fantasy took one day, and we left demand on the table [...] So we couldn't produce enough.</p>
<p>"I think we increased production runs on it 4x pre-release. It was substantially by many, many very high double-digit percentages ahead of any other production run we've ever done, and we left the market wanting more."</p>
<p>While this figure is obviously great for Hasbro, fans of Magic the Gathering are torn on these sorts of crossover sets. On one hand, it's cool to see your favourite IPs get some representation inside lovely little packs. I recall being especially excited about the Warhammer crossover, for example.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Magic the Gathering has a rich history of its own lore and characters, and with these crossover sets continuing to bring in the big bucks, there's a reasonable concern that years-long story lines will take a back seat to new partnerships between Hasbro and various media companies across the world.</p>
<p>If you think of it from the perspective of a Hasbro shareholder, would you rather a return to Bloomburrow, or for Captain America to get a mythic rare red, white, and blue legendary creature? Which would make more money?</p>
<p>That being said, Hasbro is pushing its own Magic the Gathering IP into other mediums, which could offer a new avenue to promote and revel in decades' worth of worldbuilding. For one, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-announces-magic-the-gathering-film-and-tv-series-wants-it-to-be-the-next-cinematic-universe">the company has expressed a desire to push into TV and movies</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry">is keen on making Baldur's Gate 4 (though isn't in a hurry)</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-crossover-set-made-200-million-in-a-single-day]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/free-to-play-moba-supervive-has-launched-and-%E2%80%9Calmost-everything-has-changed%E2%80%9D-with-the-arrival-of-1-0-launch-update.1252170/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1283700/SUPERVIVE/">SUPERVIVE</a>, a free-to-play MOBA from developer Theorycraft Games and publisher NetEase Games, has launched with a 1.0 update on Steam, which, according to Theorycraft, brings an overhaul to the game, with the studio saying in its <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1283700/announcements/detail/516342322187730946">latest blog post </a>that "<em>almost everything has changed</em>."</p>



<p>One of the many changes, but perhaps the most significant one, is the introduction of the game's Armory, which includes a progression system for players to collect different gear that can drastically change their playstyle and craft new builds. The Breach, the game's setting, has also been expanded, and players can get around with improved gliders and a new vehicle called the Skyshark, as Theorycraft Games has added more aerial traversal options.</p>



<p>"<em>Our goal with the Armory is pretty straightforward: offer accessible, meaningful playstyle choices on top of an engaging meta-progression system,</em>" Theorycraft Games writes in its blog post. The studio breaks down the Armory in four basic steps. Collecting items for the armory, buying those items with the in-game currency Coin, performing well in matches to earn another in-game currency called Prisma, and then spending that Prisma to unlock more items for the Armory. </p>

<p>There are over 100 Armory items for you to collect and craft builds with, so there will always be something for you to go out and find, especially because your Armory will be reset at the end of each season. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Another big change with this launch update is the introduction of a new playable Hunter called Wukong, whose passive ability lets him hide out from enemies in trees to give his glider a rest before jumping back into the fray.</p>



<p>After launching in <a href="https://wccftech.com/supervives-open-beta-begins-today/">Open Beta</a> last November, SUPERVIVE has already been off to a strong start with thousands of positive reviews on Steam. Now that it's out in 1.0, hopefully Theorycraft Games can keep up the momentum the game has built, and we're not hearing about yet another free-to-play game <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-producer-leaves-ubisoft-and-game-industry-after-xdefiant-servers-shut-down/">getting shut down within a year</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-bandai-namco-stake</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-buys-2-5-stake-in-bandai-namco-for-anime-manga-and-more.1252167/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that it has acquired a 2.5% stake in Bandai Namco, with a view to "expanding the fan community for IP such as anime and manga around the world".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202507/25-0724E/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Sony says the goal with regards to acquiring this stake in the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tekken&nbsp;</em>studio is "strengthening engagement, particularly in the anime field", an area in which Sony expects "rapid market growth".</p>

<p>Sony acknowledges its previous collaborations with Bandai Namco, but the company says it wants to expand these efforts beyond "games, anime, and music" into a "broader range of areas", including merchandising, "experiential entertainment", and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-bandai-namco-sony.jpg?itok=QC0DJ8qA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-bandai-namco-sony.jpg?itok=TNjrlYyq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bandai Namco is perhaps best-known as the publisher of smash hit action RPG&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that this isn't specifically a gaming-related investment; this is the wider Sony corporation investing in Bandai Namco Holdings rather than Bandai Namco Entertainment, so it doesn't just pertain to the latter's video game output.</p>

<p>However, since Sony and Bandai Namco seem focused on the anime and manga part of this partnership, it's entirely possible we'll see some new anime or manga adaptations of Bandai Namco's best-known works.</p>

<p>One particularly obvious addition to that catalog would seem to be&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, which is arguably crying out for an anime adaptation; I'm not a huge fan of the idea of any visual reimagining of FromSoftware's work, but it makes a lot more sense than the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-movie" rel="nofollow">recently-revealed live-action movie</a>.</p>

<p>Other Bandai Namco properties, like&nbsp;<em>Tekken</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series, and perhaps even&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>could be prime candidates for anime and manga adaptation, but of course, we'll have to wait and see what comes of this partnership to find out whether any of those are on the cards.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-nightmares-3-bandai-namco-sony.jpg?itok=WPKotqZC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-nightmares-3-bandai-namco-sony.jpg?itok=E_2hJc_A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could a&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>anime adaptation be on the cards?</figcaption></figure><p>This news comes just a couple of months after Bandai Namco <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-sales-2024-25" rel="nofollow">celebrated a strong year</a> in sales terms, with profits almost doubling on the previous year. That success likely comes as a result of the strong performance of 2024 releases like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-5m" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking!

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>'s next patch - 7.3, called The Promise of Tomorrow - finally has a release date.</p>
<p>As revealed in the latest Letter from the Producer livestream, along with a new trailer you can watch below, the patch will arrive on 5th August - just under two weeks away.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> previously stated this patch will round off the Dawntrail storyline, before the team slowly edges towards whatever storyline is next for the MMORPG. Judging by the trailer, we can expect plenty of drama in the kingdom of Alexandria.</p>

<p>As with every patch, the story continues along with a number of promised extras. This time, the second installment of the Echoes of Vana'diel alliance raid will be added, offering a nostalgic trip to Final Fantasy 11's San d'Oria.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 11 has seen a resurgence in players recently, in part due to this crossover with Final Fantasy 14. Yesterday, Square Enix announced it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/23-years-after-its-release-final-fantasy-11s-biggest-server-is-closed-to-new-players-due-to-popularity">closing the game's most popular server to new players due to overpopulation</a>.</p>
<p>Patch 7.3 will add:</p>
<ul>
<li>Main Scenario - The Promise of Tomorrow</li>
<li>New Alliance Raid - Echoes of Vana'diel - San d'Oria: The Second Walk</li>
<li>New Dungeon - The Meso Terminal</li>
<li>New Trial - ???</li>
<li>New Unreal Trial</li>
<li>New Treasure Dungeon</li>
<li>Crystalline Conflict Update</li>
<li>Weapon Enhancement Quests - Phantom Weapons</li>
<li>New Deep Dungeon - Pilgrim's Traverse</li>
<li>Allied Society Quests - Yok Huy</li>
<li>Inconceivably Further Hildibrand Adventures</li>
<li>Cosmic Exploration and Tool Enhancement Quests - Cosmic Tools</li>
<li>Chat Bubble Feature</li>
<li>New PvP Gear</li>
<li>New Mounts, Minions, and Emotes</li>
<li>Additional Duty Support</li>
<li>Additional Doman Mahjong Voices - Wuk Lamat, Koana, and Bakool Ja Ja</li>
</ul>
<p>It's an interesting time for Square Enix's flagship MMORPG. Dawntrail received a mixed reaction from the community and although patch additions like the Occult Crescent have been praised, the game anecdotally appears in decline.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://luckybancho.ldblog.jp/archives/59200105.html">unofficial fan census</a> shows player numbers are dwindling, while reddit threads are rife with Dawntrail criticism, both valid and excessive.</p>
<p>Typically, player numbers peak when a new expansion is released, so with patch 7.3 bringing Dawntrail to a conclusion, future patches should begin to set the scene for whatever is on the way next.

<figure><a title="Wild Hearts S Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157570/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Capcom effectively created a new genre with its famed <strong>Monster Hunter</strong> series back in the sixth generation of game consoles, and though many challengers over the years (such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dauntless">Dauntless</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/god_eater_3">God Eater</a>) have since tried to get a piece of its pie, nobody has quite managed to recreate its distinct magic. Koei Tecmo's Omega Force (of <strong>Dynasty Warriors</strong> fame) then decided to try its hand in 2023 with the release of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/wild_hearts">Wild Hearts</a>, but the game never really got too far off the ground despite positive reception from both fans and critics.</p>
<p>Now that the Switch 2 has come out, KT has decided to try giving its latest monster hunting foray another shot at success with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wild-hearts-s">Wild Hearts S</a>, a modest revisit that’s taking advantage of the distinct Monster Hunter-shaped hole in the Switch 2’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/every-switch-2-launch-game-ranked">launch window library</a>. Though it isn’t the roaring revival that some may have hoped it to be, Wild Hearts S still proves to be an enjoyable and engaging monster-hunting action game and one that I’d suggest newcomers look into.</p>
<figure><a title="Wild Hearts S Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157574/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The narrative in Wild Hearts places you in the role of a travelling hunter who comes to the land of Azuma in search of work and meaning after experiencing diminished demand for your services back home. Your services, of course, are hunting and killing Kemono, which are gigantic nature-themed monsters that threaten villages and their surrounding environment.</p>
<p>After getting absolutely <em>rolled</em> by a Deathstalker (basically a huge ice-themed wolf), your hunter meets a mysterious figure who grants him the power of Karakuri, which enables him to utilise spiritual energy threads in the land to create powerful constructs. Armed with this ability, you then head for the nearby town of Minato to help them out with their ongoing Kemono problem. It’s not all that gripping of a story, but there’s just enough here to keep you invested in the town and focused on protecting it from the endemic threats to its ecosystem.</p>
<figure><a title="Wild Hearts S Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157580/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gameplay in Wild Hearts adheres pretty closely to the systems that Monster Hunter popularised, focusing much of the experience on the simple, grindy loop of battling the gigantic Kemono monsters. Across four seasonally themed biomes, there are over 20 full-size Kemono species to take on here, and each brings with it a wealth of elemental attacks and tricks to keep you on your toes as you learn its moveset.</p>
<p>An initial battle against a Kemono can be a little rough as you get repeatedly blasted and beaten by its powerful blows, but experience and careful study soon teach you when to press the attack and when to run for cover or dodge. After killing one, it drops an assortment of unique items which you can then use to upgrade existing weapons and armour sets or build new ones that make it easier to take down even harder monsters.</p>
<p>Capcom got the progression system right with Monster Hunter and Omega Force was wise not to try reinventing the wheel with Wild Hearts—it's just as compelling here as it was there. Not only is there a clear sense of empowerment that comes from gaining actual stat buffs from getting better equipment, but you also just get <em>better</em> with practice as you learn each Kemono’s tells and become more efficient in dodging its attacks and exploiting its weaknesses. Plus, given the largely random nature of the rewards from felling yet another massive beast, there’s a strong ‘just one more’ element as you come up a bit short on materials needed for that next equipment upgrade you’ve been eyeing.</p>
<figure><a title="Wild Hearts S Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157561/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So far, so similar, but the main gimmick that sets Wild Hearts apart is the flexible Karakuri system, which adds some dynamic tools to your hunter’s arsenal. With this, you can summon various constructs, such as boxes or springs, into the field to give you an edge and support you in some way or throw off the Kemono’s assault. If you recognise a Kemono is about to charge, you can quickly build a wall of crates that’ll both block the charge and stun it. If you need a boost to your dwindling health and can’t get a moment to breathe and drink a healing potion, you can drop a healing mist that delivers an AoE effect to anyone in its radius.</p>
<p>The Karakuri system feels like it adds a much-needed ‘X factor’ to the fights to keep them feeling distinct, as they give you something else than just waling away at a Kemono for 10 minutes until it dies. Not only will different people favour different constructs, thus furthering player expression, but continuously unlocking new ones via an extensive skill tree means that there’s always something else to work towards beyond simply more weapons and armour. I really appreciated the various mobility and support options they offer, and hope to see more of this kind of thing in the genre as it evolves further.</p>
<figure><a title="Wild Hearts S Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157571/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I’d be remiss not to also mention the extensive selection of weapons on offer, which can really change up your combat approach and give you a lot more replayability to take the edge off of things feeling repetitive as you grind Kemono for rare drops. You can go with more traditional approaches, like the katana or bow, or more unconventional things like the Wagasa, which is a bladed umbrella that uniquely allows you to parry many Kemono attacks.</p>
<p>Each weapon has its own playstyle and quirks, and taking the time to explore them all really goes to show how much depth there is to the combat here, especially when paired with possibilities opened up by the Karakuri constructs.</p>
<p>It's tempting to hope that the ‘S’ in this release’s title indicates some sort of expansion content, perhaps akin to the ‘G rank’ quests that Capcom is keen to later include in its Monster Hunter games. Unfortunately, that’s not the case, and this Nintendo debut for Wild Hearts is more of a modest balance patch than anything else.</p>
<figure><a title="Wild Hearts S Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157562/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The main feature here is that you can now play co-op with four people (up from three in the original release), while monster behaviours and the stats of some weapons have been adjusted to make the experience a bit more enjoyable. If you already put a lot of time into Wild Hearts on other platforms anytime since it released in 2023, there’s not a lot you’re missing out on with the Switch 2 port besides the option to play it on the go.</p>
<p>And though it’s a lovely convenience that Wild Hearts is now playable on a portable console, it’s a bit disappointing that this release isn’t terribly well optimised. The original had its own share of performance issues and that’s clearly been carried over to the Switch 2; frame rates are all over the place and the visuals themselves are a little middling between the somewhat fuzzy resolution and flat textures.</p>
<p>It’s not a <em>mess</em> by any means, but seeing the visual hiccups—especially when the frame rate takes a sharp dive—can take you out of the experience a bit. This one might have benefited from a bit more time in the oven.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Wild Hearts S is a satisfying, if unspectacular, addition to the Switch 2’s early library. The monster hunting and equipment building is just as rewarding and addictive as you would hope, and there’s <em>tons</em> of replayability here whether you’re playing solo or with friends.</p>
<p>That being said, the technical performance is just <em>okay,</em> while the lack of any significant content additions to this re-release feels like a missed opportunity, especially if you previously played this on other platforms. I’d still give Wild Hearts a recommendation, as its blemishes don’t ultimately take too much away from its many strengths, but perhaps this is one to wait for a sale.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has revealed&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em>, the next major expansion for digital trading card game&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, and it's coming to Android and iOS next week.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky&nbsp;</em>will arrive on July 29th. This looks to be a full expansion along the lines of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-celestial-guardians-set" rel="nofollow">Celestial Guardians</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Space-Time Smackdown</em></a>, rather than a themed booster pack like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-extradimensional-crisis" rel="nofollow"><em>Extradimensional Crisis</em></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-eevee-grove" rel="nofollow"><em>Eevee Grove</em></a>.</p>

<p>As you've probably guessed, the expansion is based around the Generation 2 legendaries Ho-Oh and Lugia, who will be making their debut in&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-ho-oh-lugia.jpg?itok=euI8PCH9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-ho-oh-lugia.jpg?itok=vWoWbzGZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ho-Oh and Lugia will make their debut in next week's&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>They'll be joined by the three Gen 2 starters Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile, who are all represented by frankly adorable artwork. If you're a fan of the Gen 2 starters and want to see Chikorita and Totodile ahead of their&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">appearance in October</a>, this one's for you (sorry, Cyndaquil fans).</p>

<p>You can also look forward to the likes of a full art Pichu card, as well as new cards for Gen 2 stalwarts like Cleffa, the infamous red Gyarados that plays a key role in Gen 2's storyline, and more.</p>

<p>Eeveelutions Umbreon and Espeon will be getting new ex cards, and, of course, new Trainer cards will be making an appearance, including Supporters Lyra and Silver, as well as the new Rescue Scarf and Elemental Switch items.</p>

<p>If you want to get a sense for <em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em>'s theming and check out some of its new card art, you can do so right here via the expansion's trailer. I'm warning you, though: those starters really are dangerously cute.</p>




<p><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is available to download and play for free right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>.&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky&nbsp;</em>arrives across both systems on July 29th.</p>

With <em>Dorfromantik</em>, you can immerse yourself in a quiet, peaceful world at any time and take a break from everyday life. At the same time, Dorfromantik offers a challenge for those who are looking for one: To beat the high score, you need to carefully plan and strategically place your tiles.</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In <em>Dorfromantik</em> you start with a stack of procedurally generated tiles. One after the other, you draw the top tile of the stack, place it on one available slot and rotate for the best fit. Thereby groups and combinations of landscapes are formed, such as forests, villages or water bodies, and you are rewarded with points depending on how well the tile fits.</p><p>On some tiles you will also encounter special objects that give you a quest: For example, the windmill wants to border 6 grain fields, the locomotive wants to be connected to 10 tracks or the deer wants to inhabit a forest with at least 50 trees. Fulfill these quests to get more tiles to continue the expansion of your landscape. The game ends when the tile stack is used up.</p><p>As you expand the landscape, you can advance into new, colorful biomes and discover pre-placed game objects that give you long-term tasks. Through these tasks you can unlock new tiles, new biomes and new quests.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Building endless and beautiful landscapes.</li><li>Unique mix of strategy and puzzle mechanics.</li><li>Relaxing and calming gameplay.</li><li>Idyllic village scenery.</li><li>Strategic placement to beat the high score.</li><li>High replay value—every session is different.</li><li>Many unlockable tiles and biomes.</li><li>Original art style with hand-painted <a title="Genres > Board Game [58 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/board-game">board game</a> feel.</li></ul><p><strong>Not Features</strong></p><ul><li>4X strategy.</li><li>Trading.</li><li>Resource <a title="Genres > Management [30 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>.</li><li>Combat and violence.</li><li><a title="Genres > Multiplayer [557 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">Multiplayer</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Game Modes</strong></p><p><em>Dorfromantik</em> offers options for any style of play!

                <p dir="ltr">Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy was a very popular expansion to the three-decades-old card game, and based on its current sold-out status in most local game stores and big-box retailers, that popularity is still going strong. During Hasbro's <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/events/event-details/hasbro-second-quarter-2025-earnings-conference-call" rel="nofollow ">recent quarterly investor call</a> for Q2 2025, the company revealed that the set has already become the best-selling set in the game's history--and it only took one day to get there.</p><p dir="ltr">Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks revealed during the call that Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy sold $200 million worth of product in a single day. For reference, the previous MTG collaboration set--2023's The Lord Of The Rings--needed six months to reach the $200 million milestone. Cocks went on to say that the set could have made even more on day one, but the company "left demand on the table."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4537645-zidane.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537645" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4537645-zidane.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537645"></a><figcaption>Zidane, Tantalus Thief</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4537645-zidane.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We couldn’t produce enough," Cocks said. "I think we increased production runs on it four times pre-release. It was substantially--by many, many very high double-digit percentages--ahead of any other production run we’ve ever done, and we left the market wanting more.”</p><p dir="ltr">Those still looking for Final Fantasy cards despite its current sold-out status will be happy to know that Hasbro is planning to keep production going on the set, as Hasbro CFO Gina Goetter confirmed during the call. "We’re continuing to produce this set," Goetter said. "We think the set itself is going to have a huge long tail."</p><p dir="ltr">While players wait for Final Fantasy to be restocked, the next in-universe MTG set is nearly upon us, as the space-opera-themed Edge of Eternities launches August 1. After that, the Marvel's Spider-Man expansion will launch September 12, while an Avatar: The Last Airbender set will round out the year on November 21.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Mafia series has long been a contemporary of franchises like GTA and Saints Row, but its focus has always been much more narrow than those sprawling games. From the very first Mafia game, the goal was to deliver a playable classic mob movie, making for a familiar pastiche of themes and characters. The first game was technically an open world in that you drove between mission hubs, but it was largely focused on its narrative. For its latest game, Mafia: The Old Country, 2K is similarly focused. GameSpot spoke with executive producer Devin Hitch and game director Alex Cox about the change in setting and a renewed focus on making combat feel intimate and personal.</p><p dir="ltr">The previous games have slowly become more modern, starting in the 1930s and then venturing into the 1940s and 1950s in Mafia 2 and finally the 1960s in Mafia 3. Aside from brief interstitial stories, they've also all taken place across a fictionalized United States. That makes this setting, 1900s Sicily, a significant change for the series, but one that won't be unfamiliar to fans of organized-crime fiction.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="985871299"

We go back to the project, the franchise pillars to figure out what would make for a new 'Mafia' game, what we want it to be different about this one. And in some ways, what we want about it to be the same. And when we look at Mafia, the Mafia series and what was done in the previous three games, they start to become this story of organized crime in the 20th century. Visiting different historical eras that are very iconic, very familiar to a mainstream audience. Players will have seen Godfather, 'Goodfellas', Untouchables, all of the kinds of movies that define very iconic eras in organized-crime history."</p><p dir="ltr">Making a prequel was a conscious decision too, to give new players a fresh start if they haven't played a Mafia game before. Cox hints that returning players will notice some references to later games as well, since the Mafia series has had a loose but unmistakable continuity.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Sicilian Mafia is the forbearer of the US mafia, the criminal tradition that gave the Mafia its name. [They] coined the term that became the way that we all describe organized crime internationally now, [and it] was born in Sicily at a very particular time and for very particular reasons. And so we found that interesting. We found it interesting because it's a different environment than the American urban cities that we've visited in the past.</p><p dir="ltr">"And also in everybody's head there is this mystique and fascination with those, the Sicilian mafia, it's less well known. There's more to discover for players who are interested, particularly fans of crime genre, it's something that's less well trod than those other eras that maybe we've done before. And if you've seen any of the Godfather movies, you know that there's sections, each of them has sections set in Sicily and the tradition, the way that the guys refer to it. The old country comes from the way that American mobsters often refer to Sicily as they're talking to one another in crime movies and TV shows."</p><p dir="ltr">Those pop-culture touchstones are no accident. More than many other series, Mafia has always been very clearly inspired and paying homage to classic organized-crime stories like The Godfather and Goodfellas. Cox acknowledges that it "wears its heart on its sleeve" and the series has intentionally made some of its characters and plot points recognizable. As the series has continued, though, it's progressed into more original storytelling.</p><p dir="ltr">"We have moved away from that, over the years, to tell more original stories," Cox said. "However, part of the promise that we want to make to players is that you are playing a character in those movies. If you're a fan of the crime genre, you're going to have that fantasy. That's the fantasy in your head, isn't it? To be the main character in those movies. And so we always try and find a nice mix there of touch points that are familiar, our own original content and our own original, let's say universe, and our stories that we tell inside there. So that's the balance really."</p><p dir="ltr">The largest change to Mafia: The Old Country probably comes to its combat, which seems aimed at becoming more personal and up-close. Mafia has always aimed for more grounded storytelling than its contemporaries--in the very first Mafia game, a rival mob sending a handful of enforcers to assault your crew was seen as a major escalation in an ongoing conflict. The Old Country pushes that idea even further with the introduction of knife fights, a grisly close-quarters style of fighting that was common before the advent of automatic weapons.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4537267-ss_8c5af3a1b47337fe9d2f4f48d21975964eb23ccb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537267" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4537267-ss_8c5af3a1b47337fe9d2f4f48d21975964eb23ccb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537267"></a><figcaption>Mafia: The Old Country</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4537267-ss_8c5af3a1b47337fe9d2f4f48d21975964eb23ccb.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We are set in a rural setting and everybody lives to some extent in an agricultural or a rural economy," Cox explained. "So the weapons of the farmer or the poacher is part of it too, to try and evoke that feeling of this quite impoverished. When you imagine Sicily in your head, it's this dusty, hard-scrabble environment. And that's really what we wanted to put across in the whole combat design in addition to the firearms themselves. And then likewise, there's a long tradition of knife-fighting and using knives in Sicily, which derive from their common use in this agricultural setting. And then also lots of different types of knives that specialize for different usages, but then obviously became associated with Sicilian gangsters and organized crime over time."</p><p dir="ltr">The idea of knife fights went through several different iterations. The team started with giant knives, "almost like swords" as Cox describes it, which were the ones most associated with Sicilian knife-fighting. That idea became impractical during development, but the end result is a more versatile system with several types of knives that imbue you with different skills.</p><p dir="ltr">Hitch added that the team did research around Sicilian knife-fighting, especially in the pre-production phase, and found that it was considered almost like a martial art, and local artisans put great care into the production of these knives as tools and weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">"We sent some folks to Sicily, actually, to look at how these knives were crafted, because there's a really beautiful artistic quality to some of these," Hitch said. "And then we actually met with some of the knife smiths, the guys who are actually making these, and they've been doing it in a very similar way for the last 150 years or so. So there's some really cool, interesting stuff that lit a creative fire for us in pre-production. And then we're really proud to see how that's translated to the screen, and it is a new mechanic in the game that we haven't had before."</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes that research revealed gruesome details as well. Cox said there was one particularly grisly description of an argument between rival clans that broke out over who laid claim to a bench in a church, leading to a massive knife fight in the town square with multiple casualties. To capture this level of violence, Hitch said the tech and character artists worked out ways to produce procedural blood marks from your fights, which appear on characters' bodies and pool on their clothes. All of this was made to help achieve one of its key goals, which is to make the violence feel real and impactful.</p><p dir="ltr">"That was something that was really attractive in terms of storytelling, because one of the things in previous Mafia games that we have always wanted to do, was get more up close and personal with some of the key antagonists, or let's say 'bosses' in the game," Hitch said. "And because we're such a realistic game, we're not a superhero game or things like that, there was not necessarily as much opportunity to get really up close and personal when you're doing gunplay. There's this distance."</p><p dir="ltr">Cox added that the knife fights present "a great opportunity for us to get up close and personal with story characters and fight out the last minutes of their lives, looking at their faces with the cutscenes and cinematic presentation you'd expect from that, which in the past we were not able to do."</p><p dir="ltr">Guns are still present in Mafia: The Old Country, but the setting means they aren't as omnipresent as they have been in previous games--particularly Mafia 3. Hitch noted that in that game, set in the 1960s, Lincoln Clay was a Vietnam veteran, and the gameplay was built around the time period and his experiences. That meant he had ready access to lots of weapons, ammo, and grenades at any given time. The Old Country, by comparison, wants to make you feel more scrappy, needing to scrounge for limited resources and make calculations about what to do with them.</p><p dir="ltr">"That was something that we really felt jived super well with this hard-scrabble, resource-depleted environment of 1900 Sicily," Cox said. "So we introduced ideas, the resources to the player are scarcer than Mafia: Definitive Edition, for example. So you have to be a bit more considerate in how you use your ammunition. We introduced the idea of looting enemies to find bullets and other combat resources as you play through those encounters. And generally we dialed up the challenge a little bit so the feeling is a kind of surviving in some of these dangerous encounters. Rather than if I was to use the Lincoln Clay, Mafia III example of charging in there in a military sense. Enzo [the Old Country protagonist] has to play through these combat encounters in a more tactical and considered manner because of those things, limited resources and slightly raised combat challenge."</p><p dir="ltr">There are still large-scale gunfights, which Cox said exercises some "artistic license" on Sicilian history, and once in a while you will need to stock up and prepare for a large encounter. But it requires some more prep and looting bodies, as opposed to Lincoln Clay calling in a supply drop.</p><p dir="ltr">"When you're Enzo, there is a point at which everything that you brought with you starts to run dry," Hitch said. "And that's when you start thinking, 'Okay, how am I going to get to that next body to get a few more bullets or a bandage or something like that so that I can keep going?' And that's one of the things that I really like about the combat--ultimately my play style, I go in quiet and eventually I get spotted and then I have to start shooting my way out and then that's when I start getting scarce on resources. So I think it definitely makes you think, and that's one of the things that we wanted in our combat was to be intentional in that regard."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4537266-ss_44047e62744c4a7201a0238994d23f3ca72649cb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537266" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4537266-ss_44047e62744c4a7201a0238994d23f3ca72649cb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537266"></a><figcaption>Mafia: The Old Country</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4537266-ss_44047e62744c4a7201a0238994d23f3ca72649cb.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Cox said that the system is made to be dynamic, so resources will wane as necessary to make sure you're kept in a "zone of scarcity" to keep combat tense. That also helped facilitate the idea of knife fights as your trusty sidearm that never runs out of ammo, "something you can turn to in these moments of desperation." Ultimately the goal is to have an ebb and flow of different types of combat encounters with different feelings.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've got choreographed shootouts where ammo scarcity and things like that aren't part of the design formula," Cox said. "And then we have extended periods in various missions where you are playing your own ways. Where you can choose whether you go stealthy, whether you go loud, how to approach the objective. So again, like every previous Mafia game, there's a rollercoaster of different experiences from game to end."</p><p dir="ltr">Mafia: The Old Country is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on August 8.</p>

            <p>The developer of Wuchang: Fallen Feathers has acknowledged issues with the game's performance and promised a patch is on the way.</p>
<p>The soulslike, from Chinese studio Leenzee and publisher 505 Games, released yesterday and has already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuchang-fallen-feathers-follows-in-black-myth-wukongs-footsteps-with-strong-steam-launch">racked up a significant concurrent player count on Steam</a> that exceeds other games in the genre. However, player reviews are Mostly Negative, citing issues with the game's performance owing to its use of Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>"We have received reports regarding issues such as the game's optimisation not meeting expectations, errors in distributing pre-order rewards, and some abnormal pricing," said the team in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498327923676151994">statement on Steam</a>. "These problems should never have occurred, and we deeply regret the inconvenience and negative experience some players are currently facing."</p>

<p>It continued: "We are confident in the game's performance within our recommended spec but we're working on optimisation. We are looking to issue a patch as soon as we can."</p>
<p>The team has linked to an <a href="https://support.505games.com/support/solutions/150000215541">FAQ</a> to assist with any issues. Eurogamer previously detailed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ahead-of-its-release-later-this-month-wuchang-fallen-feathers-pc-specs-revealed-and-theyre-surprisingly-modest">PC specs for Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>.</p>
<p>Leenzee is also aware of pricing anomalies in some regions and is working with Steam to restore the correct pricing.</p>
<p>Lastly, the studio found a bug in the reward distribution preventing players from receiving the correct items after pre-ordering the standard and deluxe editions. This will also be fixed in the future patch. Those impacted will receive a free digital soundtrack as a token of goodwill, while deluxe edition purchasers will receive an additional exclusive bonus costume.</p>
<p>"We are fully committed to investigating and resolving these issues as quickly as possible," said the studio. "Our team is prioritising these problems at the highest level, striving to fix and handle everything promptly to ensure you have the best possible gaming experience.</p>
