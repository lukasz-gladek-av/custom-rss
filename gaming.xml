Loves both eating and <a title="Genres > Cooking [12 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a>, and apparently really enjoys serving her cooking to customers at Fuwa Fuwa Cafe. Is actually Shiro’s friend on the online game Magic Angel, so they knew each other before actually meeting in real life.</li><li><strong>Favna</strong> – <em>“I am the Slayer of the False God, the Queen of the Kingdom of Darkness, the All-Seeing Oracle, the Guardian of the Dream of All Things—“</em> A mysterious girl dressed in gothic Lolita fashion. Speaks in riddles and demands the protagonist become her familiar. She sometimes accidentally drops the edgy act when she’s taken by surprise though, so maybe she’s just got a serious case of chuunibyou…?</li><li><strong>Honoka</strong> – <em>“Ya want a thrivin’ business? That there sounds like a job for our shrine!”</em> A girl with a Kansaiben dialect who works as a shrine maiden at her family shrine. Practically in charge of the shrine, she is reliable and very good at handling money, and has a strong sense of responsibility to boot.

Make sure to give the right girl the right job! For example, Shiro is always enthusiastic to serve customers, and Miyu is great in the kitchen.</p><p>Of course, you can’t just sit there while they work. During opening hours, you’ll also have to make coffee and help out on the floor, so it’s not as easy as it sounds!</p><p><strong>The Stunning Sights of Nipponbashi</strong></p><p>In order to recreate the atmosphere of the real Nipponbashi, the game features several real stores you can find there, such as Surugaya, Sofmap, Dragon Star, Super Potato, and Karaoke Rainbow, among many others. Don’t forget to pay them a visit when you’re shopping or taking one of your maids on a date!</p><p><strong>Collectable Capsule Toys</strong></p><p>If you’ve been to the real Nipponbashi, you’ll know that there are capsule toy machines all over the area. In this game, you can also try your hand at collecting your favorite capsule toy series and experience that unique gacha thrill of not knowing what you’re getting. As you collect more toys, you can even bring them up in conversations with the girls. Keep cranking those machines until you’ve collected them all!</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is rdein, creator of the <em>Momodora</em> series. Recently my team and I have announced the latest installment in the series, <em>Moonlit Farewell</em>. This is a concluding story, following through from the events of <em>Momodora III</em>. With this new tale, I also intend to close the book on many of the past games’ mysteries and questions.</p><p>I’m aware that many players are more familiar with the story of Kaho, which is set in a distant past. As such, I’m designing <em>Moonlit Farewell</em> to be as enjoyable as possible without prior knowledge of <em>Momodora I</em> to <em>III</em>‘s stories. Moreover, the series has always been focused on action and minimal stories. So please, don’t worry too much about “catching up”!</p><p>Lastly, we hope to bring you our best game with this new title, using all the knowledge we’ve learned in the past ten years. So please don’t forget to head over to the Steam page and hit that wishlist button, and stay tuned for the <em>Momodora: Moonlit Farewell</em>!</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-state-of-play-games-might-we-see/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>First and foremost, before we dive any further in, let’s be entirely clear that this is purely speculation until we receive additional confirmation regarding any of the State of Play games. Numerous leaks regarding Sony’s showcasing point to many teasers and gameplay trailers. Here’s what we might see at State of Play!</p>



<h2 id="h-potential-state-of-play-games">Potential State of Play Games</h2>



<p>Again, this is pure speculation until we receive a concrete schedule from PlayStation regarding its State of Play address. For now, here’s what we <em>might </em>see and what I’m hoping to see!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</strong></li>



<li><strong>Path of Exile 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Judas</strong></li>



<li><strong>New World (PS5)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Horizon: Zero Dawn Remastered</strong></li>



<li><strong>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</strong></li>



<li><strong>Ghost of Tsushima 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Until Dawn Remaster</strong></li>



<li><strong>LEGO Horizon Adventures</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dragon’s Dogma 2 Expansion</strong></li>



<li><strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silent Hill 2 Remake</strong></li>



<li><strong>Resident Evil IX</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Personally, I’m most excited to see anything and everything about Resident Evil IX, Metal Gear Solid Delta, Ghost of Tsushima 2, and Path of Exile 2. Oh, and Judas!</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-state-of-play">When is State of Play?</h2>



<p>Sony announced that its State of Play will be held on <strong>Tuesday</strong>, <strong>September 25, at 6 pm ET/11pm BST</strong>. The entire show will last approximately 30 minutes and showcase 20 or more titles. </p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-watch-state-of-play">Where to Watch State of Play</h2>



<p>You can watch the entire State of Play on one of PlayStation’s official channels, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVs0suPHAX8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a></li>
</ul>



<p>You’ll want to tune in early to ensure you connect to the stream without issues. Sometimes, the Twitch stream works a little faster than the YouTube one, and vice versa, so check both out before deciding where to watch!</p>



<hr>



<p>On the topic of PlayStation, we recently reported on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-is-the-ps5-anniversary-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost of the PlayStation 5 Anniversary Edition</a>. It’s a whopping price tag, but it’s worthwhile for collectors!

That's one of the best prices we've seen for a 2TB PS5-compatible SSD from a reputable brand. It also happens to be one of the fastest PCI-E 4.0 SSDs on the market right now. This is an outstanding candidate for your PS5 or gaming PC rig.</p><h2>SK Hynix P41 Platinum 2TB M.2 SSD for $134.99</h2><div id="161786" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>SK Hynix Platinum P41 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD</h3></p></div><p>SK Hynix might not be a brand that the consumer recognizes as much as Samsung or Western Digital, but make no mistake that they are a major player in the flash memory market. SK Hynix is a South Korean DRAM manufacturer and one of the world's largest memory chipmakers and semiconductor companies. They supply components for many reputable brands you've probably heard of, like Corsair and G.Skill.</p><p>The Platinum P41 is SK Hynix's highest end SSD. It boasts sustained read speeds of 7,000MB/s and sustained write speeds of 6,500MB/s. It also boasts random read speeds of 1.4 million IOPS and random write speeds of 1.3 million IOPS. In terms of reliability and stability, the SSDs have been tested and validated through 1,000 hours of stress testing with MTBF reaching 1.5 million hours or up to 1,200TB written. SK Hynix backs it all up with a 5 year warranty. The P41 Platinum uses an Aries controller with 176-layer TLC NAND flash chips, both of which are manufactured in-house.</p><p>Of course, in terms of real world performance, the vast majority of users won't be able to tell apart the speeds between the highest end PCI-E 4.0 SSDs. Some of these SSDs include the <a href="https://zdcs.link/qmmDw?object_uuid=2700c67f-463d-4174-8813-7896fa99c488&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SK Hynix P41 Platinum</a>, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Z446D?object_uuid=2700c67f-463d-4174-8813-7896fa99c488&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Samsung 990 Pro</a>, and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/X641Y?object_uuid=2700c67f-463d-4174-8813-7896fa99c488&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WD Black SN850X</a>. Therefore, it all comes down to the price. At its current price point, the P41 Platinum isn't just one of the fastest drives on the market, it's also cheaper than any competitor that can come close to its performance.</p><h3>This is a great PS5 SSD, but you'll want to get a heatsink</h3><p>The SK Hynix P41 Platinum does not come equipped with a heatsink. That's because this SSD is catered to PC gamers looking to add storage to their desktop computer. Many motherboards come equipped with built-in SSD coolers and will only accept bare SSDs. It's generally harder to remove a heatsink than to apply a new one. If you plan to use this for your PS5, rest assured that' it is 100% compatible (in fact, it's overkill). Although some people have gotten away with an SSD with no heatsink, we recommend you install one for peace of mind. You can easily get a <a href="https://zdcs.link/OGrjj?object_uuid=2700c67f-463d-4174-8813-7896fa99c488&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS5 heatsink for under $10</a>.</p><p><em>Looking for more options?

            <p>
Sony and developer Shift Up are being sued by Louisiana-based film production company Stellarblade, which - in case you haven't already guessed where this is going - is alleging trademark infringement following the release of this year's PS5 action-adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellarblade-trademark-lawsuit-sony-shift-up">reported by IGN</a>, the complaint was filed in a Louisiana court earlier this month by Stellarblade LLC and its owner, Griffith Chambers Mehaffey. It's specifically targeting Sony, Shift Up, and and Sony's unnamed liability insurance company, amid claims Stellarblade's business (that's the film company) is being damaged by Stellar Blade (the game's) use of the name.
</p>
<p>
Stellarblade was established to provide "multimedia entertainment services" - including film, documentary, and music video production - in 2010, and Mehaffey is said to have owned the domain stellarblade.com since 2006. In the complaint, Mehaffey claims his customers have been unable to easily find information about his business online since the game formerly known as Project Eve was re-revealed under the name Stellar Blade in 2021.

<p>
In a statement provided to IGN, Mehaffey's lawyer expanded on the latter point, adding, "The defendants' far superior resources have effectively monopolised online search results for Stellarblade, pushing Mr. Mehaffey's long-established business into digital obscurity and threatening the livelihood he's built over more than a decade."
</p>
<p>
Mehaffey also argues Shift Up and Sony's Stellar Blade trademark (filed in January 2023) is "confusingly similar" to his own Stellarblade trademark (filed in June 2023), citing similar colour schemes and a stylised 'S'. He's seeking damages and attorney fees if his legal action is successful, and is requesting Shift Up and Sony be prevented from using Stellar Blade or any other similar name in the future - and that all Stellar Blade material in their possession is handed over to be destroyed.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Jessica Orr quite liked Stellar Blade when it launched earlier this year, celebrating its "moreish combat and bizarrely appealing lack of personality" in her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">four star review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/twitchcon-2024-protest-chevron-palestine-hilton<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TwitchCon took place in San Diego over the weekend, and though I was not able to attend this year, I can confirm that at least one grand (read: regrettably necessary) tradition was alive and well: protest. Following a Marriott hotel workers’ strike that was <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-hotel-strike-was-the-talk-of-this-years-twitchcon-1830077660" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the talk of the event in 2018</a>, TwitchCon 2024 was the site of two separate protests: one in favor of <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2024/09/17/san-diego-city-council-passes-resolution-supporting-striking-hotel-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a better contract for workers at a different hotel</a>, the Hilton San Diego Bayfront, and another against TwitchCon itself over a sponsorship deal with Chevron, which <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/east-bay/protesters-urge-chevron-to-divest-amid-war-in-gaza/3551411/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continues to support Israel</a> to the tune of millions of dollars.</p><p>Creators posted <a href="https://x.com/brethamilton/status/1837310234861478311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">videos</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Thafnine/status/1836888901765452172" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">images</a> of both protests, with some <a href="https://x.com/xocheergurlox/status/1837926211621642749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in favor</a> and others <a href="https://x.com/The_Man_Animal/status/1837303247499055615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opposed</a>, confused, trolling, or, when it came to the pro-Palestine assembly, <a href="https://x.com/Liutauras_/status/1837331107945001045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bizarre combination of the three</a>. A few smaller streamers, like Bret "Cinemarxism" Hamilton and Austin "Gremloe" MacNamara, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2256970916?filter=archives&amp;sort=time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spent time with protesters</a> of both causes and <a href="https://x.com/gremloe/status/1837652844444635290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advocated for them</a> (the latter also covered pro-Palestine protests <a href="https://aftermath.site/democratic-national-convention-creators-palestine-tiktok-instagram-twitchhttps://aftermath.site/democratic-national-convention-creators-palestine-tiktok-instagram-twitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the Democratic National Convention</a> last month).&nbsp;</p><p>Some creators took Hilton protesters’ side despite being inconvenienced personally. Culinary influencer Tricia "Triciaisabirdy" Wang, for example, <a href="https://x.com/triciaisabirdy/status/1837579367310070064" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted at Hilton Hotels</a> that she hadn't "slept in days" because protesters would "start chanting and banging drums outside my room" every single morning. Then she proposed a solution: "Give them a raise."</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Protestors from San Diego BDS and <a href="https://twitter.com/codepink?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@codepink</a> are protesting outside of Twitchcon, calling out the main sponsor of the event, Chevron, for their involvement in the genocide of Palestinians. </p><p>This marks the beginning of a week long focus from BDS National targeting Chevron. <a href="https://t.co/H6RMKbhaLS">pic.twitter.com/H6RMKbhaLS</a></p></div>— Bret 🍉 (@brethamilton) <a href="https://twitter.com/brethamilton/status/1837304998130274546?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>As for Chevron, protesters <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sandiegobds/reel/DAJ4BinSU_s/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from San Diego’s BDS (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions) movement</a> lined up just outside the convention center and shouted things like “TwitchCon, TwitchCon, you can’t hide, you’re sponsored by genocide.” Chevron’s presence at TwitchCon is unfortunate, but far from unprecedented. Last year, Chevron <a href="https://passionfru.it/twitch-advertising-young-people-gen-z-15038/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had its own booth at the show</a>, while Shell <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/climate-deniers/after-decades-climate-deception-shell-uses-fortnite-court-demographic-most" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threw money at <em>Fortnite </em>streamers</a> in an apparent effort to win over a younger crowd that’s skeptical of fossil fuels and fearful of climate change. Difference is, back then Chevron had yet to spend nearly a year aiding and abetting a genocide, though it had already by that point <a href="https://afsc.org/chevron-fuels-israeli-apartheid-and-war-crimes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helped fuel Israel’s apartheid state</a>. </p><p>Chevron is not even remotely the first to target Twitch as a means of whitewashing crimes against humanity; both the <a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-forces-u-s-army-to-stop-tricking-viewers-with-f-1844405124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">US Army</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/navy-twitch-stream-spirals-out-of-control-due-to-slur-1845051780" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Navy</a> have sponsored and streamed on Twitch, going so far as to <a href="https://kotaku.com/u-s-navy-follows-army-in-banning-twitch-viewers-asking-1844445873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ban viewers for asking about war crimes in chat</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>After speaking with members of the San Diego BDS movement, one streamer, WitchyTwitchy, decided to lend support from inside the convention.</p><p>"I'm here at TwitchCon paying a visit to TwitchCon's deadliest sponsor this year, Chevron," she said in <a href="https://x.com/witchytwitchytv/status/1838085498457166276" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a video filmed in front of Chevron's booth</a>. "Chevron is literally fueling, via gas and money, the genocide in Gaza. I'm a Twitch streamer, I love coming to TwitchCon, and I understand that sponsors are needed, and it may be hard to find an ethical sponsor from a big corporation. But the least we can do is maybe ask Twitch to not get sponsored by a company literally fueling genocide – especially when Twitch is a company that claims to value diversity and inclusion. I would like to remind them that Palestinian streamers are also on their platform, and maybe [they should] not get sponsors that are killing their families."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/netease-subsidiary-skybox-labs-lays-off-25-people/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Canadian developer Skybox Labs has laid off 25 staff members. Skybox Labs is a subsidiary of NetEase, a Chinese company that has acquired many different companies over time. This included Grasshopper Manufacture, Quantic Dream, and Skybox Labs, for example. In addition to acquiring all of these studios, they've helped establish additional studios globally, often headed by industry veterans such as Greg Street and David Vonderhaar. The layoffs at Skybox Labs were announced on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/skyboxlabs_today-we-informed-our-studio-that-we-made-activity-7242279185761607680-Xesv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn five days ago in a statement</a>. "Despite all our best efforts, we are not immune to the unprecedented challenges that have impacted so many companies in the industry."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocksteady-reportedly-hit-by-layoffs-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop/">layoffs</a> throughout the industry continue to rise, with the number reaching well over&nbsp; 12,700 in this year alone. The statement continues on to say that "every impacted employee will be fully supported through severance, extended benefits, career transition service, and connection to other resources to provide them with the assistance they require during this difficult time." Compared to other studios, this is generous despite the awful situation for those affected. Many companies have come under fire for laying off their staff in brutal and blunt ways and not providing them with any benefits or severance. One particular company that has come under fire multiple times for their <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-revenue-way-below-projections-layoffs-playstation-restructuring/">layoffs is Bungie</a>. They have experienced multiple layoffs this year, and considering how they are doing financially, it's possible that they will have more layoffs as shareholders pressure them to <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/">restructure the company</a>.</p>
<p>Skybox Labs was acquired by NetEase at the beginning of 2023 and is well known for its work on games such as Halo, Minecraft, and Age of Empires. It's currently unknown whether they are looking to develop any of their own games or whether they will continue to collaborate with other studios to assist in the development of other games.</p>
<p>If Skybox Labs was laid off only a year after being acquired by NetEase, it's possible that other NetEase subsidiaries will face layoffs. It hasn't been said directly whether NetEase issued the layoffs or whether they came from within the company.</p>
<p>NetEase came under fire just last month, after deciding to <a href="https://wccftech.com/visions-of-mana-studio-to-close-down-as-netease-and-tencent-pare-down-their-japanese-investments/">shut down Ouka Studios</a>, the developers behind Visions of Mana. The studio was launched in 2020 by NetEase, and it's said that only a handful of jobs remained by the end of Visions of Mana's development. NetEase refused to comment regarding the reported closure, and it was never explained why the company needed to close down, especially after making such a<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/visions-of-mana-ps5/"> successful game</a> that Square Enix published.</p>

<p>There is no shortage of cozy, casual games available on the market today. You can spend your time farming in Stardew Valley, catching creatures in Pokemon, or building a castle in Tiny Glade. You have options! But can you play Tiny Glade on Nintendo Switch? Is that an option?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-tiny-glade-releasing-on-nintendo-switch">Is Tiny Glade Releasing On Nintendo Switch?</h2>



<p>Tiny Glade looks like the perfect game for the Nintendo Switch, right? Unfortunately, developer Pounce Light doesn’t think so. When asked about the cozy castle-building game coming to Switch, they said it’s “unlikely, sorry,” as the game is optimized for PC, and the Nintendo Switch is below the minimum recommended specifications for the game.</p>



<p>If you want to play Tiny Glade on a handheld, you must wait for someone to create a community controller layout for the Steam Deck, as the game doesn’t currently have Steam Deck support, either.</p>



<p>Quickly, since we’re on the top of other platforms for Tiny Glade, others did ask about the game on mobile, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Currently, there’s no word of a console port, and a mobile port is definitely out of the question, as the game can’t run on a Nintendo Switch.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-suing-palworld-developer-pocketpair">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-suing-palworld-developer-pocketpair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo and The Pokemon Company Suing Palworld Developer Pocketpair</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-what-is-tiny-glade">What is Tiny Glade?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Pounce Light</figcaption></figure>



<p>Tiny Glade is described as a “diorama builder,” in which you construct castles, villages, ruins, and cottages out in the wild. The building system is completely gridless, allowing for free-form construction as you change the color of the walls, the pathing, the windows and decorations, and so much more.</p>



<p>It’s meant as a relaxing game where you can turn off your brain and chill. There’s no combat, no quests, and nothing pressing you for time. It’s just a chill experience. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24252493/delta-ios-emulator-online-multiplayer-nintendo-ds<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The excellent Delta emulator for iOS is going to get even better: sometime soon, the app will get support for online multiplayer in Nintendo DS games, according to Delta developer <a href="https://www.threads.net/@rileytestut/post/DARNtdxuQun">Riley Testut</a>. Testut’s post about the feature includes a video of a <em>Mario Kart DS</em> race between two people being played on the emulator, and it immediately transported me back to playing the game on my own DS many years ago.</p><p>Nintendo shut down the DS’s online services way back <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/26/5452180/nintendo-wi-fi-connection-ending-in-may">in 2014</a>, so we asked Testut how the online services will work. “It’s based on melonDS’ online support, which connects to 3rd-party Nintendo [Wi-Fi Connection] servers (such as Kaeru, Wimmfi, AltWFC, etc),” Testut tells <em>The Verge</em>. “This means all&nbsp;10 million+&nbsp;Delta users will be able to connect to other Delta users&nbsp;and&nbsp;users on real devices who are using these 3rd-party Nintendo WFC servers.”</p><p>However, “this also means it is limited to Nintendo DS games for now, but all Nintendo DS games with Nintendo WFC are supported,” Testut says. The Delta team doesn’t plan to host its own server, so online multiplayer will be free when it’s available for everyone.</p><p>You might have to wait a bit before you can try the online multiplayer for yourself. Testut says that the feature is coming first in a beta version of Delta for <a href="https://www.patreon.com/rileyshane">Patreon subscribers</a>. “We don’t have a public release date yet,” Testut says. While disappointing, that means you have plenty of time to get some <em>Mario Kart DS</em> practice in. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>But you'll have to wait for the "pause" bit.</p>

            <p>
If you're a traditionalist who kind of wishes <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> had stuck to the series' classic real-time with pause combat roots instead of taking a swerve into new-fangled turn-based territory, there's now - as they say - a mod for that. Sort of.
</p>
<p>
Modder tinybike has just <a href="https://github.com/tinybike/Brawl">released</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/one-baldur-s-gate-3-modder-managed-to-implemented-real-time-combat-like-the-classic-games-but-you-should-probably-wait-for-them-to-figure-out-a-pause-button-before-diving-in/">PC Gamer</a>) what they call a "very very very rough draft" of a real-time combat mod for Baldur's Gate 3. Which is to say, the real-time part of the equation is now there, but the critical "with pause" bit currently isn't implemented, meaning players are likely to get wiped off the face of Faerûn before making much progress.
</p>
<p>
Still, tinybike doesn't think adding pause functionality should be especially difficult. "I think because of the way I'm doing combat, which is basically by forcing everything to remain technically out-of-combat," they explained in a comment beneath a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEBW4qIW28c">video of the mod in action</a>, "pausing should actually be pretty simple."
</p>
<figure>

<p>
"I think it's just a matter of clicking the button to drop into turn-based mode," they continued. "Not 100 percent sure this actually behaves the way you'd expect a NWN-style RTwP system to behave though, I will have to mess with it and see."
</p>
<p>
And if that's not enough to dissuade from giving the "very barebones" mod a go, tinybike has an additional warning, noting there's a very good reason players should avoid attempting the campaign with it installed right now: it doesn't play particularly nice with Baldur's Gate 3's reams of chatter. "You will get butchered in real-time," they explain, "while the dialogue is happening."
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, it's a promising start to a mod that just might warm the nostalgia-hued hearts of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> purists. And you can expect plenty more where that came from, now that Baldur's Gate 3 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modding-is-pretty-big-says-baldurs-gate-3-director-as-over-1m-mods-are-installed-in-less-than-24-hours">has official mod support</a> - not that its absence stopped eager modders from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-baldurs-gate-3-mods-to-make-or-break-combat">getting stuck in</a> before then.

			<p>First posted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com.cn/assassins-creed-codename-red/51099/video/ci-ke-xin-tiao-ying-kai-fa-zhe-ri-zhi-di-er-ji" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN China</a>, a new dev diary has surfaced online and showcases some of the gameplay in the upcoming game Assassin's Creed Shadows. The footage is just under five minutes long and shows off the dynamic world that players can expect to dive into when the game releases. Considering the popularity of the site that posted the footage, it's likely that the dev diary will very quickly be taken down. More and more leaks about the upcoming Assassin's Creed game continue to surface, including ones recently speaking about some of the features that will be included in the game. The features include a dynamic weather system, which will affect the gameplay.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: World Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zKua34QXhMA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For example, when it is raining in-game, it means that enemies won't be able to hear your movements, as they will be muffled by the rainfall. Alternatively, if you have to cross a large body of water, you may have to find that you wait until winter, when the water will be frozen over, and you can traverse the ice.</p>
<p>The footage shown showcases the new animation style that is being tested out in Assassin's Creed Shadows, hoping to make a more immersive world for those who plan on playing the game. Additionally, players are introduced to their 'Hideout.' It's been described as having one acre of land, where the player will be able to build their base of operations and build something similar to an armory, as well as a dojo and an altar. The buildings will be fully customizable, allowing players to make the buildings look however they want them to, as well as being able to change aspects such as the design of the roof or the color of the walls.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-red-exclusive-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive footage shown to Insider Gaming</a>, they got to get a sneak peek further into the Hideout and what it will entail. It was said to be similar to that of the building in Valhalla, but heavily improved on.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows seems to be shaping up as <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gamescom-preview-the-most-visually-advanced-assassins-creed-to-date/">their most ambitious game yet</a>, despite it being smaller than Valhalla and bigger than Mirage. Assassin's Creed Shadows releases on November 12, 2024. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

Maybe the dialogue-heavy 2022 game about solving murders in 16th-century Bavaria isn’t what you were expecting me to say. This was a game that received widespread critical acclaim when it was released but that often goes underappreciated due to its strange premise. But the team behind it should be enough to sell you. <em>Pentiment </em>was developed by a small team at Obsidian Entertainment led by Josh Sawyer, maybe best known as the director of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/review-fallout-new-vegas-5670346&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/review-fallout-new-vegas-5670346"><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a></span>. </p><p>The Team at Obsidian is known for creating intricate worlds and stories driven by player choice. That remains true in <em>Pentiment</em>, even if the medieval-inspired 2D aesthetic and lack of a sprawling open world make you think otherwise. In <em>Pentiment</em>, your choices decide not only your fate but also the fate of an entire town over the course of 25 years. It’s a stunning achievement of storytelling thanks to an incredibly fleshed-out network of characters all living their own lives in the midst of the changing times.

<p>Fortnite’s current Marvel Season, Chapter 5, Season 4, still has quite a bit of tournaments throughout the next month. Included in the long list of online events, Fortnite’s infamous Duo Cash Cups are still happening. So, what are all the dates for the upcoming Duo Cash Cups in Fortnite?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-fortnite-duo-cash-cup-dates">All Fortnite Duo Cash Cup Dates</h2>



<p>Looking to try and compete for a bit of cash with your duo? Luckily, there are still a few more Duo Cash Cup events left before we go into the upcoming Chapter 2 throwback season.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>All Upcoming Fortnite Duo Cash Cup Dates:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>September 25 &amp; 26</li>



<li>October 2 &amp; 3</li>



<li>October 9 &amp; 10</li>



<li>October 16 &amp; 17</li>
</ul>



<p>All events have a Zero Build tournament and a regular Battle Royale tournament. Excited about these events? Well, you better make sure to play them now, as we already know next season is set to be Trios. </p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-cash-cups-to-change-to-trios">Fortnite Cash Cups to Change to Trios</h2>



<p>Starting in 2025, all major Fortnite tournaments, including Cash Cups, FNCS and more, will be in Trios mode. This announcement was first revealed at the end of the FNCS Global Championship back at the beginning of this month.</p>



<p>With how long Duos stayed as the main competitive mode, we could end up seeing Trios take the spotlight for quite some time. So, go try and make your Duo Cash Cup earnings now. It could be your last time to do so.</p>



<p>Still, if you are heavily indulged within the Forntite competitive scene, you know that the Battle Royale does not skimp out on prize pools, giving players a large amount of cash to play for each week. It will be interesting to see how the future of Fortnite Cash Cups play out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-rpg-board-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>A lot of modern board games are highly strategic affairs, that might see you conquering lands for their resources, or trading and optimizing your way to victory with an economic engine of some kind. But if you’re one of the many who thinks that kind of subject matter is dry and boring, and yearns instead for the lure of exploration and adventure, there’s a whole group of games tailor-made just for you – role-playing board games. Like their pen and paper counterparts, they imagine you’re another person in an outlandish setting, where you’ll either compete or cooperate with your fellow players to overcome quests and challenges. But, as board games, they still have plenty of strategic meat to enjoy beneath their narrative exteriors. Here are our top picks for the best RPG board games: any should be good for untold hours of fun in 2024 and beyond. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Top Role-playing Board Games at a Glance</h2></p><div data-cy="catalog-view-trigger"><div><p><h3>Gloomhaven: Jaws of The Lion</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>WizKids Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Temple of Elemental Evil</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>The Witcher: Old World</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Star Wars: Imperial Assault</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>HeroQuest</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-Earth</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>This War of Mine: The Board Game</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Descent: Legends of the Dark</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Mice &amp; Mystics</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Tainted Grail The Fall of Avalon</h3></p></div></div><p>Don't have time for reading blurbs?

But that’s exactly what it is as you step into the shoes of a series of adventurers, working together, with the roster changing through the game’s labyrinthine campaign as protagonists retire or meet a sticky end in a dungeon. Powered by a compelling tactical combat system that sees you gradually building a deck of multi-use ability cards, each scenario a rising tide of tension as your deck runs down. The original game is currently out of stock, but the prequel, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gloomhaven-jaws-of-the-lion-review">Jaws of the Lion we reviewed</a> offers much of the same gameplay chops in a cut-down, more affordable package, while sequel <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/frosthaven-board-game-review">Frosthaven</a> (see it at <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjGeLP?object_uuid=d3598ebe-dfd2-4bf5-ade9-144cfd7683be&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>) ups the ante by including an entire town you can explore, build and populate as part of the action. These also make great <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board games</a>, for whenever you find yourself without a game crew.</p></div><p id="dd-temple-of-elemental-evil"><h2 data-toc-title="D&amp;D: Temple of Elemental Evil">Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Temple of Elemental Evil</h2></p><div catalogid="f49f5eb3-7022-45c4-9059-19c1685ce84f" id="207640"><div id="207640" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>WizKids Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Temple of Elemental Evil</h3></p></div><p>Role-playing is a pretty amorphous term when it comes to board gaming, but there’s no doubt that the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> adventure system series, based on the world’s most popular pen-and-paper RPG, is a fantastic marriage of the two. Each box comes with a huge stack of tiles which you draw at random to create the dungeon, and each tile in turn is peopled with a random selection of traps and monsters that operate according to simple flowchart routines. The result has an astonishing dynamism, conjuring the sense that you’re exploiting a mysterious labyrinth controlled by a dungeon master. This system powers you through an included narrative <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign</a>. They’re all great (see them at <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAVO17?object_uuid=d3598ebe-dfd2-4bf5-ade9-144cfd7683be&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>), but Temple of Elemental Evil, based on one of D&amp;D’s most famous, old-school scenarios, is perhaps the pick of the bunch.</p><p>Check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-play-dungeons-and-dragons">beginner's guide to Dungeons and Dragons</a> if you're interested in classic D&amp;D gameplay instead.</p></div><p id="the-witcher-old-world"><h2 data-toc-title="The Witcher: Old World">The Witcher: Old World</h2></p><div catalogid="f49f5eb3-7022-45c4-9059-19c1685ce84f" id="207641"><div id="207641" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The Witcher: Old World</h3></p></div><p>Let’s further muddy the waters by introducing an acclaimed board game adaptation of an acclaimed <a href="https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-rpgs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">role-playing video game</a>. Rather than filling in another chapter of Geralt’s exploits, Old World is set years before the events of The Witcher video games and novels, casting players as other Witchers, hunting and fighting monsters, and occasionally each other, to see which of their competing styles can earn the most coin and glory. The different styles feed into a compelling game of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">deck-building</a> as you seek to create card combos and strategy synergies to boost your power ahead of your rivals, in a race to take down ever more fearsome foes. But there’s a solo mode too, for those who just want to explore this fascinating fantasy world and kill its mythical monsters. See our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-old-world-board-game-review">The Witcher: Old World board game review</a> for more information.</p></div><p id="star-wars-imperial-assault"><h2 data-toc-title="Star Wars: Imperial Assault">Star Wars: Imperial Assault</h2></p><div catalogid="f49f5eb3-7022-45c4-9059-19c1685ce84f" id="207642"><div id="207642" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Star Wars: Imperial Assault</h3></p></div><p>Not all role-playing games fit the fantasy archetype, and if you’re a sci-fi fan, you’ll be well-served by this excellent entry that swaps the tombs and traps of its peers for starship interiors and high-tech bases. Set after the events of the original Star Wars film, one player commands the forces of the Empire while the other players work together, controlling a team of plucky Rebel operatives working to undermine the Emperor’s tyrannical rule. The engaging tactical combat system is easily good enough to support one-off scenarios, but the real draw is the game’s campaign, which links a series of battles together into a grand, cinematic narrative, allowing you to fight alongside iconic figures like Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. Many other famous figures from the big screen are available in the game’s huge range of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWdROA?object_uuid=d3598ebe-dfd2-4bf5-ade9-144cfd7683be&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">expansion packs</a>.</p><p>You can check out our guide to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-board-games">best Star Wars board games overall</a> for more like this one.</p></div><p id="heroquest"><h2 data-toc-title="HeroQuest">HeroQuest</h2></p><div catalogid="f49f5eb3-7022-45c4-9059-19c1685ce84f" id="207643"><div id="207643" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>HeroQuest</h3></p></div><p>Older readers may remember this <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dungeon-crawler-board-games">dungeon-crawling board game</a> from their childhoods, having originally come out in 1989. Now it’s back with new, improved miniatures, but its RPG-on-a-board approach, complete with games master, is still top of the range. Said GM has a booklet with the scenario secrets while the other players take the role of heroes, exploring the dungeon, which the GM reveals as they round corners and open doors, fighting GM-controlled monsters and looting treasure. It’s still perhaps the closest thing you’ll get to a true role-playing experience, full of mystery, narrative and upgrading your heroes, but with family-weight rules and the tactical chops of a board game. Once you’re done with the campaign in the box, there are plenty of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heroquest-buying-guide">additional HeroQuest expansions</a> crammed with new adventures.</p></div><p id="arkham-horror-the-card-game"><h2 data-toc-title="Arkham Horror: The Card Game">Arkham Horror: The Card Game</h2></p><div catalogid="f49f5eb3-7022-45c4-9059-19c1685ce84f" id="207644"><div id="207644" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</h3></p></div><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games">Horror board games</a> are another popular frontier for role-playing, but it’s a hard call for board games because the players need a degree of control to make tactical decisions which, in turn, detracts from the horror. This is the best candidate: based loosely on the works of H. P. Lovecraft, players work together to solve mysterious hauntings and horrid crimes, linked to alien worlds and beings beyond our imaginations. The horror comes both from a challenging difficulty level and the bleak narratives that underpin each adventure, with an ongoing <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDVJYw?object_uuid=d3598ebe-dfd2-4bf5-ade9-144cfd7683be&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">series of expansions</a> spinning the yarn into ever-more surprising places. The strategy, meanwhile, is down to your deck-building skills as you improve your character, and staying atop the statistical probabilities offered by the aptly-named chaos bag.</p></div><p id="the-lord-of-the-rings-journeys-in-m"><h2 data-toc-title="The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in M">The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-Earth</h2></p><div catalogid="f49f5eb3-7022-45c4-9059-19c1685ce84f" id="207645"><div id="207645" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-Earth</h3></p></div><p>Given the appeal of fantasy settings in role-playing board games, it’s no surprise that Middle-earth, the setting that arguably popularized the whole idea of fantasy world-building, gets a look-in. The good news is that it’s a great adaptation, nestled comfortably between Tolkien’s famous stories, so it allows players to feel a part of his epic creation without stepping on his narrative beats. The core of the game sees the heroes building card decks to represent their powers and abilities, but it's ably supported by lots of novel ideas. Some of these, like the tile scale-flipping to combine overground and underground exploration, are in cardboard while others make great use of the supporting app, such as solving carefully constructed mysteries based on clues drip-fed by the narrative text.</p><p>You can also check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-roleplaying-review">review of The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying board game</a>, which we also loved.</p></div><p id="this-war-of-mine-the-board-game"><h2 data-toc-title="This War of Mine: The Board Game">This War of Mine: The Board Game</h2></p><div catalogid="f49f5eb3-7022-45c4-9059-19c1685ce84f" id="207646"><div id="207646" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>This War of Mine: The Board Game</h3></p></div><p>Not all heroes wear capes, so the saying goes, and in This War of Mine, heroism is just desperately trying to keep your friends alive against the odds in a war-torn city. It’s an unusual and powerful setting for a role-playing board game, as it was for the computer RPG that inspired it. During the day, your little band needs to scavenge the resources they need to survive, hoping against hope to find what’s required. At night, you’ll need to barricade your hideout and keep watch for raiders, soldiers and other hostiles who might come for whatever meager scraps you’ve managed to pull together. The mechanics of resource gathering and base-building are supported by a book of narrative text, the whole forming a shocking indictment of the horrors of living in a conflict zone, made personal by the way the board game places you in charge of your survivor’s fate.</p></div><p id="descent-legends-of-the-dark"><h2 data-toc-title="Descent: Legends of the Dark">Descent: Legends of the Dark</h2></p><div catalogid="f49f5eb3-7022-45c4-9059-19c1685ce84f" id="207647"><div id="207647" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Descent: Legends of the Dark</h3></p></div><p>Part of the appeal of having role-playing on a board, rather than a screen on a paper character sheet, is the look and feel of the thing. And in terms of visuals and production values, Descent: Journeys in the Dark is king of the pile with its trays of finely sculpted miniatures and extraordinary three-dimensional cardboard terrain, allowing you to construct swamps and dungeons that pop out of your tabletop in almost magical detail. Thankfully, the game engine underneath all that window dressing is very much up to par, with a supporting mobile app sending your party on a series of quests, complete with narrative and inter-scenario links that see you shepherding the treasures you’ve found to gain access to new powers and equipment.

Mice &amp; Mystics aims to bridge the age gap by telling a compelling story of a band of loyal adventurers turned into mice as they try to save a fantasy kingdom from the clutches of a tyrant. They’ll still need to pull what strings they can as they seek to return to human form while thwarting evil and a worrying number of cockroaches. With simple tactical mechanics and lots of whimsical adventure, this is a crowd-pleaser for all ages.</p></div><p id="tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon"><h2 data-toc-title="Tainted Grail The Fall of Avalon">Tainted Grail The Fall of Avalon</h2></p><div catalogid="f49f5eb3-7022-45c4-9059-19c1685ce84f" id="207649"><div id="207649" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tainted Grail The Fall of Avalon</h3></p></div><p>While most role-playing board games focus on their mechanics, Tainted Grail wants to tell an extraordinary story. It heaps Celtic legends on top of its Arthurian base to create a rich world, but one beset by challenge in which your characters must band together in order to survive. Doing so means finding and managing resources in a satisfying strategic puzzle, but the real focus is the colossal, branching, narrative campaign, ably supported by superbly written and plotted text, which has so many different paths that you can play this monster game multiple times and still not see the same tales told. </p><h2>How do RPG Board Games Relate to Tabletop RPGs and Video Game RPGs?</h2><p>“Role-playing game” (RPG for short) as a term began with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dungeons-dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>, which was the first published ruleset to bring form around an experimental practice of telling narrative, character-based stories using miniature wargame rules. These new creations were distinct enough to need their own term, and role-playing seemed a succinct way to describe the way you inhabited a character very different from your own, in a make-believe world full of challenge and adventure.</p><p>These kinds of games, often differentiated from later types of role-playing by the moniker “pen-and-paper RPGs”, sell themselves on their creative and imaginative potential. The sky isn’t even a limit when it comes to what you and your group can conjure up together. But there’s no denying that a lot of players also got a lot of satisfaction from manipulating the crunchier bits of the rules – skill checks and tactical movement – and from seeing their characters gain power and advance. Early pen-and-paper RPGs also needed a Games Master to run proceedings, a role which many players were unwilling to fulfil.</p><p>These two factors lead to the creation of board games and video games based on the concept. Either the board and cards or the computer took the place of the Games Master, using either the programmer's imagination or random factors to create a world for the player(s) to explore, while the strategy-minded were satisfied by the lure of levelling up their character and exploiting the game’s mechanics in order to win. </p><p>While role-playing has become an established term for this genre in video gaming, spawning sub-genres such as JRPGs (the J stands for Japanese) and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/top-10-roguelikes">Rogue-likes</a> after one of the earliest computer RPGS, there’s no equivalent term in board gaming. That’s surprising, given that it’s a very popular category in its own right, but the games tend to be referred to as adventure games or quest games rather than role playing. That’s possibly because controlling a plastic avatar on a board, instead of the more immediate gratification of on a screen, divorces players slightly from the action they’re portraying.</p><p>Whatever the reason, this plethora of different terms can be pretty confusing for players, never mind anyone to whom they’re trying to describe their exploits! To make matters worse, there’s intense cross-pollination between these scenes. Dungeons &amp; Dragons has inspired both board- and computer- RPGs some of which have, in turn, been adapted back into material for the role-playing game. Many board game RPGs have spawned computer versions, and many computer RPGs have got the board game treatment. It’s turtles all the way down!</p><p><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelancer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

Here's a great deal on a very well-rated Samsung memory card with your choice of two different capacities. Both <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qx7LvP?object_uuid=fd2d2533-fa41-4f15-80da-28382830afea&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Samsung direct</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wGAkR?object_uuid=fd2d2533-fa41-4f15-80da-28382830afea&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> have the 512GB Samsung Pro Plus Micro SDXC card for $29.99, or the 256GB for $19.99. A compact USB card adapter is also included. Samsung offers free shipping on both items. Amazon offers free shipping on the 512GB model but if you're not a Prime member, you'll need to get your order total to $25 to get free shipping on the 256GB model. If you want to pick a memory card that performs well and has a reliable track record, then look no further. Samsung is one of the most highly recommended memory card brands and the Pro Plus model is faster than most cards.</p><h2>Samsung Pro Plus Micro SDXC Cards Are on Sale Today</h2><p><em><strong>Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck compatible</strong></em></p><div id="186964" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="c7d5aaab-a796-422e-9a71-e2dca168aa9c"><p><h3>Samsung Pro Plus 512GB Micro SDXC Card</h3></p></div><div catalogid="c7d5aaab-a796-422e-9a71-e2dca168aa9c" id="207638"><div id="207638" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Samsung Pro Plus 256GB Micro SDXC Card</h3></p></div><p>If you've started compiling a collection of digital games, you probably already know just how limited the Switch's base storage capacity is. The Switch and Switch OLED have 32GB and 64GB of internal storage, respectively, some of it reserved for the OS. Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom uses up 16GB and Breath of the Wild about 13.5GB. If bought digitally, those two games alone would take up all of your internal storage on the OG Switch console. There's only one expansion slot in the Switch console so you want to make sure you get the biggest card you can afford, although very few people will need more than 1TB of storage.</p><p>The Samsung Pro Plus series of Micro SDXC cards are compatible with virtually any device that accepts the Micro SDXC card standard. That includes the Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, and the ASUS ROG Ally. The Pro Plus is a faster than average Micro SDXC card with a speed rating of U3 / A2 / V30. In terms of actual numbers, the Pro Plus boasts up to 180MBps sustained read speeds and up to 130MBps sustained write speeds. Besides pairing well with your gaming handheld, this card would be an ideal candidate for devices that need fast and high-capacity transfers, like a 4K DSLR or action camera. A USB card reader is also included to make it easy to transfer files to your PC.</p><p><em>Check out all of the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals"><em>best Nintendo Switch deals</em></a><em> for sales on other games and accessories.</em></p></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Sep 23, 2024 6:45 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
