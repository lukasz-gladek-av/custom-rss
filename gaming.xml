            <p>A concept album for the now-cancelled Earthblade from the studio behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/celeste">Celeste</a> has been released by composer Lena Raine.</p>
<p>Back in January, Extremely OK Games cancelled its "2D explor-action" game, which would have followed up the widely celebrated platformer Celeste.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-devs-show-first-look-at-earthblade">first look at Earthblade</a> was shown in December 2022 at The Game Awards, but nothing has been shown since. As such, this new album from Raine provides a taste of what we could have expected.</p>

<p>Raine worked on the soundtracks of Minecraft, Celeste and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/guild-wars-2">Guild Wars 2</a>, as well as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a> and Chicory: A Colorful Tale.</p>
<p>Earthblade - Across the Bounds of Fate is available to listen to on <a href="https://radicaldreamland.bandcamp.com/album/earthblade-across-the-bounds-of-fate">Bandcamp</a> and can be purchased in full for $7.</p>
<p>It's typical of Raine's style, particularly with the focus on striking melody and a mixture of electronic and real instruments. The beautiful track Verdant Mysteries includes a strange vocal too, while the eight-minute long Lineage is a mesmeric piano piece and the opening Accept Your Fate begins with Vangelis-esque chords before a mournful tone takes over.</p>
<p>"[Earthblade] was in development for a number of years, and over that period of time I wrote quite a few pieces - both conceptual, and implemented tracks - that began to depict the world of the game," wrote Raine in the album's description. "Because we'll never get a chance to tell that story in game form, I decided to cobble together every bit of music I'd written for the game to the point of its cancellation in order to tell my own version of it.</p>
<p>"Across the Bounds of Fate, more so than a soundtrack, is a concept album. The music I wrote for the game is highly dynamic, in the tradition of what I wrote for Celeste. I took it many steps beyond, in ways that temporally-constrained pieces of music can't really do justice. But I did my best to arrange them into the emotional arc of their progression, much like I would for any soundtrack release."</p>
<p>Raine's inspiration includes the aforementioned Vangelis (best known for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a>), as well as Joe Hisaishi's score for Studio Ghibli's Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, and Yoko Kanno's work on animes Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell.</p>
<p>Said Raine: "For now, tuck in and enjoy around 30 minutes of music that paint the picture of what I hoped Earthblade might be."</p>
<p>Extremely OK Games studio director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-studio-cancels-2d-explor-action-game-earthblade-nearly-four-years-after-its-announcement">Maddy Thorson called the cancellation of Earthblade</a> a "huge, heartbreaking, and yet relieving failure".</p>
<p>One factor leading to the cancellation was a disagreement about the IP rights of Celeste between Thorson and Noel Berry on one side, and studio founding member Pedro Medeiros on the other.</p>
<p>However, Thorson stressed "Pedro isn't to blame", adding: "In fact the split with him has given us the clarity to see that we have lost our way, and the opportunity to admit defeat. I feel many ways about it, but one big feeling is undoubtedly relief."</p>
<p>Thorson and Berry are now prototyping again for a new project. In the meantime, we have Raine's score as a lasting reminder of what Earthblade could have been.</p>
<p>"Melody encompasses so much of how I relate to music that it's hard for me to just write a piece that sinks solely into texture and rhythm. I do it, obviously, but I'm always humming something on top," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-composer-lena-raine-on-her-musical-style-im-a-big-fan-of-musical-metaphor">Raine told Eurogamer in a discussion about her compositional style</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>I did it. I made it through the week with the kids! Honestly, it was a blast. I've made a habit of taking a picture of the three of us before my wife arrives back home whenever we have weeks like this, and now it's turned into this really beautiful timeline of my kids growing up. It makes me feel a lot better than re-watching <em>Interstellar</em> did over the weekend. (The <em>tears.)</em> Great movie, nonsensical plot, who cares? The score, the acting, the worlds, the heart—it all worked for me.</p><p>-pk, who was inspired to rewatch <em>Interstellar</em> <a href="https://x.com/TheCinesthetic/status/1897214249878892886?ref=remapradio.com">because of this</a></p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>My Turn (Hoosiers)</em> – Well, it looks like Sports! x My Turn is going on a bit of a bender, because watching Hoosiers means we're also going to watch Rudy. We're making some questionable choices, but come join us.</li><li><strong>ARTICLES:</strong> <em>How Half-Life Ruined FPS Games + Rob Has Thoughts about Suits (the TV show)* </em>– Rob finished <em>Remap</em>'s tax forms, and the result has been Rob delightfully getting back into writing and freelances pieces.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Onimusha</em> – The audience didn't lie to us!

One of these apparently included a Scooby-Doo theme complete with mini-figures, sound effects, and an “incredibly elaborate” PowerPoint presentation.</p><p>“It was <em>Scooby-Doo and The Haunting of Merkmiss Manor</em>, and they had to go and figure out who the Merkmiss monster was, and unmask a bunch of local townspeople, and then clearly they weren’t the real villains,” he told Semafor. “It was evil Lyle Blackwood who was trying to steal the Blackwood fortune.”</p><p>It’s unclear exactly how much of that particular session was made with the help of AI, but Cocks said he believes AI is “supercharging fandom” and will be “a great leveler for user-generated content” in the future. He also sees financial upsides for Hasbro. Possible examples mentioned by <em>Semafor</em> are “subscription services letting other Dungeon Masters enrich their D&amp;D campaigns, or offerings to let parents customize Peppa Pig animations.”</p><p>This isn’t the first time Cocks has praised the possibilities for generative AI in the toy and gaming space. “I’m probably more excited, though, about the playful elements of AI,” he said <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://futurism.com/hasbro-ceo-ai-dungeons-dragons&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://futurism.com/hasbro-ceo-ai-dungeons-dragons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during a Goldman Sachs conference last year</a></span>. “I play with probably 30 or 40 people regularly. There’s not a single person who doesn’t use AI somehow for either campaign development or character development or story ideas. That’s a clear signal that we need to be embracing it.”</p><p>In the past, Cocks pointed to having ChatGPT help with scripts and Bing’s image generator create the art. It seems like it’s only a matter of time before Hasbro is trying to sell <em>D&amp;D</em> versions of those features directly to players. “We can leverage all of that to be able to build very interesting and compelling use cases for AI that can bring our characters to life,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://venturebeat.com/games/how-hasbro-is-jumping-on-the-game-opportunity-chris-cocks-interview/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://venturebeat.com/games/how-hasbro-is-jumping-on-the-game-opportunity-chris-cocks-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said last fall</a></span>. “We can build tools that aid in content creation for users or create really interesting gamified scenarios around them.”</p><p>That philosophy appears to be on a collision course with the current official stance by Wizards of the Coast’s D&amp;D team, which currently bans the use of AI in generating final products. “For 50 years, D&amp;D has been built on the innovation, ingenuity, and hard work of talented people who sculpt a beautiful, creative game,” the team wrote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://dnd-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/26243094975252-Generative-AI-art-FAQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://dnd-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/26243094975252-Generative-AI-art-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a 2023 statement</a></span>. “That isn’t changing. Our internal guidelines remain the same with regards to artificial intelligence tools: We require artists, writers, and creatives contributing to the D&amp;D TTRPG to refrain from using AI generative tools to create final D&amp;D products. We work with some of the most talented artists and creatives in the world, and we believe those people are what makes D&amp;D great.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Death Stranding 2 On The Beach is the sequel from the mind of Hideo Kojima. Its release date was finally confirmed, and if you want to hear more about the follow-up, we’ve got the main details you need to know.</p>



<p>Hideo Kojima springs to mind when I think of auteurs across any medium of media. He’s produced and directed games featuring over-the-top mecha combat, hallway-based horror, and most notably strategic stealth and surrealism. Death Stranding was arguably his most “out there” work to date, and Death Stranding 2’s release will inevitably try to one-up it.</p>



<p>With a stellar cast and even a curious homage to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-luca-marinelli-solid-snake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solid Snake</a>, let’s check the latest on one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-playstation-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest PS5 releases</a> coming soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-coming-out">When is Death Stranding 2 On The Beach Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No words. Credit to Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Death Stranding 2 On The Beach has a June 26 release date—making it one of the Summer’s biggest launches if it meets its announced release date.</strong></p>



<p>Originally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2 was a rumor</a>. The worst-kept secret became official at The Game Awards 2024. Screenshots, trailers, and gameplay have been shown off periodically over the last several years, but a release date was notably lacking.</p>



<p>This was until Kojima Productions unveiled an official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2 release date</a>. It was great news, and fans also got to see the full extent of the action title’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-colelctors-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Collector’s Edition</a>.  </p>



<h2 id="h-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-platforms">Death Stranding 2 On The Beach Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>A <strong>Death Stranding 2 On The Beach</strong></strong> <strong>PlayStation 5 exclusive launch is happening, with PC, Xbox, and any other platforms having to miss out for now.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a rare PlayStation-only launch. Exclusives are seemingly coming few and far between in 2025. Death Stranding 2 On The Beach can only be purchased on its June 26 release date for PS5.</p>



<p>But all is not lost if you’re a PC player without a PS5 console. The original Death Stranding was one of a few PlayStation-exclusive titles that eventually came to PC. Sony has made a habit of releasing its recent library of exclusives on PC—exposing titles to a wider audience, and making more money.</p>



<p>Meaning, <strong>a Death Stranding 2 On The Beach PC port is not out of the question</strong> a year or two from now.</p>



<h2 id="h-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-editions-amp-price">Death Stranding 2 On The Beach Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>You must choose between Death Stranding 2 On The Beach’s Standard Edition ($69.99/£79.99), Deluxe Edition ($79.99/£79.99), and Collector’s Edition ($229.99/£249.99).</strong></p>



<p>Look at each Death Stranding 2 edition below, and see which one is the one for you.</p>

<hr>



<p>Death Stranding 2 On The Beach is without doubt one of the biggest games (on paper) in 2025. Expect more to be added as it looks to shake the reputation of being a walking simulator. Are you picking up the sequel? What did you think of the OG Death Stranding? Let us know.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Xbox representatives have suggested that the console brand is due for a shake-up in recent months, with Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer stating that the next Xbox should be "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-should-be-more-innovative-phil-spencer-says/1100-6529067/">more innovative</a>." A new report claims that the next console from Xbox might not be a traditional console at all, and that it might be targeting a 2027 launch rather than 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">On a recent episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAOt7CKUEFY">Xbox Two podcast</a>, reporter Jez Corden said that Microsoft's plans for the new Xbox are more akin to a gaming PC. He describes the machine as a "PC in essence, but with a TV-friendly shell that also has a specific set of specs in mind." He further suggested that similar to existing consoles, developers will know what these specs are, so they'll be able to optimize their games accordingly.</p><p dir="ltr">Corden also poured cold water onto the rumors that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2026-could-drop-last-gen-systems-and-make-other-big-changes-report/1100-6529841/" data-ref-id="1100-6529841">Call of Duty 2026 is being developed</a> with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-rumored-to-launch-in-2026-with-new-call-of-duty/1100-6528636/" data-ref-id="1100-6528636">next-gen Xbox in mind</a>, stating that he's heard that the new hardware is targeting a 2027 release, not next year. "The devkit talk is more about what kind of specs they've been told to target for the next Xbox," he said. "I'm pretty sure the new hardware is not 2026, it's 2027."</p><p dir="ltr">As always, these rumors should be taken with a grain of salt. It's unclear if this hypothetical PC-like Xbox would feature the more extensive non-gaming functionality that you get with a PC, such as work apps, productivity software, and more. However, this is far from the first inkling that Xbox is considering a drastic change with its next console. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfdz5alCu8g">a recent interview</a>, former Xbox executive Peter Moore went so far as to suggest that the console war is essentially over, and if given the choice, Microsoft would stop making hardware entirely.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/creature-caravan-review-what-ride<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As the wooden wheels of your cart rumble along the dusty earth, you look back in wonder at the caravan you’ve assembled. Strange beasts flap heavy wings in the air, a frog-man ambles along peaceably, someone’s riding a giant snail? Sure, why not! This is the wonderful world of <i>Creature Caravan</i>, a brand new board game designed by <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/11854/ryan-laukat" rel="nofollow">Ryan Laukat</a>, and published by <a href="https://www.redravengames.com/" rel="nofollow">Red Raven Games</a>.</p>

<p>Red Raven Games provided me with a review copy of the game when I visited their booth at PAX Unplugged, and now that the game’s back in stock I thought it would be the perfect time to dive in and see what it’s all about!</p>



<blockquote>
<p><i>Creature Caravan</i> Stats:</p>

<ul><li>1 - 4 Players</li>
	<li>Est. Game Time: 60 Minutes</li>
	<li>Game Genre: Tableau Building, Dice Assignment</li>
	<li>Complexity: Medium</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p><i>Creature Caravan</i> tasks players with competing to score the most points as they trek across a varied landscape full of strange creatures and dangerous Ember Zombies. As the name implies, players will slowly build up their caravan in the form of creature cards that they place by their board.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creature-caravan-full-game-setup.jpg?itok=EMWnirWD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creature-caravan-full-game-setup.jpg?itok=bGAGFTN7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Trek across the plains in Creature Caravan!</figcaption></figure><p>After playing through multiple rounds of the game, players will accumulate points by traversing the land, defeating zombies, trading in goods for points, and adding creatures to their caravan. The player who scores the most points wins after 12 rounds wins.</p>

<h2>How Do You Play <i>Creature Caravan</i>?</h2>

<p>To play the game, you’ll roll five dice and assign those dice to actions on your board. When you start the game, you’ll only have a few options available on your tableau. You can assign dice to gain creature cards to your hand, gain resources, or battle Ember Zombies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creature-caravan-board-and-cards.jpg?itok=PSQrBrrL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creature-caravan-board-and-cards.jpg?itok=t9CCVtka 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The game board offers places to assign dice you roll each turn.</figcaption></figure><p>Where the complexity comes in is with the introduction of those creatures cards. As you add them to your tableau by paying resources to play their cards, you’ll unlock new slots to place your dice.</p>

<p>Placing dice in new slots unlocks additional benefits, like the ability to travel faster/further on the board, more attack to fend off Zombies, more card draw, etc.</p>

<h2>How Does It Feel To Play <i>Creature Caravan</i>?</h2>

<p><i>Creature Caravan</i> is one of my favorite types of games: the kind that starts fairly simply, and slowly gets more crunchy and complex as you play. Because of this, it’s easy to introduce new players right into the action.</p>

<p>I really like the mechanic of rolling dice and assigning them to spots on your caravan (you can assign dice of a matching number or higher to its associated spot - in other words, a die roll of a 4 could be placed on a 4, 3, 2, or 1 spot on your board).&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creature-caravan-player-board.jpg?itok=X_qGNULZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creature-caravan-player-board.jpg?itok=Kes1QWuX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What starts simply with the above options soon blossoms into many different ways to spend your dice</figcaption></figure><p>I never spent a turn without at least a few interesting options in front of me, and as the game grew in complexity I ended up having <i>too many</i> cool things I wanted to do in a turn.</p>

<p>The only area of the game that feels a little less-baked than the rest of the game are the mechanics around Ember Zombies. These zombies show up when you arrive at various spots on the map, and place tokens on your board.</p>

<p>You can then add dice to slots to attack the zombies, which is really just another place to score points on your board. Of all the elements in the game, this feels least intuitive - though for my opponents who went all-in on attacking beat me pretty squarely, so maybe shows how much I know!</p>

<h2><i>Creature Caravan</i> Stuns With Its Art and Creature Design</h2>

<p>As usual, Ryan Laukat doesn’t <i>just</i> shine as a game design, but puts his artistic talent on display by illustrating all of the artwork for the game as well. It’s this artwork, I think above all else, that gives the game so much personality.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creature-caravan-map.jpg?itok=KC1iMi5v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creature-caravan-map.jpg?itok=CwXk-nWe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Move along the board with your caravan!</figcaption></figure><p>Set in the world of Arzium, which also includes Laukat’s games <i>Above and Below</i>, <i>Near</i> <i>and Far, Now and Then</i>, and the all-new <i>Arzium RPG</i>, this is a setting full of bright colors, quirky characters, an internal logic that pulls it all together.</p>

<p>Without knowing all the in’s and out’s of the world, I can tell this game is illustrated by a creator who knows his universe down to the smallest bug and largest lumbering dinosaur.</p>

<h2><i>Creature Caravan - </i>Let the Cards Surprise You!</h2>

<p>I have a hot take for new players: I do <i>not</i> recommend going through and looking at all the character cards before you start playing. I know some of you might be screaming right now about “open information,” “optimal gameplay,” and “combo effects,” but it’ll be okay! Hear me out:</p>

<p>I don’t think your first play through is likely to be optimized for the best combing of creature effects anyway, so going into the game and letting each new flip of a character&nbsp;card surprise you will add a whole layer of brilliant discovery to the game!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creature-caravan-creature-cards_0.jpg?itok=cIbi9I_6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creature-caravan-creature-cards_0.jpg?itok=izmtjD9j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The creature cards add so much personality to the game!</figcaption></figure><h2><i>Creature Caravan - </i>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>There’s a cleanness of design on display in <i>Creature Caravan</i> that allows the player to truly settle into the game before adding creatures to your tableau expands the horizon of options. As I’ve mentioned above, the length this goes to welcoming players into the game cannot be overstated.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a game that let’s you roll dice (which we love, of course), plot movements carefully, collect a cadre of cool characters, and sink into evocative illustrations, <i>Creature Caravan</i> is the game for you!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steel-seed-release-date-close-to-the-sun<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher ESDigital Games and developer Storm in a Teacup have announced the release date for their stealth-action game&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed</em>, and it's coming next month.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed&nbsp;</em>arrives on PC and current-gen consoles on April 10th. It's Storm in a Teacup's next major project after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-store-exclusive-close-to-sun-launches-may-2nd-on-pc" rel="nofollow">2019's&nbsp;<em>BioShock</em>-inspired horror adventure <i>Close to the Sun</i></a>, although&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed&nbsp;</em>isn't related to that game in terms of story or setting.</p>

<p>Instead, it's a post-apocalyptic stealth-action game in which you play as Zoe and her drone companion Koby as they explore a massive underground facility filled with hostile machines. It'll play out in a third-person perspective, too, as opposed to&nbsp;<em>Close to the Sun</em>'s first-person viewpoint.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steel-seed-release-date-stealth.jpg?itok=XbPpKfGJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steel-seed-release-date-stealth.jpg?itok=Huwt-bP5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Steel Seed&nbsp;</em>is a stealth-action game from the makers of&nbsp;<em>Close to the Sun</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Steel Seed</em>'s world is "hand-crafted", according to Storm in a Teacup, and it'll present plenty of opportunities to discover the game's "immersive narrative" and "environmental storytelling".</p>

<p>While stealth looks to be the main tool in your arsenal, Storm in a Teacup is also promising "dynamic combat" against a range of enemies, as well as "challenging bosses" and three different skill trees containing 40 upgrades between them.</p>

<p>Koby serves as both Zoe's narrative companion and a helper for&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed</em>'s puzzles, so I'm very much hoping this isn't a&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok</em>-style situation where everything's solved for me. At the very least, if it is, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-puzzle-hints" rel="nofollow">let me turn down the hint frequency</a>!</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed</em>, which gives a sense of the game's story and the world in which it takes place, right here.</p>




<p><em>Steel Seed&nbsp;</em>boasts the involvement of BAFTA winner Martin Korda, a writer and consultant in the industry who's worked on projects like&nbsp;<em>Destiny: The Taken King&nbsp;</em>and several&nbsp;<em>FIFA&nbsp;</em>(now known as&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>) career modes.</p>

<p>Storm in a Teacup says the game will feature "an intriguing main character's evolution" and "a compelling and deep narrative experience" thanks to Korda's involvement. We'll have to wait and see whether those promises ring true.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/458430/Steel_Seed/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010794/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S on April 10th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nc-america-ceo-hopes-the-industry-and-her-company-is-on-upswing-after-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since the nascent period of online games in the late '90s and 2000s, publisher NCSoft and its massively multiplayer online role-playing games have been a mainstay. The company's one significant edge against competitors like Blizzard Entertainment's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was its focus on bridging the divide between Western and Eastern MMORPG audiences with a cross-continental portfolio including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lineage II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Aion</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Guild Wars 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As live service games have become increasingly high risk for the industry, the long-running publisher sees a path through the turmoil, with its sights on company expansion. In 2025, the publisher intends to double down on its live service business in the wake of layoffs and restructuring to reaffirm its position on the global market—all with a focus on its MMORPG pedigree.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Current CEO of NC America Jeonghee Jin said she hopes the industry—and the company—is on the upswing after laying off workers. According to her, NCSoft is recalibrating its approach to supporting Western game developers, with the hope of not repeating mistakes from years past.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Building a new NCSoft">Building a new NCSoft</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While NCSoft has maintained steady success with legacy titles such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lineage II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Guild Wars 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the company has struggled across other ends of its portfolios. During the 2010s, NCSoft made efforts to expand in the United States, but that ultimately led to the shuttering of the sci-fi MMO </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wildstar </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and its developer Carbine Studios, and the online music-rhythm game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fuser </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">from developer Harmonix (now owned by Epic Games). In recent years, it's laid off workers and underwent a general restructuring in late 2024.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The last two years have been pretty bad for many game companies, including NCSoft, but honestly, I've seen cycles like this in the game business, and most other businesses," said the CEO. "We are always seeing these ups and downs, and especially right after the COVID lockdown period. We're now seeing a lot of layoffs and cancelations of promising projects, but I'm still actually very hopeful because I feel like we're kind of at the bottom of that cycle, and that a rise is happening."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2024, Jin was named CEO of NC America following her time as the former senior vice president and CEO of Pearl Abyss America, where she helped expand the reach the South Korean MMORPG </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Black Desert Online</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Since she joined the company, NCSoft has made numerous investments within European and Korean development studios for new IPs, including a new first-person shooter from Moon Rover and an RPG known as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breakers </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">from Vic Game Studios, respectively.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jin acknowledged the publisher's past misfires, saying she joined the company with the hope of learning from its mistakes. "When I joined, I had a lot of thoughts on where we can do things with NCSoft," they continued. "This publisher has such a rich history within the MMORPG space across the Korean and western markets, and that makes it such a unique company."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Going back to the '90s, NCSoft was one of the first MMORPG developers, and they've done a lot of experiments with trying to break through to other markets. Generally those titles have been doing great mostly in Asia, but to a lesser degree in western regions, which we want to work on more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There have been a lot of investments with NCSoft over the years, and a lot of experiments, and some of them went great, but others not so much. I think a lot of people only remember failures, but there are a lot of achievements as well which definitely paved the way for other Korean companies and Asian developers who wanted to go global. I feel very optimistic now as we invest more within the western market, which we see a growth opportunity for."</span></p><p>Image via NCSoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via NCSoft.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now in 2025, Jin is heading up the new NCSoft office in Southern California following a notable restructuring effort. According to Jin, her current vision for NCSoft is a publisher that releases modern games that are more approachable for wide audiences—which includes the online shooter </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Project LLL</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">NCSoft will also lean into its steady successes within online live service games, which they still see growth potential in. Along with titles from Moon Rover and Vic Game Studios, a recent investment in Mistil Games and their upcoming third-person shooter </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Time Takers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> show how NCSoft is heading into new territory.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's good for us to have more diverse genres in the portfolio, and with NCSoft America and the Western divisions, we are now in a better position to bring these titles to a broader audience."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Finding success within the live service model">Finding success within the live service model</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The video game industry within recent years has been a volatile and challenging space for developers to operate in. With record layoffs and studio closures, studios are also juggling ballooning development budgets and expectations for success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think there are still a lot of successful titles right now, and they're still being loved by so many players, and not really having a really negative impact on their communities," she continued. "So I see a lot of bright and some dark sides of the business right now. But I know we're going to see that rise once again, and we'll do it all together as industry comrades. I'm also really looking forward to all the projects that we are working on, so I'm very positive and optimistic about the future."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jin explained that NCSoft still thinks its central publishing role supporting a wide variety of studios has advantages over being a studio supporting one game. Live service games need "happy" players, and tracking player behavior can be a task that's too big for one dev team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It can be very stressful...for any publisher and developer working on live service games, they hear a lot of harsh comments and feedback all the time," she said. "But that's why a core publisher exists for [live service games]. A really good team has to support that and figure out how to engage the community and guide the game over time."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For online games, the communities they foster can be a driving factor in future success. Along with maintaining a successful launch for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Throne and Liberty,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> NC America also has the western launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Blade &amp; Soul Neo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—a visual and gameplay remaster of its popular martial-arts action MMO—aims for a "nostalgic" trip back to a classic MMO experience for long-time fans, and the type of game that NCSoft plans to spotlight in the years ahead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm feeling great about the current projects we are working on, like one potential project we are preparing just made me feel very optimistic about the future of NCSoft's business in the West, and I feel I have a clear vision about how I want to run the business at this point," said Jin. "In the first few months while I was here, I did a lot of studying and reflecting on the history of NCSoft—what did well and what didn't, and I talked to as many people as possible at the headquarters to figure out their perspectives about the Western regions and the growth opportunities there."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm in a very good place where I can plan confidently for our next projects—I feel good for what's ahead."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.

            <p>If you enjoyed your flirtations (and more) with Astarion in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, and want more, well, you can now romance the sultry vampire in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>.</p>
<p>This new line of romance comes thanks to the fan made Baldur's Village mod, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/romanceable-baldurs-gate-3-companions-are-being-modded-into-stardew-valley">which we first got wind of last year</a>.</p>
<p>"A new village has recently been built north of Pelican Town, and its new residents seem... rather unusual," <a href="https://x.com/XunHe1145/status/1898186199790981284">reads a post on social media</a>, announcing the mod's arrival.</p>

<p>The Baldur's Village mod is described as a "large expansion mod for Stardew Valley". Along with the ability to romance and eventually marry Astarion, this mod also adds new stores including a tavern, and other Baldur's Gate 3-inspired characters.</p>
<p>While Astarion is the only romanceable character right now, more are planned for down the line, with Halsin's storyline the next focus</p>
<p>"Once completed, we will shift our attention to expanding the mod's world-building, background stories, and gameplay by introducing new features and items," the Baldur's Village creators explained.</p>
<p>The mod's creators also assure that Baldur's Village will not "alter or break the original game", and you won't need to start a new save to play.</p>

<p>As for Stardew Valley, as of December last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-continues-its-wholesome-farming-dominance-with-latest-sales-milestone">the farming sim has sold in excess of 41m copies across platforms</a>. Of those 41m, over half are on PC, with 26m copies sold. Meanwhile, the Nintendo Switch accounts for 7.9m Stardew Valley sales.</p>
<p>Last year, creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone also released Stardew Valley's bumper 1.6 update, which essentially boosted the game to an almost 2.0 status. This beefy update introduced a vast number of features to the base game, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">new NPC dialogues, home renovations and turtle pets</a>. This update was released on PC first, before becoming available across all platforms.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rootbound-ex-gothic-elex-developers</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rootbound-is-a-new-game-from-former-gothic-and-elex-developers.1129923/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rootbound-ex-gothic-elex-developers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A group of ex-Piranha Bytes developers have banded together to found new indie studio Brainlag Games, and the developer has also announced its first game in physics-based adventure&nbsp;<em>Rootbound</em>.</p>

<p>Per its new <a href="https://www.brainlag-games.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>, Brainlag was founded with the goal of "bring[ing] back what gaming was meant to be" and "creating immersive worlds with gameplay you haven't seen a hundred times".</p>

<p>That would certainly fit in with the development ethos of the studio founders' former outfit Piranha Bytes, whose name you might know best from the likes of&nbsp;<em>Gothic</em>,&nbsp;<em>Risen</em>, and<i>&nbsp;Elex</i>. The studio was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">shuttered last year</a>, although neither Piranha Bytes nor parent company Embracer Group officially announced its closure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rootbound-brainlag-games-ex-piranha-bytes-developers.jpg?itok=ikGB2ZLR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rootbound-brainlag-games-ex-piranha-bytes-developers.jpg?itok=9LvKIMX3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rootbound&nbsp;</em>looks to be a very different prospect from its developers' former work.</figcaption></figure><p>That brings us to Brainlag, which was founded by Piranha Bytes veterans&nbsp;Markus Kloß, Maki Dieffenbach, Amadeus Weidmann, and André Hotz. Like Piranha Bytes, the studio is based in Essen in Germany.</p>

<p>Brainlag's first game&nbsp;<em>Rootbound&nbsp;</em>is, according to its Steam page, a "physics-based action adventure about a plantling's quest to save its home from a mysterious blight". Rather than being a fully-fledged 3D action RPG like&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Risen</em>, it's a&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>-style isometric affair.</p>

<p>Together with your sentient backpack, you will journey into the world of Akara, discovering "ancient puzzles" and fighting "dangerous monsters" as you seek to uncover a long-lost civilization's secrets.</p>

<p>By the looks of the debut trailer, the physics element of the game comes in a sort of <i>Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</i>-style environment manipulation mechanic whereby you can build bridges with planks, knock down stone walls, and interact with the world in other fun ways.</p>




<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;<em>Rootbound&nbsp;</em>doesn't yet have a release date, but if you'd like to keep up with the game's progress, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3453490/Rootbound/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam right here</a>.</p>

<p>As for Piranha Bytes, the studio may be dead, but its debut title&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>lives on in the form of the upcoming remake (developed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-thq-nordic-studio-alkimia-interactive-to-develop-gothic-remake" rel="nofollow">by Alkimia Interactive</a>), which is now <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-2025-release-window" rel="nofollow">scheduled to launch in 2025</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Just when you thought Kojima probably couldn’t share any more about the game without spoiling he said, “Oh, just watch me.” The footage opens with a character named Neil who appears to be some sort of black ops spook called in for one last job to smuggle pregnant women across the U.S. Mexico border. He’s played by Italian actor Luca Marinelli and gives intense <em>Metal Gear</em> vibes by the end of the trailer. </p><p> Toward the end of the footage we see him wrapping a bandana around his head and emerging from a burning church with a squad of skeleton soldiers and fireworks exploding in the background like a death cult 4th of July celebration. There are callbacks to Mads Mikkelsen’s Clifford Unger in the first game, as well as obvious allusions to Kojima’s own <em>Metal Gear </em>series and its generations-spanning special forces operative named Snake. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1j7i9fh/luca_marinelli_i_think_if_he_donned_a_bandana_hed/?rdt=55212&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1j7i9fh/luca_marinelli_i_think_if_he_donned_a_bandana_hed/?rdt=55212" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans were quick to point out</a></span> that the director had previously tweeted that Marinelli would make a great Snake in a live action movie. The post came after the actor appeared in the otherwise pretty mediocre Netflix action blockbuster about immortal soldiers called <em>Old Guard</em>. Leave it to Kojima to weave an apparent troll of his former publisher, Konami, into meta commentary for his next serpentine-plotted thriller. </p><p>The trailer ends with Nicolas Winding Refn’s Heartman merging his DHV Magellan ship with a massive BT (hence the collector’s edition statue) to fight another massive BT and a ghostly Kaiju showdown of oozing black oil and paranormal horror. When <em>Death Stranding 2</em> was announced there were a lot of people, including myself, wondering why in the world we needed a sequel. After nearly 30 minutes of carefully crafted pre-release trailers, I’m 100 percent on board. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A recent patent filed by Nintendo strongly suggests that voice chat will be integrated into the Nintendo Switch 2 operating system, addressing one of the original Switch's biggest oversights.</p>
<p>The patent, which was <a href="https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/pdfRedirectDownload/20250058223?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiI0YjEwOGFlNS0yYjc4LTRlMzQtOTRiYi1kNjZkZDNlMDZiNmEiLCJ2ZXIiOiJlZjViYmE5NC1hMDAxLTQyNzUtOTM1ZC03NTMyY2MyNjE5ZjAiLCJleHAiOjB9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> late last month by Nintendo in the United States, outlines a system for implementing proximity chat in games, suggesting not only OS voice chat integration for the Nintendo Switch 2, but also that first-party titles will likely support proximity chat, which could considerably improve multiplayer games like the next entry in the Mario Kart series or a potential new entry in the Splatoon series.</p>
<p>Voice chat support directly on the Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be confirmed, but it's been speculated over the months that the mysterious new C button on the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-pictures/">Joy-Con controller</a> could have something to do with it. Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to learn what the new button does and how the new system will improve the user experience over its predecessor, as the dedicated Nintendo Direct focused on the console, which will likely be out <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">before the end of summer</a>, will air in less than a month.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed 2025 release date worldwide. We will keep you updated on the highly anticipated system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kojima Productions has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>release date, and the long-awaited sequel is on its way to PlayStation 5 in summer.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em>launches on June 26th. Unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-directors-cut-pc-release-coming-to-steam" rel="nofollow">the original</a>, this one's a PS5 exclusive, although it's worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>originally launched exclusively for PS4 before receiving a PC release (and then an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-xbox-release-kojima-ip" rel="nofollow">Xbox release</a>) later on down the line.</p>

<p>As well as revealing the release date, Kojima Productions also announced that pre-orders for&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>will begin on March 17th at 10am local time, so make sure to add that to your calendar if you want to get in early.</p>

<p>Naturally, that includes more spectacular scenery, more labyrinthine conversations between extremely famous people, and lots more walking. I'm looking forward to it tremendously.</p>

<p>In the trailer, you can catch glimpses not only of returning characters like Norman Reedus' Sam Porter Bridges or&nbsp;Léa Seydoux's Fragile, but also new players like Luca Marinelli's Neil and Debra Wilson's Doctor, as well as&nbsp;<em>Mad Max: Fury Road&nbsp;</em>director George Miller as Tarman.</p>

<p>You can check out the release date announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>right here. It's worth setting aside ten minutes or so to watch the whole thing, as it's exactly the kind of bonkers excess we've come to expect from Hideo Kojima.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, it's the sequel to 2019's&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>. Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-confirmed-by-norman-reedus" rel="nofollow">leaked by lead actor Norman Reedus</a> in 2022, the game was subsequently officially revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-trailer-revealed-at-game-awards-2022" rel="nofollow">at that year's Game Awards</a>.</p>

<p>It's not the only project Kojima is currently working on, either; he's also currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-new-game-od-in-partnership-with-xbox-and-filmmaker-jordan-peele" rel="nofollow">working on the mysterious&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-new-game-od-in-partnership-with-xbox-and-filmmaker-jordan-peele" rel="nofollow">OD</a>&nbsp;</em>alongside&nbsp;<em>Get Out&nbsp;</em>director Jordan Peele, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-next-generation-espionage-action-game" rel="nofollow">"next-generation espionage action game"&nbsp;<em>Physint</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a> on June 26th.</p>

<p>Activision has confirmed that Verdansk is officially returning to Call of Duty: Warzone as part of Season 3. The announcement came via social media posts on Monday morning.</p>



<p>“As we celebrate Call of Duty: Warzone’s 5 Year Anniversary, it’s time to revisit a place of unforgettable memories,” the game’s official <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1899083215802904607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media account</a> said.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-the-future-of-call-of-duty-insider-gaming-weekly">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-call-of-duty-insider-gaming-weekly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Future Of Call of Duty—Insider Gaming Weekly</a></h6>



<p>Verdansk will be returning alongside the start of Season 3 on April 3. In addition to the announcement, Activision released a new trailer to get players ready for what’s to come.</p>



<p>As far was what else fans can expect in Season 3 of Call of Duty: Black Ops  6, that information will be fully revealed when the launch gets closer. Season 3 was originally planned for a release later this month, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but was delayed</a> so the developers can “[take] time to deliver a great experience” for players.</p>



<p>The announcement of Verdansk’s return is likely just the first for what fans hope is a big new season for the game.</p>

This process begins the first time you start up the game on your console.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This policy is in keeping with other Xbox games released on Sony’s console, including Minecraft, Grounded, and Sea of Thieves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, it has caused a degree of controversy among some. Does it play?, which works to “ensure games and hardware remain accessible now and always,” <a href="https://x.com/DoesItPlay1/status/1898346712466444541" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to say the news “basically kills preservation for the PS5 version of Forza Horizon 5.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That statement taps into a concern that Forza Horizon 5 may become unplayable even to those who bought it if at some point in the future Microsoft discontinues its account linking process without updating the game to be playable without a Microsoft account. There’s also concern that Forza Horizon 5 on PS5 will become unplayable if a player loses access to their linked Microsoft account for whatever reason. Adding to this concern is the fact Microsoft will release Forza Horizon 5 on PS5 digitally, and has no plans for a physical disc version.</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony came under fire for forcing PC players of Arrowhead’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> to link a PSN account in order to play, but that decision was reversed after a backlash online. In January, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-you-wont-have-to-link-a-psn-account-to-play-some-of-its-pc-games-anymore">Sony announced gamers would no longer require players to link a PSN account to enjoy some of its PC games</a>, but offered bonuses to those who did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reaction to the Forza Horizon 5 Microsoft account news among the PS5 community has been mixed, with most players left wondering if the game has cross-progression given the forced Microsoft account link.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, according to the FAQ, Forza Horizon 5 for PS5 does not carry over save files from Xbox or PC. Microsoft pointed out that this is also the same behavior between the Xbox and Steam versions of the game, where game files are separate and not synchronized.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can publish UGC on one platform and download it to play on another, however you won't be able to edit it unless you're playing on the save profile it was originally created on. Some online statistics, such as your leaderboard scores, are synchronized if you log into the game using the same Microsoft account, the company added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Forza Horizon 5 is the latest Xbox game to launch on a rival console as part of Microsoft’s big multiplatform push.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/steel-seed-hands-on-preview-a-gem-in-the-making/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developing an original experience is becoming increasingly difficult in the video game industry, due both to the market's failure to always reward truly innovative games and the objective difficulty of creating something that hasn't already been done and making it fun. Still, plenty of titles inspired by gaming greats have managed to carve out a space in the industry thanks to the quality of the experience they offer.</p>
<p>This definitely feels like it will be the case with Steel Seed, a stealth action-adventure game in development by Storm in a Teacup, a small Italian development studio that has released some pretty unique indie games like N.E.R.O. - Nothing Ever Remains Obscure, Enki, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/close-to-the-sun-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Close to the Sun</a>, which attempted to do something different from the norm to varying degrees of success. With their latest game, on the other hand, the Italian studio seems to be playing it a little safely, as Steel Seed is a game that draws inspiration from other linear action-adventure titles like the Uncharted and the Star Wars Jedi series, featuring some light platforming and parkour and a combat system that's vaguely reminiscent of a Soulslike game. This, however, could be the best for the game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250306164231_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the experience felt almost immediately familiar in the short 20-minute-long demo I had the chance to try, the combination of elements from different games and their quality is sure to set the game apart from its illustrious inspirations. Set in a dark sci-fi world where humanity is on the brink of destruction, Zoe wakes herself up from what felt like a very long slumber to discover herself changed with a robotic body that grants her abilities far superior to those of a regular human. Lost in a world she doesn't recognize, Zoe sets out together with the mysterious drone KOBY to find her father and obtain the answers she seeks, only that this new world she woke up in won't make it very easy for her, as it is filled with machines out to take her down.</p>
<p>Steel Seed is clearly going for a cinematic approach, which feels well-realized already a few minutes into the adventure with some impressive set pieces like a giant robot going after Zoe and her companion drone, but developer Storm in a Teacup is clearly doing things right regarding gameplay as well. While the game employs a Soulslike combat system without a stamina system with light and heavy attacks and dodging, which can become a perfect dodge when timed correctly, as the sole defensive option, at least in the beginning, it implements these features well, thanks to how enemies react to hits, and how responsive Zoe feels to control. The challenge level also seems to be on point, as the enemies in the first area hit hard and don't just stand still taking hits. Over the course of the adventure, it will be possible to expand Zoe's skills to perform more complex maneuvers that will make combat feel more varied than in the first few minutes of the adventure.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250306164614_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Another big part of the Steel Seed experience will be the stealth mechanics, which also felt well put together in the short demo I played. Moving from one cover to another, Zoe will have to be extra careful avoiding and taking enemies down with instant takedowns, as their AI is mostly on point, making them react properly to Zoe's presence and alerting others in case she is found out. Overall, the stealth mechanics at the beginning of the game are somewhat straightforward, but they are well put together, and they are sure to evolve over the course of the game with more complex level design and an increased involvement of KOBY, who will be able to scan the environment unseen to help Zoe plan a course of action. Best of all, stealth sequences don't seem forced, although going straight for the enemy will put Zoe at a clear disadvantage due to the enemies' higher numbers.</p>

<p>With an interesting setting that sets up some compelling mysteries right off the bat, great responsiveness, solid gameplay mechanics, and some impressive visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5, Steel Seed has the chance of becoming one of the surprises of this packed 2025. I did not know anything about the game, but the short demo I tried was enough to make me very interested in a game I feel will surprise many when it launches later this year on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has a new update that makes copious little and large changes to the popular animal-hitting sim. As often with PC game patch notes, the changelog is a balance of mealy fare such as fixes for broken <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-best-weapons-tier-list">weapons</a>, and moments of absurdity, such as addressing a problem whereby you'd hack the tail off an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-ajarakan-tips-weaknesses-rewards-how-to-beat">Ajarakan</a> only for it to transform into another monster's appendage. Also, you'll no longer be able to cheese the Gore Magala by somehow dropping a dozen boulders on it simultaneously.</p><!--more-->
<p>The update notes in question are to be found on <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/support/wilds/en/faq/detail/060">Capcom's FAQ for currently known issues</a>. The list of technical problems addressed as of today, 10th March include the "Grill a Meal" and "Ingredient Center" features not unlocking, the Field Guide becoming inaccessible, players falling through the map during the mission "Toward Fervent Fields", NPCs not appearing in "A World Turned Upside Down", tutorials repeating themselves, Lance Power Guards and mantles not activating properly, Insect Glaive offset attacks causing your hunter to space out, force quits due to a screen rendering bug, and wait, stop! I'm just listing and rewording them all. So much for not letting the AIs take my job.</p>
<p>Let's skip to the highlights. Firstly, they've fixed a problem where "some environmental features such as floating rubbles" could be exploited several times. I've never managed this myself, but I've now looked up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1j7w7m1/floating_rubbles_you_will_be_missed/">a relevant player video on reddit</a> and well, that's not how you're supposed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-hirabami-tips-weaknesses-rewards-how-to-beat">to beat Hirabami</a>. Can't fault the effectiveness, though.</p>
<p>Secondly, they've nobbled that issue with hacked-off monster parts transforming into parts from other monsters - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1j2xurg/monsters_dropping_the_wrong_parts/">see this video</a>, in which a dismembered Ajarakan obstinately poops out pieces of Gravios. I take a fiendish delight in this bug inasmuch as Capcom have accidentally gone full Monster Gacha machine. Monster Hunter is, in my experience, pretty gentle with its randomised loot drops, but who knows, perhaps this is secretly them testing a wonderful, magical omnibeast with three rotating eyes and one big arm you yank with your slinger to make assorted wyvern kidneys fall out the bottom.</p>
<p>The FAQ also spotlights a few Monster Hunter Wilds bugs they're still working on. These include network errors when firing an SOS flare right after a quest begins, link members (aka, people you've formed a regular four-person hunting party with) not being prioritised when deciding which players appear in base camps, Palico blunt weapons failing to inflict stun and exhaust, and problems with your profile not being editable and certain side missions being unfinishable.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds continues to be a Steam favourite. I confess, I've drifted away since last week, but that is simply because I am a news shark who must keep swimming forward to the next big release, or else succumb to a deluge of floating boulders. How are you getting on with it, if you're still playing?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
