            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning: </strong></em><em>this article contains </em><em><strong>spoilers </strong></em><em>for Donkey Kong Bananza. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza is now out in the wild, and one of the biggest burning questions ahead of launch centered on DK’s new best friend: Pauline. She’s a teenager in Bananza –  13 years old, to be precise – and this has led to rampant speculation that Bananza is a prequel to Super Mario Odyssey, which features an adult Pauline living in New Donk City. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve played through the main story of Bananza and completed most of its major post-game beats, which means we now have the answers to that question and more. But be warned, we’re about to <strong>spoil the entirety of Donkey Kong Bananza's finale</strong>. So if you’re still working your way to the Planet Core, turn back now, and join us once you’ve seen Bananza through to the end yourself.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/new-donk-1752851646893.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pauline and DK arrive in New Donk City. | Image credit: Nintendo</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bananza eventually reveals that 13-year-old Pauline does, in fact, call New Donk City home, just like her Odyssey counterpart, and the story’s grand finale takes place in the metropolis after it’s been completely overrun by the returning King K. Rool. When DK and Pauline break through to the surface, Pauline exclaims “This is MY city!”, confirming the fan theory that Bananza would end by returning Pauline home to Odyssey’s most iconic location. But is this city connection enough to confirm that Bananza is a prequel to Super Mario Odyssey? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, some background on Pauline, who is central to this mystery. In Odyssey, Pauline (who’s a full-grown adult) is the Mayor of New Donk City, perhaps most memorable for her performance of Jump Up, Super Star! at the New Donk City Festival. Teenage Pauline and Mayor Pauline share a lot in common: Beyond their shared name, they are both singers and performers, with much of Teenage Pauline’s character arc revolving around gaining enough confidence to perform in front of her hometown. She also sings the Bananza Transformation songs, and Void Kong is obsessed with the power of her voice… at least until King K. Rool boots him out of the story entirely.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on Pauline’s age, most expected Bananza would be a prequel to Odyssey, and potentially an origin story for New Donk City itself. It would make sense that DK, acting as Pauline’s hero and best friend, would prompt the people to name the town after her savior once she was safely returned. But in Bananza, New Donk City is already established before DK and Pauline arrive, and during one of Teenage Pauline’s monologues at a Getaway, she references New Donk City’s nickname “The Big Banana”, a Kong-inspired parody of New York’s “The Big Apple.” It’s a nickname we’ve heard before, first uttered in Mario Odyssey by a New Donker.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Using all that as a starting point, it seems that there’s actually more evidence to suggest that Bananza is a <em>sequel </em>to Odyssey, and that Teenage Pauline is Mayor Pauline’s daughter, and the granddaughter of original Pauline (who we’ll call Arcade Pauline). Let us explain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Teenage Pauline regularly references her grandmother throughout Bananza, including one time directly in the main story. After the pair run into Diddy and Dixie Kong in the Racing Layer, Pauline says to DK during the dive to the next layer, “I’m glad you got to see your friends again! But if I don’t get home, Grandma will worry.” Teenage Pauline’s Grandma is the only family member she directly mentions in Bananza, so Nintendo clearly wants us to think about who her grandma is.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/cutscene-1752851935120.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pauline says her grandma is at "home", later revealed to be New Donk City. | Image credit: Nintendo </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The most likely answer becomes clear when we consider Donkey Kong’s grandfather: Cranky Kong. It is well-established that Cranky Kong is the original Arcade Donkey Kong that kidnapped Arcade Pauline way back in the day. Bananza reinforces this lore, as Cranky rants about his old rival who wore overalls, clearly referencing Mario… or Jumpman, as our favorite plumber was originally known. Cranky and Wrinkly Kong’s son is Donkey Kong Jr., who - despite what the Super Mario Bros. Movie may have tried to tell you - is not actually our current Donkey Kong. Junior starred in the Donkey Kong Jr. arcade game and made various other playable appearances before being essentially wiped from the face of the earth. The tie-wearing Donkey Kong we know and love – first introduced in Rare’s Donkey Kong Country – is actually Donkey Kong <em>the Third</em>, son of Donkey Kong Jr. and an unknown Kong mother. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, we’ve established three generations of DK, which brings us back to Pauline. Arcade Pauline and Mayor Pauline don’t look like the same person. Arcade Pauline has blonde hair, while the Mayor is a brunette. You could argue this is just a character redesign, but a billboard in Odyssey’s New Donk City shows a blonde version of Pauline. Perhaps that’s just a fun easter egg, but perhaps it’s a clue to canon, and we have to use all the evidence we can. The New Donk City Festival – which sees Mario recreating gameplay from the Arcade Donkey Kong game – is held to “tell the story of our city's beginnings," according to Pauline. This implies that New Donk City was founded after the events of the arcade game, built on the foundation of the girders Jumpman climbed up towards Donkey Kong.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/easter-egg-1752851969004.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">This image of Pauline in Super Mario Odyssey is a reference to the original Pauline from the Donkey Kong arcade game. | Image credit: Nintendo</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">New Donk City is a sprawling metropolis, and it likely took the course of at least a human generation to build it up to such an enormous size. That, combined with the different appearances, leads us to believe that Arcade Pauline and Mayor Pauline are two different people. Perhaps, dare we say, they are mother and daughter? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I suppose it’s possible that Bananza could still be a prequel, that Mayor and Teenage Pauline are one and the same, and that Arcade Pauline is her grandmother with a missing generational link between them, but it feels cleaner to suggest that there are three generations of Pauline: Arcade, Mayor, and Teenage, just like there are three generations of DK: Arcade/Cranky, Jr., and the main DK of today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We really hope our theory that Teenage Pauline is the granddaughter of Arcade Pauline is true, because it’s absolutely adorable that the grandchildren of two of the oldest Nintendo characters have now teamed up and become best friends in Bananza. It’s very cool to think that Nintendo has found a clever way to redefine one of its oldest character dynamics over 40 years later. Unfortunately, completing the bulk of Bananza’s postgame content – which are called Bananza Rehearsals and leads to Bananza’s true final platforming challenge – doesn’t really shed any more light on this. Pauline returns to the surface to perform a song for her city, but all we see of that is a new piece of art that appears after the credits have rolled. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/1000006378-1752850870617.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Completing Bananza's post-game content unlocks this bonus art that... doesn't really tell us anything new. | Image credit: Nintendo.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So while Bananza’s position as a prequel may make a lot of sense, it ultimately can never be more than a theory. There’s just not enough concrete evidence from Nintendo. This theory does raise some concerning, perhaps even supernatural questions about Mario, though. If he has really interacted with multiple generations of Paulines and Donkey Kongs… does this mean Mario never ages, while those around him do? Or are there multiple generations of Mario? Is Nintendo implying that Mario and Jumpman are two different characters? It’s probably best not to think about it too much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, and perhaps most crucially, it’s important to remember that Nintendo historically doesn’t care about lore and continuity across its games. Even The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – a direct sequel to Breath of the Wild – has lore inconsistencies that are ultra-hand-waved away. So it’s quite possible Nintendo doesn’t even have a truly established timeline between the original Donkey Kong, Odyssey, and Bananza, and just loves to keep fans guessing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What do you think is going on in Donkey Kong Bananza? Is Teenage Pauline the daughter of Mayor Pauline and granddaughter of the original Pauline Cranky Kong kidnapped all those years ago, or are we being completely ri-Donk-ulous? Let us know in the comments!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Logan Plant is the host of Nintendo Voice Chat and IGN's Database Manager &amp; Playlist Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Switch 2 technically launched with an <em>F-Zero</em> game, as <em>F-Zero GX</em> was available on Nintendo Switch Online’s premium tier as part of the GameCube lineup. But if you’re looking for a <em>new</em> <em>F-Zero</em> or <em>Wipeout</em>, the console has a spiritual successor that costs just $14.99: Shin’en’s <em>Fast Fusion</em>.</p><p><em>Fast Fusion</em> pits you in futuristic sci-fi hovercraft races where you fly forward at hundreds of miles per hour. Races are all about managing boosts by collecting coins to build your boost meter and driving over boost zones on the tracks themselves. (You can boost into opponents to make them spin out to earn some extra coins, which never gets old.)</p><p>The game looks great — it’s the first time I’ve been really wowed by the Switch 2’s graphics. The tracks are thrilling, with rolling hills and tight turns that sometimes make you feel like you’re on a roller coaster, especially when you’re barreling ahead at super-fast speeds. They all feel distinct, too: In one, you’ll drive over a sandy desert as whale-like creatures jump above you. A course in space forced me to dodge meteors falling on the track. One stage set around a volcano was filled with magma.</p><p>There’s no online multiplayer, so you’re probably going to be competing mostly against computer opponents. They can be tough, even at the lowest difficulty — sometimes it even feels like they can unfairly rubber-band ahead of you. But as I got more familiar with the tracks, knowing when to boost, and learning where to find alternate rounds, I found I was better at keeping up. Fortunately, you don’t have to get first place in a cup to get a good chunk of in-game currency you can use to buy new tracks or vehicles. And you can play local multiplayer, if you want to take on your friends at home.</p><p>If you tire of cups, there are a few other fun modes to play and earn money from. My favorite was “Super Hero Mode,” where you have to get first place in a track without blowing up — with the added twist that your boost meter is also a shield meter, similar to <em>F-Zero</em>. It creates an exciting risk-reward dynamic, and I wish there was a mode where you had to complete a whole cup that way.</p><p>The game’s vehicles are much less interesting than the levels. They all looked pretty generic to me. You can pay a small fee to “fuse” vehicles together to make better racers, though I honestly couldn’t tell that much of a difference between the different options.</p><p><em>Fast Fusion</em> isn’t exactly the same as <em>F-Zero</em>, and I really wish Nintendo would make a brand-new entry in that series. (<em>F-Zero 99</em> doesn’t quite count. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/16/23876228/theres-hope-for-me-yet">Sorry, Wes</a>.) And I’m not getting my hopes up for a new <em>Wipeout</em> game anytime soon. For now, <em>Fast Fusion</em> scratches the high-speed sci-fi racing itch, and it’s a great showcase for what’s possible with the Switch 2 — and what a new <em>F-Zero</em> might, someday, possibly look like.</p><p><sub>Fast Fusion<em> is available now on the Nintendo Switch 2.</em></sub></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/705627/fast-fusion-review-f-zero-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It seems like the Battlefield 6 reveal event may be very close, at last. Content creator Doom49 reported (as screengrabbed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-reveal-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Insider Gaming</a>) having received a promotional package this week, and rivaLxfactor <a href="https://x.com/rivaLxfactor/status/1946400245388038395" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> a few more details:</p>



<p><em>I have confirmed with another person that there is a 3 day event at the end of July for EA which will include the live reveal of Battlefield 6. It will be much like the BF1 event, with players getting a live round in after the devs speak and video is showcased.</em></p>



<p>This is, perhaps, why EA Games won't be at Gamescom 2025, as their PR agency confirmed to Wccftech. They're going to have their own event, possibly on Tuesday, July 29, and, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/datamine-leak-ea-battlefield-6-open-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evidenced by a datamined leak</a>, there might be a public open beta not too long afterward.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 has been in development for several years, with four studios contributing to the project:</p>



<ul>
<li>Franchise creator and caretaker DICE</li>



<li>Motive Studios (Star Wars: Squadrons, Dead Space Remake), which is working on the single player campaign</li>



<li>Criterion Games, which is working on both single player and multiplayer</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-2042-dev-dice-la-rebrands-ripple-effect-studios-new-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple Effect Studios</a>, which worked on Battlefield 2042's Community Portal</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to a report</a> from early July, Electronic Arts has lofty goals for Battlefield 6: it seeks to reach a hundred million players, which would be by far the franchise record. The report also hinted at a $400 million budget, one of the largest in the history of gaming, and various development troubles. </p>



<p>One thing is for sure: Battlefield 6 cannot fail like 2042 and, to a lesser extent, Battlefield V did. To that end, EA should ensure that the game is polished enough before making it to launch. Officially, we only know that the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be released before the end of EA's fiscal year</a>, which is to say before the end of April 2026.</p>

<p>'That'll do'</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Belkin Charging Case - front" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ce52d06607d4e/belkin-charging-case-front.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sasha Stowe</em></figcaption></figure><p>If there’s one thing that’s more important than keeping your Switch 2 charged when you’re out and about, it’s a solid, reliable case to keep it safe from harm. If you imagine that you could bring those two worlds together, you’d probably be imagining something very similar to Belkin’s Charging Case.</p>
<p>A firm, robust outside only betrays its party trick by nature of being decidedly thicker than most cases. Not a dealbreaker by any means, but sadly the use of that space isn’t exactly perfect.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the positives first, though. Underneath where your console sits is a 10,000 mAh (or 20Wh if you prefer - and you should) battery that nestles itself snugly and still with a short, velcro-fastened strap. On the top side you’ll have the classic screen flap and elasticated game card holders, a mesh pouch with a pleasing lack of any metal to damage your screen, and even a smaller pouch within for housing an Apple AirTag or similar.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, things don’t look quite so rosy once you put your console in its place. The fit is just not as good as I would expect from a company like Belkin. The console can fairly freely rock left and right, seemingly due to a combination of the battery acting as a fulcrum and the immense amount of empty space beneath each Joy-Con. There are some lips that should help stop this from happening, but they’re just not enough to prevent it.</p>
<p>Having said that, it does appear that the console is secure once everything’s closed up, but it doesn’t fill us with confidence, especially given the not-insubstantial $69.99 price tag. I really like the case’s ideas, but I do think the execution is less than ideal.</p>
<p>A bit of a rethink and a redesign with a slimmer battery that wouldn’t be so inefficient with space and this could be a serious contender.</p>

<p>Before we find out what we're all up to, however, let's see what's been going on this week. First up, of course, Nintendo released the wonderful <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> to widespread critical acclaim, including a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">9/10 review</a> from us.</p>
<p>We also found out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-announces-first-cast-members-for-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">who will be playing Link and Zelda</a> in the upcoming <strong>Legend of Zelda</strong> movie, while Square Enix sadly confirmed that there will be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/square-enix-rules-out-switch-2-upgrade-path-for-dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">no upgrade path</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> from Switch 1 to Switch 2.</p>

<h2>Alex Olney, Video Producer</h2>
<p>The plan? The plan is to get Donkey Kong Bananza and never put it down.</p>
<p>The reality? I'll probably put off buying it and instead sink another 10 hours into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a>.</p>
<p>It's a tough life.</p>
<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This weekend im gonna be joining everyone else in exploring the latest Donkey Kong adventure.</p>
<p>I've only managed about three hours or thereabouts so far, and Im already in danger of spending way too much time just destroying the entire environments. Just because I can.</p>
<p>I will actually be making time for a few other Switch cuts this weekend, too, with both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> already on my homescreen and awaiting my attention.</p>
<p>Have a good one, shorts fans!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>As predicted, everyone has gone a little bananas this weekend and yours truly is no exception. However I fear I will take far longer than any of my peers to complete Donkey Kong Bananza because I make sure that I smash every single thing that can be smashed before moving on… (Please send help!)</p>
<p>A double dose of shmup action on the way, courtesy of <a href="https://ng.dev/">NG.DEV</a>. Picked up both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gunvein">Gunvein</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_striker_ex">Fast Striker EX</a> so I can try to keep my reflexes at acceptable levels because I want to make sure I continue to be “old school” and not just plain old.</p>
<p>While I continue to make steady progress in both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Directors Cut</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a>, an inexplicable need to return to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/tekken_4">Tekken 4</a> on PlayStation 2 also needed to be inserted onto the weekend rotation. So, like… <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tekken_8">Tekken 8</a> on Switch 2 when, Namco? Asking for a friend.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend is largely dedicated to [REDACTED REVIEW GAME], but if I have any time, I'll also be trying to wrap up 100 days in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line</a>.</p>
<p>I also checked out a game the other day called <strong>corru.observer</strong> (link: <a href="https://corru.observer/">https://corru.observer/</a>) — it's this strange, funky little sci-fi game about exploring the remnants of an alien's memories. It's all fractured and corrupted and pixel-bashy, with this fantastic layer of "translation" — the alien language is being fed to you through some kind of Star Trekky auto-translator, and every now and again it'll remind you of this by saying that a word has "no equivalent" but that it's chosen something similar, and provided context. As someone with a background in translation, I think that's super neat! I'll admit that the game takes a while to wrap your head around, especially because the UI is all in-fiction, but I think it's a real treat for anyone who enjoys games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/paradise_killer">Paradise Killer</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As the season of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d6ed521c-5f08-4830-865a-d3f962e557b4" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-new-edition-with-plenty-of-changes" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer Underworlds Embergard</em></a> continues, the latest Warband to be released is <em>Kamandora's Blades</em> alongside the <em>Raging Slayers Rivals Deck</em>. This five-Fighter Warband is a group of savage warriors ready to "weaken and bleed their foes" and "hack their heads free." Mixed with the aggressive Raging Slayers deck this is a Warband for those who like picking a target and going until they're destroyed.</p>



<p>The five fighter warband is made up of Kamandora, the guiding hand and matriarch of the group, the powerful Throkk, and the nimble and deadly Ghalista, Antro Krast, and Kannat.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-kamandoras-blades-miniatures-and-character-cards.jpg?itok=EDLRSoGU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-kamandoras-blades-miniatures-and-character-cards.jpg?itok=ysUxKqsB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The story of these fighters is that they're a group living in the wastes left by Khorne's armies. Already in their description, you'll begin to get an idea of how they function.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Ghalista, Antro Krast and the hound Kannat weaken and bleed their foes before Throkk hacks their heads free."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The core mechanic of this Warband revolves around the "A Worthy Skull" ability. At the start of the first Action step of each Battle Round a single enemy fighter is selected to be the 'worthy skull'. This ties into not only the narrative, of Kamandora picking what fights her Blades take part in, but also into the Inspiration mechanic of this Warband.</p>

<p>First, you'll be inspiring each friendly fighter adjacent to the enemy worthy skill after a power step, but also if the worthy skull is killed by a friendly fighter they will also be inspired. Tracking down and dealing damage to the worthy skull is further enhanced by the Slaughterous Pilgrimage ability. After picking the worthy skill each friendly fighter must be pushed 1 hex closer.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-kamandoras-blades-warband-sheet.jpg?itok=WC-gZ8N1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-kamandoras-blades-warband-sheet.jpg?itok=Zj0kZBgV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This all lead to a LOT happening at the beginning of each battle round as your opponent gets to learn who your target is, every friendly fighter moves closer, and those who are adjacent get to be inspired.</p>

<p>Inspiring, as you'd expect, will power up each of the Fighters attacks, as well as their defences. This Warband is a seek and destroy machine intended to deal constant damage one enemy at a time. It is a wave that's going to be constantly putting pressure on dealing damage to your enemies and whittling down their forces before they can do anything to push back on you.</p>

<p>The engine of this Warband is extremely clear to understand, it's formulaic yes but if you're wanting to get a better understanding on the rest of the game and want to just run your Warband with a simple strategy it's a great first step to be taking. It's also great for someone like me who tends to appreciate an aggressive approach, as well as the consistency that comes with it.</p>

<h2><em>Raging Slayers</em> Rivals Deck</h2>

<p>When talking about the <em>Kamandora's Blades</em> and their consistent strategy, rolling dice normally laughs in the face of that. With a Rivals Deck like <em>Raging Slayers</em> you can negate that.</p>

<p>When using the <em>Raging Slayers Rivals Deck</em> you'll be able to place a Rage token on any fighter that you pick to use a Charge attacks. These Rage tokens will stay on the fighter until the end of the battle round.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-raging-slayers-01.jpg?itok=C1B3oQy4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-raging-slayers-01.jpg?itok=IBmkWROl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A fighter with a Rage token can reroll 1 attack dice immediately after making a melee attack, and if you're attacked and not driven back or grapples you can then push your fighter 1 hex away from the attackers.</p>

<p>Combining the two, you've got a force of enraging fighters, that advance on a selected opponent and power up, and if they're hit have a chance to back away while Enraged.</p>

<p>The Objective Cards of this set are just as aggressive as the abilities would have you believe. Points are scored for killing, enraging, and having a large number of enraged fighters in various areas of the map. If you're playing as aggressively as this deck wants you to then achieving something like having all friendly fighters enraged and in your opponent's territory.</p>

<p>To back up these aggressive Objectives the Power Cards are your disposal are all about making your attacks even more consistent, how you can mitigate taking damage by allowing rerolls on saves, and moving enraged fighters further towards targets.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-raging-slayers-02.jpg?itok=n2vAroqH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-raging-slayers-02.jpg?itok=Q0UFqUU_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Upgrades take this further by adding additional attacks, altering damage types, and providing additional protections while enraged.</p>

<h2><em>Kamandora's Blades </em>and <em>Raging Slayers</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Never before have I see a combination Warband and Rivals Deck that is so straightforward and blood thirsty. The ever encroaching fighters, empowered and buffed, are going to be a terrifying force that will just become scarier as your battles go on.</p>

<p>Seeing either of these players should be warned that they need to take action to slow this Warband's development, or hope they can stay out of reach while working on their own objectives.</p>

<p>For a player who is into a linear strategy, while it might seem obvious, it's surely going to be a consistent strategy to create a tidal wave of attacks making it harder for your opponent to focus on objectives while they're just trying to protect themselves.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, this is a creator tool mode you can access before entering the main game, and it allows you to use the Switch 2's mouse controls to carve out, smoothen, paint, and sculpt works of art.</p>

<p>As more players have now had some time to check out the new game, more creations are being shared online. So, here's a quick look at some of the creative designs DK fans are going bananas for right now.</p>
<p>Many of these designs are doing the rounds on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/">Donkey Kong subreddit</a> as well as social media. First up, we've got a cat:</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4pltmoy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Next is Leo Luster – a throwback to the <a href="https://donkeykong.fandom.com/wiki/Leo_Luster">Donkey Kong Country TV Show</a>:</p>

<p>For anyone calling for more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>, tell us what you think of this recreation:</p>

<p>Mario's brother Luigi might not be in the new DK outing, but he's still there in spirit:</p>

<p>And how about this classic recreation of DK:</p>

<p>That's just a small sample of the sculptures so far, and it's still early days, so we're sure there'll be plenty of other amazing creations going forward. You can see our full thoughts about this particular mode in our Donkey Kong Bananza review (<em>spoiler: we didn't mind it</em>).</p>

<p>In recent weeks, we've been finding out more details about the developers behind the Switch 2's launch line up of games, and now Nintendo's 1-UP Studio has updated its website with two major projects.</p>
<p>It helped out with not only <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> but also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. It previously supported Nintendo EPD on projects like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> and assisted with multiple other entries in the Mario series during the same generation. You can see the rest of the company's history <a href="https://1-up-studio.jp/company/history.html">on its official website</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4pltmoy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>According to 1UP's website, its responsibilities on Donkey Kong Bananza included "design, level design, programming" and "part of the sound". As for Mario Kart World, it's mentioned how it assisted with "part of the design". As with many major first-party Nintendo titles nowadays, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/06/xenoblade_studio_monolith_soft_is_helping_make_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">collaborative efforts like this</a> have become increasingly common.</p>
<p>This follows an update from Nintendo earlier this month, which confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-has-been-revealed">"the Super Mario Odyssey team"</a> developed DK and Pauline's latest outing for the Switch 2.

<p>Instead of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-finally-has-release-date-out-on-switch-2-day-one">previous August release date</a>, it's now been pushed back to <strong>13th November 2025</strong> for the Switch 2, Switch and multiple other platforms. The latest delay is apparently tied to recordings, localisation and "other related processes". Here's the scoop, via the game's <a href="https://x.com/InazumaSeries/status/1946252039518044194">official social media account</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important Announcement Regarding the Release Date</strong></p>
<p>Due to the content volume exceeding our initial expectations, additional time is required for voice recording, multi-language localization, and other related processes. As we work toward the final stages of development, we have decided to adjust the release date to ensure the best possible quality.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<div><p>The release date of "Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road" has been changed from August 21, 2025, to [November 13, 2025 (GMT)].</p><p>

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to all the fans who have been eagerly waiting for a long time, and truly appreciate your understanding and continued support.</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see the video below detailing this delay and it also reiterates how development is apparently in the "final stages". The team believes this next date is when it will "finally be able to release the game".</p>
<p>The same video also highlights the development progress and improved features players can expect when this title does finally arrive. The team does not want to make any compromises and intends to use the extra time to further polish and enhance the overall experience.</p>

<p>This delay follows Level-5's launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, which got off to a positive start in its opening months – surpassing 1.2 million in "global cumulative sales".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">indie.io is a video game publishing platform that works with lots of different developers and publishes games in a variety of genres. They’ve published dozens of games, several of which are discounted on Nintendo Switch right now as part of a sale that will run through July 30.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As with indie.io’s library as a whole, the sale includes a wide range of genres. There’s cozy adventures, tactical RPGs, creature collectors, management sims, and more. You can check out the full sale <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/sales-and-deals/indie-io/#sort=df&amp;p=0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>here</u></a>, but we thought we’d highlight six games that showcase the diversity of titles that are available. Let’s get started:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/c60f2d286cca1b53dc4a30f52f70ca80da94835ae2297b81e3ec14893b86046b-18001013-07-18-2025-11-38-am-1752863926860.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/echoes-of-the-plum-grove-switch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Echoes of the Plum Grove</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sale: 20% off</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cozy farming sim genre has been thriving in recent years, and Echoes of the Plum Grove adds to the formula by letting you experience multiple generations. Initially, you wash up on an island shore and start with a modest plot of land. Over time, you can expand your homestead, start a family, and grow that family. You can befriend or insult your neighbors, form an alliance with a local witch coven, or poison people who cross you. As the generations pass, these decisions will shape your descendents’ experiences and ultimately define your legacy. The game world is fully hand drawn, with 2D characters in 3D environments that heighten the cozy feel. And while forming relationships through the generations is the central core of the game, there are also mysteries across the island for you to uncover.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/27a7c9cc1a10206916f1d18b8d7340a182f602a5c43711113b15024ecec6d14f-18001013-07-18-2025-11-39-am-1752863980107.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dark-deity-switch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Dark Deity</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sale: 75% off</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Deity is a strategy RPG that was clearly inspired by classics of the genre. You build up an army, lead your soldiers in turn-based combat, and choose what classes to promote them into as they grow stronger. There are 30 playable characters, and if one of them falls in battle, they’ll suffer grave wounds that drop their stats. So you need to be careful and strategize as you lead your squad from rookies to heroes. The main story is told across 28 chapters that take more than 20 hours to complete, and the “Suns Out, Swords Out” DLC is also available for 20% off as part of the current sale. It adds seven additional levels, each telling a story from before or after the events of the base game.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/778f5d494b38cab2cc5e5e2d834aec4594c160ff025b2e40e10e42c8ad85a29d-18001013-07-18-2025-11-40-am-1752864071071.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/coromon-switch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Coromon</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sale: 50% off</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another modern game that takes inspiration from and builds upon the classics of the genre, Coromon is a monster tamer with more than 100 monsters to catch and train. Each monster is defined by its element, traits, and skills. The battle system is stamina-based and every skill costs SP, so you need to be strategic about when you use your most powerful skills. Meanwhile, traits are inherent to a monster and can trigger when certain conditions are met. They don’t sap stamina when they trigger and differ between monsters of the same species, so they can be an important factor of building your perfect team. The story of Coromon takes you across six biomes as you try to stop a mysterious threat, and there are more reveals and plot twists than you might expect in a typical monster tamer.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/aaed8882d691d0f6920791bbe29c0276e710ec58867defd9b941d8d906bb9d69-18001013-07-18-2025-11-41-am-1752864126105.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/cat-cafe-manager-switch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Cat Cafe Manager</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sale: 40% off</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Game titles don’t get much more clear than this one. In Cat Cafe Manager, you … manage a cat cafe. You inherit an old, rundown cafe in the town of Caterwaul Way, and you’ll need to rebuild and renovate it to give the local stray cats a proper home. You can decorate and expand the space to fit your personal tastes, as well as hire new employees and refine their skills. You can make plenty of feline friends, but you’ll build relationships with humans too. It is a cafe, after all. The villagers will want to stop by and take a load off after a long day, and you can travel across the town to chat with the locals and discover new recipes and other opportunities for your cafe. Who knows, you might even uncover a mystery or two in need of solving.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/52131427f1e6fcb529f5060bd6c12056d8129d7565f008ae75862f7cdbe37ee1-18001013-07-18-2025-11-42-am-1752864169029.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/9-years-of-shadows-switch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>9 Years of Shadows</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sale: 35% off</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, for something completely different. 9 Years of Shadows is a side-scrolling Metroidvania where color has been drained from the world for almost a decade (hence the name). You play as Europa, a warrior bent on fighting her way to the mechanical giant Talos and stopping the corruption seeping out of it before everything is swallowed in darkness. You’ll befriend a cute floating bear called Apino who has the ability to bring back color, and together you’ll wield elemental armors, restore vibrant hues, and try to free the world from the colorless curse that plagues it. And as you do, enjoy a soundtrack from composers Michiru Yamane and Norihiko Hibino, known for their work on Castlevania and Metal Gear Solid, respectively.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/73436094b39ccee444a40a85b45e169ce1b377fc45f7a3f150c57e4197ab78cd-18001013-07-18-2025-11-43-am-1752864212426.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mail-time-switch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Mail Time</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sale: 30% off</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our list ends by circling back around to a cozy, relaxing game. Mail Time is a cottagecore adventure set in a whimsical forest where you’re a courier who uses light platforming to deliver letters. You can customize the look of your character and run, jump, and glide your way across the forest to make deliveries to the critters who live there. Relaxation is the focus of the game, with gameplay that doesn’t saddle you with anything stressful. There’s no time limits, pressure, danger, or fall damage. You can just chill, make your deliveries, upgrade your gliding, and do it again. Simplicity can be nice sometimes.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/6-diverse-games-in-the-indieio-publisher-sale-on-nintendo-switch]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress-dont-forget-to-shower/">FBC: Firebreak</a> is the first stab at making a multiplayer game that Remedy Entertainment has taken, so it's not the biggest surprise that things haven't been smooth sailing from the jump. In its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536607976683733002">latest blog post on the game's Steam page</a>, Remedy acknowledged the issues players are having with the game, including the fact that its opening hours can be fairly frustrating.</p>



<p>Remedy also confirmed that its first major update, which it had <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-details-two-major-updates-coming-in-fbc-firebreaks-post-launch-roadmap/">previously set to arrive sometime in Fall 2025,</a> will launch this coming September, though it didn't provide a specific date.</p>



<p>"<em>The weeks since launch have given us a huge amount of feedback, from you, the community, as well as reviews, and the data we are looking at</em>," the post reads<em>. "We've seen many players come into the game and leave within the first hour. And that's because our first hour can be frustrating; you feel ineffective and confused as to what to do. This needs to be improved."</em></p>



<p>"<em>For many of you already playing FBC: Firebreak, us focusing on the opening experience may seem less exciting, but to keep the game healthy (and your matchmaking fast), we need to bring in more people with a better first-time experience than before.</em>"</p>



<p>Remedy goes on to say that it will introduce more narrative onboarding for players who are hungry for more information about the world in which FBC: Firebreak exists, the same world as Control and Control 2, the latter of which is arguably the game that players are most excited to see from Remedy. It also says that it intends to improve the "<em>pop-up tips you receive while playing by offering important information at relevant times</em>."</p>



<p>The studio also confirms that it will be adding three new heavy guns to the game as part of its efforts to change how weak the gunplay can feel off the top. It also plans "<em>to drop all 'generic' upgrades from equipment (guns and tools) and start players with a playable and powerful version of everything a Firebreak needs from the beginning</em>."</p>



<p>Remedy is working on a Mod system to replace those more "<em>generic</em>" upgrades which the studio says will let you tweak weapons and how they become more powerful over time based on how you want to play. More about this new system will be revealed with the update in September.</p>



<p>Remedy will also be making "<em>big changes</em>" to Jobs and their content, starting with the Clearance and the Corruption levels being replaced by "<em>pre-made, exciting (you'll have to take our word for that for now) variations of Job experiences that can still be short or long or filled with Corrupted items, but also a whole lot more</em>."</p>



<p>It will also introduce a new Job with the September update, and the team is also currently looking at ways in which it can create more variety in the things to do in FBC: Firebreak, and to add more to the game.</p>



<p>"<em>We are pushing a lot of improvements and changes into the game for our first major update. Some of these ideas were improvements we weren't able to add before launch, but all were decided on and developed based on what we heard from you (listening to feedback) and seen from you (looking at data). We are extremely excited about these changes and about delivering even more than we'd originally been planning, but changes now also mean changes later. We need to see what's working for you and to hear from you again before we can be certain that we're prioritizing the right things</em>."</p>



<p>Last month, The Game Business reported that Ampere Analysis claimed Firebreak had only <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-reportedly-has-just-under-250k-players-while-junes-other-major-releases-like-fbc-firebreak-dune-awakening-and-rematch-all-exceed-1m/">managed 1.3 million</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-reportedly-has-just-under-250k-players-while-junes-other-major-releases-like-fbc-firebreak-dune-awakening-and-rematch-all-exceed-1m/">players</a> in its opening week, and while that's not exactly anything to scoff at, it's below what a modern multiplayer game needs to survive. There's also the fact that, because Firebreak is available on Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus Extra, the player count absolutely does not equal copies sold.</p>



<p>FBC: Firebreak might not be going as well as Remedy would have hoped in its opening month, but it's clear that the studio is trying to be transparent with its community and fix elements of the game that it and its community have identified as weak. If it can successfully listen to its community, then Remedy has more than a good shot at making FBC: Firebreak a very successful multiplayer game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Corvus Belli’s recent Fantasy skirmish wargame, <i>Warcrow</i>, released last year with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warcrow-winds-from-north-review" rel="nofollow"><i>Winds of the North starter set</i></a> and followed up with a few <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warcrow-syenann-action-pack-review" rel="nofollow">additional lines of forces</a>, but overall it hasn’t felt like the game truly received the introduction into the world it deserved… until now!</p>

<p>Corvus Belli just sent us an early copy of the newest release, <i>Warcrow</i> Song of the Dormant, and we’re digging in to check it out, see what’s included, and dive into how it plays.</p>

<h2>What’s Included in <i>Warcrow </i>Song of the Dormant?</h2>

<p>The new Battle Pack boxed set includes everything two players need to jump into the game, as it pits the forces of Feudom against the Scions of Yaldabaoth (more on both of these forces shortly). Included in the box set is:</p>

<ul><li>Beginner Rule &amp; Scenario Booklet</li>
	<li>Dice</li>
	<li>Range Rulers</li>
	<li>Cardboard Terrain</li>
	<li>14 miniatures Consisting of:</li>
	<li>1x Verena of Aurtigard</li>
	<li>1x Morgane of JauCret Syzigian</li>
	<li>1x Knight of the Sacred Relic</li>
	<li>4x Feudom Guisarmiers</li>
	<li>1x Uruk, He Who is Without Prejudice</li>
	<li>1x Needle</li>
	<li>1x Breath</li>
	<li>4x Intact</li>
</ul><h2>Who are the Feudom and the Scions?</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-knight-vs-needle.jpg?itok=7tscaUqH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-knight-vs-needle.jpg?itok=QuD3JBOi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Perhaps the most exciting element of the new <i>Warcrow</i> Song of the Dormant Battle Pack is the inclusion of two new factions to the game: Feudom and Scions of Yaldabaoth. But who are they, and what do they fight for?</p>

<p>The Feudom are your very classic holy warriors in a lot of ways. They seem organized (based on the bit of lore included in the instruction booklet) around a series of different realms and leaders, and rely on their faith to grant them strength and power.</p>

<p>This is a culture that relies on the populace to maintain safety and order - in more ways than one, as the rulebook references the toll that heavy taxation in the Feudom has on the everyday person.</p>

<p>But who are they fighting against? Who is it that crawls out of the fog? Meet the Scions of Yaldabaoth, “Dark Minded” elves who have embraced the corruption of magic, all for the pursuit of knowledge, power, and advancement.</p>

Uruk, He Who Is Without Prejudice is the leader of this fighting force, and his body is so twisted and honed to be a killing machine that he looks unlike anything else on the battlefield.</p>

<p>One thing I love about these miniatures, and which goes a long way toward describing the whole ethos of the Scions, is the description of the Intact. The Intact are described as not yet changing their bodies with transformations, and being so shamed by that fact that they cover their bodies in the bones, skin, and limbs of others!</p>

<h2>The Learn-To-Play Experience in <em>Warcrow</em> Song of the Dormant</h2>

<p>The Learn-To-Play experience in <i>Warcrow</i> Song of the Dormant takes big leaps forward for the game, and this feels like a true introduction to the game. The booklet begins with lore for each of the two factions, and then we get right into playing the game.</p>

<p>Assuming you’ve already assembled the miniatures (they’re very easy to assemble, without instructions because it’s mostly intuitive), the tutorial game walks you through every step.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-rulebook.jpeg?itok=FApaebGc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-rulebook.jpeg?itok=XgmNZ3Zf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The rulebook walks you through every step of learning the basics of the game</figcaption></figure><p>You don’t even roll the dice, instead, the booklet tells you what the roll result should be at every point to show you how the game flows. Once you make it through that beginning tutorial, there’s a QR code to scan to get the full rules, but you’ll have most of what you need to keep going!</p>

<p>And from this point on in the booklet, you’ll see a truly well-thought out mini campaign for the two forces as they face off against each other.</p>

<p>There’s lore describing the setting and the stakes involved, and then we crack off into three mounting scenarios, with mission briefings for each side of the battle.</p>

<p>This new Battle Pack is so well-presented, clear, and easy to understand - and the translation into English is the cleanest we’ve seen. I really like the look of all the miniatures in the box, and the inclusion of cardboard terrain is a nice touch.</p>

<p>All in all, this really feels like the introduction that <i>Warcrow</i> deserves, and I believe the game is ready to hit the big-time. If you’ve been curious about <i>Warcrow</i> but haven’t seen a clear path into the game yet, this is the product you should be reaching for - and it should be hitting stockists in late August.</p>

I wasn't planning on picking up the new Nintendo console off the bat, but the incredible reviews of Donkey Kong Bananza convinced me to cave and buy one much earlier than I'd expected. IGN gave the game a rare <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">10 out of 10 review</a> and people are already talking about how it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-game-of-the-year-2025-donkey-kong-bananza-clair-obscur-expedition-33-death-stranding-2">giving GOTY vibes</a> barely a week after release. As a lifelong Nintendo fan, the potential of missing out on a Donkey Kong masterpiece for a full year was just enough to push me over the edge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was first introduced to Donkey Kong in the Super Nintendo days. Donkey Kong Country was challenging and fun, and my brother and I spent countless hours playing it. Then came <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, which if I remember correctly, actually required an Expansion Pak to function.
