            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-breaks-its-own-pricing-rules-airpods-max-hits-a-wild-black-friday-low.1362778/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Discounts on Apple’s products are few and far between. This is true for both the latest releases and most older generation models that still perform well. But thanks to Black Friday and Cyber Monday, that changes today.</p>
<p>Even though the events are technically still a few days away, early deals have started popping it. There’s a wide range of items to grab, from tech essentials to kitchen appliances, games, outdoor gear, and even toys! We also just spotted Apple AirPods Max — one of the best wireless headphones out there — at a discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5865/">These headphones usually sit at $550, but they can be yours for $430 today. That’s after a sweet 22% discount.</a> The offer applies to blue, orange, starlight, and purple color options. Those after the classic black version can grab it for $479. There are no weirdly long coupon codes or complicated checkout processes to worry about. Just add the product to your cart, and the discount applies automatically. Prime members will also enjoy free shipping on their orders.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5865/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Pro-Level Active Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>The headphones don’t just look good; they are comfortable to wear, too. The pair is designed with a knit-mesh canopy and memory foam ear cushions that fit nicely to seal the sound in. Unlike most over-ear headphones, these don’t apply unnecessary pressure to the ears, which means you can wear them for longer without feeling uneasy.</p>
<p>Carring them around safely won’t be a problem either, thanks to the color-matched smart case that’s included in the box for free. Plus, since there are multiple fresh colors to choose from, you can pick one that suits your aesthetics the best. Like your audio gear a bit on the minimal side? The black or starlight options can be a great pick. Want something with a bit more personality? The purple version is stunning!</p>
<p>Performance-wise, these are packed with a dynamic driver and the Apple H1 chip for rich, high-fidelity audio. There’s Active Noise Cancellation that blocks all background sound for a more immersive experience, even in noisy, chaotic settings. This feature is great for when you really want to focus on a task (or vibe to a track) without any distractions. Just put these on, and block the outside world for as long as you want.</p>



<p>Of course, that doesn’t work for every situation. Sometimes, it’s better to be aware of what’s happening around you. For that, you’ve got the Transparency mode. This one lets ambient sound in while still delivering deep, quality audio. You can enjoy what’s playing, plus stay in touch with the world. This mode is best when you’re travelling and don’t want to miss your stop, or when you’re in a cafe and want to hear the barista call your name.</p>
<p>Spatial Audio is supported, too. This mode pushes sound that suits your unique ear shape for a 3D experience. The headphones are also smart enough to pause the audio automatically when you take them off! Tweaking other settings doesn’t require pulling your phone out, either. You can adjust volume, mute yourself on calls, skip tracks, and more using the digital crown right there on the headphones.</p>
<p>Pairing these with your device is straightforward. You can place the headphones near your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, and just tap Connect on the screen to get started.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5865/">The current deal brings the price of this high-end pair to $430.</a> We know it’s still a bit of an investment, but the discount somewhat makes these a bit more approachable. If you’ve been wanting to grab premium headphones from Apple for less, today is the day to make the move.</p>

              <p>Both storage variants of the Galaxy S25 Ultra have <strong>crashed to all-time low prices</strong> on Amazon for Black Friday: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/">256GB model drops from $1,299 to $949</a>, while the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/">512GB version falls from $1,419 to $1,019</a>. With these prices well undercutting Samsung’s own website, Amazon is the clear winner on this flagship purchase. At these lower prices, the S25 Ultra competes with the iPhone 17 Pro, and many would argue Samsung gives you more features for less cash.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best Smartphone</h2>
<p>The screen of the <strong>6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X runs at a native 3088 x 1440 resolution</strong> with adaptive <strong>refresh rates from 1Hz to 120Hz</strong>. Lowering its refresh rate to 1Hz while displaying static images, this screen dynamically adjusts its refresh rate depending upon content; it ramps up to 120Hz in the case of gaming and scrolling. The peak brightness goes up to 2600 nits for great outdoor visibility even under direct sunlight. This <strong>display supports HDR10+</strong> for stunning color reproduction in compatible content. It also has the toughened Gorilla Glass Victus 3 to protect it against scratches and drops with undiminished touch sensitivity.</p>
<p>The <strong>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip</strong> represents the most powerful mobile silicon currently available. This custom variant happens to run slightly faster than the standard Snapdragon 8 Elite in other flagship phones. The octa-core architecture handles demanding games and 4K video editing, and heavy multitasking without breaking a sweat. AI processing happens locally on the device through dedicated neural processing cores.</p>



<p><strong>Battery capacity reaches 5000mAh</strong> to provide all-day endurance even for demanding users. This efficient processor and adaptive display work together to make the most of your day. <strong>Fast 45W charging takes the phone from zero to 65% in about 30 minutes</strong>. Wireless charging at 15W offers cable-free convenience when at a desk or nightstand. You will be able to top up Galaxy Buds or a friend’s phone by merely placing them on the back of your S25 Ultra with reverse wireless charging.</p>
<p>The camera system consists of a <strong>quad-lens setup that competes with independent cameras</strong>: The primary 200MP wide sensor captures exceptional detail that can be used for aggressive cropping without losing quality. A 50MP periscope telephoto delivers 5x optical zoom on subjects far away. The secondary telephoto provides 3x optical zoom for portraits and shots in the middle distance; it has a resolution of 10MP. The 12MP ultra-wide captures wide-screen shots with a field of view up to 120 degrees.</p>
<p>Video capabilities <strong>encompass 8K recording at 30fps or 4K at 60fps with exceptional stabilization</strong>. Super Steady video mode removes shake during walking or running. Director’s View lets one see all camera angles simultaneously and seamlessly switch between views when recording. Pro video controls give filmmakers manual exposure, focus, and audio level adjustments.</p>
<p>The <strong>built-in S Pen</strong> turns this phone into a productivity powerhouse: Taking handwritten notes feels natural on the responsive stylus, feeling like pen-on-paper feedback. Annotate screenshots, sign documents, and even sketch out your next idea without needing any extra accessories. The pen stores inside the phone body, where it is always ready should inspiration strike.</p>
<p>Starting at $949 for 256GB or $1,019 for 512GB, Galaxy S25 Ultra offers flagship performance that has never been this affordable on Black Friday. If you want the best Android phone available, period, these record-low prices finally make the premium features accessible.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-hytale/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-is-hytale-hytale-v-minecraft-comparison-explained.1362769/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The thought-lost Hytale project has arisen. Hypixel Studios has resumed work on the upcoming sandbox game, and it’s drawing plenty of comparisons to Minecraft. If you’re unsure of what the game is and why people are so excited, this guide has a full explainer for you.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-shuts-down-hypixel-studios-cancels-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale was officially canceled</a> in mid-2025 after 10 years of development. The title’s complexity was deemed one of the main factors in the game (and Hypel Studios) closure. There were also suggestions that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-hytale-dev-says-issues-were-all-internal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘issues were all internal’</a>. </p>



<p>However, merely months later, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale was brought back to life</a> by founder, Simon Collins-Laflamme. </p>







<p>Here we are in late 2025 with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-announcement-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale about to enter early access</a>, and many still don’t know what it is.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-hytale">What Is Hytale?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to do and explore. Credit to Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hytale is a sandbox game that allows you to create, build, and explore a procedurally generated world.</strong></p>



<p>From its blocky art style to the ability to uncover and unearth your innermost building skills, Hytale bears resemblance to another popular sandbox game (more on this later), but has more than enough of its own nuances to stand out.</p>







<p>Hytale was initially devised as a Hypixel server in Minecraft. After the spin-off server’s revenue potential was stunted by Mojang-enforced EULA changes in 2014, the idea was coined to make Hytale a standalone game.</p>



<p>Here’s how the official Hytale website describes the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Hytale blends the freedom of a sandbox with the momentum of an RPG: explore a procedurally generated world full of dungeons, secrets, and a variety of creatures, then shape it block by block. Our Early Access release focuses on polished core systems – exploration, responsive combat, and robust building – alongside creator‑first tools for making your own content, crafting minigames, and running community servers.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-is-hytale-an-mmo">Is Hytale An MMO?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Hytale is described as an MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) game as players will be able to interact and share the same game space in servers.</strong></p>



<p>In the developer’s words: “Why not invite a friend or two to share the experience and leave a mark on the world together?”</p>



<p>The game features player-run servers and encourages the Hytale community to bond and come together. It’s unclear how many people can be in one server at a time, but make no mistake that the MMO aspect is real.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hytale-like-minecraft">Is Hytale Like Minecraft?</h2>



<p><strong>Despite being developed as a Minecraft server within Minecraft, meaning it is like the game, to an extent, Hytale is its own game, and doesn’t claim to be like Minecraft.</strong></p>



<p>The Minecraft comparison feels obvious at first glance. However, once you watch the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-coming-soonand-shows-off-16-minutes-of-minecraft-like-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale gameplay</a> and understand the devs’ vision, it might be more appropriate to describe it as ‘the <em>next </em>Minecraft.’</p>



<p>An emphasis on variety with creation tools, mini-games, and the encouragement to share worlds and have players in your server is a big part of Hytale’s identity. The combat is more extensive, and it leans further into RPG elements.</p>



<p>You should check out a 16-minute gameplay trailer to see it for yourself.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>You better believe that Hytale will be very popular once it hits early access. We’ve not got there yet, and announcements have already revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-reveals-plans-for-proximity-chat-multiplayer-portals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plans for proximity chat and Multiplayer ‘Portals’</a>.</p>

            <p>Charlie Cox won himself a Game Awards nomination for his work voicing Gustave in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. However, while the actor is understandably delighted to see his work recognised, he says as much of the credit needs to go to Gustave's motion performance actor, Maxence Cazorla.</p>
<p>Cox recently reacted to his Best Performance nomination while speaking at a panel (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@posta.entretenimiento/video/7575433617237642517">recorded by POSTA Entretenimiento</a>). "Yes, I'm thrilled for this nomination," Cox said, before immediately praising Cazorla's work bringing the Clair Obscur character to life.</p>

<p>"I've said this before, and I think it is important to say that there's an amazing french actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla who did almost all of the motion capture for that role," Cox shared with the audience.</p>
<p>"And so, any nomination or any credit I get, I really have to give to him, because I really believe that the performance of that character is down to him, and my voice was just part of that process."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Cox admitted that while Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been met with critical acclaim, he personally feels "like a total fraud". Why? Because it turns out that the actor recorded <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/daredevils-charlie-cox-feels-like-a-total-fraud-following-clair-obscur-expedition-33-praise">most of his lines in only about four hours as part of a voice over gig set up by his agent</a>.</p><p>Cox is not the only Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 cast member to be up for the Best Performance award at this year's Game Awards. Both Ben Starr and Jennifer English have also been nominated for their part in Sandfall's turn-based RPG. Meanwhile, the title is also up for Game of the Year, alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.</p>
<p>With 12 nominations to its name, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has made Game Awards history by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">becoming the most nominated game since the show's conception</a>.</p>

<p>The Game Awards 2025 will take place on Thursday, 11th December, at 7:30pm EST. That's very early in the morning on the 12th, if you are in the UK. Will you be watching?</p>

<h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Stranger Things: Welcome to The Hellfire Club Adventure Game</h3>

<p>For many, <em>D&amp;D</em> caught their eye when <em>Stranger Things</em> came out. If you're a fan of the show, this lets you play as the <em>D&amp;D </em>heroes the characters of the show actually play as. This is great for people new to <em>D&amp;D</em>, with a lot of the same things as the Starter Set above. But, it's also a good time for <em>D&amp;D</em> veterans who want some<em> Stranger Things</em> flavor.</p>

<h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Dungeon Master's Guide</h3>

<p>Check <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-dungeon-masters-guide-review-true-dms-best-friend" rel="nofollow">our review</a> for more specific information, but if you have anyone you know that's interested in becoming a DM for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, this is THE book to get. It has all of the information they'll need to get going and is considered one of the core rulebooks of the game. The starter sets may be a better option for someone just dipping their toes, but this is great for someone that's ready to jump in fully.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Player's Handbook</h3>

<p>If you already have the 2014 Player's Handbook and some of the expansions released later, this probably isn't needed. And if someone in the player group has one already, you probably don't need one of your own. But, this is still one of the "core" books for<em> D&amp;D</em> that includes all of the nitty gritty details to play the game. Everything a player would need to know.</p>

<h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Monster Manual</h3>

<p>This is the final core book that would flesh out just about everything anyone would need to know to play as expansive a game of D&amp;D as they would want. It details all of the most popular monsters in <em>D&amp;D</em>, how to make a monster and use them, and everything else. With the updated layout that is easier to use, this is a great pick up for a veteran <em>D&amp;D</em> fan who may not have sprung for the newer manual yet.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-neo-mini-drone-reaches-its-lowest-price-that-makes-it-easier-than-ever-to-pick-up-this-black-friday-2000646001</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-neo-mini-drone-reaches-its-lowest-price-that-makes-it-easier-than-ever-to-pick-up-this-black-friday.1362733/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Comparing today’s drones to the ones from just 10 short years ago isn’t&nbsp;<em>quite</em> like comparing a MacBook to the UNIVAC, but the differences are truly incredible. One of the best examples of how drones have become infinitesimally smaller, more user-friendly, and priced for everyone is the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5864/">DJI Neo, a palm-sized 0.3-pound wonder that’s a terrific early Black Friday deal at just $159 at Amazon.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>What the DJI Neo does best is something its ancient ancestors from 2015 could never even dream of doing — AI-powered subject tracking that allows it to follow you and keep you in frame while you’re in motion, all while shooting 4K Ultra HD video and somehow not crashing into anything. Unlike its predecessors that were mainly geared toward big sweeping landscape shots — and only after you mastered the art of flying it — the Neo accomplishes all of its many fun photographic features while not even requiring a remote control.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5864/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Long-Haul Flight</h2>
<p>The DJI Neo has 18 minutes of flight time per battery charge, which gives you ample time to have it follow and shoot amazingly stable 4K Ultra HD video of you or another subject, hover or circle for beautiful group photos, or go on fast acrobatic flights that result in amazing action videos.</p>
<p>Getting started with the Neo could not be easier. Take it in your palm, press the mode button to select how you want to shoot (including Circle mode where the drone orbits you at a fixed altitude to shoot amazing 360-degree video, among other great action modes), and it takes off from your hand. When it’s done, it returns and lands in your hand. It has built-in guards for its four propellers to protect both your hands and the drone itself, and also to make indoor flight and shoots an option.</p>



<h2>Tag, Shoot, Enjoy</h2>
<p>The Neo is incredibly easy to control, and by many methods. Add the DJI Fly app to your smartphone and the Neo becomes a voice-controlled flyer that responds to spoken flight directives. The app can also be used as a remote, with virtual joysticks appearing on the screen and point-of-view images from the Neo’s camera. If you’re locked into the idea of a remote, DJI’s RC-N3 Remote Controller (sold separately) will do the trick.</p>
<p>Our favorite potential method of flight control? DJI’s Goggles (either the 3 or the N3) combined with the RC Motion 3 or FPV Remote Controller 3. They’re all sold separately, and you’ll probably want to wait until you totally have the hang of flying the Neo, but the goggles are an incredible and immersive experience where you feel like you’re the one flying. The Neo is also able to transmit video from up to 10 kilometers, so there are virtually no limits on your flight range.</p>
<p>It can be a little unnerving to see the tiny Neo fly out of your sightline, but the Return to Home command can be delivered to the drone via app (or by hand motion if it’s close to you), with failsafe navigation that brings it home safely.</p>
<p>The DJI Neo is an incredible holiday gift option thanks to its virtually limitless possibilities for creating amazing videos, its ease of use, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5864/">its even more accessible than usual price of just $159 during this Amazon pre-Black Friday Deal.&nbsp;</a></p>

              <p>Sonos has earned its reputation as the <strong>premium choice in home audio</strong> through years of engineering excellence and ecosystem refinement. The Beam soundbar (now second generation) is their <strong>most accessible entry point into high-quality soundbar</strong> territory, and it punches well above its weight class.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/">$349, down from $499, this Dolby Atmos soundbar has hit an all-time low price on Amazon</a> for Black Friday. Competing soundbars from Samsung and Bose struggle to match the combination of sound quality, features, and ecosystem integration that Sonos delivers at this price point.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dolby Atmos That Makes a Difference</h2>
<p><strong>Dolby Atmos’ 3D surround sound effect</strong> creates an immersive audio experience that will totally change movie nights. Height channels bounce the sound off your ceiling to create overhead effects during action sequences and atmospheric moments. Helicopters fly over your head, rain falls from above, and explosions surround you from every side. The Beam Gen 2 achieves <strong>this spatial audio through psychoacoustic processing</strong> and some seriously clever speaker placement inside the compact bar.</p>
<p><strong>Crystal clear dialogue reproduction</strong> ensures you never miss the important conversations or plot details. This is ensured by a dedicated center channel that focuses on vocal frequencies carrying speech. Background music and sound effects stay separated from dialogue, avoiding the muddy mix that plagues cheaper soundbars. You can finally stop reaching for the remote to adjust the volume when scenes switch between quiet dialogue and loud action.</p>



<p>The bass performance is well above expectations for such a compact soundbar: The lively low-end adds weight to movie soundtracks and music playback without overwhelming other frequencies. You feel the rumble of engines and the thump of music bass lines. The bass stays tight and controlled rather than boomy or muddy. Many users find the bass output sufficient without adding a separate subwoofer, though Sonos makes it easy to expand later if desired.</p>
<p>The Sonos app is your key to intuitively<strong> controlling all your audio settings and streaming services</strong>. You’ll tweak EQ settings, manage multiple Sonos speakers across your home, and access music from dozens of streaming services. Music streaming works independently when the TV is off, turning your soundbar into a capable music speaker. Radio, podcasts, and audiobooks all play through that superior sound system you’ve already installed for your TV.</p>



<p>Set up is simple, requiring just two cables: <strong>one to your TV via HDMI and one to a power outlet</strong>. A single HDMI ARC or eARC connection for audio input to the soundbar also enables TV remote control pass-through. Control volume and power with your existing TV remote; no programming or separate controls are required. Apple AirPlay 2 support lets you stream directly from iPhones and iPads.</p>
<p>At $349, the Sonos Beam Gen 2 is offering high-end soundbar performance for 30% off retail this Black Friday. None of the competing Samsung or Bose soundbars at this price offer the complete package you’re getting here from Sonos.</p>

<p>Palworld’s Ultrakill crossover finally has a release date, and the update is scheduled to arrive on December 17, 2025. </p>



<p>Pocketpair announced Palworld’s crossover with the fast-paced, ultraviolent retro FPS, Ultrakill, back in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworlds-next-crossover-is-with-ultrakill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 2025</a>; however, at the time, we were only told that players would be able to experience iconic weapons from the FPS. Now, a new trailer reveals all the content the crossover entails, along with a tease for update 1.0.</p>



<h2 id="h-home-sweet-home-update-as-ultrakill-collab-along-with-new-base-customization-options">Home Sweet Home Update as Ultrakill Collab Along with New Base Customization Options</h2>



<p>The new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq8ey7cKfYo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> kicks off with an Ultrakill character showcasing all the latest weapons players can use in Palworld with the upcoming update. A few of these weapons have shots that can change their trajectories mid-travel to hit their targets, and some have explosive capabilities as well. Some weapons also have the ability to deflect some attacks right back at the Pals with the help of coins. The Home Sweet Home update will also add the ability to colour your bases, along with the new customization option. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>That’s not all: towards the end of the trailer, we cut to a black screen, with the music and theme completely changing. For a split second, we see a humongous Pal’s silhouette intimidating the characters in the area before the trailer ends with the words, “Palworld 1.0 -2026”. For those unaware, the release of Palworld 1.0 will mark the game’s exit from early access, and its release window was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-1-0-release-window-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> earlier this year. </p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo’s patent in the Palworld dispute is being reexamined by the USPTO. Additionally, an anti-Palworld patent was recently rejected in Japan.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-suffers-worst-japan-launch-in-20-year-franchise-history.1362724/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It wasn’t beyond the realms of possibility for Black Ops 7 to struggle in 2025. The shooter market is fierce, and the impact of rival franchises seems to have hit Black Ops 7 hard, as it’s recorded the worst Japanese retail launch sales ever in the series.</p>



<p>The poor reception to Modern Warfare 3 didn’t stop Black Ops 6 from bringing the franchise back with a bang. It was a tough task for Black Ops 7 to repeat this success, and early gameplay footage and trailers didn’t do much for the game’s hopes. The realisation hit home hard when it was reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-sales-are-down-50-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 sales were down 50% in Europe</a>.</p>



<p>Japan’s Black Ops 7 sales have hit a new low.</p>







<h2 id="h-lowest-call-of-duty-retail-sales-in-japanese-history-for-black-ops-7">Lowest Call of Duty Retail Sales In Japanese History For Black Ops 7</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time for some soul-searching. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s first week retail launch sales (shown by <a href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@Zuby_Tech</a>) were <strong>12,311</strong>—with the PS4 version reportedly adding to this by allegedly selling under 1,800 copies.</p>







<p>According to a graphic, this is lower than 2007’s Call of Duty 3, which registered 14,117 retail launch units. It doesn’t include the first two Call of Duty titles, but there’s every chance that the result would be the same.</p>



<p>The Japanese market certainly isn’t one of the most popular for Call of Duty games. However, when we’re looking at overall data—factoring in Europe sales again—patterns are emerging across the board. Black Ops 7 isn’t being well-received.</p>



<p>It would be interesting to see how Black Ops 7 would have done without competition, but the fact is that Battlefield 6 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-soared-sales-two-days-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> are both doing exceptionally well with sales and player count numbers. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-player-count-black-ops-7-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 versus Black Ops 7 player count</a> debate was over in one week.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Interest in Call of Duty is currently as low as it’s been for years. Head to the Insider Gaming Discord Server and share your thoughts on whether this is a wake-up call for Activision or not. What does the company need to do for Call of Duty 2026 to rectify the situation?</p>

                <p>Valve will not say what the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-release-date-price-everything-we-know/1100-6536286/" data-ref-id="1100-6536286">Steam Machine</a>'s price is just yet, and in this information vacuum, people are offering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">all kinds of different theories and guesses</a> as to what the six-inch cube-like system may cost. Now, Valve has yet again commented on the pricing question, providing potentially the best clue yet, while also saying the company cannot or will not disclose pricing yet due to "a lot of external things."</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=SskFh89ieBarjGmu&amp;v=yvu66Y2VLq8&amp;feature=youtu.be" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skill Up</a>--which is co-hosted by GameSpot's Lucy James--Valve software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais said people can expect the price of the Steam Machine to be close to what it might cost to build a PC with "basically the same level of performance."</p><p>"I think that if you build a PC from parts and get to basically the same level of performance, that's the general price window that we aim to be at," he said, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-confirms-steam-machine-will-not-be-subsidized-hardware-like-consoles-and-some-are-questioning-that-strategy-while-bracing-themselves-for-a-current-pc-market-price" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by IGN</a>. "Ideally we'd be pretty competitive with that and have a pretty good deal, but we're working on refining that as we speak. Right now is just a hard time to have a really good idea of what the price is going to be because there's a lot of different things… a lot of external things."</p><p>Those "external things" could be elements like tariffs, which have contributed to growing prices for all manner of goods in 2025 since US President Donald Trump controversially rolled them out.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmKrKTwtukE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OmKrKTwtukE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Also in the interview, Griffais confirmed that Valve is not going to take the approach that Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have in the past in terms of selling the system at a loss and making up the difference with game and accessory sales.</p><p>"No. It's more in-line with what you might expect from the current PC market. Obviously, our goal is for it to be a good deal at that level of performance," he said.</p><p>The Steam Machine price will also take into account the system's unique small form factor and the noise level that Valve says it's achieved. "We're excited that people are going to find out how quiet this thing is," he said. The Steam Machine also integrates HDMI and CEC, and allows people to turn their TV on and off straight from the device. Additionally, it makes use of new Bluetooth and wireless connectivity systems that Valve designed. "That's all hard to do," Griffais said.</p><p>"So being able to sit down on your couch, press one button on your controller, and the whole thing lights up like you'd expect for a thing that's in your living room, I think that's really valuable. And there's not really a price point to that because it's not really something that exists in the PC market right now," he explained.</p><p>Another factor to consider is that your time is money, and some people would rather pay a little more for a company like Valve to do the work for them. "For me one of the benefits of Steam Machine is, I'm someone who used to build my PC in college and I am too old and tired to do that now!" designer Lawrence Yang explained.</p><p>Predictions about how much the Steam Machine may cost are all over the place. One expert believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">$400 is the sweet spot</a> for the entry model, while others believe it could be more than $1,000. Others believe it may be priced similarly to the PS5.</p><p>"Tariffs, surging memory / storage costs, supply chain volatility, and an inability to subsidize to the same extent as traditional console manufacturers are all working against Valve at the moment," <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1991311485323063443" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad said</a>. "That being said, the specs suggest Valve wanted this to be in line with PS5 pricing."</p><p>Officially, Valve has only said its goal is for the Steam Machine to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">"affordable" and priced according to the value it offers</a>. This is pretty much what every company says about their products, so these comments don't tell us much of anything.</p><p>The Steam Machine launches in 2026, but preorders are not yet open and the exact launch timing has not been confirmed as of yet. For now, check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-release-date-price-everything-we-know/1100-6536286/" data-ref-id="1100-6536286">everything we know about the Steam Machine.</a></p>

That's what we say here at NL Towers, and Vancouver's brand-new women's hockey team seems to agree. We can't think of another team with a better name than this in <em>any</em> sport right now. Not without a search engine, at least.</p>
<p>However, not only is it a very cool name that's got us wanting all of this team's merch, but they've also gone and got granular with their details, skating out to the Bond theme and even going so far as to use <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/goldeneye_007">GoldenEye's</a> original N64 pause menu music during the intermissions in their debut game, as you can see in the clips below:</p><div><figure data-videoid="11MIkYn3Npk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/11MIkYn3Npk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt11MIkYn3Npk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/11MIkYn3Npk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/11MIkYn3Npk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed39375cmnhpgj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Now that's a slick use of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/from-bon-jovi-to-banjo-grant-kirkhope-on-the-complete-fluke-of-his-rare-musical-journey">Grant Kirkhope</a>'s iconic Goldeneye Watch theme right there!</p>
<p>The Goldeneyes' first game took place in the Vancouver Canucks' old stadium, and it seems the match brought some proper playoff excitement vibes to boot. Let's face it, it's probably all down to the fact it's a stadium full of secret gamers who just got triggered by an excellent needle drop.</p>
<p>The use of this music also removes any doubt whatsoever that the team are actually named after the Goldeneye variety of diving duck rather than the game. Nope, this is just straight-up, good old-fashioned video game nerd stuff. And we love it. Go Goldeneyes!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fire-tv-soundbar-just-hit-a-black-friday-price-only-possible-when-amazon-doesn%E2%80%99t-care-about-margin.1362703/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You can’t really enjoy your favorite TV shows and movies on visuals alone; you need solid sound to match. Unfortunately, most screens don’t come with quality speakers, which can really take away from the overall experience. No one likes having to rewind just to hear dialogues properly or deal with distorted sound at higher volumes.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you don’t have to put up with that. A quick (and affordable) solution to this is to grab yourself a soundbar. Amazon makes some of our favorites out there, and you can now bring one home without paying the full price!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5862/">Thanks to Black Friday, the retailer has dropped the price of its very own Fire TV Soundbar to just $85, after a nice $35 off its retail price.</a> This is the lowest we have seen in 90 days, which means it didn’t even drop this low during the October Prime Day. The offer can be grabbed by both Prime and non-Prime members. But keep in mind, early BF deals tend to wrap up fast. If you’ve been looking for a reliable sound solution to add to your entertainment setup, now is a good time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5862/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three-Dimensional Virtual Surround Sound</h2>
<p>Like most Fire TV soundbars, this too comes in a no-fuss, compact build. There’s nothing too crazy going on with the design; just a bar with a few minimal buttons at the top. It can blend into any setup without bringing too much attention to itself. Place it on your console or mount it on the wall using enclosed mounting rings for a cleaner setup, whichever you prefer.</p>
<p>As for the performance, it offers DTS Virtual:X technology to deliver full, three-dimensional virtual audio that fills the room. Audio won’t just be blasted from where the soundbar is placed, but will come from all directions. Footsteps feel like they’re coming from behind, whispers creep up, and cars race past your couch. Best of all, the output even includes a height dimension for overhead atmospheric effects; exactly what you experience in a cinema.</p>
<p>Then there’s Dolby Audio support that offers richer bass and clearer dialogue for tracks, movies, and games. The soundbar can also be used as a Bluetooth speaker for vibing to your favorite songs or listening to podcasts in the background as you finish house chores. It can connect to your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth within seconds!</p>



<p>Setting things up and getting started is simple. All you need to do is plug in the power cord in the soundbar, and connect the included HDMI cable to your TV’s eARC/ARC port. Hit the power button on your remote to turn the screen on. Your audio output will now instantly switch from the TV speakers to your new soundbar. As simple as that.</p>
<p>The Fire TV Soundbar works well with almost all smart TVs and streaming media players. Those using a Fire TV can use a single remote to control both their devices.</p>
<p>The box comes with the soundbar itself, a remote, an HDMI cable, and a wall mounting kit. That’s everything you need to get started right away.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5862/">To wrap it up, you can now grab this powerful, efficient soundbar for just $85, after a 29% discount.</a> You’re saving $35 on it. We don’t expect the price to drop any further during the main event, so it’s best to grab the deal right now. Looking for more such smart devices? Amazon is offering plenty of its top-rated devices at up to 50% off, so there’s a lot more to browse.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dispatch-adhoc-studios-interview-sales-2-million-humor-2000646848</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-dispatch%E2%80%99s-devs-hope-the-industry-learns-and-doesn%E2%80%99t-learn-from-its-success.1362700/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-review-adhoc-studios-all-8-episodes-finale-2000644106"><i><span>Dispatch</span></i></a><span>, AdHoc Studio’s superhero workplace comedy, is an indisputable hit. The team led by ex-Telltale devs has announced that the episodic adventure game has reached </span><a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1991235043868410096"><span>2 million players</span></a><span> as of this week, and has become a viral sensation for streamers and content creators. The game’s success flies in the face of claims that narrative adventure games have gone out of style. So what does AdHoc hope the industry learns from its success? Conversely, what do they hope developers </span><i><span>don’t</span></i><span> take away from it? These are some of the things we asked when we sat down with co-directors Dennis Lenart and Chris Rebbert.</span></p> <p><span>According to Lenart, the simplest reason for the game’s success is that “people still enjoy good narrative games.” Rebbert expanded upon this by pointing out that simplicity and ease of access have become so rare in games that something refreshingly straightforward like </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>is offering an experience many players want but often have a hard time finding in today’s market.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I play some free-to-play games and stuff like that, but I feel like I get on so many games now, and it’s like I have to download an update every time I get on, and I have to pay for any extra thing,” Rebbert said. “I think when we talk about our favorite games, we always talk about, ‘I just want a linear experience. I don’t want to come jump in and compete.’ And not to say those experiences shouldn’t be available for those who enjoy them, but I feel like a lot of people would like to have experiences like this, where they can just jump in and have a personal singular or linear playthrough or whatever it might be that is uninhibited by microtransactions and stuff like that, you know.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Rebbert also pointed to </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s consistent release schedule, which made each episode a weekly event for fans, in contrast with the old Telltale games or the early </span><i><span>Life Is Strange </span></i><span>games, which launched sporadically over several months. </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s regular cadence allowed AdHoc to own a few weeks of mindshare.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I was talking to Natalie [Herman], our producer, about it yesterday, and it was just like, ‘How often do you have, like, those moments of anticipation anymore, you know?’” he added. “Because most TV shows even get dumped on a streaming platform, and people watch them at their leisure. You don’t have this cultural anticipation in conversation; that was really nice. We were witnessing it more than participating in it. I got increasingly excited to jump on and watch streamers on those days. It was cool to see people get increasingly excited for the next drop. I haven’t seen, culturally, that happen in a long time, and it’s cool that it was successful.”</span></p>

 <p><span>While it all worked out in the end, Lenart says that </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>felt like a gamble throughout its development. He thinks the team’s belief in the project, despite outside insistence that single-player narrative adventures were a dying genre, helped them push through their doubts.</span></p>

 <p><span>“There were several points along the way where things [felt] destined to fall apart for this kind of game coming out in this specific time in this market,” Lenart said. “At every step of the way, I feel like the team pulled together and just made something happen where we didn’t think it was possible to make it happen. So it is definitely a credit to everyone at the studio for continuing to believe in the project, from the early days when it was an idea that we didn’t know if anyone would like, except for us, all the way through the final details and the final push to get out into the world. So it’s, it is really gratifying to me to be able to see the team enjoy the success that the game is having and see the little details that they put in and contributed, called back in memes. It’s just fun.”</span></p>

 <p><span>On the other hand, it’s always possible that something will blow up and some C-suite executive will completely misread why it took off. For </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>, Rebbert and Lenart say they don’t want people to aimlessly try to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-episode-5-best-bar-scene-song-prism-thot-squad-2000645192"><span>emulate the game’s raunchy sense of humor</span></a><span>. Rebbert says that nudity and curse words are not a silver bullet for success if they’re not pulled off with “taste and dramatic weight.” Lenart says that the more irreverent side of </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span> came about later in development, and the original draft was much more reserved and comparable to </span><i><span>The Office </span></i><span>meets </span><i><span>Ted Lasso</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>“In all of the stories that we classically tell as a team of collaborators, the scenes that are the most exciting to us are people sitting around a couch or a table talking,” Lenart said. “All of the visual flair or some things that people might think are gratuitous, all of that is sort of flavoring that gets peppered in the story and the characters where they’re at in the moment. It’s not the thing we start with. I definitely think there are some IP out there that start with ‘How do we get the crazy thing or the insane image? What’s going to be the shock value thing? Then let’s stitch that piece together into the story.’ We’re the exact opposite.”</span></p> <p><span>All eight episodes of </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>are available now on PC and PlayStation 5.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"This is the absolute worst generation."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being revealed at last year's The Game Awards, Naughty Dog's upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> is reportedly still years away from launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of the Uncharted and The Last of Us studio should also not expect another glimpse of the project at next month's annual video games award ceremony, it was claimed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Discussion around when to expect Intergalactic was recently sparked by journalist Colin Moriarty, who suggested he thought it possible the game would launch in 2026. (After various sites picked up the comment as confirmation, Moriarty then <a href="https://x.com/longislandviper/status/1992340284026331442" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued</a> a clarification to say he'd just been "speculating," though by then, the topic had snowballed.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In March this year, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conversation</a> with 28 Years Later director Alex Garland, Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann said the developer still had "a ways to go" on the project. During the same month, Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier stated that the game would not launch in 2026 (and neither would The Witcher 4, either). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This month, Schreier has now <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jason-schreier-on-intergalactic-can-assure-you-that-intergalactic-is-not-coming-out-in-2026.1361842/post-148016161" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repeated</a> this statement — once again placing Intergalactic's arrival as 2027 at the earliest, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-tech-wizard-mark-cerny-teases-new-graphics-features-hes-excited-to-bring-to-a-future-console-in-a-few-years-time-sparks-wave-of-ps6-release-date-speculation-in-the-process">potentially skipping the PS5 generation altogether</a>. Meanwhile, Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3m6ajw5exkk2p" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a> that the game won't be making a second appearance in trailer form at The Game Awards this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is this a surprise? Not really. PlayStation (and Nintendo, and Xbox) have a habit of teasing blockbuster titles a long time before they're ready for most people to play them. And in an interview in May, Druckmann confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-developer-naughty-dog-working-on-a-second-unannounced-game-other-than-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-neil-druckmann-confirms">Naughty Dog was also working on a second game</a> which he said he was acting as "more of a producer" and "mentor" on. Perhaps this game will be announced and launched first?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the reminder that Naughty Dog's big new IP is still years away has come as a disappointment to some. Should Intergalactic launch in 2027, it will have been seven years since the launch of The Last of Us Part 2. During the PlayStation 3 and 4 era, Naughty Dog launched a trilogy of Uncharted games and the first The Last of Us within the same timeframe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Naughty Dog has still launched new products over the past few years, including the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, The Last of Us Part 1 and The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered — but these have been re-releases and remasters. At the same time, it has also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-cancelled-will-focus-on-single-player-games-going-forward">abandoned its long-awaited multiplayer The Last of Us spin-off</a>, which will now no longer see the light of day. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I am all for letting devs cook but this is the absolute worst generation for Naughty Dog," one fan <a href="https://x.com/NeoGameSpark/status/1992617103627804904" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> on social media. "TLOU P2 dropped in 2020 and all we've gotten are barebones remasters, an unnecessary remake, cancelled multiplayer and waiting almost a decade for a new game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Druckmann has spoken confidently that Intergalactic will be worth the wait. Featuring a dark sci-fi story centered around the topics of faith and religion, the project will be led by a star-studded cast that includes Tati Gabrielle from the Uncharted movie as protagonist Jordan A. Mun, and Kumail Nanjiani of Marvel's Eternals as a man called Colin Graves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September this year, in an interview in which Druckmann described development as "firing on all cyclinders," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-naughty-dogs-most-expansive-and-maybe-the-most-expensive-game-the-studio-has-ever-made">the director branded his next project as "the most ambitious game we’ve ever made."</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's the most expansive game we've ever made," he then teased, "[and] maybe the most expensive, by the time we finish it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160752/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Developers Purple Lamp Studios are single-handedly keeping the dream alive for the continuing adventures of everyone's favourite sentient sponge.</p>
<p>2020’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/spongebob_squarepants_battle_for_bikini_bottom_-_rehydrated">Battle for Bikini Bottom: Rehydrated</a> was a fine update to a cult classic and a huge success to boot. The studio followed up with a solid sequel in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/spongebob_squarepants_the_cosmic_shake">The Cosmic Shake</a>, making good on the promise to continue the franchise.</p>
<p>We now have another adventure from that same template with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/spongebob-squarepants-titans-of-the-tide">Titans of the Tide</a>, a familiar adventure that is fun for all ages and preserves the universal appeal of its source material.</p>
<p>The story is about as simple as an average episode of the show. King Neptune and the Flying Dutchman get into a seismic squabble in the Krusty Krab, and the denizens of Bikini Bottom end up caught in the crossfire. Undersea inhabitants are turned into slime-throwing spectres and Squidward has something else to complain about. SpongeBob and Patrick must team up to battle the Dutchman's army of monsters and save the day. How else is Mr Krabs going to turn a profit?</p>

<p>Although this title is not a huge leap from The Cosmic Shake, it is a clear step up from PHL Collective’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/spongebob_squarepants_the_patrick_star_game">The Patrick Star Game</a>. Where that title was more of a kiddy-friendly puzzler, this is an expansive collectathon platformer.</p>
<p>As a proud member of the multi-generational legion of SpongeBob fans, I always look forward to these. The presentation is flawless, Bikini Bottom and its inhabitants are lovingly rendered. Levels are full of NPCs, most of which have a quip to throw your way, and some have genuinely funny dialogue that’s worth discovering. It's fun to explore the levels (with the help of a handy surfboard), finding all the fish people tucked away in every corner.</p>
<p>Titans of the Tide lets you play as both SpongeBob and his dim starfish buddy. Through the magic of a BFF Ring, both characters are with you throughout the game. Each of them has a unique ability set that helps solve platforming and environmental puzzles across the levels.</p>
<figure><a title="SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160749/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You can swap between them with the push of a button, with the non-controlled character floating around as a ghost. This spectral companion acts as an objective guide and lights a path to the next goal within the generously sized environments.</p>
<p>Special abilities are fun to mix and match. SpongeBob utilise his karate experience, while Patrick can burrow underground and grapple with a spectral whip. Levels often encourage using this character-switching mechanic, and it is satisfying to swap between the two for traversal and combat.</p>
<p>Battling the spectral minions of the Flying Dutchman is a bit thin. You get simple melee combos and the occasional light environmental puzzle during boss encounters. Some enemies require the use of a newly discovered ability, although most encounters are little more than punch and move on.</p>

<p>Between quests, you'll head to the Floating Patty, a hub area where you can chat with NPCs and pick up side quests from the likes of Plankton and Sandy. There's a lot of content here, with a broad variety of locations and a ton of side content. Collecting everything doesn't have quite the same challenge as flagship 3D platformers, but what's here could easily fill a giant-sized Krabby Patty.</p>
<p>While not a graphical powerhouse, Titans of the Tide plays like a dream. Quality (30fps) and performance (60fps target) modes are both viable thanks to a motion smoothing slider. I always enjoy the stretchy animations and physics ripped straight out of the cartoon.</p>
<p>Audio is also great, with the cast of the show on hand to provide voice work; this alone will be worth the cost of admission for fans. It's worth noting that barely a second of gameplay goes by without a cheesy quip, dumb Patrick-ism, or signature laugh from Tom Kenny, so mileage may vary on your tolerance for that.</p>

<p>The only real gripe I have with Titans of the Tide is that it doesn't do enough to differentiate itself from the other two titles in Purple Lamp’s series revival. Aside from the ghostly enemies and ability switching mechanic, this game is no different from Battle for Bikini Bottom or Cosmic Shake. Even the in-game store, which contains a generous amount of skins for SpongeBob and Patrick, is basically the same as it was in the previous game. The format is reliable, but three games in and it's starting to creak.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you are a fan of the other games in this cycle of platform adventures, you are going to love Titans of the Tide. It's another colourful, funny SpongeBob adventure from Purple Lamp and, just like the cartoon, repeat viewings don’t tend to lessen the magic. The formula is starting to show its age now, but it's still the best virtual Bikini Bottom we've got.</p></section>

			<p>Xenopurge may be one of the most tense auto-battler strategy games I have played, and that is in no small part to the influences it takes from Aliens. You are a commander on a remote and secure base, but your job is to issue commands to your squad on the ground as they infiltrate Xeno bases to kill aliens, rescue important people, and gather intelligence. Yet, apart from their portraits on the side of the screen, and hearing their voices through the radio, your squad are nothing more than small health bar and a designation number on your screen.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xenopurge -  1.0 Full Release trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_RlQPZgpjE0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Humanity is at war with aliens and you are a member of MACE, the human military machine that is trying to fight back. The information you have is limited even as a Commander, but Xenopurge has a story threading through your encounters with the aliens, making you question what is really going on.</p>


<p>The game is played from a first person perspective as you view multiple screens to set up and manage your run and your squad. Four different squads eventually become available to you, but you will start with the Sentinel Squad which is a classic brute force squad that start with health packs and other boosts that improve speed and attack power. As you make your way through the ranks you eventually unlock the Huntsman, Synthetic, and Bioweave squad types. The Huntsman are more tactical, using turrets and mines to keep the enemy at bay, but they do not start with any health packs. Synthetics are all androids who have no healing ability, so have to be repaired between missions, but they can hack things like doors to stop enemies from getting through them for a time. The Bioweave are the weakest class to start off with, but each kill awards biomass which allows Bioweave units to upgrade themselves to become stronger.</p>


<p>Whichever squad you choose, you will only have limited input on their actions when on missions. Starting commands include prompting them to us a health stim, set up a turret, bioweave to create armour, or hack doors, though these depend on which squad you are using. As you progress through a run you may unlock new commands to use, hopefully selecting the most useful ones that complement your squad. Runs themselves consist of missions and stops at gear or upgrade points, where you can improve melee damage, get new weapons, upgrade soldier logic, or hire another soldier, boosting your squad size up to the maximum of four. Xenopurge is pretty generous with its rewards for successful missions, so you can always get some better gear, but not all of it in one hit.</p>
<p>All of this is viewed on a basic monitor in-game, where little green health bars engage with red health bars. You cannot direct where your squad will go, unless you get the ‘go to room’ command, and have to watch as they make their own decisions on how to proceed unless you give them a specific job to do, like collect a package. This is where some of that tension comes in for Xenopurge. For example, when one squad member is backed into a corner as enemies converge on them there is no way to get your other soldiers to run to their aid unless they are going in that direction themselves. The music really adds to the atmosphere, especially as the countdown gets closer to zero to triggering the next wave. Watching doors open on the screen where you have no line of sight is also tense, because you do not know what kind of enemy is coming for you. And hearing your soldiers shouting for help is another thing that really sells the immersion of being a commander who is helpless at times.</p>
<p>One issue I had with the AI was when ordering soldiers to extract, as they would just try and run past enemies or ignore fights that another soldier was engaged in, unless they get attacked themselves. I would imagine in real life, soldiers would still engage with enemies as they head to extraction points and help fellow squad mates. Another was that when all the rooms have been uncovered and most objectives cleared, units will stay in place even if they can hear another soldier shouting for backup. As I do not have the command to send soldiers to help their comrade, I would have hoped hearing it over the radio would spur them into action.</p>

<p>Despite those annoyances, Xenopurge has hooked me. There are a lot of run variations you can take on, with an achievement for completing each one, and squads can be altered with variants that give unique soldiers, such as one named Ripley who has a motion scanner. There are different zones across Xenopurge to explore with the later zones providing a much more difficult challenge due to being deep in Xeno space. Outside of the monitor, your commander can leave their seat and explore the cabin to read emails and watch news reports to learn of what is really happening. Here, the development team leave clues that something isn’t right and as you explore your little cabin and eventually what is beyond the door you too question the realities of the war.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Nearly a month after the release of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, former Creative Director and The Chinese Room Studio Head Dan Pinchbeck opened up on the game's development phase <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWDyNLAo1E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a video interview with YouTuber Cat Burton</a>. </p>



<p>The most interesting tidbit is that Pinchbeck really didn't want to call this game Bloodlines 2. As you might recall, The Chinese Room only came in to rescue the game from cancellation after publisher Paradox Interactive split with the original developer of the sequel, Hardsuit Labs. That also meant they didn't have enough time or money to make it the true sequel fans of the original might have wanted. Apparently, it was Pinchbeck who decided to make it a more focused, Dishonored-like game, due to the constraints the developers were forced to work with.</p>



<p><em>We used to sit there and go and have these planning sessions of how do we get them to not call it Bloodlines 2. That feels like the most important thing we do here, is to come at this and say this isn't Bloodlines 2. You can't make Bloodlines 2. There's not enough time. There's not enough money. Bloodlines 1 came out at a really interesting period in game development, when you could ship a really ambitious game that was full of bugs and holes, was totally flawed, but the ambition was really exciting. A lot of those games, they're real cult games now, but they really weren't very good when you actually broke them apart and analyzed them. Great ideas, wonderful ideas, players loved them. You couldn't get away with it now.</em></p>



<p><em>So, trying to recreate that magic in a different environment felt wrongheaded. No one would be happy. You wouldn't make people who love Bloodlines 1 happy and you wouldn't make people who didn't know about Bloodlines 1 happy, because they'd never get Bloodlines 2 and they'd always get a flawed game that was built too fast and with not enough money.</em></p>



<p><em>So we approached it from that point of view of, well, what can we do with the time and the money that's available, and at that point, I came in and went, 'we can't make Bloodlines 2, we can't make Skyrim, but we can make Dishonored.' We would look at something which is not an RPG and is not fully open world, but is really tightly focused and true to the mythos, and it's a good ride, we get a Bloodlines title out in the world, and then we'd started talking about saying, then what would the next big Bloodlines game look like after that, if that happened?</em></p>



<p>It's a sound strategy, in theory. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the game is going to sell enough to warrant a bigger, better sequel. According to estimates based on SteamDB data, only between 120K and 300K copies of the game have been sold so far via PC's most popular store. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-greatly-uneven-but-still-worth-a-look/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In my review of the game</a>, I concluded that Bloodlines 2 is worth playing despite its flaws, but only for fans of the setting and once the game is significantly cheaper than the launch price. However, that might happen very soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft’s most popular console has officially gone retro. Let’s remember what made it great.</p> <p>The Xbox 360 came out a year earlier than the competition and $100 cheaper than the base PlayStation 3. It seemed to make all the right moves, using <em>Halo</em>, <em>Gears of War</em>, and <em>Call of Duty</em> to jump start online multiplayer into the soon-to-be dominant form of gaming, while investing it all back into indie curation, big exclusives, and marketing deal that made the console feel like the place everyone had to be.</p> <p><em>This article was originally published on Jul 30, 2024. We’re re-posting it today in honor of the Xbox 360’s 20th anniversary.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>In some ways it felt like the best of all worlds, and by the end of the generation you could pick up an Xbox 360 for just $100 and play dozens of the best games ever made. The culture was far from healthy, and some of the places making everything were a mess to work for. But it was also a fun time, and a weird one. Here’s what we’ll miss about it and why the Xbox 360 still feels so special to us.</p>

 <hr> <p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-remember-some-xbox-360-games-1826905842">Let’s remember some Xbox 360s</a>! What’s your Xbox 360 origin story Carolyn?</p> <p><strong>Carolyn Petit:</strong> The first E3 I ever attended was in 2005, with the Xbox 360’s launch still some months out and I have to say, the games I saw on the show floor looked amazing. It’s hilarious to me now considering I haven’t even thought about this game in probably 15 years, but at that time, the game that blew me away the most was probably <em>GRAW</em>. Interestingly, though, despite my initial excitement about the console being rooted in its graphical power and my lust for next-gen spectacle, now, when I think back on what made the console so special to me, it’s not really about that aspect of it at all. What about you Alyssa?</p>

 <p><strong>Alyssa Mercante:</strong> I’ve told mine on<em> Kotaku</em> more than once, but I had borrowed my high school sweetheart’s original Xbox to play <em>Halo 2</em> when he went away to college, but not long after that <em>Halo 3</em> came out, which wasn’t backwards compatible. So I went out during my free period in high school (we had an open campus for seniors, you could take your car and leave if you didn’t have class), and drove to a Target where I spent my summer job savings on a 360, <em>Halo 3</em>, and Xbox Live.</p>

 <p><strong>Ethan:</strong> I have zero recollection of the Xbox 360’s launch. What was I even doing at the time? 2005. Hmm. I was going into my senior year in high school, barely playing anything except for the occasional late-stage PS2 game—<em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> and <em>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai</em>, followed eventually by <em>Okami </em>and <em>Final Fantasy XII</em>. My only real memory of the beginning of that console cycle is my brother getting a PS3 and me having almost no interest in it. It wasn’t until my girlfriend’s roommate’s boyfriend in college got me hooked on <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em> that I finally picked up a super cheap used Xbox 360 arcade edition for like $150. That four years after the console launched but still somehow only the mid-way point.</p>

  <p><strong>Carolyn:</strong> Yeah, I don’t remember exactly when I finally got one myself—I certainly couldn’t afford one at launch, and my memories of the time around release have a lot to do with playing Peter Jackson’s King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie (lol) at GameStop kiosks.</p>

 <p><strong>Moises Taveras: </strong>The first time I ever played an Xbox 360 also had to do with <em>Call of Duty: MW2</em>. It was all the rage with the kids in my middle school, but I was largely looking from the outside in as a) a PlayStation kid since my youth and b) someone who came from a family too poor to afford more than one console. But eventually, I made friends who had 360s and I remember us all cramming onto a couch in the smallest bedroom imaginable at our friend Howard’s house and playing local multiplayer matches till we lost our voices from shouting. I learned really quickly then that the 360 was synonymous with multiplayer and socializing with folks and it made me want one so bad. Little did I know I wouldn’t get a 360 till the very end of the console generation!</p>

 <p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>I think part of the Xbox 360’s dominance in that era can be attributed to the fact that it offered the best online experience for folks wanting to play <em>Call of Duty</em>, but it also did something incredible that totally won over people like me. I’m not saying I didn’t have an amazing time playing Gears of War co-op, I absolutely did, and huge credit to Microsoft for putting out a steady stream of banger exclusives that really made Xbox Live feel essential. But for me, when I think about the Xbox 360, what still gets me excited most is Xbox Live Arcade, and particularly amazing games like <em>Pac-Man Championship Edition</em>. Games like this took the arcade leaderboard competition of my childhood and absolutely exploded it. Suddenly I was staying up nights pouring everything I had into beating my friends’ high scores on online leaderboards for all the world to see. Man, it was incredible.</p> <p><strong>Moises:</strong> Supergiant Games’ Bastion absolutely blew my mind as far as what I thought games could be. It being a console exclusive to the 360 through XBLA broke my heart and kept me from the portfolio of what’d become my favorite studio, and then Xbox just kept pumping out indie titles like it. Honestly, my working definition of an indie game was largely informed by this era of XBLA games.</p>  <p><strong>Kenneth Shepard:</strong> The Xbox 360 was the first console launch I was really tuned into the industry for. I was full-blown sicko mode for that thing as a kid, and was counting down the days. I was a huge Rare fan at the time and Kameo and Perfect Dark Zero were a huge deal to me. But broadly, I think I fell off video games for a bit because the system just didn’t speak to my tendencies. As Moises said, the 360 became the multiplayer system and I preferred gaming in solitude, and eventually pivoted to the PS3 in the final years of that generation. But I played the <em>Mass Effect</em> trilogy on the 360, so I ended up keeping an old 360 in my home longer than any other system. I had to replace the household 360 more times than probably any other system my family owned.</p>

 <p>We got a launch window system that died by the time <em>Halo 3 </em>came out, so we had to replace it swiftly. Then I got my own 360 for Christmas 2009, just before the launch of <em>Mass Effect 2</em>. That sucker lasted over a decade. It gathered dust for large swaths of the time, but since I didn’t own an Xbox One, it was the only way for me to go back to my old <em>Mass Effect </em>trilogy saves until the Legendary Edition came out in 2021. So while I had mostly abandoned the system by the end of the generation, the 360 is still a defining system in my life because it gave me one of the most important video game experiences of my life. I’ll always be grateful for it, even if I think the Microsoft was a trailblazer for some of the industry’s worst modern tendencies with it.</p> <p><strong>Ethan: </strong>That was the other thing that I think tipped me in the direction of the Xbox 360 besides the price and walled multiplayer gardens. As someone coming from the PS1 and PS2, it just had more of the RPGs I was craving earlier or in better condition. I came to the original Mass Effect late but it blew my mind. I got to catch up on Star Wars: The Old Republic. It was synonymous with retro and couch-coop indie games for me like Castle Crashers and Super Meat Boy. It really did just nail a lot of the same things that the PS4 did a generation later and which ultimately helped Sony to reverse the tide.</p>

 <p><strong>Moises: </strong>it’s so weird to think about now given Xbox’s current situation and catalog, but the 360 was where all the games were!</p> <p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>Another thing that was a big factor for me, I have to admit, is that I was totally cheevo-pilled. The Xbox 360 brought about the advent of achievements and I got extremely excited about pulling off absurd things like beating Call of Duty campaigns on Veteran to get all the achievements. I no longer put much stock in achievements or trophies, but to this day I greatly prefer the at-a-glance number that reflects your achievements compared to all the trophies of PlayStation’s system. And on top of that, the whole interface on Xbox just felt so much more inviting to me than that on Sony. I think avatars were really smart of them to introduce in that era. I loved signing on and seeing little cartoon versions of all my good friends online, playing games of their own. In comparison to that, the whole interface of the PS3 just felt cold and impersonal to me, and that console would end up gathering dust in my entertainment center.</p> <p><strong>Ethan: </strong>The Xbox 360 home screen definitely felt a lot more inviting and hit that sweet spot of clutter to chill. The controller was also very solid. Have any of you gone back and tried to hold a PS3 DualShock? It feels like you’re being pranked. I take it none of you ever had an issue with red-ringing or other hardware failures?</p>

  <p><strong>Moises:</strong> Nope! Correct me if I’m wrong but those issues got ironed out with later iterations of the console, so by the time one of my best friends let me indefinitely borrow his 360, it was smooth sailing for me.</p> <p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>I did have to send mine back for repairs once, and for a while there at least, it felt like everyone I knew who owned one was hitting the red ring. There was a period there, at least in my circle of friends, where there was real disbelief and anger that Microsoft had sold us all a product that was so prone to failure. I think it speaks to just how fond people were overall of the console—its library, its interface, its online features—that today, when you bring it up, you’re far more likely to get fond recollections than bitter complaints. It was so good that even the considerable irritations so many of us experienced with it are now just a footnote in our memories.</p> <p><strong>Ethan: </strong>My console ended up red-ringing in like, 2012? But then I read that you can just put it in the oven and bake it at a low temperature to loosen up the glue. Has worked like a charm ever since.</p> <p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>Wow, I never knew that!</p> <p><strong>Ethan:</strong> I think one of the reasons people look back so fondly on the Xbox 360 is that, in retrospect, it felt like the last time you could contain the entirety of what was going on, coming out, and being talked about in your head at any given time. It was still very intimate and physical, with midnight launches and stacks of controllers in the split-screen coop session. There was spectacle with E3 but also the feeling you alone were discovering these incredible hidden treasures on Xbox Live Arcade, which was like a return to finding the internet for the first time again.</p>

 <p><strong>Carolyn:</strong> I agree. And they just had so many games that became sensations for a time, from <em>Braid</em> to <em>Geometry Wars</em>. The curation was exceptional, and it was an era in which it still felt like the whole culture, or much of it at least, could still come together for a few weeks around some exciting new downloadable game.</p> <p><strong>Moises: </strong>Yeah. By comparison, when the PS4 really started to pivot to those smaller more intimate games early in its lifetime, it wasn’t that those games were lesser, but it did feel like they were being more haphazardly thrown on the platform to fill gaps between big exclusives. Meanwhile XBLA had these clearly thought out rollouts and events that made a big deal of Arcade titles. Also everything was less shitty. Xbox Live Gold was the original multiplayer subscription, and the only one for quite some time, but it at least seemed to provide value with great deals and a platform that produced rock solid multiplayer hits. It also wasn’t as expensive as anything is nowadays.</p>

  <p><strong>Carolyn:</strong> Before we wrap things up here, I think we can’t talk about what an amazing console the 360 was without saying a little more about its games. Are there any games y’all want to shout out as particular favorites that really helped make that library great or were emblematic of what the console was doing? When I think about the 360, I think about how the grittiness of <em>Gears of War</em> coexisted harmoniously alongside the whimsy of <em>Viva Pinata</em>, and I’ll never forget the dozens of hours my friends and I spent driving around doing challenges together in <em>Burnout Paradise</em>. It really did feel, more than a lot of other consoles, like it offered something for everyone, and like the people behind it thought deeply about how to bring people together to share in the experiences it offered.</p> <p>And even though some of its games were also on PlayStation, at least everyone in my friend group, won over by the cheevos and online features of Xbox, always bought multiplatform games there, which perpetuated the console’s dominance in that generation. It’s a little wild to think how this generation it feels somewhat the opposite for me, like most people I know play most multiplatform games on PlayStation. Wild how the tables have turned. But yeah, any other 360 shoutouts?</p>

 <p><strong>Moises: </strong>I cannot separate the 360 from the stunning role it did in promoting so many smaller studios to the mainstream. I already invoked Bastion from Supergiant Games, but I can’t not shoutout Limbo and Playdead, which has now delivered two absolutely singular game experiences in a row. Oh and Shadow Complex does still own.</p> <p><strong>Ethan: </strong><em>Limbo </em>was incredible. While the indie darling backlash was fair and warranted, it was really an incredible run of curation there for several years. <em>The Dishwasher</em> games were great, and really spoke to that sense of Newgrounds 2.0 animating the grungy vibe of XBLA. It’s also wild how much Microsoft tried to court Japanese RPG fans with<em> Blue Dragon</em> and<em> Lost Odyssey</em>. For me personally, <em>Dungeon Defenders</em> is still an all-time great. One of the last times I was able to rope friends into playing something for hours with me on a couch.</p> <p>I was trying to think of my top five favorite 360 games, exclusive or no, and couldn’t stop listing stuff. The end of that console generation was so strong, on both 360 and PS3, maybe there’s hope that the Series X/S and PS5 pick up in their final years. But with massive budgets, long development times, and so much risk-averse consolidation, I’m not hopeful.</p> <p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>Whether it picks up to some degree or not, I think it’s safe to say that there will never be an era quite like that exemplified by the 360 again. The console was just perfectly poised to take advantage of a given moment in gaming culture and technology, employing exciting new ideas like achievements to build a sense of both community and friendly competition around games in ways that its library and online service leveraged brilliantly. Also, Sneak King was great.</p> <p><strong>Ethan:</strong> Any parting thoughts since you vanished, Alyssa?</p> <p><strong>Alyssa:</strong> LMAO. The time my 360 red ringed right before I went up for senior year of college. The day before. And I went out and bought another because not having one wasn’t an option. That or the time my mother heard me cursing out misogynists in Italian?</p> <p><strong>Ethan:</strong> Was it on the $3 phone bank operator Xbox 360 headset?</p> <p><strong>Alyssa:</strong> Beninteso!</p>

              <p>The Meta Quest 3S is literally the best value proposition in VR headsets at the moment. It’s an entry-level model capable of delivering performance very close to the premium Quest 3 which sells for $599. For the vast majority of buyers, this will be the smart choice.</p>
<p>Now the 128GB version has dropped to an <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/">all-time record-low price on Amazon for Black Friday at $249, down from $299</a>. The numbers say a lot about demand: over <strong>30,000 units sold in just a few days</strong>. This is the best-selling VR headset in its category right now and the popularity speaks well of the exceptional performance-to-price ratio that Meta managed to achieve with this model.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Wireless Freedom</h2>
<p>The <strong>completely wireless design eliminates the cables and external sensors</strong> that plagued earlier VR generations. You move naturally through virtual spaces without tripping over cords or worrying about connection points. Room-scale VR experiences feel liberating once you can spin, duck, and explore without physical tethers. Inside-out tracking uses built-in cameras rather than requiring external base stations. Set up takes minutes instead of hours, and you can play anywhere with enough clear space.</p>
<p>The Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor brings <strong>double the graphical processing power of the previous Quests</strong>. Games load faster, graphics render with more detail, and frame rates stay smooth during intense action. This leap in processing power enables the creation of more complex virtual environments with better lighting, textures, and physics simulation. Developers can be more ambitious when constructing an experience because they know the hardware can sustain it.</p>



<p>The 8GB of RAM represents a 33% memory increase that directly impacts performance: The more RAM, the more the headset can juggle several background processes without bogging down active gameplay. Apps switch faster, menus load quicker, and the overall experience just feels more responsive. Games can load larger levels and handle more simultaneous objects without stuttering.</p>
<p>Dual RGB color cameras power a full-color Passthrough feature that will seamlessly blend the real and virtual worlds together. You can see your actual room in color while interacting with virtual objects overlaid in your space.<strong> Mixed reality apps let you place digital furniture in your home</strong> to preview before buying. Fitness apps show you your real environment while adding virtual trainers and UI elements. The quality of Passthrough is on par with what you’d see when looking through a pair of sunglasses, making it very practical for extended use.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life exceeds two hours on a single charge</strong> and covers most gaming sessions quite comfortably. Improved power management also extends playtime compared to earlier Quest models. Quick charging gets you back into action a lot faster once the battery runs low. External battery packs that are compatible with USB-C can extend sessions indefinitely, if needed.</p>
<p><strong>Instant access to 40+ games as part of the 3-month tria</strong>l removes any barrier to software purchases out of the gate. Popular titles from a multitude of genres give you plenty to explore while you discover what VR experiences you enjoy most. The ever-growing games catalog adds new releases monthly, so fresh content will surface regularly.</p>
<p>The exclusive<strong> Gorilla Tag bundle adds a selection of in-game items and currency</strong> that fans of the popular multiplayer game will appreciate. This social VR title has gained phenomenal traction, and the exclusive content sweetens things for existing fans or curious newbies alike. The 1000 shiny rocks provide immediate in-game purchasing power.</p>
<p>At $249, the Meta Quest 3S 128GB is offering flagship VR performance at an entry-level price this Black Friday. This headset sits just $50 above the old Quest 2 while offering dramatically better specs that approach the $599 Quest 3.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Every new update on Stellar Blade seems to suggest that the game has defied all expectations. Now, it’s understood that Stellar Blade has beaten out Ghost of Tsushima, God of War, Marvel’s Spider-Man, and others to be the best-selling PlayStation exclusive on PC.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade news has been coming thick and fast recently. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sequel-in-development-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sequel-in-development-now/">Stellar Blade sequel is confirmed to be in development</a>, and the bombshell was dropped that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-multiplatform-shift-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar Blade is going multiplatform</a>. The original game was a success on launch and continues to escalate in terms of popularity and sales.</p>



<p>Shift Up has revealed a new graphic showing this to be the case.</p>







<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-destroys-other-playstation-exclusives-on-pc">Stellar Blade Destroys Other PlayStation Exclusives On PC</h2>

<p>Stellar Blade developer Shift Up showed off an impressive chart showing the biggest PlayStation-exclusive games that have received a PC port.</p>



<p>The graphic (shown by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Genki</a>) shows the top six games for sales on PC. The data shows Stellar Blade hit a peak of 192,000 concurrent players on Steam at launch, with the next best being 77,000 players for Ghost of Tsushima.</p>







<p>The headline sentence also says: “Best-selling PlayStation-exclusive launch IP in history.”</p>



<p>Based on the numbers, this isn’t just the case; it’s conclusive. We reported a couple of weeks ago that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shuhei-yoshida-absolutely-wanted-stellar-blade-on-playstation-after-playing-it/">Shuhei Yoshida ‘Absolutely Wanted’ Stellar Blade on PlayStation after playing it</a>. PC players eventually got a chance to experience it—which was clearly snapped up!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-launch-post-apocalyptic-mmo-december/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>GFA Games has announced that PIONER, an ambitious post-apocalyptic MMO, will launch in early access on December 16, 2025. This date comes mere weeks after a successful beta test, which saw the game skyrocket to over 500,000 wishlists on Steam. The PC-exclusive MMO has been described as a perfect balance between the likes of Fallout, STALKER, and Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>PIONER features a massive open-world environment, stacks of customization options, and an immersive atmosphere that encourages players to prioritize exploration and development over anything else.</p>



<h2 id="h-pioner-hits-early-access-soon">PIONER Hits Early Access Soon</h2>



<p>PIONER, which has been compiled by GFA Games, a studio headquartered in Serbia, is set to be released <strong>in early access </strong>on December 16. This news dropped today, along with a new trailer, which you can see below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="PIONER - Together" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ZDY7I4VS70?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The team at GFA Games also revealed the Deluxe Edition of PIONER, which comes with stacks of digital content:</p>



<ul>
<li>Unique Skin: “Renegade” – a unique, exclusive armor and gear design</li>



<li>Weapon Skin with VFX – a unique weapon skin for the entire AR platform, including AR-12,<br>AR-16, and AR-16 Ifrit</li>



<li>Exclusive Founder Title – a status symbol for social interaction</li>



<li>Premium Currency – 500 Efritanium Crystals</li>



<li>Weapon Accessory: “Creepy Charm” – cosmetic trinket for a weapon</li>



<li>Gadget: “Katana” Watch – inspired by the iconic 80s Japanese watch design; a retro-futuristic style that fits the world of PIONER</li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s blurb reveals how much potential this game has:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>PIONER takes players to a vast, atmospheric post-apocalyptic island, where remnants of the Soviet era create an incredible alternate reality. The game emphasizes realism over traditional mechanics, offering an open world of over 50 km2 filled with hidden dungeons, story quests, and faction missions that influence alliances and rewards. As a social-focused MMO, PIONER combines story-driven exploration with intense PvE and PvP gameplay. Players shape the world through their actions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>PIONER has an expansive campaign that eases players in with a great tutorial section, and it has grown over several years of development to become something that could stun in early access.</p>

            <p>Valve has addressed the pricing for its recently announced hybrid PC, the Steam Machine.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Valve revealed its new gaming hardware, including the Steam Machine, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-steam-machine-preview-a-powerful-customisable-mini-pc-for-couch-gaming">console/PC hybrid which will be able to run PC games on a television or as a normal gaming computer</a>. But, while we have seen what the gear looks like, Valve refrained from offering any guidance on its pricing.</p>
<p>Valve's Lawrence Yang and Pierre-Loup Griffais have now addressed this question. Neither have disclosed an exact figure, but they have said the Steam Machine will be "more in line with what you might expect from [the] current PC market".</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The Valve duo were guests on the Friends Per Second podcast when the topic came up. "I think that if you build a PC from parts, and get to the same level of performance, that's the general price window we aim to be at, " Griffais said.</p>
<p>"Ideally, we would be pretty competitive with that, and have a pretty good deal," he continued, adding Valve was "working on refining" the pricing.</p>
<p>When further asked if the Steam Machine was "going to be a subsidised device", the Valve developer said its "more in line with what you might expect from [the] current PC market", again saying the team wants to ensure it is a good deal for consumers in relation to its performance. "You know, you have features which are actually really hard to build if you are making your own gaming PC from parts," Griffais further explained. "Obviously the small form factor and I think the noise level that we achieved (or lack thereof) is really impressive. We're excited that people are going to find out how quiet this thing is.</p><p>"But also, some integration features like HDMI CC, being able to turn on your TV, turn off your TV… that's all hard to do, but more importantly you can turn on the machine from your controller, which is not something that's straightforward depending on the kind of PC you have… so, being able to sit down on your couch, press one button on your controller and the whole thing lights up like you would expect for a thing that's in your living room, I think that's very valuable.</p>
<p>"There's not really a price point to that, because it's not something that exists in the PC market right now."</p>
<p>Closing, Griffais said there will be those among us who are perfectly happy to build a PC from scratch themselves. However, Valve's Steam Machine will be a "nice baseline offering", letting users access "some features which are really hard to get to otherwise".</p>
<p>In the same conversation, Griffais added Valve may be open to develop a 'Steam Machine Pro' down the line, but "for now" it is staying focused on the Steam Machine's current level of spec, as it offers "a good trade-off between affordability and the level of power" it provides.</p>

<p>Valve's new Steam hardware will be released next year, though release dates are currently unknown. If you're hoping to get your hands on it all, know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-it-be-easy-to-buy-a-steam-machine-valve-confirms-its-continually-improving-how-it-distributes-hardware-ahead-of-the-release-of-its-new-hardware-launches">Valve will continue to self-distribute hardware just as it did with the Steam Deck</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile earlier this month, head of market analysis at video game industry analysis company Alinea Analytics Rhyss Elliott told our Connor that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/400-with-a-controller-this-would-really-send-a-message-one-analyst-on-how-valves-steam-machine-could-make-the-biggest-impact-on-the-games-industry">price point will be a real indicator of how the Steam Machine is perceived in the market</a>. "If the Steam Machine launches above $500, it risks being perceived as an expensive niche PC (like the rumoured next-generation Xbox) rather than an accessible living-room gaming option," Elliott said.</p>
<p>"The sweet spot would be $400 with a controller. This would really send a message, as console manufacturers have been raising their prices."</p>

<p>At present, the game is only available in English, with no in-game language options. Yet while some players have criticised the game for this as it's virtually unplayable for non-English speakers, its developer has no plans for localisation.</p>
<p>Blue Prince developer Tonda Ros told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/blue-prince-goty-localization-sequel/">Polygon</a> there are "certainly no concrete plans because it is largely considered near impossible".</p>

<p>The reason for that is because so many of the game's puzzles rely on wordplay, which cannot be easily translated.</p>
<p>That's not to say it isn't necessarily doable, mind you, but that it would take far too long to achieve.</p>
<p>"It's a tough decision to let Blue Prince be discoverable by more people, but potentially risk burning out myself and/or giving up making a whole other game," said Ros.</p>
<p>That sort of work would equate to "creating a second game," he added. Yet a direct sequel isn't planned either, though a follow-up of sorts could still happen.</p>
<p>"I want all my projects to be able to stand up on their own and be unique things," said Ros. "That's just the type of sequels that I like. I like Myst followed by Riven, not Myst 2."</p>
<p>As such, there "will not be a direct sequel to Blue Prince," added Ros. "There might be a game set in that universe, but I can't even say it likely will be in the same genre."</p>
<p>At the very least, though, "it would take as many risks as Blue Prince took."</p>
<p>"More than anything, Blue Prince seems aware of the time you're spending within it, and that's pure magic to me," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blue-prince-review">Eurogamer review of Blue Prince</a>.</p>
<p>"The richest aspect of the game's extremely rich design may be how many secrets it springs once you’ve lived with it for a while. It's the pleasure of finding hidden aspects to things you thought you understood in full, the pleasure of coming back to something you thought was simple and finding that it's not simple at all."</p>

			<p>Although it has provided some inspiration to The Witcher IV developer CD Projekt Red, future games from the studio won't be anything like Larian Studios' Baldur's Gate 3.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/baldurs-gate-3-is-an-inspiration-for-cd-projekt-but-its-all-in-on-big-open-worlds-we-are-definitely-not-going-to-make-a-game-like-larian-did/">PC Gamer</a>, CD Projekt's joint CEO Michał Nowakowski confirmed that Baldur's Gate 3 provided the developer a lot of inspiration, but they will still stick to the open-world setting seen in games like The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. Obviously, CD Projekt Red isn't going to simply create similar games with better graphics, as Nowakowski highlighted that the studio wants to <em>"innovate."</em></p>



<p>Although the CD Projekt's joint CEO did not elaborate on how they plan to innovate their open-world formula in games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">The Witcher IV</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-new-chicago-city/">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a>, it seems that world interactivity will be enhanced over older games.</p>



<p><em>"That's the kind of game they can make,"</em> Michał Nowakowski said about Larian Studios' games like the Divinity: Original Sin series and Baldur's Gate 3. <em>"But a lot of stuff with how they can interact with the world and what it does was, for sure, some inspiration to us."</em></p>



<p>Much of Baldur's Gate 3's success resides, in my opinion, exactly in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/">how the world feels incredibly dynamic and reactive</a>, so it's great to hear that The Witcher IV may take the best of Larian Studio's approach for the third entry in the beloved series and apply it to its open-world formula to improve the experience. As good as The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 are, their open worlds adhere to traditional by-the-books design without shaking them up significantly, so I am very interested to see how much this influence will shape their sequels.</p>



<p>One thing The Witcher IV is not going to feature for certain is new contributions from Andrzej Sapkowski, author of the novels upon which the CDPR series is based. According to the author, <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-have-any-new-contribution-from-andrzej-sapkowski/">the developer rarely asks him for details nowadays</a>, but their relationship remains healthy after <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-solidifies-relationship-with-andrzej-sapkowski-creator-of-witcher/">the signing of a new deal in December 2019.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-drops-airpods-pro-3-to-a-record-low-for-the-first-time-margin-clearly-isn%E2%80%99t-a-priority-this-black-friday.1362634/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When Apple drops a new tech device to replace a top-rated favorite — say, the AirPods Pro 2 — the first questions are always “how much better can the new one be?” and “do I really need to upgrade?” In the case of the AirPods Pro 3, the answers are “a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>” and “yes, absolutely.” The AirPods Pro 3 aren’t just Apple’s best active noise-cancelling in-ear buds, they’re the best ones made by anyone, anywhere, at any time. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">They’re also on sale for the very first time at Amazon for Black Friday, with an all-time low price of $220.</a></p>
<p>There’s definitely nothing wrong with the AirPods Pro 2. They’re still among the very best wireless earbuds on the market (and almost certainly the subject of some epic Black Friday deals of their own, especially now that the Pro 3s have arrived). But the Pro 3s are on a whole new level, from their sound and noise cancellation to their redesigned feel — more contoured, shorter stems, and a better overall fit. As much as we love the Pro 2s and didn’t think we’d be recommending an upgrade this soon, here we are.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Turns Phenomenal</h2>
<p>As long as the list of serious perks is for the AirPods Pro 3, we have to start with the active noise cancellation. It takes the formidable ANC of the Pro 2s and doubles it, creating the world’s best in-ear active noise cancellation. And now with as much of the outside world blocked out as you want, you can immerse yourself in the upgraded sound of the Pro 3s. Apple’s added a new acoustic architecture that really brings out the bass, but also the mids, vocals, and every facet of the music.</p>
<p>It’s also an improved Spatial Audio sound, which will have you turning your head to move the sound source over and over until you get used to just how realistic the effect is. And you can move your head or any other part of your body as much as you like with the AirPods Pro 3, because in addition to the more contoured design, they also come with five sets of ear tips to ensure a more secure fit. The AirPods were already great workout buds, but the better fit and the new heart-rate-sensing feature that links to the Move ring and step count on your iPhone, and also the Apple Intelligence-powered Workout Buddy feature.</p>



<h2>All-Day Listening</h2>
<p>Active Noise Cancellation is a notoriously greedy feature when it comes to battery life, but the AirPods Pro 3 give you 8 full hours of ANC listening time on a single charge, and 10 hours in Transparency mode, even if you engage the Hearing Aid feature that’s been carried over and enhanced from the AirPods Pro 2. The Hearing Aid feature now has automatic Conversation Boost and active Hearing Protection to safeguard your ears when the environment around you gets overly loud. (Think live sporting events or construction zones.)</p>
<p>If putting the brand-new AirPods Pro 3 on sale is Apple’s opening move for Black Friday and Cyber Week, it’s a sign of a truly epic holiday shopping season to come. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">This Amazon deal for $220 is the lowest price yet on the AirPods Pro 3, and they’re a worthy upgrade even from their famously great predecessors.</a></p>

              <p><em>Command &amp; Conquer</em>‘s legendary Lord Yuri, Udo Kier, has died aged 81. The news of the death of the well-loved German actor on Sunday morning was <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/udo-kier-dead-own-private-idaho-andy-warhol-frankenstein-1236590259/">shared by his partner</a> Delbert McBride, followed by an impassioned online tribute from Hideo Kojima.</p> <p>For games players, Kier is most immediately identifiable as Lord Yuri, in what’s widely considered to be one of the best&nbsp;<em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> games,&nbsp;<em>Red Alert 2</em>. Leader of the Soviet Psychic Corps, Yuri was the antagonist of the game, and the star of the esteemed expansion pack,&nbsp;<em>Yuri’s Revenge</em>. The <em>C&amp;C</em> games were famous for their use of FMV and real-world actors, making Kier a very familiar face to a generation of strategy gamers.</p>

 <p>Over his career, Kier appeared in over 220 films, working with legends like Lars von Trier, Werner Herzog, Gus Van Saint and Alexander Payne, and most recently was due to star in Hideo Kojima’s mysterious next game,&nbsp;<em>OD</em>. In the game, co-written with Jordan Peele, Kier was due to play one of the lead roles, alongside Sophia Lillis and Hunter Schafer. Kojima reacted to the news of Kier’s death this morning on X, calling the actor an “icon of his time.”</p>

 <p>According to Kojima’s post,&nbsp;<em>OD</em>‘s filming (the game, like so many of the creator’s, was due to use motion capture and astonishingly photorealistic faces for its characters) was delayed until 2026 by the recent voice actors strike, meaning none of Kier’s scenes have been shot. Kojima stated that despite this, the two had stayed in close contact, emailing one another and meeting up as recently as September. “He told me how much he was looking forward to the shoot starting up again next year,” said the video game director.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m at a loss for words. It all happened far too suddenly.<br>Because of the strike, we weren’t able to shoot “OD” for a long time, and we were forced to reschedule to next year. Even during that time, Udo and I exchanged emails frequently. We stayed in close contact. When we met in… <a href="https://t.co/aRpP1i38CE">pic.twitter.com/aRpP1i38CE</a></p> <p>— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1992785286712209409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Still a prolific actor in his 80s, Udo Kier had multiple projects in pre-production at the time of his death alongside&nbsp;<em>OD</em>, on top of the three movies in which he’d already appeared this year. Other video game roles for the actor included 2022’s&nbsp;<em>Martha Is Dead</em> and 2017’s&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: WWII</em>, but his portrayal as the ESP-wielding Lord Yuri will always be his most iconic.</p>
