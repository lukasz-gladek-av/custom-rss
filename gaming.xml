            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-final-shape-dd-crossover-cosmetics-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bungie's space opera live service shooter is crossing over with the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG. Thanks to a collaboration with Wizards of the Coast, players can enjoy <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape D&amp;D</em> crossover cosmetics, letting them bring some dice magic to their triumphant guardians.</p>



<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape D&amp;D</em> crossover will introduce new cosmetic items to players based on monsters and spells from <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>.</p>




<p>For fashionistas, the crossover brings armor based on Faerun's most iconic monsters. Hunters get the Spectral Displacer set, based on the crafty Displacer Beasts. Warlocks get the Flayer's Dominion set, which is Mind Flayer-themed. Lastly, Titans get the Apex Draconic set, making them as bold as a metallic dragon.</p>

<p>The Destiny 2: The Final Shape D&amp;D crossover content doesn't end at player armor. The crossover will include an Adventurer's Pack Bundle, which features an Owlbear-themed sparrow, a ship based on the five-headed dragon Tiamat, and a Beholder Ghost shell.</p>

<p>Lastly, the crossover will include two emotes. One is the Natural 20 emote, which lets your Guardian roll a d20. Yes, the die results are random each time. Second is a new finisher where players can smack down enemies with the power of Bigby's Hand.</p>

<p>All of these cosmetics will be available when <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> goes live on June 4.</p>

<p>This major expansion tells the epic conclusion of the Light and Darkness saga. The Guardians of the Traveler journey into The Pale Heart to prevent the calcification of reality itself by The Witness. It will feature the return of fan-favorite character Cayde-6 and the introduction of the new Prismatic subclass.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/videos/24167860/beasts-of-balance-overboard-jenga-stacking-board-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9TTLyl">A tower of precariously placed objects presents a classic board game conundrum. <em>Jenga</em> is the famous example, but <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/193042/junk-art">many others</a> <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/218129/catch-the-moon">also put dexterity</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/23780048/tokyo-highway-table-top-board-game-overboard-lets-play">to the test</a> as players build and deconstruct towers until they inevitably fall over. <em>Beasts of Balance</em> uses that foundation to make something new: a cooperative (or competitive) building game designed around a companion tablet app and RFID reading pedestal. The result is engaging at just about any age.</p>
<p id="BB5Dus">Playing the game is simple: Just grab an artifact (as the game’s pieces are called), scan it on the plinth, and add it to the tower. You can choose from polygonal beasts like eagles and octopi, point juicing elements, or maybe a “cross” piece that combines the points and DNA of two beasts in play. The tablet app helpfully illustrates this by showing you the “hawktopus” you’ve just created, adding it to your compendium of crossbred creatures.</p>

<p id="4gy1IJ">The app works almost seamlessly and we only encountered a few hiccups getting pieces to scan. Most of the time the app integrates well into the experience, tracking your score, showing off your chimeric critters, and even adding additional building challenges. For example, you might need to keep one finger on the app while you place your artifact with your other hand (for extra points, of course).</p>
<p id="2YzlaE">The most thoughtful designs in the game are the artifacts, which are designed to be stacked, hung, and yes, <em>balanced</em> on top of each other. The animal pieces are especially fun to handle, with striking angles and soft-touch plastic. Even without the added gameplay elements of the app, the simple act of stacking pieces is immensely satisfying.</p>
<p id="szLCfK">The game can be played cooperatively, with everyone taking turns selecting artifacts and adding them to the tower. If the tower falls, players have a short time to put it back together before the game ends. Alternatively, players can go head-to-head, swiping each others’ beasts or even making them go extinct.</p>
<p id="OxdD1Y">You can see how both modes work in our Let’s Play at the top of this post.

  <p id="l0iLc1">There’s yet another new SMG in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/modern-warfare-3-guides"><em>Modern Warfare 3</em></a>, this time in the form of the <strong>Superi 46</strong>. While it’s a very solid all-rounder. the Superi 46 doesn’t immediately stand out as having best-in-class stats, but with the right attachments it can compete with some of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/modern-warfare-3-guides/23912779/best-weapons-guns-call-of-duty-mw3">best guns</a> in the game.</p>
<p id="A6ExzC">This versatility means it can be built out to support any type of playstyle, though in our testing we’ve actually found keeping it as an all-rounder is the best option. It means you can deal with enemies up close while also taking foes down from afar after reducing the recoil and increasing the bullet velocity.</p>
<p id="UM7afK">Here’s the <strong>best Superi 46 loadout in </strong><em><strong>Modern Warfare 3</strong></em><em> </em>and details on how to get your hands on it to begin with.</p>
<hr id="awoEr8">
<h2 id="Zn4o8R"><strong>How to unlock the Superi 46 in MW3</strong></h2>
<p id="kgxUP4"><strong>To unlock the Superi 46 in </strong><em><strong>Modern Warfare 3 </strong></em><strong>Season 4, you must complete Sector 6 in the battle pass. </strong>This is over on the far left of the grid, so the quickest path there from the start is to complete Sectors 1, 2, and 4, followed by 6 above it. As always with new weapons, the Superi 46 is completely free, so you don’t need to fork out money on the battle pass. You just need to play the game enough to earn a sufficient amount of tokens.</p>

<p id="zBrRa8">Here is the <strong>best Superi 46 loadout</strong> in <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li id="c0heS4">
<strong>Barrel: </strong>Houndguard Heavy Barrel</li>
<li id="gjiWwK">
<strong>Underbarrel: </strong>FTAC RS-9 Stealth Angled Grip</li>
<li id="z4Pacx">
<strong>Optic: </strong>Holo Craft Optic</li>
<li id="U2Y507">
<strong>Stock: </strong>Rescue-9 Stock</li>
<li id="trvce5">
<strong>Rear Grip: </strong>Phantom Grip</li>
</ul>
<p id="WOBIJk">Kicking things off is the most impactful attachment here, the <strong>Houndguard Heavy Barrel</strong>. This is the attachment that will allow you to compete in long-range gunfights, as it gives a significant buff to bullet velocity and range. However, the trade-off is that it nerfs a lot of the mobility you’ll get with the Superi 46, so the rest of your loadout will need to account for that.</p>
<p id="eorLPg">The <strong>FTAC RS-9 Stealth Angled Grip</strong> may seem like a slightly unorthodox pick, but it’s for one good reason: The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/modern-warfare-3-guides/23955189/mw3-tactical-stance-tac-stance-get-use-controls">tac stance</a> spread buff. With this build, you’ll want to use the tac stance whenever fighting up close because the <strong>Holo Craft Optic</strong> is geared towards longer-range engagements.</p>
<p id="tmV8Uh">Then we have the <strong>Rescue-9 Stock</strong>, which is a huge help for some of the mobility-based offerings, including your movement speed. It also helps manage recoil, while the <strong>Phantom Grip</strong> is essential for reacting to surprise fights up close. The only downside is the nerf to your flinch resistance, so when you’re fighting at range, you’ll want to be ducking in and out of cover constantly to avoid getting hit.</p>

<p id="2ri9qv">The <strong>Modular Assault Rig</strong> is a vest that allows you to carry two lethal and tactical grenades, and you can have equipment in every slot. You also spawn with max ammo and you can resupply your grenades from dead players, so you’ll basically never run out, even when you’re on a streak. In the secondary slot, go for the standard <strong>Renetti</strong> because it’s so reliable. Do the same for both grenades: You can’t beat the classics, so the <strong>Flash</strong> and <strong>Frag Grenades</strong> are your best bet.</p>
<p id="qU5rQa">In the field upgrade slot, equip <strong>Dead Silence</strong>. This may seem like a slightly odd choice, but footsteps are quite loud in <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>, so making them as quiet as possible is helpful, especially with a build like this where you’ll often be flanking and moving from one position to the next.</p>
<p id="1FxScI">The <strong>Marksman Gloves</strong> assist at long range, especially in helping to regain some of that flinch resistance lost with the Phantom Grip, while the <strong>Stalker Boots</strong> improve your movement speed while strafing and aiming down the sights. Finally, much like Dead Silence, the <strong>Ghost T/V Camo</strong> assists your stealthiness as it means you can’t be seen by UAVs or enemy radar sources when you’re moving.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24167466/cuckoo-director-tilman-singer-preview-interview-hunter-schafer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ISa1Jd">Sam Levinson’s drama series <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22950817/euphoria-recaps-memes-social-media-internet-watch-party"><em>Euphoria</em></a> has been a spectacular launching pad for new movie stars, with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24091605/dune-2-zendaya-movie-star-best-performance">Zendaya</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24099874/immaculate-review-sydney-sweeney-nun-movie">Sydney Sweeney</a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24030564/saltburn-what-happens-fandom-explained-tiktok">Jacob Elordi</a> all seeing their film careers take off after the show’s first season. Hunter Schafer is the latest <em>Euphoria</em> player heading for film stardom, with her first leading role coming up in Neon’s late-summer horror movie <em>Cuckoo</em>. Schafer plays Gretchen, an American teenager reluctantly joining her father, stepmother, and mute half-sister at a remote German resort run by a deeply creepy man (<em>The Guest</em>’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24133463/abigail-review-horror-comedy-vampires-scream">Dan Stevens</a>) whose excessively friendly front is obviously hiding some deeper motivations.</p>
<p id="E2d89T">It’s a dark, strange movie, built around a central character who’s initially hard to like, then impossible not to root for as she takes more and more physical abuse and the odds stack up against her. And given the distinct gap between how the first trailer portrays the film and what’s really going on, <em>Cuckoo</em> is likely to be a significant surprise for a lot of viewers. Avoid spoilers if you can. (You won’t find any below.)</p>
<div id="3Opru1"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NuON7HH0UkQ?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="3AiTyn">Writer-director Tilman Singer, a German-born filmmaker making his second feature-length project after 2018’s horror-mystery <em>Luz</em>, told Polygon in a pre-release interview that he cast Schafer for the movie years ago, before the first season of <em>Euphoria</em> had even aired. When COVID-19 delayed his production, though, he was gratified to see her building a fan base through the series — because while <em>Cuckoo</em> is an R-rated movie, he’s stealthily hoping that younger teenagers find ways to slip into a theater and see it.</p>
<p id="TXuMqX">“We had to push [production] one more time because <em>Euphoria</em> was shooting season 2, and by then, it was super hype,” Singer said. “We knew all of that was really, really good for us. It made me happy, because first and foremost, I thought, <em>Wow, she has a </em>lot<em> of young fans, and these young people may go watch our weird movie.</em> I remember when I was a young teenager, the first really weird, strange movies I saw, that kind of overwhelmed me, that I didn’t fully understand at the time — I was so thankful that happened to me. I was fantasizing that something like that happens to other young people now, with our movie.”</p>
<p id="raL4zb">While <em>Cuckoo</em>’s initial festival run produced a number of reviews comparing it to movies like Stanley Kubrick’s <em>The Shining </em>and Ari Aster’s <em>Hereditary</em>, Singer would rather people didn’t call it “2024’s <em>Hereditary</em>” — he says he’d rather people call it “2024’s film that young people managed to sneak into and see too early.”</p>

<p id="wpGt6J">Singer looks back with a particular joy at movies that he saw “too early,” like Alex Cox’s 1984 cult movie <em>Repo Man</em>. “I love that movie,” he said. “I was, like, 14. My uncle gave it to me on VHS in English. My English was really bad. But I was into punk music, and I just watched it over and over. I had no fucking idea what was going on. The other one — around the same age, I watched David Lynch’s <em>Lost Highway</em>. And these just opened me up. So that’s a beautiful thing.”</p>
<p id="1lm7LR">He compares the sensation of this kind of formative, often illicit cult-movie experience to having your heart or brain torn open. “Sometimes, something hits you with a force, because you’re not used to hearing or seeing [anything like] that, and it just cracks open your skull,” he said. “[…] I think that’s one of the most formative and beautiful things.”</p>
<p id="9W0B7Z">Will <em>Cuckoo</em> hit young viewers that way? It’s certainly possible. Singer’s horror movie is a singular film, full of narrative surprises, an intense and emotional central performance from Schafer, a terrific mystery in Stevens’ character, and vivid images that stick in the memory long after the final shot. Singer shot <em>Cuckoo </em>on 35mm film because, as he told Polygon, he prefers the “big choices” of having to pick lighting and framing in advance for a limited number of shots over “all the little trial-and-error choices” of real-time, on-set digital manipulation. That gives the film a lush, hyper-real look that, again, may remind viewers of <em>The Shining</em>.</p>
<p id="ny6qwB">Singer is fine with the comparison — he says<em> The Shining</em> was just one of the influences pressing on him as he made <em>Cuckoo</em>, but it was certainly an influence. “I absolutely watched it a billion times,” he laughs. “Then when we were on location, scouting, and I found this large hall that we turned into our hotel reception lobby, <em>The Shining</em> just <em>washed</em> over me. I was like, ‘Oh my God, we <em>have</em> to shoot here, <em>we have to shoot here</em>!’ Our production designer was like, ‘This place is in disarray. This place will fall apart.’ And I was like, ‘We don’t even have to do anything! The patina is already there!’ They were like, ‘Yeah, we do have to do <em>one or two things</em> here.’”</p>

<p id="ve7lOE">Singer says all old hotels “always have something ominous to them,” and anything shot in an old hotel is likely to take longtime horror fans back to Kubrick’s movie. But he hopes horror fans see his other influences in <em>Cuckoo</em> as well.</p>
<p id="4SPFJS">“Especially with a movie that feels so much like it wears its influences directly, you know, on its face,” he says. “I think that’s just what I do. I tend to write really unconsciously, to tap into my subconscious and let it flow, and then later understand what [I’ve written], and form it together with the actors. With that process, it’s just like a ton of visuals and sounds and structure pours out of my head.” </p>
<p id="iRpXDF">One thing he approaches a little more consciously, though, is a conviction that horror movies need some sense of hope. “I wanted to make a horror film, or a thriller with horror elements, or however you want to call it, that is not as grim, and not as spiraling down into an absolute doomsday scenario,” he told Polygon. “I think horror is a very beautiful genre, because horror is effectively forcing you to face death, or all the incarnations of death. It could be violence, sexual violence, all of this stuff? And the only remedy to death is a form of religion.”</p>
<p id="A3XNOA">Singer was quick to clarify that he doesn’t mean organized religion: “I’m not talking about Christianity or Islam or something. I’m talking about a higher sense for humans. How to deal with death. You could call it love, you could call it music, whatever. I think <em>Cuckoo</em> has a lot of that idea — we can overcome death, or if not overcome it, just live with it. I’m not going to spoil the last shot, and it’s not that crazy if you just described it. But that very last shot for me is the essence of the whole movie.” </p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be nice to live in a world where exclusivity was eliminated altogether? When a game launches, it is released to all available systems so that everyone can enjoy the experience. Unfortunately, that’s an idealistic dream. There’s money to be made by launching a console-exclusive title. That brings us to Stellar Blade. Will Stellar Blade come to PC?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-stellar-blade-coming-to-pc">Is Stellar Blade Coming to PC?</h2>



<p>Currently, there is no confirmation or information surrounding a PC release of Stellar Blade. Of course, it’s likely to happen, as most console exclusives wind up coming to the PC, but it’s a matter of time and money. Will Sony want to port the game to another platform? Yeah, likely.</p>



<p>We suspect Stellar Blade will eventually be on Steam. Most PlayStation exclusives wind up on the Valve-owned platform; we must remain patient and show Sony that we don’t mind waiting.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-long-does-it-take-for-playstation-exclusives-to-launch-on-pc">How Long Does it Take for PlayStation Exclusives to Launch on PC?</h2>



<p>For the most part, a PlayStation-exclusive title takes approximately one to two years to launch on PC. If we look at games such as Horizon Forbidden West, it was around two years before the console exclusivity ended. That said, it took Ghost of Tsushima four years to launch on PC. </p>



<p>There is, unfortunately, no concrete window. I mean, look at Bloodborne. There’s likely more going on behind the scenes, but Bloodborne on PC is one of the most requested titles in history, but it’s still not happening.</p>



<p>We could wait two or more years before Stellar Blade comes to Steam!</p>

                <p>Ahead of the launch of The Final Shape expansion next week, Bungie has unveiled a Dungeons &amp; Dragons crossover for Destiny 2. Like previous collaborations, players will be able to don stylish armor sets inspired by the popular tabletop game franchise, including Faerûn inspired armor for all classes. The new armor sets include the Apex Draconic set for Titans, the Spectral Displacer set for Hunters, and the Flayer’s Dominion set for Warlocks. There'll also be an Owlbear Chariot, Queen of Dragons ship, the Eye Tyrant Ghost Shell, and more added to Destiny 2 when the crossover rolls out.</p><p>It's worth noting that these are purely cosmetic pieces of armor and they have no effect on your gear's stats or properties. These premium armor ornaments typically require you to spend some cash to own them and previous collaborations have been priced at 2,000 Silver, or around $20 in real-world cash.

<p data-characters="270" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I’ve always looked past <em>Call of Duty </em>Blackcell bundles, mostly because I don’t feel like breaking the bank with its paywall. But, with the release of <em>MW3</em> and <em>Warzone</em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-season-4-early-patch-notes-new-maps-modes-killstreaks-and-equipment-items/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4</a>, that has since changed with the thieving abilities of the Copy and Dupe Operators.</p> <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true">What makes them so extraordinary is their Identity Theft Finishing Move, which can steal another player’s skin and place it on to your own Operator. So, if you see someone causing havoc as <em>The Boys’</em> Homelander, you can put ’em in their place by taking and using their skin. <em>Call of Duty</em> reposted a snippet of what it looks like in action, where the player Speros copies the skin of an unfortunate <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/warzone-and-mw3-players-question-not-banning-ranked-play-cheaters-completely/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Warzone </em>player</a>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="521" data-injectable="true">While the result of copying the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/yes-its-real-gundam-is-coming-to-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Operator skins</a> is the primary show-stopper, it doesn’t hurt that the ability just looks cool. It’s as if Copy or Dupe are sucking the life out of someone, using a cloudy effect.</p>
 <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">The only downside is that the Blackcell Operator’s stealing technique is temporary. That means you’ll immediately lose out on the skin upon death. However, it could bring about a challenge to see how long you can last with a particular Operator.</p> <p data-characters="169" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">The Blackcell bundle will also still cost you, going for a price of $29.99 in the COD shop. This comes with the Season 4 Battle Pass, too, and a few more valuable gear. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="211" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="false">Despite its paywall, getting ahold of Copy and Dupe in <em>MW3</em> and <em>Warzone</em> could be worth it. You could think of it as an investment, since it gives you other exclusive skins for free, at least in a temporary sense.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-call-of-duty-league-will-reportedly-look-a-whole-lot-different-in-major-4-qualifiers/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-call-of-duty-league-will-reportedly-look-a-whole-lot-different-in-major-4-qualifiers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="177" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In collaboration with Treyarch, Sledgehammer Games made substantial changes in the past two <em>Modern Warfare 3 </em>updates, which have major implications for the <em>Call of Duty League</em>. </p> <p data-characters="504" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true">As part of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-season-4-early-patch-notes-new-maps-modes-killstreaks-and-equipment-items/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4 update</a>, <em>Modern Warfare 3 </em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-season-4-change-pushes-players-away-from-using-covert-sneakers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decreased footstep sounds</a> for enemies, reworked the Hardpoint hills on 6 Star to exclude the pool point, removed exploding propane barrels on Highrise, buffed the MCW headshot multiplier, buffed Rival-9 damage ranges, and buffed the Cruise Missile damage range. Going back even further, the Trophy System was reworked in the Season 3 Reloaded update to be destroyed in two shots instead of three and the entire Boots Perk category saw a massive overhaul. </p>
 <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">Dexerto’s Jacob Hale <a href="https://x.com/JakeHaleee/status/1795827934571508109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says</a> <em>Call of Duty League </em>Major 4 will be played on the latest patch. This means all of these changes will be present in league matches starting on Friday. Previously, the <em>Call of Duty League</em> used an old patch and didn’t use the Season 3 or Season 3 Reloaded updates, and there was no guarantee that the pro players would use the latest update either. </p> <p data-characters="558" data-current-count="942" data-injectable="true">Because enemy footsteps make less noise, we will likely see professional players experiment with new Boots since Covert Sneakers eliminating footstep audio is no longer as important. And there will be plenty of options given the buffs to other Boot options in Season 3 Reloaded. In addition, it will be interesting to see how the Rival-9 and MCW changes have on SMG and AR players and how they stack up statistically against each other. Lastly, matches should flow better, given the 6 Star rotation changes, and players will die less frequently on Highrise. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Season 4 comp changes: </p><p>– Footstep sounds decreased<br>– 6 Star HP: hills reworked (no pool)<br>– Highrise: exploding Propane removed 🙌<br>– MCW headshot multi buff<br>– Rival-9 damage ranges buff<br>– Cruise missile damage radius buff <a href="https://t.co/8Lm6BZACc8">pic.twitter.com/8Lm6BZACc8</a></p></div>— Breaking Point (@GGBreakingPoint) <a href="https://twitter.com/GGBreakingPoint/status/1795841826773164069?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true">Historically, the <em>Call of Duty</em> League doesn’t rotate new maps or weapons into its regular rotation. Treyarch has been much more active during the <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> season, keeping the viewing experience fresh and exciting. It all started in late March, as Ranked Play hosted a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/call-of-duty-league-makes-massive-map-pool-changes-ahead-of-major-3-qualifiers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">public playtest</a> to experiment with new potential maps. </p>
 <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">A mix of player and professional player feedback resulted in the<em> Call of Duty League </em>adding Vista and 6 Star in place of Invasion and Skidrow. Then, Treyarch held a public playtest in Ranked Play to test out new weapons to potentially replace the Rival-9 and MCW. This trial didn’t amount to any changes, yet its still promising to see future changes aren’t ruled out. </p>

<p data-characters="207" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Wojciech Szczesny Serie A TOTS SBC is now available in <em>EA FC 24</em> Ultimate Team. After a long wait, EA Sports has released a goalkeeper SBC, perhaps wonderful news for those who have Serie A-based items. </p> <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="227" data-injectable="false">Szczesny also becomes the last Serie A TOTS release, as the promo will expire tomorrow on May 31.

With so many objectives currently available in Ultimate Team, completing this challenge shouldn’t be an issue for anyone. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/opinions/top-10-threats-in-finsters-monster-matic-cookbook</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/top-10-threats-in-finsters-monster-matic-cookbook.885231/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/opinions/top-10-threats-in-finsters-monster-matic-cookbook<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My fellow dice goblins, the latest <em>Power Rangers</em> Essence20 RPG sourcebook, <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em>, has been out for a while.</p>

<p>It is the closest thing to a full on <em>Monster Manuel</em> the Essence20 system has received so far, containing tons of interesting tokusatsu threats as well as more tailored threat creation rules for GMs.</p>

<p>And for Essence20 GMs out there, I do highly recommend this book. Not just for how it translates various fan favorite monsters to the system, as well as repurpose characters and elements seen in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/power-rangers-heroes-of-grid-review"><em>Heroes of the Grid</em></a>, but for the wellspring of inspiration those monsters' unique Perks and Powers can spark.</p>

<p>While there is plenty of creativity found in this 303 page book, ten of those threats personally stood head and shoulders over the rest.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-craterite-artwork.jpg?itok=9Ke2ctwY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-craterite-artwork.jpg?itok=3Dvqdb-P 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is what happens when the holodeck fails</figcaption></figure><h2>10. The Craterites</h2>

<p>The Craterites are a somewhat obscure monster from <em>Power Rangers in Space</em>. They are essentially hardlight projections of a training program gone horribly wrong. They are also the first monster in the series to be made up of several smaller versions of itself.</p>

<p>This is reflected in their respective statblocks. A group of Craterites has a Leader among their ranks. At any point in a fight, this Leader can command the swarm to form on them and combine.</p>

<p>Once all the Craterites reach the leader, they turn into a gigantic Craterite Conglomerate.This conglomerate gets various bonuses and extra health based on how many minions make it up.</p>

<p>Not only is it a novel take on a monster of the week, it adds some new dynamics to handling minions and navigating a scene.</p>

<p>Plus, it might just inspire similar hivemind monsters at your own table.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-death-revenant-artwork.jpg?itok=FviEltSA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-death-revenant-artwork.jpg?itok=wRKypWxn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Kill it with fire.</figcaption></figure><h2>9. The Death Revenants</h2>

<p>A Threat from the Boom! Studios comic continuity, the Death Revenants are reanimated dead, made to serve a dark master like the Death Ranger or Necrolai.</p>

<p>They are also the perfect template for having zombies in your campaign. With some reflavoring, they are perfect cannon fodder for Halloween or horror-themed one-shot adventures.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-rinshi-warrior-artwork.jpg?itok=pdVhzr7t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-rinshi-warrior-artwork.jpg?itok=sl-eF6QQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It might turn into a toad monster or a scorpion. Really.</figcaption></figure><h2>8. The Rinshi Warriors</h2>

<p>The elite footsoldiers of Dai Shi from <em>Power Rangers Jungle Fury</em>, the Rinshi Warriors are another minion with a really novel spin.</p>

<p>In addition to a Perk that gives them Edge against targets suffering certain conditions, the Rinshi Warriors can transform into a different Threat once they hit a certain amount of health.</p>

<p>These different forms are also in <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em>. There is even a handy chart for GMs to roll.</p>

<p>And with some extra work, it's a wonderful framework for GMs that want to spice up late game encounters against minions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-blobgoblin-artwork.jpg?itok=13sBSOYx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-blobgoblin-artwork.jpg?itok=dwXx_SeR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>My favorite kind of monster. Silly looking but secretly dangerous.</figcaption></figure><h2>7. Blobgoblin</h2>

<p>Blobgoblin is a great early threat for GMs that want to lean more into playful mischief. His whole gimmick isn't being a direct powerhouse, but being an amorphous blob that can take over electronics, vehicles, and even Zords if given enough time. Like a superhero take on <em>Poltergeist</em>.</p>

<p>It's just the right level of impish and fun that can spice up any table.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-dramole-artwork.jpg?itok=M7cGnPPf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-dramole-artwork.jpg?itok=jfHO66cX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He has a perk called Surprise. Guess why?</figcaption></figure><h2>6. Dramole</h2>

<p>Dramole is a classic <em>Mighty Morphin'</em> monster, one that is great to throw at early to mid game players that might lean too hard on combat stats.</p>

<p>Not only can Dramole burrow through the ground and turn out the lights, he has various attacks and powers that target Willpower Defense. Those same attacks and powers can mesmerize or disorient the team, forcing them to rethink their battle strategy.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-gravezord.jpg?itok=t2yqBtSG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-gravezord.jpg?itok=8xrvJlu- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What happens when the villains repurpose destroyed Zords?</figcaption></figure><h2>5. The Gravezord</h2>

<p>Another Boom! Studios original, the Gravezord is exactly what it sounds like. A Frankenstein's monster of various Zord parts cobbled together into a war machine.</p>

<p>Not only is it a powerful mid game threat, it is the perfect template for an evil mech piloted by the bad guys. High defense, solid damage, and it even has some creative hang-ups to help players think outside the box.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-kamdor-artwork.jpg?itok=s84hqH9J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-kamdor-artwork.jpg?itok=eyoaiuCA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He'll honor a one on one duel, but treat you like a dog.</figcaption></figure><h2>4. Kamdor, Master of Miratrix</h2>

<p><em>Operation Overdrive's</em> Kamdor is a peak example of the “dark knight” monster in <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em>. An extremely powerful general to the big bad that is characterized by some sort of warrior code of honor.</p>

<p>This nobility can add a lot of character to the usual menagerie of mindless monsters and maniacal despots.</p>

<p>Plus, his Hang-Ups give him just the right level of arrogance to make him novel to face. Whether you use him as is or as a template, Kamdor is a standout.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-lord-drakkon.jpg?itok=c_sLjpfS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-lord-drakkon.jpg?itok=glt5EnqK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The face of a man that lead a war against multiple dimensions</figcaption></figure><h2>3. Lord Drakkon and His Forces</h2>

<p>Taking number three in this list is the iconic Lord Drakkon from the Boom! Studios comic crossover event, <em>Shattered Grid</em>.</p>

<p>As an endgame Threat, Drakkon is a beast. Not only does he have defenses over 20 across the board, he is more than capable of downing an entire team with just a few attacks.</p>

<p>On top of that, he has his own Personal Power pool, allowing him to mind control teammates and even shut down characters from using their own Personal Power pools.</p>

<p>But Lord Drakkon isn't alone in this book. Every one of his generals and soldiers are also in <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em>. The Ranger Slayer, Black Dragon, nine different types of Ranger Sentry, and even some of his war zords all have statblocks.</p>

<p>And since Drakkon is an interdimensional threat, this means you could have his attempt to conquer the world the focus of an entire campaign arc. It's all here, in this book, ready to go.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-rita-repulsa-artwork.jpg?itok=zfmud7ov 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-rita-repulsa-artwork.jpg?itok=mUSnQ03B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What spell is she conjuring now? Seriously, I don't know.</figcaption></figure><h2>2. Rita Repulsa &amp; Lord Zedd</h2>

<p>The absence of the most iconic evil power couple in the franchise from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/power-rangers-roleplaying-game-review"><em>Power Rangers Core Rulebook</em></a> has finally been corrected in <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em>. And it was worth the wait.</p>

<p>What makes both of them the stuff of legend as endgame Threats are how they showcase this supplement's brand new Sorcerous Magic system. This point-buy system lets you make surprisingly tailored spells, powers, and attacks with the trade-off of some skill tests costing the caster some health.</p>

<p>Rita and Zedd embody this magical cruelty. Massive area of effect blasts. Ongoing auras that inflict conditions and sap Personal Power. And, of course, the ability to instantly make themselves or an ally grow to gigantic size and escalate the battle.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-finster-and-psycho-rangers.jpg?itok=5lqBTsWZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-finster-and-psycho-rangers.jpg?itok=p4FQJiWD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Let's see, how can I make them more bloodthirsty?</figcaption></figure><h2>1. The Psycho Rangers</h2>

<p>If you are familiar with the Essence20 supplements released for <em>Power Rangers</em> so far, The Psycho Rangers appearing in <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em> might surprise you.</p>

<p>The Psycho Rangers already have statblocks. They were introduced in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/power-rangers-across-stars-review"><em>Across The Stars</em></a> supplement. In fact, those statblocks were perfect in portraying them in the game.</p>

<p>Well, in <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em>, there are rules for making your own Psycho Rangers. All six Psychos have their own Player Roles in this book, all themed around different forms of antisocial or psychotic behavior.</p>

<p>Not only are these rules great for making darker, alternative ranger PCs, it is also a great way to make bespoke GM-controlled PCs as Threats. Want a dark counterpart to the group's outgoing extrovert? The Path of Stone's emotionally dead bruiser is right there. Want to contrast with the empathic caregiver in the group? The Path of Cruelty's sadistic streak works just fine.</p>

<p>The new Psycho Ranger Roles are one of the biggest additions <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em> brings to the game, giving not just the GM options for threats, but players options to embrace their dark side as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24167967/life-eater-strange-scaffold-stalking-horror-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="EVofsr">Most games’ protagonists are heroes, gunning down bad guys or trying to save the princess. You could argue the protagonist of <em>Life Eater</em> is kind of like a hero. Sure, he stalks people relentlessly before murdering them in the service of a dark god. But if he didn’t do that, the world would end. So really, when you think about it, this is a noble mission — and by enacting Zimforth’s will, I’m saving the world.</p>
<p id="3Z41vf"><em>Life Eater</em> is a weird little game that is unlike anything I’ve ever played before. When I first played it upon its release in April, I noticed the striking visuals and audio effects, and the short cutscenes between campaign chapters sent chills down my spine, but I found the actual meat and potatoes of the game to be fairly minimal. </p>
<p id="wicyLB">Here’s how it works: I get presented with targets, each of whom has their own schedule. Each victim’s personal timetable starts out blank; I have to uncover the details of my victim’s life by poking and prodding at them. For instance, I can discover that my target has breakfast at around 9 a.m. by leisurely rattling their doorknob and then scampering away. Hacking into their computer gives me a hint as to their weekend habits, and hiding in the bushes is a good way to learn whether they commute or not. It’s only when I truly understand the victim and their schedule that I can strike, sacrificing them in the dark to buy our world another year of peace.</p>

<p id="IQOP9N">At first, I bounced off <em>Life Eater</em> hard. The ending ritual to sacrifice the victim would always be the same — remove <em>this</em> organ if they have a commute, and break <em>this</em> rib if they slept a certain number of hours per day. It took a lot of the joy out of poring over a victim’s life, because I always knew the exact facts I needed to gather, so I had little curiosity to do anything else. The campaign also introduces multiple targets early on, but some of them are innocent and must not be touched. I had a hard time ascertaining which person was the “right” sacrifice, and eventually I grew frustrated with the game and put it down, thinking it was ambitious and admirable but not for me.</p>
<p id="EIVmjr">A recent update from developer Strange Scaffold has changed things. The ending sacrifice is now much more varied, and now I want to go into the ritual with as much information as I can possibly glean. Furthermore, a new Endless Mode has been added to the game, and I found this to be a good way to practice my stalking skills. After a few rounds of Endless Mode, I felt like I could tackle the campaign, and the narrative weight of the story finally got its claws into me. </p>

<p id="LGqixG">The trick to <em>Life Eater</em> is that every action takes time, which is a finite resource, of course. Furthermore, a failed action raises suspicion — if I try to break into someone’s house and they catch me, I’m at risk of being discovered and possibly stopped by the police. I can ease suspicion by doing any number of non-stalker actions, like going to work, sleeping, or socializing… but that burns into my time, and if the clock hits zero without me performing the necessary sacrifice(s), the world ends.</p>
<p id="Lgu4rq">The minimal style of the game pays dividends here, because each one of the procedurally generated victims can end up being relatively complex. The game never straight up <em>tells</em> you if someone lives alone — but I can review the information I’ve uncovered and see the blocks of time where the victim is alone and figure out whether they have company at any given hour of the day. And sometimes I find some truly grisly secrets, like a Saturday ritual where my target goes to the woods to drink blood with their buddies. It’s a game that actually makes me <em>feel</em> like a stalker, which is a truly novel horror experience. </p>

<p>While initial plans placed Marvel Rivals firmly in the PC camp, it appears that’s about to change with an upcoming announcement. The word around town is that Marvel Rivals is coming to consoles, including PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. So, when can we play Marvel Rivals on Xbox?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marvel-rivals-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Marvel Rivals on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p>Following various leaks on social media and mysterious code appearing on the game’s official website, it seems Marvel Rivals on Xbox Series X|S isn’t a pipedream. It’s happening; it’s just a matter of when.</p>



<p>Throughout the next few weeks, we have numerous upcoming gaming events, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-playstation-showcase-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation State of Play</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-xbox-showcase-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. These events, along with Summer Game Fest, would provide the perfect stage for developer NetEase Games to announce console versions of Marvel Rivals. </p>







<h2 id="h-does-marvel-rivals-support-cross-platform-play">Does Marvel Rivals Support Cross-Platform Play?</h2>



<p>While we’re pretty sure of the upcoming console versions of Marvel Rivals, there’s no official word from the developer yet. As such, there is no official cross-platform support for Marvel Rivals, but it’s coming. There’s code within the PC version indicating crossplay and cross-platform functionality between PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>Since the basis is already in place, this functionality will likely become activated when the game officially launches on all three systems. In this case, I don’t suspect we’ll have to wait for a post-launch update.</p>

<p>It’s always fun to see a highly anticipated title expand its reach. Previously, developer NetEase Games planned Marvel Rivals as a PC-only title. But that’s changing. There’s new information surrounding the hero-based shooter that points towards a console release. So, is Marvel Rivals on PS5? Is it coming soon?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marvel-rivals-on-ps5">Can You Play Marvel Rivals on PS5?</h2>



<p>While you can’t play Marvel Rivals on PS5 yet, it’s happening. A recent code revealed on the game’s website indicates the superhero shooter is coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S alongside the PC version. </p>



<p>Anyone on a console who was hoping for a chance to rampage through an arena as Hulk or Iron Man will soon have their chance. However, there is no console release date for Marvel Rivals. With so many upcoming events, like the PlayStation State of Play and Summer Game Fest, we’ll likely see a reveal soon enough, though!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-marvel-rivals-crossplay">Is Marvel Rivals Crossplay?</h2>



<p>While Marvel Rivals isn’t yet available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, supposedly, code within the current build indicates full crossplay infrastructure is ready for launch day.</p>



<p>However, whether or not we’ll see some restrictions in place remains to be seen. It’s not uncommon for a game to offer cross-platform or crossplay support but lock the feature to PC and Xbox Series X|S, like with No Man’s Sky. But if Marvel Rivals features genuine crossplay support, we’ll see lobbies full of superheroes across all supported systems.</p>



<p>Let’s hope the studio can balance heroes well enough to prevent any one system from having an unfair advantage!</p>

He was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/john-romero-mabel-addis-game-developers-choice-awards-2023">honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award</a> at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in 2023 for his outstanding contribution to the video game industry.</p><p>His autobiography, published in July 2023, chronicles a "difficult childhood and storied career, beginning with his early days submitting Apple II game code to computer magazines and sneaking computers out the back door of his day job to write code at night," according to the book's blurb, which calls it an "inspiring" tale.</p><p>"Talking with both Rob [McCallum] and Naomi [Harvey], I knew they were the perfect team to bring Doom Guy to life," Romero said of the adaptations.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-adds-vegito-gogeta-and-other-famous-fusions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Fusion...HA!</h2></div><section><p>Bandai Namco unveiled a new character trailer for its hotly anticipated 3D fighting game, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-producer-says-game-will-have-budokai-tenkaichis-spirit-nostalgia"><u>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</u></a>. Much like <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-official-master-and-apprentice-trailer"><u>past themed character trailers</u></a>, this one centered on the mega-popular shonen series’ smorgasbord of fusion characters. </p><p>First up is Goku and Vegeta’s rambunctious Saiyan kids, Goten and Trunks. The pair premiered in Dragon Ball Z’s Buu arc, where the pair fused, forming the formidable Gotenks. Unlike most Saiyans, their move set is pretty unorthodox.</p><p>Key among them is the Super Donut, an ability that turns enemies into a volleyball, and Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack, which, as its name suggests, spews explosive ghost clones from their mouth.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Kale and Caulifla, Saiyans from Universe 6, were first introduced in the Tournament of Power arc in Dragon Ball Super. Caulifa serves as the de facto Saiyan leader of Universe 6 whereas Kale, for all intents and purposes, exists as Universe 6’s Broly.</p><p>Unlike Goku and company, Kale and Caulifla quickly mastered transforming into Super Saiyans. Their fusion, Kefla, also exists as one of the strongest fusions in the series, putting Goku on the backfoot until he unlocked his newly minted Ultra Instinct form.</p><p>Moving right along are Gogeta and Vegito, two fusion forms of Goku and Vegeta using the fusion dance and potara earrings, respectively. Keeping in spirit with the energy of Dragon Ball Z fandom debates, the trailer leaned into the discourse over which Saiyan combo is the best—going so far as to have Vegito trash talk Gogeta’s fusion dance poses—before cutting away from their beam struggle.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/30/thumbnail-fourth-character-revea-1717083231223.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Sparking! Zero's roster is filling up.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Fused Zamazu, a villainous potara fusion between Goku Black and Zamasu in Dragon Ball Super, also got some play in today’s fusion-centric trailer. </p><p>Sparking! Zero's roster has now increased to a whopping 82 characters, though most of the roster is occupied by a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-goes-super-saiyan-heavy-with-reveal-of-first-24-characters">swarm of Goku and Vegetas in various Super Saiyan forms</a>.</p><p>Based on Bandai Namco’s trend of releasing character trailers a month apart, we’re likely to receive yet another character trailer sometime toward the end of June 2024. WheneverDragon Ball: Sparking! Zero gets around to revealing its officiial release date, players can look forward to its inevitable launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. </p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

  <p id="mBjVTl">Let’s face it: A lot of sports movies, especially the most famous ones, are pretty bad. Often corny, schlocky, and with only a mediocre understanding of the sports they depict at best, sports-loving movie audiences have long been disappointed by adaptations of the games they love on the big screen.</p>
<p id="zWREi3">That’s why we’re here — to separate the wheat from the chaff and hone in on the sports movies that are actually good. </p>
<p id="Cnhiib">Here are some sports movies we quite like, and we hope you do as well. They are organized by sport. Our latest update added <em>Bull Durham</em>, <em>Challengers</em>, <em>Ferrari</em>, <em>The French</em>, <em>O.J.: Made in America</em>, <em>Rocky</em>, and <em>Throw Down</em>.</p>

<p id="YzQUtF"><strong>The sport:</strong> Baseball, or rather, baseball statistics</p>
<p id="QDOVem"><strong>The movie:</strong> Adapted from a nonfiction book, this low-key but compelling real-life baseball drama from 2011 tells the story of manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and his attempt to turn around the struggling Oakland Athletics team. Beane goes against the headwinds of the sport (as you must do in all sports movies) by disregarding the received wisdom of scouting and assembling a team of overlooked players based on statistical analysis compiled by the nerdy Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). </p>
<p id="KGVRlm"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> This is perhaps the only sports drama where the bean-counter is the hero, which gives it novelty value. The topic sounds dry, and it kind of is, but master screenwriters Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin know just how to spell it out and sell it, the filmmaking craft is impeccable, and you get treated to a supporting turn from the legendary Philip Seymour Hoffman. Bizarrely, there’s also a cameo from former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick, who plays the team’s owner. —<em>Oli Welsh</em></p>

<p id="jwzK8u"><strong>The sport:</strong> Basketball</p>
<p id="oxfUnm"><strong>The movie:</strong> Steven Soderbergh’s second movie shot on an iPhone (after <em>Unsane</em>), <em>High Flying Bird </em>follows sports agent Ray Burke (André Holland), who looks to fight back against some of the power imbalances in sport by finding an opportunity for a rookie client (Melvin Gregg) during a labor dispute.</p>
<p id="gmY9fl"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> <em>High Flying Bird </em>digs into some of the complicated dynamics on the business side of sports, and Soderbergh’s iPhone direction is paired well with a sharp script from Tarell Alvin McCraney (<em>Moonlight</em>) and a magnetic lead performance by Holland. <em>—PV</em></p>

<p id="xPJaNE"><strong>The sport:</strong> Boxing</p>
<p id="1mBdMw"><strong>The movie:</strong> A 1980 biography of Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro), a champion middleweight boxer of the 1940s and ’50s. Adapted from LaMotta’s own memoir, <em>Raging Bull </em>takes the viewer on a brutalizing tour through his sporting and private life. It spares us neither the savagery of the ring nor the dysfunction and violence at home, and shows LaMotta both in his prime and in a sad, post-boxing life.</p>
<p id="fmRw7o"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> Because, <a href="https://www.afi.com/afis-100-years-100-movies-10th-anniversary-edition/">according to the American Film Institute</a>, it’s the fourth-greatest American film of all time. Because it’s one of De Niro’s greatest performances, with a terrifying physicality. Because it’s a searing, tragic deconstruction of toxic masculinity. And because Scorsese’s filmmaking, powered by Michael Chapman’s black-and-white photography and Thelma Schoonmaker’s impressionistic editing, reaches a delirious intensity that will take your breath away, especially in the dumbfounding boxing scenes. —<em>OW</em></p>

<p id="ZVpY13"><strong>The movie:</strong> One of the all-time great underdog stories and iconic movie characters. Sylvester Stallone stars as a small-time fighter who gets a surprising shot at glory when he secures a fight against the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers).</p>
<p id="rIPvtF"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> It’s <em>Rocky</em>! No list of sports movies would be complete without it — it’s one of the main reasons underdog stories are so popular in the genre. Yes, it’s schmaltzy, but that’s the charm of the movie. Sylvester Stallone is among the most earnest pop artists of the 20th century, and nowhere is that clearer than in <em>Rocky</em>. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="Qxvr6p"><strong>The sport:</strong> Football</p>
<p id="TnaRuL"><strong>The movie:</strong> Harold Lloyd’s classic 1925 comedy follows his fresh-faced new student Harold Lamb, who wants nothing more than to be cool. How do you be cool? A great question that has baffled scientists for millennia. For Harold, however, the answer was joining the football team.</p>
<p id="uCL6NW"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> A hilarious movie filled with some gags that don’t translate to the modern day and some that truly do (there’s a whistle-based gag in the football game that could still very much happen in real life), <em>The Freshman </em>is an early example of a sports movie and a standout movie from one of silent cinema’s great comedians. <em>—PV</em></p>

<p id="B8gmom"><strong>The sport:</strong> Motorsport</p>
<p id="w0WoYI"><strong>The movie:</strong> Michael Mann takes on the legacy of Enzo Ferrari (Adam Driver), the founder of the luxury car brand and racing team and more than a bit of an asshole. The movie charts his later years as he deals with his struggling race team, hiding his secret second family from his wife, and public scrutiny.</p>
<p id="R0dbm9"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> An exemplary anti-great man biopic, <em>Ferrari </em>was one of my favorite movies of 2023. It’s a terrific character study led by incredible leading performances by Driver and Penélope Cruz (the biggest Oscar snub of the year, in my humble opinion). Also, it’s a Michael Mann movie, so you know the action sequences are excellent (in this case, the racing sequences).<em>—PV</em></p>

<p id="P5ZdAk"><strong>The sport:</strong> Judo</p>
<p id="bctgqI"><strong>The movie:</strong> Three people in the Hong Kong nightlife — a singer (Cherrie Ying), a former judo champion who runs a bar (Louis Koo), and an aspiring judoka who wants to take on anyone he can (Aaron Kwok) — intertwine in a powerful and touching movie about friendship and the search for the self.</p>
<p id="Tw3nbk"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> It only makes sense to follow up <em>Sanshiro Sugata </em>with <em>Throw Down</em> — Johnnie To dedicated the movie to Kurosawa, and while it’s not a remake, there are many similarities between the two. It’s a gorgeous, sentimental martial arts movie directed by one of the very best in the business. <em>—PV</em></p>

<p id="4jvnDt"><strong>The sport:</strong> Tennis</p>
<p id="wUy1SQ"><strong>The movie:</strong> Three youth tennis stars (Josh O’Connor, Mike Faist, and Zendaya) find themselves in a love triangle that mixes personal feelings and competitive spirit. After an injury sidelines the most promising of the three, it seems the relationship drama sorts itself out. But when the trio run into each other on the competitive circuit years later, it seems old rivalries and passions are still just as hot as ever.</p>
<p id="7RNDe6"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> Sports, at their very best, are really just a vehicle for drama, and <em>Challengers </em>understands that perfectly. The movie is framed around one central tennis match, the championship at a tiny, meaningless tournament, which we cut back and forth to between intersections of tense romantic drama. The tennis in this movie is shot the way other movies might approach a fistfight: It’s violent, kinetic, and personal, and every single hit has an emotional winner. All this makes both the tennis and the romance hit harder each time they come back up, leading to an inevitable conclusion that feels absolutely perfect. —<em>Austen Goslin</em></p>

<p id="IXuxVi"><strong>The sport: </strong>Tennis</p>
<p id="IZWhrr"><strong>The movie: </strong>William Klein’s cinéma vérité documentary about the 1981 French Open had unprecedented access from the French Tennis Federation, allowing Klein to get behind the scenes with one of the most fascinating periods in tennis history. It’s a favorite of Wes Anderson’s, who presented the movie at the Metrograph.</p>
<p id="R7oyRh"><strong>Why you should watch: </strong>The movie is filled with intimate looks at the fascinating stars of that era — Björn Borg, John McEnroe, Yannick Noah, Chris Evert — and is a completely immersive portrait of a grand sporting event. Klein spends as much time embedding you in the sights and sounds of the crowd as he does in the tennis matches themselves, and the result is one of the greatest sports documentaries ever made. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="tCpB86"><strong>The sport:</strong> Ice hockey</p>
<p id="eQxvVH"><strong>The movie:</strong> Many sports have specialized roles, but hockey is unique — many teams have enforcers, aka “goons,” who are basically there to strategically get into fights with opposing players. <em>Goon </em>tells the story of one such enforcer, Doug Glatt (Seann William Scott), a very sweet but not very bright young man who gets signed by a team after attending a game as a fan and winning a fight against a homophobic player who climbed into the stands. The movie is based on the book <em>Goon: The True Story of an Unlikely Journey into Minor League Hockey</em>, written by Adam Frattasio and Doug Smith (who the Glatt character is based on).</p>
<p id="ldjSEe"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> Scott’s affecting performance brings a lot of heart to what could have otherwise been a pretty flat character, and <em>Goon </em>hits a great balance of sports comedy and sports drama. <em>—PV</em></p>

<p id="aEqRX6"><strong>The sport:</strong> Figure skating</p>
<p id="ogHsFT"><strong>The movie:</strong> 2017’s <em>I, Tonya</em> tells the true — and at the time, notorious — story of Tonya Harding, an ice skating prodigy from the wrong side of the tracks who became a tabloid sensation when she was implicated in a physical assault on her rival Nancy Kerrigan in the lead-up to the 1994 Winter Olympics.</p>
<p id="uugVEN"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> Director Craig Gillespie walks a tonal tightrope in <em>I, Tonya</em>, blending biopic, mockumentary, tabloid sauce, broad comedy, and <em>Fargo</em>-esque crime satire and threading it through with clearly unreliable narration from Harding (a fantastic Margot Robbie). It’s a fun, wild ride, but it’s secretly dead serious and compassionate about the fact that white trash like Harding, surrounded by idiots and snobs and bullied by her single mom (Allison Janney, also great), never had a chance in the first place. —<em>Oli Welsh</em></p>

<p id="IBiJE7"><strong>The sport:</strong> Soccer and Shaolin kung fu</p>
<p id="2jhxMc"><strong>The movie:</strong> Stephen Chow directs and stars in his 2001 Hong Kong sports comedy as a itinerant shaolin kung fu student who, after crossing paths with a disgraced ex-soccer player (Ng Man-tat), reconciles with his former fellow students to compete in a soccer tournament and spread the good word of Shaolin kung fu. The team eventually face off with Team Evil, a rival soccer team with their own formidable abilities, in an explosive, climactic match for the championship. —<em>Toussaint Egan</em></p>
<p id="I8qBo8"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> Chow is a master of over-the-top theatrics, slapstick physical humor, and fist-pumping action. It’s nearly impossible to go five minutes throughout its one-and-a-half-hour run time without being struck by a moment of ingenious non-sequitur comedy, be it impromptu Shaolin-themed karaoke cabaret, hilarious sight gags, or exhilarating action scenes. <em>Shaolin Soccer</em> marries the thrill of watching an underdog sports drama with the unrestrained frivolity and anything-goes chaos of a Looney Tunes cartoon.</p>

<p id="0OMIti"><strong>The sport:</strong> Ballroom dancing</p>
<p id="3bdrw0"><strong>The movie:</strong> Scott (Paul Mercurio) is the son of a ballroom dancing family and has been training for glory on the Australian scene since he was 6, but his flashy improvisations get the better of him, and he loses his partner. Shy Fran (Tara Morice) offers to replace her, and together they find something special — but the despotic conservatism of local ballroom impresario Barry Fife (Bill Hunter) stands in the way of their self-expression.</p>
<p id="7gJuaR"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> Baz Luhrmann’s 1992 debut film is a dazzling, full-hearted crowd-pleaser, somehow blending the grotesque countercultural stylings of John Waters with classical upbeat sports drama and sequined pop spectacle. Luhrmann’s fairy dust turns caricatures into real people and finds the glamour in the disreputable, poor, and weird fringes of Australian society — and, of course, the dancing rules. —<em>OW</em></p>

<p id="WOh7J1"><strong>The sport:</strong> Professional wrestling</p>
<p id="ARNuxE"><strong>The movie:</strong> A bittersweet 2008 tale of washed-up wrestler Randy “The Ram” Robinson (Mickey Rourke), who’s well past his hair-metal 1980s heyday but still wrestling in small promotions on the weekends while he scrabbles out a lonely trailer-park life. He courts a stripper called Cassidy (Marisa Tomei), seeks reconnection with his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood), and contemplates one last big match-up with his old nemesis, The Ayatollah, before his body fails him completely.</p>
<p id="Z2WtJq"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> <em>The Wrestler </em>is a shabby, tender, and uncharacteristically naturalistic film from director Darren Aronofsky (<em>Requiem for a Dream, Mother!</em>). The reason to watch it is Mickey Rourke, himself an ’80s heartthrob who went off the rails, who’s poignantly cast as the “broken-down piece of meat” Randy. It’s a moving performance that takes the film to places you both do and don’t expect, right up to its moving yet ambivalent final frames. —<em>OW </em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doctor-who-has-everything-in-the-right-place-but-still-feels-disjointed.885156/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/doctor-who-has-everything-in-the-right-place-but-still-feels-disjointed/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=doctor-who-has-everything-in-the-right-place-but-still-feels-disjointed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="323" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">For as long as I can remember, I’ve been a fan of <em>Doctor Who</em>. It was a staple of Saturday nights growing up, when I’d be on the edge of my seat taking in old reruns, and I have been watching the latest generation since it began in 2005. However, season 14 feels alien, and not in the usual <em>Doctor Who</em> kind of way.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">It’s not because of Ncuti Gatwa or Millie Gibson, that much I can be certain of. They are both undeniably talented actors in their own right, and they’re doing the best they can with what they’ve been given. Even in “73 Yards,” Gibson shines in her role as a companion who has lost their Doctor and must face strange goings on alone.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Disney Plus</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">It’s not because I’m in the UK and forced to wait until midnight to see a new episode either, although I definitely felt a little put out when that was first revealed to be the case. Like most <em>Doctor Who</em> fans here in the UK, I adapted to watch the latest episode with breakfast every Saturday while avoiding social media, for fear of spoilers from those who got to see it before me.</p> <h2 id="h-keeping-the-pace" data-injectable="false">Keeping the pace</h2> <p data-characters="527" data-current-count="913" data-injectable="true">The first, and possibly most damaging reason that season fourteen feels strange is the pacing. Historically, <em>Doctor Who</em> has had between 12 to 14 episodes per season, not including Christmas or other specials, with an average run time per episode of around 50 minutes. Season 14, and I’m unsure who thought this would be a good idea, has been cut down to 8 episodes. Where we’d usually be barely over a quarter of the way through a season by this point, we’re now halfway through, and not much has actually happened.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">Some things in <em>Doctor Who</em> are bound to change. There’s been a constant turnover of showrunners and we are, of course, on the fifteenth iteration of the Doctor (as long as you don’t count the outliers like the Fugitive Doctor or Doctor Donna), so viewers are absolutely used to change. What we aren’t used to is the Doctor seeming so unlike himself, and the major overarching story feeling overlooked in favor of standalone tales which don’t add to anything in the grand scheme.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Disney Plus</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true">Why isn’t the Doctor acting like himself? His Sonic device appears to have been forgotten, feeling like just a weight in his pocket at this point. Across the four episodes of this season so far, we’ve seen it used twice – once in “Space Babies” to recalibrate the ship, and again in “The Devil’s Chord” to seemingly mute Maestro’s tuning fork.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="651" data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true">It was nowhere to be seen when the Doctor sprinted onto an unknown, war-torn planet, not even to scan the surroundings for danger, and it didn’t even seem like a fleeting thought when he was trapped on a landmine. It’s not as if he had to use it himself, which would make sense considering how sensitive the landmine was to the smallest of changes. We’ve seen former companions use the Sonic Screwdriver, such as when Dan used it to bring the train to a halt in “The Power of the Doctor.” On top of this, I don’t even remember what the inside of the TARDIS looks like at this point, because we only ever get to see the doors.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">My second gripe, which I already know will prove to upset some people, is the writing. I know that both Russell T Davies and Steven Moffat have become synonymous with <em>Doctor Who</em> at this point and, in the past, I have loved their writing. Moffat is responsible for the Weeping Angels and Russell T Davies was showrunner during the David Tennant era of the Doctor. However, I’m wondering what his plan is here.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Netflix</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-finding-a-bearing" data-injectable="false">Finding a bearing</h2> <p data-characters="524" data-current-count="824" data-injectable="true">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/sci-fi/dot-and-bubble-doctor-who-first-look-newsupdate/">Radio Times</a>, Davies described “Dot and Bubble,” the next episode set to be released on May 31, as the “most Black Mirror-like episode yet.” However, he goes on to say that it is still quintessentially Doctor Who, his comment worries me. Black Mirror is an anthology series, consisting of entirely separated stories with little overarching plot to explain. If Davies draws inspiration from the well of Charlie Brooker, that may explain why things feel a little disjointed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">My thoughts are echoed by the viewing figures for this season. I only have the statistics for UK viewers, either live on BBC One or through BBC iPlayer to go off, but currently the most viewed episode of the season, “Space Babies,” had 4.01 million viewers. This number is steadily declining and, when compared with the 7.49 million viewers who tuned in for “The Church on Ruby Road,” it’s a worrying trend even without comparing to previous seasons.</p>
 <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">Without any resolution, fans have begun to look for answers in the strangest of places. There are dozens of fan theories out there and, admittedly, a lot of them would make sense. One theory suggests that Ruby may be the <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGe4tTLre/">daughter of River Song</a>. Another suggests that the Doctor is actually <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@punishedvenomcasey/video/7369637307193888043?_r=1&amp;_t=8mixvv6k46M">part of the Pantheon</a>, alongside The Toymaker and Maestro. At first glance these seem like whacky theories, but fans are clinging to them, desperate for any kind of answers.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="762" data-injectable="true">You might be asking yourself why I’m still watching if I’m not enjoying the current season. Honestly? I’ve asked myself the same question and the answer is 75% hope, 25% sunk cost fallacy. I’m clinging to the possibility of things coming together, though I’m expecting to have to wait until the Christmas special for any kind of resolution, with Ruby being a Christmas baby. Besides, if I give up now, the answers might come and I’ll miss them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">On top of everything, I’m hoping that I’m wrong. I would love for this article to be entirely irrelevant in three weeks time, with questions having been answered and loose ends tied up. I want the story to progress to a point where things start to make sense. The one thing we do know about the overarching story is the involvement of the Pantheon of Discord, which is where a lot of my hope is coming from.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via BBC</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true">The Pantheon has four currently known members – Toymaker, Maestro, The Trickster, and Hecuba. The Toymaker plays games, Maestro messes with music, The Trickster can bend reality, and Hecuba can bend time at will. All of these characters, together, could provide the answers to so many questions that are currently left without resolution. </p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">Without that, though, I fear that <em>Doctor Who</em> will end the same way that Space Babies did – flying off into space as a giant fart that viewers can’t wait to forget.&nbsp;I’m waiting for the twist at the end, and I really hope it proves me wrong.</p>

<p data-characters="279" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a></em> is an RPG-lite. It includes leveling, but each time you hit a new level, you are given the choice of three stats to upgrade. That’s still quite the commitment with huge consequences. So, which ones should you pick for maximum efficiency?</p> <p data-characters="33" data-current-count="33" data-injectable="false">For clarity, the three stats are:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="153" data-injectable="false"> <li>HP: Health points for how much damage you can take.</li> <li>FP: Flower points used for abilities</li> <li>BP: Badge points used for equipping badges.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="81" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">FP and HP rise 5 points, while BP rises 3 points when selected during a level-up.</p> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="521" data-injectable="true">For obvious reasons, you need FP. Unless you are just going to keep on downing honey to use your skills, you’ll want some sort of stockpile. You might think that HP is also important, but probably not as much as you think. That’s because, in truth, <strong>BP gives you the most flexibility</strong>.</p>
 <p data-characters="404" data-current-count="404" data-injectable="true">Backing up for a moment, the first three times you level up, you don’t have many options for badges. The most helpful ones come a little bit later in the game. An early investment in BP isn’t the worst idea, but it would be better spent elsewhere. To be more specific, <strong>I’d advise spending one or two levels upgrading your FP</strong>. The amount you start with doesn’t allow for the use of many abilities.</p>
 <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true">However, once you get up there in levels, BP is the best place to focus your points. Keep in mind that your attack power and skills don’t increase with each level. Beyond getting new shoes and an updated hammer, <strong>badges are the only way to increase your damage output</strong>. It’s also the best way to improve your defense. You can even double-up badges to further increase their effectiveness. You can also get more badges by using Ms. Mowz to steal them from enemies who are holding items in battle.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">While badges are important, you probably don’t want to entirely neglect your HP and FP. Some players recommend doing an alternating pattern of HP, BP, FP, BP, HP, BP, and so on. However, <strong>I found that once I hit around 25 or 30 points in HP and FP, that was enough for most of the game</strong>. Everything else I mostly put into BP.</p> <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">Then, it’s a matter of finding the best badges and equipping them. There are plenty of both attack and defense badges (Power Plus and Defend Plus), and you can stack ability badges on top of each other to increase their strength. The important thing is that you have enough Badge Points to hold them, so that’s why investing in BP is so useful. It lets you adapt more readily.</p>
 <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="false">If you find your build isn’t working well (or if you discovered this guide several levels in and it makes sense to you), then you can <strong>talk to Chet Rippo after Chapter 5 to re-allocate your points</strong>. He’s found beneath Rogueport. Take the pipe down from in front of Professor Frankly’s house and use Bobbery to blow open the cracked wall. Go down that pipe and talk to Chet Rippo. He’ll reallocate points for 39 coins each.</p>

            <p>Bethesda's Todd Howard has called Fallout's recent renaissance "beyond anything [he's] ever seen in [his] 30 years of doing this".</p>
<p>This renewed interest in the series all came about thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-the-essence-of-fallout-and-does-the-tv-show-live-up-to-it">Amazon's Fallout adaptation</a>. The show's success - which saw<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks"> 65 million viewers</a> tuning in in its first 16 days of release - led to droves of players venturing into one or many of Fallout's wastelands, to find out what delights were in store.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-currently-europes-best-selling-game-almost-a-decade-after-release">Fallout 4 actually became the best selling game in Europe</a> at one point in April, despite having been out for almost a decade. Meanwhile, earlier today, it was announced that Fallout 76 has now welcomed 20 million total players, several years after its initial release.</p>

<p>"Depending on the Fallout game, you're looking at a 4-6x increase in daily players," Howard said to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/fallout-76-20-million-players-tv-series-new-games-bethesda-studios-1236018945/">Variety</a>, reflecting on this latest number. "Having an event that brings that many people into games that you have and who have never played your games before, that's a big thing. New players who have never played a game or never played one of our games.</p>
<p>"It's a really, really unique moment."</p> <div>

<p>Meanwhile, on the newly-minted TV side of the franchise, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">Amazon's Fallout was officially announced to be getting a second season</a> soon after series one made its debut. At this time, Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy - who executive produce the show via Kilter Films - said they "can't wait to blow up the world all over again".</p>
<p>Speaking on this upcoming second season, Howard confirmed the current plan is to follow the same characters we met in season one. "The one thing about TV that Jonah told me from Day One is it's about finding the characters. And I think it's really awesome how these characters have resonated with the audience," Howard said.</p>
<p>"And so I think there's still stories to tell there. There's so many great characters - I love Norm and Chet, I love the two of them in every scene. And obviously we have the Ghoul and Lucy and Maximus. But there's so many great characters that have a lot of stories left to tell."</p>

  <p id="fVzhKS">For a story about someone who can cheat time, the timing of <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em> could not be more unfortunate.</p>
<p id="bjdIR9">Amid the release of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24033589/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-ubisoft-switch"><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em></a> in January of this year, as well as the much more recent surprise launch of roguelite phenomenon <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24147392/hades-2-early-access-release-date-how-to-play"><em>Hades 2</em></a> in Steam Early Access — the latter of which actually resulted in developer Evil Empire <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24153672/rogue-prince-of-persia-hades-2-release-date-delay">delaying</a> this game’s original May 14 release — <em>Rogue</em> finds itself on uneven ground. What could have been a fresh and promising spinoff for a franchise that had been dormant for years now has to unfairly share the spotlight, facing sky-high expectations and inevitable comparisons to not only its surrounding peers, but <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24126419/rogue-prince-of-persia-dead-cells-evil-empire-reveal">the studio’s own legacy</a> as the support team for <em>Dead Cells</em>.</p>
<p id="5BmKVf">Released in Steam Early Access on May 27, <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em> marries Ubisoft’s popular franchise with the institutional knowledge of Evil Empire around the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/23313023/best-roguelikes-on-nintendo-switch-steam-playstation-xbox-pc">roguelite</a> genre. In the 2D roguelite, Persia is attacked by a Hun army, a nomadic group wielding dark magic. Thanks to an artifact in his possession, the Prince can travel back in time whenever he’s about to meet his demise, ready to dash through another attempt to stop the invasion.</p>

<p id="4QuoNv">During the tutorial, it doesn’t take long to see how Evil Empire is sprinkling Prince of Persia flair into a scaled-down action platformer. As you navigate a series of procedurally generated 2D biomes, you’re free to wall-run horizontally and vertically on any suitable structure in the background. You can also vault over enemies (yes, this was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=427GbpLiNoY">inspired</a> by <em>The</em> <em>Sands of Time</em>), perform a kick, and do a dive attack from midair — which isn’t as aggressively snappy as <em>Dead Cells</em>’ ground pound, but it still feels quite satisfactory.</p>
<p id="I7qQ3F">Each of these actions has a simple mechanical purpose with some additional benefits if used in the right scenario. The kick is great for interrupting attacks or just throwing somebody toward the nearest trap or cliff. It can also stun enemies if they hit a wall or a fellow Hun, producing a ripple effect. If the second target has a shield and gets hit, this action automatically removes that shield; the same can be accomplished with the dive attack. Once you get used to the Prince’s acrobatic actions, getting from point A to B in a biome feels like speedrunning an obstacle course.</p>
<p id="hotUjE">It’s unfortunate, then, that <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em> doesn’t offer much of a challenge once you’ve mastered these movements. There are platforming sections reminiscent of the franchise’s roots, but they don’t require perfect precision. Enemies seem often at a disadvantage around the Prince’s traversal. Toward the end of my playthrough of the current build, I was able to remain untouched for almost the entirety of a run. Getting to this point does feel rewarding. The current early access build, however, makes that thrill short-lived.</p>

<p id="K4ao8M">During the first week of release, there are six biomes and two bosses available. It took me six hours to reach the “end” of the current build, and everything basically stopped in its tracks once I did. The oasis to which the Prince returns after each death serves as a hub to unlock items for subsequent runs, as well as the occasional chat with characters. Once I defeated the second boss, they all ceased offering conversations. There’s a so-called Mind Map that registers key story details, gradually mapping a detective board of sorts. First impressions of this mechanic seem promising, especially when a “clue” leads you to take a different route just to talk to a specific NPC and unlock an item to progress — an interesting method of providing story-led structure to a roguelite. But with only a few events available at the moment, it still feels like a first draft.</p>
<p id="5jQUvo">The same sentiment encapsulates my experience with <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em> as a whole. Even Evil Empire has acknowledged this within 24 hours of the launch, in response to the community’s feedback. “We’re not here to do a final sense check on a 90% finished game and replace some placeholder art,” reads a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2717880/eventcomments/4335356696603111755">Steam post</a> by the studio, “nor are we a finished game with years of post-1.0 support. Our plan is to at least double the amount of content in the game, by providing weekly content updates where we work closely with the community.”</p>
<p id="zAhOWo">When I reviewed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1371980/No_Rest_for_the_Wicked/"><em>No Rest for the Wicked</em></a> earlier this year, I was surprised at what is considered a “work in progress” in Steam Early Access, as the build was big enough to be its own thing already. <em>Rogue</em> is much smaller in scope and had a significantly shorter development time. But the foundation is there already. I just can’t help but wonder if, aside from the model it’s being built around, <em>Rogue</em> was released earlier than it should have been. I don’t see how churning out weekly updates, which Evil Empire sees as an “experiment,” is the answer to keep up with expectations.</p>

<p id="MzAQme">The second Prince of Persia spinoff of 2024 is riddled with phantoms. In an interview with Edge Magazine, reposted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/the-prince-of-persia-roguelike-had-to-change-its-story-because-of-the-prince-of-persia-metroidvania-and-was-forbidden-from-using-an-iconic-weapon/">GamesRadar</a>, game director Lucie Dewagnier said Evil Empire “needed to change things” due to <em>The Lost Crown</em>. According to <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/04/10/we-played-the-rogue-lite-prince-of-persia-from-the-co-developer-of-dead-cells">Game Informer</a>, both teams were in touch from the beginning to avoid “making the same decision and making the same game” along the course of development.</p>
<p id="qNsTqd">Despite that open line of communication between the teams, there are still some undeniable similarities between <em>Rogue</em> and <em>The Lost Crown</em>. Both games shared the same conceptual mission — a spinoff that would awaken the Prince of Persia name from slumber, especially with the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23736045/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delay-reboot"><em>Sands of Time</em> remake</a> still MIA. They also happen to be 2D action platformers in a year that has a glut of them (<em>Ultros</em>,<em> Pepper Grinder</em>, <em>Nine Sols</em>, and more). It’s a different scenario than the one surrounding <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/6/13/18677696/cadence-of-hyrule-review-zelda-necrodancer"><em>Cadence of Hyrule</em></a>, for example, a spinoff by the <em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em> studio that still managed to stand out and have a spotlight period before <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/9/19/20870437/zelda-links-awakening-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em></a> was released three months later.</p>
<p id="q3XiyV">Likewise, pitting <em>Rogue </em>against <em>Hades 2</em> — a sequel that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hades-2s-surprise-early-access-release-already-has-more-stuff-in-it-than-the-first-game/">already</a> has more environments, enemies, and voiced characters in early access than the full version of the first game did when its 1.0 version launched — is an uneven comparison, to say the least. And yet Evil Empire delayed its game in the light of <em>Hades 2</em>’s release. </p>

<p id="SCC8Ge">Then there’s Evil Empire’s legacy as a studio. Few people will remember the start of <em>Dead Cells</em> in early access back in 2017, with only a handful of biomes and mechanics still in the conception phase. Instead, the expectations for <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia </em>are clouded by the present, with <em>Dead Cells</em> fans picturing the fully formed roguelite hit that sold over <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/dead-cells-has-topped-10-million-sales-worldwide">10 million copies</a>. Seven years later, the roguelite genre as a whole seems to be at a saturation point, which doesn’t help. Three Sony first-party games — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22408761/returnal-review-ps5-housemarque"><em>Returnal</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24001843/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-review-roguelite-free-dlc"><em>God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24036476/the-last-of-us-part-2s-roguelike-mode"><em>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</em></a> — did their own spin on the genre, while an increasing number of studios are betting on sequels (see <em>Slay the Spire</em>,<em> Darkest Dungeon</em>, and <em>Spelunky</em>, to name a few) rather than new games altogether.</p>
<p id="ZS1pbX">Saying that Evil Empire is dealing with unfavorable odds would be an understatement. After my short time with its new roguelite, however, I still can’t wait to see where <em>Rogue</em> goes from here. I’m intrigued to see how its promising ideas are developed, regardless of how many more of its genre come out prior to the release of its 1.0 version. Let’s just hope Ubisoft doesn’t launch another Prince of Persia game that same year. </p>

<p data-characters="153" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Having a clear idea about the best <em>EA FC 24</em> playstyles is incredibly beneficial for any player, irrespective of the game mode you’re planning for. </p> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false">Playstyles were introduced with <em>EA FC 24</em> and have become a fan-favorite feature. EA Sports removed the older traits system and iterated on it with this new system that impacts how a footballer behaves. Naturally, every position has certain playstyles that work better; knowing them will help you dominate the in-game meta and win more matches.</p> <h2 id="h-top-3-ea-fc-24-playstyles-for-every-position" data-injectable="false">Top 3 <em>EA FC 24 </em>playstyles for every position</h2> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">Ideally, some positions do have more than three great choices when it comes to <em>EA FC 24</em> playstyles. However, I have narrowed them down to the top three options. Do note that goalkeepers don’t have playstyle+, so I have ignored them. Playstyles on a goalkeeper seem pretty redundant (only EA Sports knows why it’s like that).</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true"> <li>RB/LB: Jockey, Whipped Pass, Intercept/Anticipate</li> <li>CB: Anticipate, Intercept, Jockey (Aerial in Div.1 or higher)</li> <li>RWB/LWB: Whipped Pass, Jockey, Rapid</li> <li>CDM: Anticipate, Intercept, Pinged Pass (Tiki Taka if the midfielder has H/H work rates)</li> <li>CM: Pinged Pass, Long Ball Pass, Tiki Taka/Incisive Pass</li> <li>RM/LM: Rapid/Quick Step, Pinged Pass, Technical</li> <li>RW/LW: Rapid/Quick Step, Finesse Shot, Technical</li> <li>CAM: Incisive Pass, Finesse Shot, Technical</li> <li>ST/CF: Finesse Shot, Technical, First Touch</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">Now, there are some exceptions to this list of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-do-power-shot-in-ea-fc-24/">EA FC 24</a></em> playstyles. In the current meta, a lot of goals are being scored from headers. Suddenly, the Power Header and Aerial have become a hot favorite of the community. However, only use cards with these playstyles if you want to play with crosses and aerial long balls. The Long Ball Pass playstyle is also very useful in this particular meta.</p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="691" data-injectable="true">When it comes to <em>EA FC 24</em> Playstyles, Trivela, Trickster, and Power Shot can be pretty unique choices. As helpful as these playstyles are, not everyone can use them efficiently. The Trivela playstyle, in particular, is more important than ever if you want to score from shots with the outside foot.</p>
 <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false">Almost all new cards coming to Ultimate Team now have triple <em>EA FC 24</em> Playstyles. Some of those include the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-henrikh-mkhitaryan-tots-sbc-solutions-tasks/">Henrikh Mkhitaryan Serie A TOTS SBC</a>, or you can opt for the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-trinity-rodman-tots-sbc-cheapest-solutions/">Trinity Rodman TOTS</a> (much more meta).</p>

            <p>A Just Cause movie is in on the way.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/just-cause-movie-in-the-works-1235910913/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the movie – based on Square Enix and Avalanche Studios' action series – will be led by Blue Bettle director Ángel Manuel Soto, and produced by Kelly McCormick and David Leitch, who also produced The Fall Guy.</p>

<p>Story Kitchen's Dmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg, and Timothy I. Stevenson – who also worked on the movie adaptations of Tomb Raider and Sonic the Hedgehog – are also on board. Dan Jevons joins the project as executive producer.</p>
<p>THR says Universal "jumped at the chance for the adaptation", as "the studio sees the title as part of the rising wave of video game adaptations that seem to be supplanting the superhero genre at the box office", pointing out that the studio's The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Five Nights at Freddy’s movies grossed over $1.4 billion and $290 million respectively in the global box office.</p>
<p>Sadly, there's no further information on who will write the movie or star in it, but as always, we'll keep you posted. Hopefully this project will fare better that prior attempts to bring Just Cause to the big screen; as noted by THR, Constantin Film "spent the better part of a decade" trying to get a movie made "before the rights eventually lapsed".

</p><p>ICYMI, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-being-made-in-close-collaboration-with-the-true-genius-of-miyamoto">live-action adaptation of The Legend of Zelda is being developed in "as closest possible collaboration"</a> with the "true genius" of Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto.</p>
<p>Sony Motion Pictures Group chair Tom Rothman recently stressed the importance of "big IP movies" for the company, asserting that "The Legend of Zelda is going to be huge for us".</p>
