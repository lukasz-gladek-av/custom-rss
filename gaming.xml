            <p>Attention, folks who like the idea of flinging a fire-breathing Group B monster down some dirt tracks. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assetto-corsa">Assetto Corsa</a> devs Kunos are bringing out a rally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a>. It's called Assetto Corsa Rally, therefore instantly winning the inventive video game name award for this year.</p>
<p>As with road racing AC successor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assetto-corsa-evo-motors-into-multiplayer-racing-for-the-first-time-in-its-latest-early-access-update">Assetto Corsa EVO</a>, the studio and co-developers Supernova Games Studios have opted to go the Steam early access route for this selection of Scandinavian flicks, with a release penned in for November November 13 this year.</p>

<p>"Feeling the lack of a modern rally simulator, we’ve built a team and developed a technology to create one ourselves, with the support of drivers, engineers, collectors, mechanics, and industry experts," Supernova studio director Mauro Notarberardino said in the game's <a href="https://assettocorsa.gg/assetto-corsa-rally-wishlist-now-on-steam/">announcement post</a>. "A special thanks goes to Kunos Simulazioni, whose partnership was crucial in maintaining the signature feel of the series — especially in terms of the driving model — in this new chapter."</p><p>I can't help but read that first bit as pointing straight to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-arent-making-any-more-rally-games-but-there-are-alternatives">EA "pausing" development on future rally sims</a> at Codemasters earlier this year, leaving a DIRTy great Colin McRae-adjacent gap in the market the studio had regularly filled for 25 years or so. Naturally, as Brendy pointed out at the time, there are plenty of other great rally games out there to help fill the hole, but few offer the kind of in-depth realism of a cutting-edge sim.</p>
<p>As for what Assetto Corsa Rally will offer, Kunos and Supernova promise laser-scanned stages faithfully mirroring real life counterparts, the use of Assetto Corsa's physics engine to render everything from surfaces to weather, and cars ranging from 60s and 70s classics to modern trail blazers. At early access launch, there'll be ten rides including the likes of the Lancia Stratos and Rally2 class Hyundai i20N. The screenshots also include a Group B Lancia 037, a Seb Loeby early 2000s Citroen Xsara, and a 90s Delta. Stages on Welsh gravel and French tarmac will be on offer out of the gate.</p>
<p>By the time of full release, which the Steam page outlines is aiming to come in "less than 18 months", the studios' goal is to have five different rallies and a roster of over 30 cars up and running. The likes of a driving school and career mode are also planned. As a number of players have <a href="https://x.com/AC_assettocorsa/status/1979095945531797808">pointed out</a> in response to the announcement, it's a lot to take on while Kunos still have Assetto Corsa EVO in paid early access and in need of more additions before its 1.0 release. That said, the fact AC Rally's being co-developed is enough for me not to be too concerned, at least at this point.</p>
<p>You can wishlist Assetto Corsa Rally via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3917090/Assetto_Corsa_Rally/">Steam page</a>, if you're so inclined.</p>

              <p>Three days ago <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-sale-discount-everwild-leak-helldivers-performance-2000635349">Ubisoft announced</a> that <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>head honcho&nbsp;Marc-Alexis Côté was leaving the company. “Marc-Alexis Côté has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft,” said a spokesperson at the time. Except, now Côté is insisting that’s not how it went down, and that he was in fact “asked to step aside.”</p> <p>Marc-Alexis Côté has been running everything <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> for almost two decades, overseeing a vast number of games in the enormous franchise. But it’s also been a tumultuous time of change for the cash-strapped Ubisoft, leading to March’s announcement of a major <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796">business relationship with Tencent</a>, in which the French company took a $1.25 billion bailout from the Chinese firm. This led to the announcement of a new co-owned subsidiary that would take over the production of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, eventually announced a couple of weeks back as Vantage Studios. The joint-owned venture was created to take over the running of the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise, its name revealed just a couple of weeks ago. This week, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/i-did-not-walk-away-former-assassins-creed-boss-says-he-didnt-resign-he-was-asked-to-step-aside-by-ubisoft/">according to&nbsp;<em>VGC</em></a>, an internal memo was sent to staff from Vantage’s co-CEOs Charlie Guillemot and Christophe Derennes stating that Côté was “offered a role as part of Vantage Studios’ leadership, but declined.”</p>

 <p>“Following the organizational restructuring announced in March 2025,” <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft">Ubisoft told&nbsp;<em>IGN</em> in a statement</a>, “Marc-Alexis Côté has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft. While we are saddened to see him go, we’re confident that our talented teams will carry forward the strong foundation he helped build.”</p>

 <p>But Côté has now <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7384672277055012864/">taken to his LinkedIn page</a> to claim a very different version of events. “The past 24 hours have been deeply emotional,” his statement begins, sharing that people’s messages sent to him have meant a great deal. However, he noted that a recurring theme in those messages was people’s surprise that he had “chosen” to leave <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, “especially given the passion I still hold for it.” Except, he says, that’s not what happened. “The truth is simple: I did not make that choice.”</p>

 <p>Reading between the lines of Côté’s post, it seems that the role he was offered by Ubisoft was far more like a demotion. “Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin’s Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure,” said the former boss. “A different position was mentioned, but it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work I had been entrusted with in recent years.”</p>

 <p>Insisting he holds no resentment, and still greatly values his time at Ubisoft, Côté is unequivocal in his position:</p> <blockquote><p>“I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly:<br> I did not walk away.<br> I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside.”</p></blockquote> <p>Often when long-term leadership are let go companies will issue statements suggesting it was all amicable, not just to save face, but to offer the person leaving the dignity of not looking like they were fired. And it seems technically true that as staff were told, he&nbsp;<em>was</em> offered a leadership role, just one that wasn’t the job he’d had for 20 years and wanted to continue.</p> <p>Similarly, Ubisoft’s statement to&nbsp;<em>IGN</em> isn’t an outright lie, but just ambiguous enough to suggest the decision was Côté’s rather than its own. It’s true that after not wanting to take a likely demotion he <em>did</em> “chose to pursue a new path elsewhere,” but it’s clearly designed to make everything seem a lot more amicable and positive than it seems it really was. And the consequence of that certainly didn’t work out in Côté’s favor.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals has a brand new surprise for the players, arriving in the form of the first-ever PvE Zombies mode on October 23, 2025.</p>



<p>Season 5 of Marvel Rivals is scheduled to arrive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-marvel-rivals-season-5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on November 14</a>, bringing Gambit and Rogue into the mix. Ahead of that, the developers have one last new update for players in season 4.5, bringing some PvE fun into the mix. The upcoming game mode is inspired by the animated series Marvel Zombies. </p>



<h2 id="h-slay-zombies-in-marvel-rivals-from-october-23">Slay Zombies in Marvel Rivals From October 23</h2>



<p>Through a new post on the official Marvel Rivals <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1979053687340408847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), the executive producer at Marvel Games, Danny Koo, spoke more about the upcoming PvE Zombies mode. The new Marvel Zombies-inspired mode lets players embody one of 5 playable characters —Thor, Blade, Magik, Jeff, or The Punisher —as they face off against endless hordes of zombies. Surviving is the goal until you can test your might against the two bosses, Zombie Namor and Queen of the Dead. </p>



<p>To take on this new threat, the developers have also granted each of the five heroes new abilities. Jeff can charge through the hordes, Blade can slice and dice through the bouncing Moon Blades, Thor gets a persistent Awakened State to shock more zombies, and Magik is getting an unlimited Darkchild form. The post also included a sneak peek of the Marvel Rivals PvE Zombies mode gameplay, featuring the 5-hero squad being ambushed by zombies from every angle, but still holding their ground. </p>

Many fans blamed the uneven final season on the series' creators running out of book material to adapt, while others have suggested the series simply tried to do too much in too few episodes. Regardless, it has become a model that other series, clearly, do not want to follow.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think everyone was pretty worried, honestly," Wolfhard said.  "The way that Game of Thrones got torn to shreds in that final season, we're all walking into this going, 'We hope to not have that kind of thing happen.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not that Wolfhard is suggesting Stranger Things will wrap up its own run with a similarly polarizing finale — far from it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Then we read the scripts," Wolfhard continued, saying that the show's cast now felt reassured.

We completely understand the motivation behind this, like faster progression and a way to test setups without pressure, but it’s led to some unintended side effects. With so many servers focused on farming XP rather than active play, it’s become noticeably harder for players to create and find experiences to play with other people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Experiences in the Community section is a key part of what makes Battlefield 6 special. It’s meant to be a space for creativity, experimentation, and connection, where you can easily find and enjoy great modes with your friends and squadmates. Our goal moving forward here is to reinforce the player-driven experiences that bring people together, while still keeping room for custom setups, creativity, and new ideas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are developing adjustments that are intended to diminish the number of XP farms taking up server space while further emphasizing playing with friends on both custom and verified experiences.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s another quirky collaboration for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> players to enjoy, with The Digiverse expanding once again for the free Two Point Museum x Vampire Survivors update, and Update 6.0 in general.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum x Vampire Survivors Trailer | Free Update OUT NOW!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MVfdLuyo9eU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Digiverse is a part of the game that sees multiple rifts opening that you can send your curators through to explore, bringing back items to display in your museums. Following on from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2L_z9phxxw">Dredge</a> and the original creation Meat Wizard back in August, Vampire Survivor is bringing all manner of adventuring heroes and the quest to find vampires, any vampires, to the museums of Two Point County.</p>


<p>Alas, there’s no new museum map for you to play with, but the Digiverse opens up three new POIs at the Mad Forest, Inlaid Library and Capella Magna, with 10 new pixelly exhibits to find, including Spinach and Santa Water. There’s also a whole batch of new decorative items, wallpapers, and VIPs that might visit.</p>
<p>Here’s the full Update 6.0 patch notes:</p>

<p>These free updates are coming along with the first major expansion, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/08/two-point-museum-fantasy-finds-review/">Two Point Museum: Fantasy Finds</a>, arrived back in July. Laura had a grand time with this, saying, “Although Two Point Museum: Fantasy Finds doesn’t come with an accompanying fantasy museum, the new Scorched Earth expedition map, exciting newfangled exhibits, intriguing fantasy Expert subclasses and great array of extra features and unlockables makes it a fantastic excuse to re-visit your favourite Two Point game. As if you needed an excuse…”</p>

If you are fond of snake ladies, sea snakes and staffs that look like snakes, you'll likely be hypnotised by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>'s Tides of Torment DLC, which adds three Legendary Lords representing the High Elves, Slaanesh and Norsca.</p>
<p>Creative Assembly and Sega have just slapped a release date atop this serpentine assembly - 4th December. (PSA: Do not slap anything on real-life serpentine assemblies, unless you are a trained zoologist.) On that very same day, they're hosting a 25th anniversary showcase "unveiling what's next for the franchise".

Expect "new fantasy and historical project announcements, alongside commentary from the development teams shaping the future of Total War." Hopefully, one of the announcements will be that they've finally fixed Twarhammer 3's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3s-developers-are-fighting-to-fix-a-catastrophic-failure-in-many-of-our-ai-systems">currently rather broken AI</a>. No point adding snake ladies if they space out whenever they have to recruit people.
</p><p>
While Tides of Torment will demand a few of your moneybucks, the pack will land alongside some free tweakage and a new campaign for noted demon sexpest Slaanesh. The latter introduces a pirouetting Legendary Lord who once danced at Slaanesh in a sort of sarcastic way, and was accordingly cursed to jig and caper for all eternity. I wasn't aware it was possible to dance sarcastically. I wish I'd known this as a teen.
</p>
<p>
"Coming free as part of Patch 7.0 is the Masque of Slaanesh Legendary Lord, providing a brand-new campaign experience for the excess-driven forces of Slaanesh," Sega explain in <a href="https://sega.prezly.com/mark-your-calendars-for-december-4th-new-total-war-warhammer-content-arrives-alongside-the-25th-anniversary-showcase">their press release</a>. "Alongside her arrival, the High Elves, Slaanesh and Norsca will receive new legacy updates, allowing players to return to past campaigns and experience a host of new gameplay improvements."
</p>
<p>
Total War turning 25! It feels like only yesterday that I was defending Mikawa province against three factions simultaneously in the original Total War: Shogun. I'm not sure Twarhammer 3 players are in the mood for celebrating - the hitherto-popular <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>'s Steam user rating is still Mixed to Mostly Negative, as reviewers rage about everything from DLC pricing through the AI problems to Creative Assembly's communication. Still, perhaps we can fit in a hymn to the glory days alongside some criticism of the missteps.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 is receiving a new update within the next week, which will address progression pace and XP Leveling. </p>



<p>The launch of Battlefield 6 has shaken the gaming industry, with the new title rivalling the likes of Call of Duty launches. The game sold 7 million copies in the first 3 days, making it the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-biggest-launch-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest launch in series history</a>. However, there have been some minor issues at launch, such as progression and XP leveling, and fortunately, the developers are already addressing them in the next update. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-devs-acknowledge-progression-pace-issues">Battlefield 6 Devs Acknowledge Progression Pace Issues </h2>



<p>In a lengthy new post on the BattlefieldComms account on <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979107918185157116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the developers acknowledged the progression issues in Battlefield 6 and revealed how they will be addressing them. The developers understand that it’s taking way longer to unlock hardware, such as gadgets and weapon adjustments, and are making changes accordingly. </p>



<ul>
<li>Match completely and daily bonuses, XP has been increased by 10% and 40% respectively.</li>



<li>The XP a players need to unlock the first 20 attachment ranks has been reduced, with useful attachments arriving twice as fast.</li>



<li>Players should note that the UI for weapons that are already being progressed might show something “abnormal at first”, but will be resolved once players use that weapon in a match. </li>



<li>The assignments that required career ranks 20, 23, and 26 to begin will now require career ranks 10, 15, and 20, respectively.</li>



<li>The developers are aware of the “frustrations regarding the challenges themselves and are actively working on reviewing them.” However, this change will take longer to develop, test, and implement. </li>
</ul>



<p>The goal of Battlefield 6’s progression changes is to make the experience feel smoother and more rewarding while retaining the sense of achievement of fully mastering a weapon. The new update will go live within the next week or sooner, depending on testing and verification. The developers are also aware of concerns about visibility, weapon bloom, vehicles not spawning, and more, and will share more details when possible. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield Studios Announce Battlefield 6 Portal ‘XP Farms’ Will Soon be Patched]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-changes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-studios-announce-battlefield-6-portal-%E2%80%98xp-farms%E2%80%99-will-soon-be-patched.1327510/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield Studios has announced that it will soon be making changes to the Battlefield 6 Portal to reduce the amount of ‘XP farms’ in the game that have been taking up server capacity.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979107918185157116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a> on the official Battlefield Communication channel, it was stated that since the launch of Battlefield 6, the maximum capacity of the Battlefield 6 Portal servers has been consistently reached, which has been attributed to XP farms.</p>



<p>They said, “After reviewing the data, we found that a large number of these servers were created primarily to earn XP, inflate player stats, and earn special accolades through defeating bots. We completely understand the motivation behind this, like faster progression and a way to test setups without pressure, but it’s led to some unintended side effects. With so many servers focused on farming XP rather than active play, it’s become noticeably harder for players to create and find experiences to play with other people.”</p>



<p>As such, changes will soon be coming to Battlefield Portal, including changes to “diminish the number of XP farms taking up server space while further emphasizing playing with friends on both custom and verified experiences.”</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-portal-changes">Battlefield 6 Portal Changes</h2>



<p>It’s not entirely clear what the changes will be, but it’s likely to be an adjustment to the rate at which people earn XP in Battlefield Portal, meaning that they will be less likely to be used for XP farmers. </p>



<p>One change, though, could be the change that stats and accolades will no longer count towards your player stats, which has seen players artificially inflate their stats with absurd K/D ratios and more.</p>



<p>Presumably, however, the changes will be intended to incentivize people to transition to the core multiplayer experiences, as there will also be some progression updates to the game in this regard.</p>



<p>So for now, you should probably grind your weapons in Battlefield Portal before the changes coming in the coming days.</p>



<p>What do you think about the leveling system in Battlefield 6 at the moment? Do you think it’s too slow? Let us know over on the official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-we-played-%E2%80%93-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-keeper-ball-x-pit.1327501/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The nights are drawing in and it’s getting much colder in the UK, meaning that it’s the perfect time for playing video games, basking in the warmth of our OLED screens and heat being pumped out by your PC’s GPU. I’ve been playing a lot of games this week, including Jurassic World Evolution 3, Nascar 25, Hades II, Ball X Pit, Lumines Arise, Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch, while getting involved with my youngest son’s newfound obsession with Star Wars by playing Lego: The Skywalker Saga with him, <em>and</em> sneaking in a few matches in Battlefront II.</p>

<p>Keeping things much more controlled, Nic B has been playing Pokémon Z-A (or PukaPuka as his tiny son calls it) and while on review duties for us, he handed it a massive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/14/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/">10/10</a>. This seems pretty good, if he’s to be trusted.</p>
<p>Next up, Aran has played a couple of games for review, including Keeper and Lumo 2. That’s all he’s allowed to say right now, but you won’t have too long to wait before those review embargoes lift. A matter of hours, even!</p>
<p>Jim has been fully hooked on Ghost of Yotei this week, freely exploring its gorgeous open world and ticking off the odd bounty and side quest as he goes. He told us, “I’m glad to report that the combat is becoming more varied and challenging. Atsu is also growing on me, though it’s fair to say that the true main character is the location. Easily the best-looking game of the year.</p>

<p>“I randomly installed a mobile game called SOVL, too. It feels like a fan-made video game adaptation of the Warhammer Fantasy tabletop game, and it works incredibly well. Makes you wonder why Games Workshop haven’t tried something similar, in the same way that Wizards digitised MTG with Magic Arena.”</p>

<p>Ade has been on with Hades 2 this week, crushing the underworld run but finding that defeating the end boss on the surface still eludes him. He says, “It’s been an absolutely stonking year for video game releases, but, so far, Hades 2 is definitely my favourite!”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gamoc has been playing The Outer Worlds 2 for review, plus Rise of Industry and Dreams of Another. Once again, you’ve got to wait for those pesky embargoes to find out more.</p>
<p>Jason has uninstalled Ball X Pit “to save myself”, but he did at least wait until he’d fully 100%-ed it.&nbsp;Other than that, he’s been mucking around in Fellowship too, saying ” It is basically what you’d get if an MMO was designed for people who had responsibilities.”</p>

<p>And finally, Tef has been keeping up with Battlefield 6, dipping in for a few matches most days and plugging away at challenges. More interesting, though, has been dipping into a few Next Fest demoes. He wrote about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/16/you-should-play-the-demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-demo/">Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</a> already, and he’s giving Star Trek: Voyager – Across the Unknown a try today as well.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a>'s offline mode is now live, ensuring that the racer "remains accessible for years to come". Well, assuming you're not bothered about playing online, which would still be deep-sixed if Ubisoft opted to shut down the game's servers, as they did with its predecessor. Odds are that won't happen at least in the immediate future, due to the player feedback the publishers have credited as the impetus behind this addition.</p>
<p>That acknowledgement very much looks to be a way of nodding to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-stop-killing-games-supported-eu-petition-now-closed-the-campaigns-loudest-voice-reckons-its-done-about-as-well-as-is-humanly-possible">Stop Killing Games campaign</a>, who rose to prominence following Ubisoft's shutdown of  <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/motoring-mmo-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-making-it-impossible-to-play">the first Crew's servers</a> - thereby rendering it totally unplayable - without naming them directly.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/the-crew/the-crew-2/news-updates/zs6ZFyLEQvKbFskEJZolR">offline mode</a>, dubbed hybrid mode because cars, has taken a year to leave the garage following its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-adding-offline-modes-to-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-after-getting-savaged-over-junking-the-crew">announcement</a>. Jumping into The Crew 2 now sees you offered a choice as to whether you want to play online or offline, with the latter not boasting the mandatory internet connection which led <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a>'s shutdown to play out how it did.</p><p>As you might expect, playing offline's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-the-crew-2-as-a-single-player-game">rather stripped-back experience</a>, with the likes of the race creator, livery editor and custom liveries, leaderboards, ghosts, and the stats menu being sliced away in addition to the more obvious online bits. Any vehicle packs, season pass stuff, or Ubisoft Connect rewards you've bought or unlocked have to be claimed in a house or HQ in online mode before you can use them offline.</p>
<p>The online and offline modes have separate save systems, allowing you to carry online progress into offline play by exporting your online save to offline mode, but not letting you bring any progress you make while playing offline in the opposite direction. There's also a bit of reading to do in terms of how the switching between the two handles your in-game cash.</p>
<p>"When you choose Export to Offline Save, your current Crew Credits balance is included in the offline save file," Ubisoft wrote. "That offline balance can be used to purchase eligible items while playing in Offline Mode, for example, vehicles available in the offline catalogue. However, some items that are only purchasable via the online Crew Credits storefront (notably vanity items and some bundles) are not available in Offline Mode. If you purchase additional Crew Credits while online after exporting, you must re-export your Online Save to update your Offline Save and include the newly purchased credits."</p>
<p>An offline mode for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-motorfest">The Crew Motorfest</a>'s also in the works, but no updates have been offered as to when that'll arrive. Even if I doubt Ubisoft'd have done this without the Stop Killing Games campaign having put the series under a microscope, kudos to them for following through on promises to ensure the racers wouldn't be at risk of perma-shutdown in the future.</p><p>While it's been cool to see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/having-resurrected-the-crew-devs-behind-fan-revival-project-are-now-working-on-a-big-mod-to-restore-the-racer-to-greatness">The Crew Unlimited's modders resurrect the original Crew</a> with their server emulator, the onus to keep games people have paid for playable in the long run shouldn't solely be on the substantial efforts of dedicated volunteers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>From unexpected power outages that can leave your home in the dark to weekend camping trips where you still need to charge devices and run small appliances, these portable power stations deliver peace of mind when you need it most. Jackery’s Explorer 1000 has long been the bestseller in this category with its 1500W output but right now there’s a game-changing deal that changes everything: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4831/">much more powerful Jackery Explorer 2000 (2200W) just dropped to $799, down from $1,499, matching the original price of that classic Explorer 1000</a>. With $700 slashed off and hitting an all-time low, this is hands-down the smartest buy on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4831/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Favorite Power Generator</h2>
<p>Jackery Explorer 2000 boasts an <strong>impressive 2042Wh of capacity with three AC outlets that provide 2200W of continuous power</strong>. That means you’ve got the capability to power a full-size fridge for over 15 hours, your internet router and laptop during a blackout for days on end or <strong>charge your phone more than 150 times in a single recharge</strong>.</p>
<p>By virtue of having the 2200W output, you have the luxury of plugging power-hungry devices like microwaves, coffee makers or power tools with no fear of overloading. That <strong>USB-C PD 100W port</strong> comes in very convenient so you fast-charge laptops and tablets immediately without having to carry around big power strips. With this amount of capability, it’s perfect in home backup emergency applications, yet it’s also convenient in RV trips, tailgate parties or to power tools at remote construction job sites.</p>



<p>Despite only weighing 39.5 pounds, the <strong>Explorer 2000 is 41% lighter and 34% smaller</strong> compared to similar 2kWh lithium iron phosphate power stations. That weight disparity becomes enormous when you hoist it out of your garage and into your vehicle, or from vehicle to campsite. Jackery was able to do this with the application of CTB technology taken from the design of electric vehicles that mounts the battery cells internally into the structure itself.</p>
<p>Normal AC charging <strong>gets the battery from dead to 80% in a very impressive 66 minutes</strong> so you can give it a quick top up before you go. In a real hurry? Emergency Super Charging via the companion app gets it to full in 102 minutes. And for those who love solar independence, the unit will take up to 400W of solar panel (sold separately) and recharge to full in approximately six hours of good sun. There’s even a silent charging mode that operates at under 30 decibels while still giving you a full charge in five hours.</p>
<p>At this all-time-low price of only $799, you’re getting high-grade backup power that literally could save the day during the next storm or blackout.</p>

<p>Mega Evolution has returned in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, with even more to unlock than ever before, and an array of different requirements are present before you can obtain them all.</p>



<p>Obtaining all the Mega Evolutions is a lengthy, but worthwhile, task in the bid to complete <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-pokemon-legends-z-a-mables-research-rewards-listed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mable’s Research Tasks</a>, which provides the ultimate prize of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-shiny-charm-in-pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shiny Charm</a>, but you won’t be able to get them all until the post-game.</p>



<p>We’ve got all the requirements and Mega Evolutions in Pokémon Legends: Z-A detailed in this guide.</p>

<p><strong>Mega Evolutions in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A require obtaining a specific Pokémon’s Mega Evolution Stone, with several ways of obtaining</strong> <strong>them.</strong></p>



<p>Many are locked behind story progression, with no way to jump ahead, while others can be obtained relatively early on, as long as you have enough cash or Mega Shards. Pokémon Legends: Z-A does make some even more difficult to obtain, however, locking them behind online ranked participation.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick breakdown of the many ways you can get Mega Evolution Stones in Pokémon Legends: Z-A</p>



<ul>
<li>Story Progression</li>



<li>Stone Emporium</li>



<li>Quasartico Mega Shard Exchange</li>



<li>Mystery Gift Rewards</li>



<li>Ranked Battle Rewards</li>



<li>Post-Game Content</li>
</ul>



<p>For a breakdown of every Pokémon Mega Evolution available in Legends: Z-A, and the specific unlock requirements, check out the table below.</p>

<p>Nintendo is anticipating demand for Switch 2 to persist over the Christmas period, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-17/nintendo-switch-2-production-plan-25-million-units-by-march-2026?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDY2MzU1NCwiZXhwIjoxNzYxMjY4MzU0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUM1VMNUZHT1QwSkswMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBRDcxOUY5NDBGRTk0MzNBOERCNzI2OEJDOTY3NzY3QyJ9.LE6GP3UTebmLsJ8NMH5owMDSVfAgjvJ76QZvezdERSM&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> has reported, with sales of roughly 20m Switch 2 units expected this fiscal year based on shipping estimates, according to the outlet's sources.</p>

</figure>
<p>Nintendo's prediction was on par with, if slightly ahead of, sales of the first Switch console, which sold 14.87m units in its first year on sale.</p>
<p>Yet the Switch 2 sold 3.5m units worldwide in its first four days on sale, becoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">Nintendo's fast-selling piece of hardware ever</a>.

<p>News of the Switch 2's success comes despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">criticism of its high price</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-treehouse-live-viewers-have-very-clear-message-for-nintendo">cost of games and accessories</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a> will soon receive updates that let you earn more XP per shootbrawl, rank up faster, and unlock gadgets and weapons attachments sooner. The tweaks are coming in response to frustrations about sluggish progression that have seen players pack the game's community servers with XP-farming matches against bots.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"We've heard your feedback around the pace of progression," the developers cry out to us <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979107918185157116">from the corpse-strewn deserts of social media</a>, "especially how long it can take to unlock hardware such as gadgets, and weapon attachments. We know progression is an important part of feeling rewarded for your time on the battlefield." 
</p><p>
So what changes are they making? Firstly, they're bumping up XP from match completion and daily login bonuses by 10% and 40% respectively. Secondly, they're reducing the XP required to unlock the first 20 attachment ranks, meaning you can "start earning useful attachments almost twice as fast". Be warned that if you're already making headway with a particular weapon's unlocks after the update goes live, you might see some weirdness on the UI, "but this should resolve itself once a match is played while using that weapon". 
</p>
<p>In other news, assignments (multiplayer challenges to earn cosmetics and such) that once required career ranks 20, 23, and 26 will now require career ranks 10, 15, and 20, respectively. The devs are aware that this doesn't address wider misgivings about assignments, without going into details - they're "actively working on reviewing them, but it will take more time to develop, test, and implement these changes."
</p><p>It's all in the name of making Battlefield 6's online arsenal-growing feel "smoother and more rewarding while still keeping that sense of achievement when you complete a milestone". It's also in the name of stemming the flood of bot factories in the community servers section.
</p>
<p>"Over the past week, many of you noticed that we reached maximum capacity on community servers," the devs go on. "After reviewing the data, we found that a large number of these servers were created primarily to earn XP, inflate player stats, and earn special accolades through defeating bots. 
</p>
<p>"We completely understand the motivation behind this, like faster progression and a way to test setups without pressure, but it's led to some unintended side effects. With so many servers focused on farming XP rather than active play, it's become noticeably harder for players to create and find experiences to play with other people."
</p>
<p>Battlefield's Community Experiences, EA rather primly point out, are "meant to be a space for creativity, experimentation, and connection, where you can easily find and enjoy great modes with your friends and squadmates". They're not supposed to be Operation Firestorm-sized treadmills. There's an overfamiliar op ed to write here about how live service operations of Battlefield's stature routinely grind away their own sense of play. I will spare you that. Instead I'll say that some of my most relaxing experiences during the Battlefield 6 review write-up were bot matches. It's so cute how they play-act at flanking and taking cover.
</p><p>Aside from greasing the progression chute, EA are "developing adjustments that are intended to diminish the number of XP farms taking up server space while further emphasizing playing with friends on both custom and verified experiences." Once they've carried out the associated backend maintenance, they expect that "all experiences, both custom and verified, will need to be republished by players before they can create an active server". 
</p>
<p>Look out for these updates "within the next week, potentially sooner depending on testing and verification". The devs close by acknowledging other complaints about "visibility, weapon bloom, vehicles not spawning, and more". They'll be patching those issues down the road, having already wrestled the hydra of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-gets-a-hotfix-targeting-bugged-hit-damage-and-ea-are-busy-inspecting-bouncy-ladders">bouncy ladders</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-backend-tweaks-tune-down-some-sniper-rifles-and-shotguns-as-ea-keep-fiddling-with-little-knobs">overclocked sniper rifles</a>.</p>
<p>Seems like the new field-battler is a hit, clogged-up levelling system notwithstanding. Yesterday, EA announced that it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-battlefield-6-is-best-selling-entry-in-the-series-7m-copies-sold-172m-online-matches">the best-selling Battlefield so far</a>.</p>

Discovered cafes in Legends: Z-A serve as fast travel points, and visiting them has several benefits. Firstly, sitting with a particular Pokémon strengthens your bond, which could be helpful for evolving them later on. Plus, buying drinks at a cafe restores your entire party’s health and removes status effects, so maybe your Totodile is sneaking a sip when you are not looking? </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you have already picked up Pokémon Legends Z-A and are wondering which initial Pokémon to pick, see our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/pokemon-legends-z-a-which-starter-should-you-choose"><u>tips for choosing from the game’s three starters</u></a>.

It’s the kind of thing that would be annoying for any game, much less a relatively competitive military shooter where every bullet counts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear if bright lights in Battlefield 6 affect more players on PC, PlayStation 5, or Xbox, or if the issue is present across all versions of the game.

		<p>Last year, Ubisoft confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/11/the-crew-motorfest-and-the-crew-2-are-both-getting-offline-modes/">The Crew Motorfest and The Crew 2 would both be getting offline modes</a>, and now that is a reality for The Crew 2. Ubisoft has released the Hybrid Mode update for The Crew 2, which allows players to continue playing the game online or to play The Crew 2 offline. If you are connected to the internet you can choose to play online or offline, but if you are not connected to the internet The Crew 2 will automatically launch into offline mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Crew Showcase 2025: new playground, race creator, offline mode…" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aydLtR1KzvQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>However, it has to be noted that online and offline saves are separate. While online data can be exported offline, offline save data cannot be exported to online. In addition, any online save data that is transferred to offline will overwrite any offline save data. This means any offline progression you have made that does not match online will be lost. When it comes to rewards and DLC, these need to be claimed online then exported to the offline save so these items can be used there. The Crew Credits balance is included in offline save data so you can buy cars offline, but any items or bundles only available in the online Crew Credits store cannot be purchased offline. Ubisoft has listed what is not available in the offline mode:</p>
<ul>
<li data-sleek-node-id="HiVDq7">Crew Credits purchases (vehicle bundles, vanity items) and the Far &amp; Beyond shop in all 4 Hubs.</li>
<li data-sleek-node-id="J7tW7S">LIVE Summits.</li>
<li data-sleek-node-id="FW7W7e">All multiplayer content, including PvP, Crews, crew features, news feed, leaderboards, ghosts, and statistics menus. Only your own best times will be recorded per race.</li>
<li data-sleek-node-id="wuQTXL">UGC features, including the Race Creator and Livery Editor. Custom liveries will not transfer to offline saves.</li>
<li data-sleek-node-id="VGMvxu">Some Hobbies and Achievements (Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Ubisoft Connect) that require online-only actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no detail yet when The Crew Motorfest will get the Hybrid mode to add offline to that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>What do you do when you’ve already made one of the best game controllers of all time? If you’re Victrix (or Turtle Beach, its parent company), you take a look for any missed opportunities and set to work again. That’s why we now have the BFG Reloaded. It’s a revision, rather than a revelation or revolution, but Victrix are steadily moving closer to peripheral perfection.</p>
<p><iframe title="Victrix™ Pro BFG™ Reloaded Wireless Modular Controller" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wdVQfElG71s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The BFG Reloaded is a wireless and wired, pro-styled modular controller, available for both the PS5 and Xbox Series consoles, with either iteration also playing nicely with PC. The BFG was named after the ultimate weapon in Doom, and while they might be stretching that metaphor to its logical conclusion, Victrix made a controller that can make <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/27/victrix-pro-bfg-controller-review/">a decent claim for it being the ultimate weapon for gamers</a>… and they’ve now reloaded it for another devastating blast.</p>


<p>In the box, you’re getting the controller itself, a sturdy hard case, modular units for the new Hall Effect left and right analogue sticks, and a revised six-button layout for fighting game aficionados that has shifted the inputs to make them more comfortable.</p>
<p>Besides that, there’s a thick braided cable in the requisite Victrix purple, alternate height analogue sticks, two further D-pad styles, as well as different-shaped gates for each analogue stick. All these options allow you to set the controller up exactly how you would want it, and there should be enough variety for everyone, no matter your skill level.</p>


<p>It’s a smart-looking piece of kit. If you were to turn up to a tournament with this in tow, you’d be certain of a few admiring glances. Our review unit came in black, but there’s also a white edition if that’s more your bag. It exudes modernity, edging towards futurism, but it doesn’t overdo the Cyberpunk, industrial vibes. In terms of visuals, I think it looks better than either Microsoft or Sony’s official controllers from this generation. Then again, at £170, it’s basically three times as expensive, so you’ll want something that bit more special.</p>
<p>Built from solid-feeling plastic, there’s rubberised grip sections at the front and wrapped around the rear grips, so it won’t slide about, even if you’re particularly prone to sweaty hands. These feel comfortable under your hand, and avoid the type of roughness you might experience with the P<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/13/powera-ops-v3-pro-wireless-controller-review/">owerA OPS V3 Pro</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/gamesir-cyclone-2-controller-review/">Gamesir Cyclone 2</a>.</p>
<p>Modular controllers are the Swiss Army Knife solution for pro controllers. Like the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">Thrustmaster eSwap</a> series, the BFG Reloaded has alternate units that you can take out or swap in, allowing you to shift from a symmetrical to an asymmetrical stick layout, or to wholly change the controller setup by bringing in more face buttons for fans of games like Street Fighter 6. If you play a variety of different games to a competitive level, it makes more sense than most, as the BFG Reloaded can easily fulfil multiple roles.</p>

<p>It’s made particularly easy because you have a mini hex-shaped screwdriver in the case. Undoing each control unit is very straightforward, and you can whip the different parts out in a minute or two. To be honest, it’s fun just swapping the parts, never mind actually using them to play a game.</p>
<p>Visually, there’s little to differentiate the BFG Reloaded from its predecessor. This is fundamentally the same core controller, enhanced by the now-expected Hall Effect sticks and the improved fightpad layout. It is marginally more comfortable, but then, I didn’t have any problems with the original unit.</p>
<p>Amusingly, some members of the gaming community are now already decrying Hall Effect sticks as being a poor cousin to TMR sticks, even though the technology is a clear and distinct step up from the old-school potentiometer sticks we’ve had for years that have a nasty tendency to develop stick drift.</p>

<p>TMR sticks are admittedly newer and capable of being more precise, but Hall Effect sticks are still tried and tested, with proven durability that will last far longer than standard potentiometer sticks. The majority of players won’t be able to tell the difference between TMR and Hall Effect, and even at this price, I’m still happy to see Hall Effect sensors in place, and they feel excellent in the Pro BFG Reloaded.</p>
<p>The standard face button layout is enhanced by four further ‘pro’ inputs on the back, and I really like the way these are flared out, and differently sized so that they fit perfectly beneath your ring and middle fingers. They’re firm enough that I didn’t find myself accidentally hitting inputs, but quick enough to reliably perform in the heat of a Star Wars Battlefront II battle (my current multiplayer obsession).</p>
<p>At the rear, you’ll also find the lockouts for the triggers. Now, in the original version, I did find myself catching these at first, but I didn’t do that at all with the Reloaded edition, though perhaps that’s due to muscle memory. The lockouts reduce the travel of the triggers, and in doing so drastically improve your reaction time – generally a very good idea for games where you’re trying to shoot other people. Uniquely, you can set these at five different depths, and they’re independent of one another, giving you another level of customisation you won’t find elsewhere.</p>

<p>There are a few negatives though. The BFG Reloaded is coming out at the tail end of a year that’s seen multiple extremely competitive and advanced pro controller releases, and the triggers and the face buttons aren’t quite on the cutting edge that we’re seeing elsewhere.</p>
<p>The trigger shapes are excellent, comfortably rounded and perfectly flared, but they feel a touch too light and, in fairness, a little cheap and clacky. There’s also no mechanical switches in the standard control module – they are in the fight pad module, though – or in the trigger lockouts, and when that’s increasingly the norm that we’re seeing from manufacturers like Gamesir, it’s hard not to pine for the instantaneous feel you get from them.</p>
<p>The Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded still feels fast and responsive in use. Turtle Beach list it as having 5ms of input lag, though I can only imagine that this is in the wired mode, or based on its polling rate, with further testing generally finding that it hovers around 9ms.</p>

<p>This is still very fast, but it does put it behind the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/23/dualsense-edge-review-is-sonys-first-ps5-pro-controller-essential-for-gamers/">DualSense Edge</a> or the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/07/nacon-revolution-5-pro-controller-review-ps5/">Nacon Revolution 5 Pro</a>. If you want the absolute fastest, this isn’t it, but equally, I prefer the way the Pro BFG Reloaded feels in the hand over both of those options.</p>
<p>Few controllers have the customisation and modularity of the BFG Reloaded, and if you’re the type of gamer who’ll repeatedly hop between Street Fighter 6 and Battlefield 5, or who’s looking to create a very particular setup, there’s no better option out there. I really like the construction materials and the way it feels in the hand, but there are still missed opportunities in terms of mechanical inputs throughout, and the triggers aren’t in line with the competition anymore.</p>
<p>On PlayStation, your only other option for modular-style control is the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/10/turtle-beach-stealth-pivot-controller-review/">Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot</a>, which sees the extra controls hidden away in the body of the controller. The Pro BFG Reloaded is far more comfortable, though the Stealth Pivot is considerably cheaper at £120. On PC, if you’re looking for modularity, it’s well worth considering the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">Thrustmaster eSwap</a>, which has also just received a Hall Effect update, though this only comes in a wired option, and is better suited for larger hands.</p>

<p>You and meme</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Ah, the humble Metroidvania. We've seen more additions to this genre than we can count in recent years and now — with all other bases covered, presumably — even memes are being adapted into the format of non-linear exploration.</p>
<p>After a successful Kickstarter campaign, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/this_is_fine_maximum_cope">This is Fine: Maximum Cope</a> takes KC Green's iconic dog meme and bends it into a metroidvania complete with perilous platforming, challenging bosses, nasty enemies and unlockable abilities. Oh yes, and it all takes place in the anxiety-riddled mind of the central character, Question Hound.</p>
<p>It launches on Switch in <strong>March 2026</strong>, promising adventures through five wild worlds of Humiliation, Fear, Failure, Loss, and Regret, plenty of collectibles, coffee sips and burning 'This is Fine' rest points — because of course.</p>
<p>We're not sure if we're completely sold on the above trailer's speed just yet; that said, the funny little dog animations are a nice touch, and we're getting hints of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cuphead">Cuphead</a> from some of those grizzly-looking boss battles. Who knows, maybe memes make for great games!</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from its Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explore the landscapes, beat bosses, unlock abilities, and access new chapters. This is a metroidvania. As you platform your way through each world you’ll encounter enemies, each an embodiment of everyday worries. Through navigation and persistence, you will ultimately face the challenging bosses unique to every area. Defeat them and acquire the abilities needed to progress further (and explore previous areas in more depth)!</p>
<p>Be sure to stop at every burning Rest Point to save, sip coffee, and pretend everything is fine for a brief moment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new skirmish wargame is coming courtesy of Osprey Games. <em>Warriors of Athena</em>, the newest project by Joseph McCullough, brings quests and nail-biting fights set during the time of Greek myth.</p>

<h2>The <em>Warriors of Athena</em> Announcement</h2>

<p><em>Warriors of Athena </em>will release in two books. Those books will feature illustrations by Hazem Ameen, whose work has been featured in Minos: Dawn of the Bronze Age and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pathfinder-adventure-card-game-review-co-op-excellence" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</em></a>.</p>

<p>These titular heroes are demigods, larger-than-life human beings blessed with the divine power of the Greek gods. These scenarios can be played solo, two-player co-op, or with an Oracle scripting and presenting scenarios for players to overcome.</p>

<p><em>Warriors of Athena: Quest</em> is a book packed with how to craft these scenarios. It contains four prewritten campaigns, advice on how to make your own, and a bestiary full of gods, monsters, and foes ready to challenge heroes.</p>

His body of work includes many beloved narrative-rich skirmish games such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/frostgrave-limited-deluxe-edition-celebrates-10-years-of-skirmish-mayhem" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Frostgrave</em></a>, and <em>Rangers of Shadow Deep</em>. But this game may be his biggest release yet. McCullough stated from the official press release the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Warriors of Athena</em> has allowed me to indulge in my childhood love of Greek myth while building upon my previous games to push tabletop miniature gaming into new narrative spaces. It’s also an excuse to paint some cool Greek heroes, centaurs, minotaurs, and maybe even a god or two!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Warriors of Athena</em> will be supported by a new line of miniatures by Osprey Games and North Star Military Figures. Both books are available for pre-order on Osprey's website in both hardcover and PDF format. They are expected to ship February 24, 2026 in the US and February 26, 2026 in the UK.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you had any doubts over the legitimacy of the recent wave of gargantuan Pokémon leaks, then The Pokémon Company COO Takato Utsunomiya calling for them all to be removed is probably the most telling piece of evidence you can ask for.</p>



<p>October 13 saw a seismic influx of Pokémon leaks hit the internet. We learned about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-wind-waves-gen-10-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Generation 10’s Wind and Wave</a>, a bunch of new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-games-and-dlc-roadmap-allegedly-revealed-in-new-datamine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon games, and the DLC Roadmap</a>, not to mention potential Pokémon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-leak-reveals-boss-fight-and-mmo-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MMO Details</a>!</p>



<p>It’s been a rip-roaring few days, and we don’t think The Pokémon Company has taken too kindly to it all.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-wind-amp-wave-and-other-leaks-asked-to-be-taken-down">Pokémon Wind &amp; Wave And Other Leaks Asked To Be Taken Down</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’ve learned so much already. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Centro LEAKS</a> has become one of the go-to accounts in all of social media where Pokémon leaks are concerned. Some would argue it’s the account everyone refreshes. It posted a bunch of leaks ahead of Pokémon Legends Z-A, and it’s a regular source of Pokémon leaks for Pokémon Pocket and other associated media.</p>



<p>The page reported on October 16 that it had been contacted directly by The Pokémon Company.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Mr. Takato Utsunomiya, the Chief Operating Officer of The Pokémon Company, has personally sent an email to Centro Leaks / X to take down the Pokémon leak images.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Centro LEAKS has reiterated that it will not be removing any such leaks or images. In fact, the page has doubled down on its findings and revealed that among the images they want removed are the alleged Pokémon Wind and Wave logos.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The social media page has now pinned a message from Oct. 17, 2024, saying: “If only he knew that laws don’t exist in Perú.” </p>



<p>The message was presumably another instance of copyright issues between the page and The Pokémon Company, and it’s clear that Centro LEAKS’ stance won’t change in 2025. So, unless The Pokémon Company has something stronger in mind, Centro LEAKS will have all the original leaks on its page for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>Which of the leaks has intrigued you the most? Do the new Wind and Waves designs look good?

<p><iframe title="ASSETTO CORSA RALLY ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ueDItr3A3KM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Feeling the lack of a modern rally simulator, we’ve built a team and developed a technology to create one ourselves, with the support of drivers, engineers, collectors, mechanics, and industry experts.”</em> said Mauro Notarberardino, Supernova Studio Director. <em>“A special thanks goes to&nbsp;KUNOS Simulazioni, whose partnership was crucial in maintaining the signature feel of the series – especially in terms of the driving model – in this new chapter. Today marks an exciting new beginning for Supernova and Assetto Corsa Rally, and we can’t wait to share the journey with you.”</em></p>
<p><em>“A rally version of Assetto Corsa, when?! It has been one of the most frequent questions I’ve received over these years, and I can finally provide an answer.”</em> said Marco Massarutto, Co-Founder of KUNOS Simulazioni and the Assetto Corsa franchise and Executive Manager for KUNOS Simulazioni.</p>

<p>When Assetto Corsa Rally launches into early access, the content players will have access to includes 33km of fully laser scanned real life roads, four Special Stages with 18 variants, set across gravel roads in Wales and tarmac roads in Alsace, 10 iconic rally cars, including Group B, WRC and Rally2 vehicles,<br>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new Dragon Ball video game project will be announced in late January 2026 during a special celebration of the franchise's 40th anniversary.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/DB_anime_info">As confirmed on X by the official series anime profile</a>, the new game project will be announced during the Dragon Ball Genkidamasturi event on January 25, 2026. The event, which will be held at Makuhari Messe in Chiba, Japan will also feature other announcements, discussion panels and events hosted by Masako Nozawa (Goku voice actress), Akio Iyoku (executive producer) and Hironobu Kageyama, the composer of some of the series' most iconic opening tracks like Cha-La-Head-Cha-la and We Gotta Power, the opening themes for the classic DBZ anime.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Bandai Namco hasn't confirmed any other details on this new game project, so even speculation is difficult at this time. The fighting games <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-ball-fighterz-super-saiyan-god/">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-an-explosive-love-letter/">Dragon Ball Sparking! ZERO</a> are still receiving updates and new content, as is the role-playing game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-authentic-ambitious-adequate/">Dragon Ball Kakarot</a>, Dragon Ball: The Breakers, and multiple free-to-play games like Dokkan Battle, Legends and Gekishin Squadra.</p>



<p>As hyping up a new game announcement so far ahead of time wouldn't make sense for a minor project possibly belonging to video game genres that are still actively represented by other titles, there's a solid chance this new announcement could be something unique and unexpected. Hopefully, it will be an adequate game to celebrate the legacy of Akira Toriyama, who sadly <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-akira-toriyama-dies-68-gaming-legacy/">passed away last year.</a></p>

            <p>Former Assassin's Creed series lead Marc-Alexis Côté's departure from Ubisoft after 20 years in various roles was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft">announced earlier this week</a>, and the developer's now put out a post in which he says that leaving wasn't his choice. Instead, Côté asserts that it came after he was asked to step aside as Assassin's Creed boss by Ubisoft as part of a corporate restructure, then offered a reduced role as part of the company's Tencent-backed Vantage Studios subsidiary.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin’s Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it," Côté wrote in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marcalexis_the-past-24-hours-have-been-deeply-emotional-activity-7384672277055012864-87QR/">post on LinkedIn</a>. "The truth is simple: I did not make that choice."</p>
<p>He continued as follows:</p>
<blockquote>Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin’s Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure. A different position was mentioned, but it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work I had been entrusted with in recent years. I want to be clear that I hold no resentment. Ubisoft has been my home for all my professional life, and I will always be grateful for the people, the projects, and the belief that together we could create worlds that inspire millions. But I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly: I did not walk away. I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside.</blockquote>
<p>Côté's departure came as a bit of a shock, given it followed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/assassins-creed-shadows-success-shows-that-the-threat-of-negative-campaigns-is-overblown-opinion">success earlier this year</a>, an important win for what's been a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-push-back-some-of-our-biggest-games-and-announce-further-cost-cutting-after-a-challenging-year">struggling publisher</a> over the past few years. This restructure around the formation of Vantage Studios, a subsidiary created to oversee Assassin's Creed, FarCry and Rainbow Six going forwards as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">a €1.16 billion deal with Chinese conglomerate Tencent</a>, has seen Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot appointed as its co-CEO. Yep, that's Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot's son Charlie, who has <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ubisoft-spinoff-ceos-christophe-derennes-charlie-guillemot-1236453661/">insisted his appointment wasn't just down to nepotism</a>.</p><p>I reached out to Ubisoft for comment and the publishers stuck to their statement guns from earlier this week, with a spokesperson saying: "Following the organizational restructuring announced in March 2025, Marc-Alexis Côté has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft.While we are saddened to see him go, we’re confident that our talented teams will carry forward the strong foundation he helped build."</p>
<p>"We are deeply grateful for the impact Marc-Alexis has had over the years, particularly in shaping the Assassin’s Creed brand into what it is today," they continued. "His leadership, creativity, and dedication have left a lasting mark on our teams and our players. We thank him sincerely for his many contributions and wish him continued success in all his future endeavors."</p>
<p>Côté was also very forthright in his defense of Shadows' devs in the face of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-warn-staff-not-to-celebrate-assassins-creed-shadows-launch-as-part-of-anti-harassment-plan">online vitriol over Yasuke being one the game's protagonists</a>, in contrast to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/our-goal-is-not-to-push-any-specific-agenda-ubisoft-ceo-tries-to-mollify-gamers-who-wont-stop-being-mad-about-a-black-samurai-in-assassins-creed-shadows/">the elder Guillemot</a>. Here's hoping that Derennes and baby Guillemot are willing to do that kind of thing, but I'm doubtful until we see it.</p>

            <p>
There is a woman trying to get into my supermarket. She's banging on the sliding door glass, an urgent silhouette against swirling fog and darkness. My manager told me it's not safe outside at night, but the woman doesn't seem afraid, for all her banging. She is smiling. Not a nice smile. A Skibidi smile, all teeth and gums and painfully stretched skin. 
</p>
<p>
I do not think I should let the woman in, but she explains to me in text dialogue that I have it all backwards. <em>She's</em> not outside the store. <em>I</em> am. So really, if I let her in I'm only letting myself in. I do not find this gnomic insight reassuring. I tell her to clear off. She doesn't press her case, but comments before drifting away that there might be consequences later. I silently observe that I would rather have consequences later than consequences right now.

This is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hellmart">Hellmart</a>, a grubby first-person job simulator in which you spend your days stocking shelves, cleaning the aisles and manning the checkout, and your nights attempting to secure the premises against a nebulous Evil. 
</p>

The daytime stretches are squalid and oppressive but relatively non-horrific. True, you might have to deal with paranormal antics such as self-slamming doors. True, the boxes of pasta on your shelves look vaguely like pictures of guts and eyeballs. True, the CCTV feeds on your computer by the till often reveal things that aren't there, or which hopefully aren't there. True, a lot of your customers sport that Skibidi smile, and true, it's unclear where they're from, exactly. The store sits in a waste of snow and forest, with locals emerging from behind a distant hill.
</p><p>
But that's all peanuts compared to what happens when the sun sets. I haven't progressed far enough to encounter some of the entities brazenly given away by the Steam page (and the below trailer), but it's telling that you can board up windows. The security measures immediately feel inadequate. Being able to padlock the doors is of minimal comfort, given the presence of patently xenomorph-friendly airvents. The option to hide in fridges just feels like offering yourself up as a snack.</p>
<p>The store isn't huge - it's a handbaskets-only joint, barely roomy enough to justify the supermarket label, but the head-high shelves carve it up into a larger labyrinth that is pleasingly efficient in its jumpscare potential. And then there are the people [citation needed] who bang on the glass. Some of them are probably safe company: it's up to you to decide, based on the things they say.

There's been a slight trend in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror games</a> about Letting The Right One in over the past year or so. Mark recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-was-terrified-of-answering-the-door-before-playing-this-freaky-faced-apocalyptic-horror-and-honestly-it-hasnt-helped">wrote</a> about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-im-not-a-human">No, I'm Not A Human</a>, in which you are a post-apocalyptic hermit appraising the bona fides of night-time wanderers and Visitors. There's also the earlier <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3373660/Look_Outside/">Look Outside</a>, in which you definitely shouldn't open the curtains, and the forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quarantine-zone-the-last-check">Quarantine Zone</a>, a chilly piece of military border policing that is hopefully alive to its own inhumanity. 
</p><p>
It's tempting to make connections with Covid lockdowns and lingering agoraphobia, but these are emotions that date back much further, of course - back through games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/papers-please">Papers, Please</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights At Freddy's</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkwood">Darkwood</a> to zombie fables about the possibly infected and folk legends about vampires and thresholds. The major difference I sense in games like Hellmart is that the monsters often don't particularly bother to hide their monstrousness. The ghoulish thrill of these games is letting nocturnal callers cross the lintel even when you're 70% sure they're bad news, just to see what mayhem they wreak.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3762550/HELLMART/">Find the Hellmart demo on Steam</a>. I'll conclude with the anecdote that I used to be a Tesco store cleaner, and the scariest thing that ever happened to me on-shift was two old ladies power-dunking jars of pesto and cream at either end of the store simultaneously - the janitorial equivalent of a Double Event in Pacific Rim. Mind you, now that I've played Hellmart, I realise how glad I am that I never had to lock up after dark. That Tesco was huge. So many sightlines. Pretty sure it had a meat locker as well.</p>
<p>It's out "soon". Bulgaria-based developers Gaze in Games are a new outfit founded by a former member of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/zoochosis">Zoochosis</a> developers Clapperheads. If you're sold on the premise and don't want to wait, there's also the lower-fi <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3126330/Kiosk/">Kiosk</a> from Serbian developer Vivi.

<p>Dead Space 4 is a wishlist game for many survival-horror fans. Glen Schofield is the genius behind the original title, and while he didn’t have any direct involvement in its sequels, the creator wants to return and get horrible again with Dead Space 4.</p>



<p>It was almost a year ago that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/glen-schofield-dead-space-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schofield revealed EA turned down Dead Space 4</a>. There’s a wide belief that the Dead Space Remake didn’t meet sales expectations for Krafton. This is likely why we haven’t heard a sniff about a <a href="http://Dead Space 2 Remake Shelved for Battlefield, It’s Claimed – UPDATE: EA Denies Claim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Space 2 Remake</a>, let alone a fourth game. However, Schofield has reiterated his desire to return to the world of nail-biting terror and necromorphs.</p>

<figure><figcaption>One more round? Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Schofield declared in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-can-save-you-30-40-million-on-the-idea-i-have-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-already-making-calls-about-dead-space-4-now-ea-has-new-owners" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I have quite a few ideas that I’m ready to go with, and one of them is Dead Space 4. The fact that EA just got bought, I think there’s an opportunity. I’m already making calls.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He revisited his trip to EA, which we’ve already mentioned above, and doubled down on the fact that EA has seemingly moved on from Dead Space:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I went to [EA] recently and they’re like no, we’re not interested anymore. I said, I can get back the leadership team. I need the models from EA Motive [Dead Space Remake creator] and I can save you 30 to 40 million dollars on the idea that I have. And, they’re like, ‘no.'”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Dead Space creator believes the $55 billion takeover of EA could lead to some changes, though: “I am more optimistic because somebody new could buy [the rights to the Dead Space IP].”</p>



<p>EA did <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-space-remakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ask if fans were interested in more Dead Space Remakes</a> shortly after the 2023 release. However, it appears that all plans are on hold for now. Would you like to see a Dead Space 2 Remake? Or can we go one better and finally get the Dead Space 4 sequel we’ve all been waiting for?

<p>Glen Schofield has been quite vocal recently.
