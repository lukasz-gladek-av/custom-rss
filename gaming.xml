<p>Warner Bros. Games has canceled its Wonder Woman game and shut down multiple studios. According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lizk5skwps2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and WB San Diego are all being closed.</p>



<p>Wonder Woman was first announced at The Game Awards 2021, and was being developed by Monolith Productions. The game was set to feature the Nemesis system made popular by its Middle-earth games. Since its reveal announcement, news surrounding Wonder Woman had been scarce with it reported that the game had been completely rebooted sometime in 2024.</p>



<p>Monolith was formed in 1994 before becoming a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Games in 2004.</p>



<p>The closing of Player First Games comes after its debut game MultiVersus was canceled with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-is-officially-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutdown happening in May</a>. Warner Bros. Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-acquires-multiversus-developer-player-first-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired the studio</a> in July 2024.</p>



<p>WB San Diego was founded in 2019, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/warner-bros-opens-new-mobile-studio-in-san-diego" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">focused primarily</a> on mobile and free-to-play games.</p>



<p>The news comes just weeks after it was announced that current Warner Bros. Interactive president David Haddad <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-david-haddad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was leaving the company</a> this spring. His departure comes after 12 years in his division.</p>



<p>As of writing, there’s been no public statement from Warner Bros. Games. It’s also unclear if anyone from the closing studios will be moved, or if everyone will be let go. Insider Gaming has reached out to Warner Bros. Games for comment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/skin-deep-steam-next-fest-demo-impressions-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m floating in space, clinging to the hull of a spaceship. I peer in through a trash chute – not the most glamorous window into the ship’s vacuum-sealed world, but it will have to do. Inside, a lone guard patrols around a laundry room. Perfect, she’ll make for an easy ambush. I wait for her to turn her back, and then I burst in. Immediately, everything goes awry. Because I entered through the trash chute, I’m now stinky, and the guard snaps to attention as soon as she catches a whiff. I frantically scurry under a counter, where I happen upon a hidden stash of soap. Fantastic. I can work with this.&nbsp;</p><p>I throw a couple bars onto the ground, producing sudsy bubbles and causing the guard to slip and fall. I rush out to finish her off, only to… also faceplant as a result of my self-made slip ‘n’ slide. The guard opens fire, and I roll into a nearby vent with just a sliver of health left. OK, I think, this isn’t going <em>great</em>, but I still have options. As I linger in the vent, a meter fills telling me that I will soon sneeze – not great for stealth – but that gives me an idea. Earlier I picked up a container full of black pepper; I barge back into the laundry room, take aim, and throw it at the guard, who begins sneezing and wheezing. It’s now or never. I leap onto her back and wrestle her onto one washing machine, followed by another. That leaves her down for the count. Then, of course, I pop her head off nice and clean and throw it out the airlock. You know, so she can’t levitate over to a new body. Another job well done.</p><p>This is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/301280/Skin_Deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Skin Deep</em></a> in a nutshell.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Skin Deep - Release Date Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rP1matuR3qQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Skin Deep</em> first appeared on my radar almost as soon as it was announced several years ago, largely because I’ve been a fan of developer Blendo Games since the hazily-remembered days of <em>Gravity Bone</em> and <em>Thirty Flights Of Loving</em>, games that told tight, absurd stories with a uniquely cinematic flair for the dramatic. But on other occasions, such as 2016’s <em>Quadrilateral Cowboy</em>, the studio revealed its true passion: densely-packed mechanical systems, the kind that fit together like gears in a pocketwatch. <em>Skin Deep</em>, which comes out in April, applies pretty much every tool in Blendo’s belt to a sci-fi immersive sim. It makes a phenomenal first impression.</p><p><em>Skin Deep</em>, a brief demo of which is now available as part of Steam Next Fest, describes itself as an “immersive first-person shooter” in which you play as an insurance operative who rescues talking cats. (When you do so, by the way, they explode out of their tiny jail cells, and the word “MEOW” flies across the screen.) You’re outnumbered and outgunned aboard nonlinear spaceships, with standout features that include the aforementioned sneezing tendency, as well as the fact that your character is constantly barefoot for some reason.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Blendo Games</figcaption></figure><p>The setup might sound silly, but it works. For example, if you step on broken glass, it gets lodged in your foot. Yikes. But if you yank it out, you can both recover some health and gain a new weapon. This kind of thinking suffuses the whole experience: Even the most mundane objects can be potent offensive tools in the right hands (or feet). I’m talking books, hunks of metal, walkie talkies, tuna cans, and slapstick classics like banana peels and fishbones. Creativity is your paintbrush. Every level is a canvas.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, I’ve replayed the second level several times, with a devious glee that takes me back to childhood afternoons spent with the <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> demo that came bundled with <em>Zone of the Enders</em>. There are just so many ways to mess with these three hapless guards, and they’re all funny. Certainly, I’ll always remember my nearly-botched first attempt, but my second go ‘round – when I realized I could use books and coffee cups to shatter numerous windows and turn most of the ship into an antigravity playground – represented a true turning of the tables, a new power dynamic born of ingenuity (and my character’s thus-far-unexplained ability to breathe in outer space).</p><figure><figcaption>Blendo Games</figcaption></figure><p>After only an hour or so, which includes replays, I’m extremely high on <em>Skin Deep</em>. It feels like one of those games that’s going to keep throwing comically ingenious (or perhaps ingeniously comical) curveballs at me as levels increase in complexity, and whatever comes next will be positioned atop a uniquely confident foundation. As it stands, games already have plenty of slick infiltrations and assassinations. They need more knock-down, drag-out cartoon brawls. They need more slapstick. <em>Skin Deep</em>’s demo gets it. I sure hope the full game does too.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-skeleton-notes-funny-writing-bear-egg"><h3>Avowed Has Killer Skeleton Storytelling</h3></a><p>It turns out that dead men do, in fact, tell tales.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-microsoft-muse-ai-xbox-avowed"><h3>Microsoft’s New ‘Muse’ AI Is Doubly Bad Because Avowed Is So Good</h3></a><p>"The [Muse] announcement almost felt like it was under duress, like it was a hostage video in some ways"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/framework-known-for-upgradable-laptops-intros-not-particularly-upgradable-desktop/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>In Framework's first-party case, the PC starts at $1,099, which gets you a Ryzen AI Max 385 (that's an 8-core CPU and 32 GPU cores) and 32GB of RAM. A fully loaded 128GB with a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 configuration (16 CPU cores, 40 GPU cores) will run you $1,999. There's also an in-between build with the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip and 64GB of RAM for $1,599.&nbsp;If you just want the mini ITX board to put in a case of your choosing, that starts at $799.</p>
<p>None of these are impulse buys, exactly, but they're priced a bit better than a gaming-focused mini PC like the Asus ROG NUC, which <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1860500-REG/asus_rnuc14srku7169aui_republic_of_gamers_nuc.html?ap=y&amp;smp=y&amp;msclkid=665d398fca4517ecc9d75e33332b247f">starts at nearly $1,300 as of this writing</a> and comes with half as much RAM. It's also priced well compared to what you can get out of a DIY mini ITX PC based on integrated graphics—the Ryzen 7 8700G, an AM5 ITX motherboard, and 32GB of DDR5 can all be had for around $500 collectively before you add a case, power supply, or SSD, but for considerably slower performance.</p>
<p>The volume of the Framework Desktop's first-party case is just 4.5 liters—for reference, <a href="https://ssupd.co/products/cases-meshroom-s-v2">the SSUPD Meshroom S</a> is 14.9 liters, a fairly middle-of-the-road volume for an ITX case that can fit a full-size GPU. An Xbox Series X is about 6.9 liters, and the Xbox Series S is 4.4 liters. Apple's Mac Studio is about 3.7 liters. The Framework Desktop isn't breaking records, but it's definitely tiny. </p>

    <p>
      Despite the non-upgradeability of the main components, Framework has tried to stick to existing standards where it can by using a flex ATX power supply, ATX headers on the motherboard, regular 120 mm fans that can be changed out, and of course the mini ITX form factor itself.

<p>So the pitch for the system is easy: You get a reasonably powerful 1440p-capable gaming and workstation PC inside a case the size of a small game console. "If the Series S could run Windows, I'd buy it in a second" is a thought that has occurred to me, so I can see the appeal, even though it costs at least three times as much.</p>
<p>But it does feel like a strange fit for Framework, given that it's so much&nbsp;<em>less</em> upgradeable than most PCs. The CPU and GPU are one piece of silicon, and they're soldered to the motherboard. The RAM is also soldered down and not upgradeable once you've bought it, setting it apart from nearly every other board Framework sells.</p>

            <p>
If you've already hoovered up developer Color Gray Games' excellent deduct-'em'-up sequel The Rise of the Golden Idol, you might well be delighted to hear The Sins of New Wells - the first of its previously announced post-launch DLC episodes - is arriving this March.
</p>
<p>
The Rise of the Golden Idol, if you're unfamiliar, takes the sleuthing formula of its 2022 predecessor and shifts it from the 18th Century to the 1970s. Eurogamer liked its 20 new cases enough to declare it a "compelling modern mystery thriller" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-review">our four star review</a> last year.
</p>
<p>
Prior to its release, Color Gray Games confirmed The Rise of the Golden Idol <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sleuthing-sequel-the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-shares-post-launch-dlc-roadmap-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch">would be getting a paid Detective Pass</a>, granting access to four additional self-contained DLC Investigations throughout 2025 - each one featuring "at least" four new cases. And we now know the first of these, The Sins of New Wells, is coming in March.
</p>

"Homicide detective [REDACTED] has been transferred to the [REDACTED]," the studio explains in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2716400/view/521956605068051135">announcement</a>, "where corruption runs as deep as the sewers beneath New Wells. Here, crime is business as usual. But as he and his new partner, Cliff Savea, investigate a string of brutal crimes, they find themselves pulled into something far more insidious...Lemurian magic."
</p>
<p>
And if that appeals, The Sins of New Wells will be available as part of the aforementioned Detective Pass bundle, which costs £14.99/$17.99, or as an individual purchase priced at £4.99/$5.99. It's coming to PC, consoles, and the Netflix-exclusive mobile version.

Martin's popular fantasy franchise, now has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC demo</a> that everyone can download for free as part of Steam Next Fest. Here's a brief official description of the demo:</p>
<p><em>From the untamed wilds beyond the Wall to the towering halls of Winterfell, the North is harsh, unforgiving, and full of opportunity—and peril. In this demo, get a taste of the journey before you set forth to explore the vast realm of Westeros in the full game.</em></p>

<p>In the full game, players will forge their own legacy as the bastard child of House Tyre, a small noble house in Northern Westeros. They'll be thrust right into action by the death of the main character's brothers and the looming threat of winter and forced to embark on a mission to restore House Tyre to its former glory.</p>
<p>With this objective in mind, players must consolidate their political standing, navigate the complex power struggles between the noble houses of Westeros, and seek out any allies while also helping the Night's Watch prepare for the final confrontation with the White Walkers and their army of the dead that awaits just beyond the Wall.</p>
<p>As covered in our previous news story, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will also support a cooperative mode. In this mode, players can band together to face mythical creatures from the world's most mysterious lore and earn great loot rewards. The game will launch at some point in Q2 (that is to say, before the end of June) on PC, iOS, and Android.</p>

One of the channel’s most popular shows was <em>MTV Unplugged.</em> This was a live concert series that brought in different artists and bands and had them play their music using a minimal amount of instruments and tech. And now <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-trek-section-31-cameo-big-name-jamie-lee-curtis-1851747475&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-trek-section-31-cameo-big-name-jamie-lee-curtis-1851747475">Paramount+</a></span> has added a ton of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/mtv-unplugged/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/mtv-unplugged/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">classic<em> MTV Unplugged</em> episodes</a></span>, including famous performances by Nirvana and Alice in Chains. </p><p>As noted in a press release by Paramount, many of these <em>Unplugged </em>episodes “haven’t been available in 20+ years.” Sure, you could find some of the most famous ones on YouTube in various levels of quality, but most were much trickier to find and the versions floating around online looked and sounded terrible. So it’s really nice to have a large chunk of music history accessible again. Well, accessible if you have Paramount+. I have the service because I love<em> Star Trek </em>and <em>Survivor</em>, and I rewatch <em>Frasier</em>. If you ask nicely I’ll share my account with you. <br></p><p>One of the <em>Unplugged </em>episodes added to Paramount+ features the infamous 1996 performance by Oasis.

And when the band finally showed up an hour before taping, he was apparently very drunk. Noel Gallagher, his brother, ended up singing the entire show on his own. This episode existed in some low-quality forms online already, but now you can watch a pristine version of this famous concert that almost wasn’t. </p><p>Beyond Unplugged, Paramount+ has also added a ton of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VH1_Storytellers&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VH1_Storytellers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VH1 Storytellers</em></a></span> episodes, too. This was a similar show to <em>Unplugged</em>, but even more stripped down and with the artists talking more about their lives or the origins of their songs in between numbers.</p><p>Now, excuse me, I’m going to listen to Nirvana’s performance of <em>The Man Who Sold The World</em> again. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
BioWare co-founder Greg Zeschuk has looked back on his time at the company behind Dragon Age, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-the-old-republic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a>, and discussed some of the studio's most notorious moments, as well as his relationship with mega-publisher owner EA.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Simon Parkin on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4C53o2G7q64HMCeqf54Qyz?si=02ac49c328d34de8">My Perfect Console podcast</a>, Zeschuk said EA had been a decent partner, despite some BioWare fans' view that the studio's buyout was the beginning of its end.
</p>
<p>
"I like to comment that EA gives you enough rope to hang yourself," Zeschuk said. "And what I mean by that is you have to learn to work within the structure and I think we did quite well, if you look at the Mass Effect [trilogy that] came out of there. It was actually a pretty successful run. 
</p>
<p>
"But you have to understand how to work within a big company. And, for me, that was the end. It was like, 'oh, I don't like big companies'. So I knew by year two that I was going to leave at some point. I just didn't know when.
</p>
<p>
"I lived in Austin on-and-off half-time for two-and-a-half years making Star Wars: The Old Republic and that was like my swansong in the industry," Zeschuk continued, recounting his work on his final game. Both of BioWare's co-founders famously quit the company and games industry in 2012, and Zeschuk now spends his days happily working in craft beer.
</p>
<p>
"I knew that was kind of a one-way trip," Zeschuk says of his decision to focus on BioWare's big Star Wars MMO bet. "If it was super successful, super-duper successful, Ray and I would have probably launched a bid to try and take over EA from the inside, being the corporate pirates that we are. But it needed to be like $2bn a year successful. It didn't work out so I was like, 'I'm fine'."
</p>
<p>
As for EA in general, Zeschuk says the publisher behind FIFA and Madden "let us operate freely" - though BioWare's antics sometimes raised eyebrows. 
</p>
<p>
"There's all kinds of shenanigans we did," Zeschuk recalled. "We actually made Facebook games under false pretenses, under false names actually."
</p>
<p>
Zeschuk remembers a game about a yeti running around delivering gifts, which BioWare staff made as an experiment to test the platform. 
</p>
<p>
BioWare was not allowed to work on mobile games, Zeschuk continued, but some team members were curious about it - so they made up fake company name to test development for it. The idea was that BioWare might want to include mobile integration into one of its bigger games - which indeed happened with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a>'s Galaxy at War app.
</p>
<p>
"You can't have a company of cowboys," Zeschuk said. "I wouldn't say we were cowboys, we were usually somewhat calculating in what we did. But we liked to try stuff. So when they discovered we had a couple of Apple development devices and we weren't in the mobile division, they were like 'what are you doing?'"
</p>
<p>
While discussing his biggest regret of his time at BioWare, Zeschuk recalled receiving advice from another gaming giant - Microsoft - which ultimately swayed the company into launching <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jade-empire">Jade Empire</a> for the original Xbox, to a middling response.
</p>
<p>
"Microsoft was like 'no no, you should release it now, right at the end of the cycle, because it's a great time'," Zeschuk recalled. "It was the worst advice, absolute moronic advice from them, the stupidest thing ever. I'll say that and Peter Moore will punch me in the mouth next time he sees me. It wasn't his fault, but we should have pushed that to the beginning of the [Xbox] 360. 
</p>
<p>
"We could have rezzed [Jade Empire] up, we could have amped it up. We could have said no. We just missed... I wish I'd said, 'this is a terrible mistake, give us another six months, give us the chance to make it a launch title for 360' and we'd have had another franchise, and then who knows. I just think it would have been a way more successful product at the beginning of a cycle than the end, because by the time it came out people weren't even buying Xbox anymore, they were waiting for the next one."
</p>
<p>
Zeschuk recalled concerns from within BioWare at the company's acquisition by EA, particularly around the perception that the publisher had a culture of overworking, or 'crunch'. But this was something BioWare already had experiences with itself, he noted.
</p>
<p>
"There was a pretty heated all-hands in the studio to talk about the sale and whether EA was going to force its philosohical work-life balance onto us," Zeschuk said, "but we actually all did it to ourselves. We were the ones who were immature, and so we were the ones who could get ourselves out of that. 
</p>
<p>
"I think we did the best we could, we always could have done better, but I don't know. There are times you had to put in maximum effort, but we also tried to institute things like, 'hey there's still sympathetic... if you work from home, go home. You don't have to be in the office'. 
</p>
<p>
"The biggest offenses in that world were, 'just in case, we'll have you stay in the office for hours on end in case someone needs you'. Nah, just go home. We'll call you in. Be reasonable. We tried to do it better. I don't know if we did? I think we did it better than we could have done. There's always ways to improve."
</p>
<p>
Finally, Zeschuk recalled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-video-sheds-light-on-what-it-was-like-inside-bioware-during-the-mass-effect-3-ending-controversy">the Mass Effect 3 ending controversy</a>, when a fan backlash prompted the release of a new extended ending to the sci-fi space opera in response to complaints online, but also harassment and death threats.
</p>
<p>
"I think intentions were good," Zeschuk said. "You can never do anything perfectly, and that's one of the challenges as a game developer. To some degree, especially when there's high expectations - think of a series like Mass Effect, absolutely beloved, an incredible overall experience - and then to maybe not reach the players' expectations of agency and decision-making at the final step when providing a more nuanced ending... it's complicated. 
</p>
<p>
"Speaking fully and honestly, I was a bystander on it as I was working on Star Wars: The Old Republic, and so I was in the mix but not in the firing line, if that makes sense. But I really felt for the team because I understood the purpose. 
</p>
<p>
"Your dream scenario is [to] release a game no one's really heard of and do it really well, because as soon as the expectations are there, it's really tough," he continued. "And the other extreme pressure on the other side of that... you got these giant business conglomerates that are pushing for certain release dates and release times. At BioWare, when Ray and I ran [it], our most effective thing was pushing for the dates that made the most sense that made the best possible game. 
</p>
<p>
"We would play something and declare that, with lots of resource, it wasn't ready, and make it happen at a later date. I look at a game like Anthem and think 'man, there's such a great core to that game, but yeah, it needs to bake for another year'."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-veteran-writer-among-those-looking-for-work-after-post-dragon-age-the-veilguard-downsizing">BioWare has now shrunk down in size</a> following the completion of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> last year, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-confirms-many-staff-moved-elsewhere-in-ea-as-core-team-focuses-on-mass-effect-5-in-downsized-studio">smaller team committed to Mass Effect 5</a>.

    <p><span>Breaking the fourth wall.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > 11 bit studios [57 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/11-bit-studios">11 bit studios</a> has released a new trailer for <a title="Genres > Survival [380 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival game</a> <em><a title="Games > The Alters [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a></em>, in which the fourth wall is broken as the game’s alternate version of the main character play <em>The Alters</em>. <span id="more-946390"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p>Survival may be a familiar challenge in games, but 11 bit studios’ upcoming ambitious science-fiction title, <em>The Alters</em>, takes it to an intensely personal level. In <em>The Alters</em>, survival isn’t just about enduring the unknown—it’s about confronting yourself in the most personal way possible; face-to-face. After all, what could be more personal than navigating life-or-death decisions alongside alternate versions of who you could have been? Jan Dolski is an ordinary worker—now the sole survivor of a crash landing on a distant, unforgiving planet. Stranded and alone, he faces an impossible task: operating a massive mobile base designed for an entire crew all while escaping the relentless, burning sun. His only chance lies in the Alters—alternate versions of himself, shaped by pivotal choices he never made, each with different skills, different memories, and different lives.</p><p>As revealed in the latest trailer, which subtly plays with the notion of breaking the fourth wall, working with these different Jans is anything but straightforward. They are not just copies. Some took different paths and look upon the first Jan’s choices with pity. Others succeeded where he failed, living lives he never had the chance to—and now, maybe, they don’t even believe he has the guts to be a leader.</p><p>But none of that matters when survival is at stake. Like it or not, they must find a way to work together—one way or another.</p><p><em>The Alters</em> blends a meaningful, emergent narrative—where choices truly matter—with survival gameplay, exploration, resource gathering, and base-building and management mechanics.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>The next Hearthstone expansion is Into the Emerald Dream, exploring the magical spirit realm specialized by Druids. As you might expect, this is a very Druid-focused expansion, and for the first time each class will get its own cards that use the Druid's "Choose One" keyword, alongside a number of other new mechanics. Naturally, Druids will get their own special tools, as we can exclusively reveal the new class <strong>legendary minion Hamuul Runetotem</strong> and several of his support cards.</p><p>Hamuul Runetotem himself uses the new keyword <strong>Imbue</strong>, which will be available to Druid, Hunter, Mage, Paladin, Priest, and Shaman. This keyword gives you a new Hero Power, which then upgrades as you play more Imbue cards. Some already-revealed Imbue cards take effect as Battlecry or Deathrattle effects, but Hamuul's takes effect as soon as the game starts, if you built your deck with only Nature spells. Then, it repeats the Imbue effect again for every two spells you cast during the game. It's a big, powerful effect as a trade-off for limiting your spell selection.</p><figure data-embed-type="comparison" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4448995-druid_edr_845_enus_hamuulrunetotem-114858_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4448996-druid_edr_845_enus_hamuulrunetotem-114858_signature.png" data-ref-id="1300-4448995,1300-4448996" data-size="large" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/1585/15855271/4448995-druid_edr_845_enus_hamuulrunetotem-114858_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/1585/15855271/4448996-druid_edr_845_enus_hamuulrunetotem-114858_signature.png"><p>Gallery</p>       <figcaption>The Hamuul Runetotem Druid Legendary, in Standard and Signature variants</figcaption> <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4448995-druid_edr_845_enus_hamuulrunetotem-114858_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4448996-druid_edr_845_enus_hamuulrunetotem-114858_signature.png"></figure><p>Druid's upgraded Hero Power summons a 1/1 Plant Golem, but keep in mind, it will be upgrading each time you play two Nature spells, to a 2/2 Plant Golem, and then 3/3 and so on.

The <strong>Horn of Plenty</strong> is a Nature spell that discovers another Nature spell, making it enough for a full Imbue all by itself. <strong>Reforestation</strong> is similarly generous, letting you choose between drawing a spell or minion, or rewarding your patience by doing both if you hold it for three turns. Finally, <strong>Photosynthesis</strong> will help you stay alive by restoring 6 health, while also supplying you with three random Druid spells. The generated spells aren't necessarily Nature spells, but since they're Druid spells, they have a pretty good chance to help feed your Imbue effect.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449918-druid_edr_270_enus_hornofplenty-115080_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449919-druid_edr_843_enus_reforestation-114848_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449920-druid_edr_843a_enus_aidoftheforest-115932_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449921-druid_edr_843b_enus_fertilize-115933_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449922-druid_edr_843t1_enus_reforestation-117402_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449923-druid_edr_848_enus_photosynthesis-114914_normal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4449918,1300-4449919,1300-4449920,1300-4449921,1300-4449922,1300-4449923" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4449918-druid_edr_270_enus_hornofplenty-115080_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4449919-druid_edr_843_enus_reforestation-114848_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4449920-druid_edr_843a_enus_aidoftheforest-115932_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4449921-druid_edr_843b_enus_fertilize-115933_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4449922-druid_edr_843t1_enus_reforestation-117402_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4449923-druid_edr_848_enus_photosynthesis-114914_normal.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449918-druid_edr_270_enus_hornofplenty-115080_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449919-druid_edr_843_enus_reforestation-114848_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449920-druid_edr_843a_enus_aidoftheforest-115932_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449921-druid_edr_843b_enus_fertilize-115933_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449922-druid_edr_843t1_enus_reforestation-117402_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449923-druid_edr_848_enus_photosynthesis-114914_normal.png"></figure><p>For the Into the Emerald Dream expansion, each class gets its own Wild God legendary card, along with its own Choose One card for the Druid flavor.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-sbmm/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/interview-i-sat-down-with-a-developer-behind-call-of-duty%E2%80%99s-sbmm.1118607/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-sbmm/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<div><p>Earlier this month, I attended the 2025 D.I.C.E (Design, Innovate, Communicate, Entertain) Summit, an annual event that see’s industry executives and leaders across the globe converge into one location to discuss the future of video games. It was an eye-opening event and I walked away with a sense that the industry has got a renewed sense of optimism, with the past few turbulent years catalysing a reinvention of creativity and technology that will undoubtedly lead to an exciting future.&nbsp;</p><p>One of my favourite conversations at the event, though, was on the four letters that strike fear in any good player who plays multiplayer games; SBMM. For those who don’t know, I started off this unorthodox journey into journalism as a Call of Duty YouTuber, who thrived and gained a following by uploading high-kill, low-death gameplay with the occasional commentary about how the next game leaked on the back of a Doritos packet. Finding ways to get around SBMM was always a part of my gaming routine and when I had the opportunity to speak with Charlie Olson,&nbsp;a veteran software programmer who spent nearly a decade at Raven Software in two stints, and wrote the&nbsp;Matchmaking Rating algorithm (MMR) for Call of Duty’s SBMM system, it was an offer I couldn’t refuse.</p><p>Olson initially wrote the MMR algorithm for China’s Call of Duty: Online in 2015, with the algorithm making its way into its first mainline entry with 2016’s Infinite Warfare.&nbsp;It’s a system that has been there ever since, with&nbsp;the matchmaker itself becoming more sophisticated over the years,&nbsp;but Olson’s rating algorithm remaining essentially unchanged. Olson would move on from Raven Software in 2020, going on to co-found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.invokation.games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Invokation Games</a> in 2022;&nbsp;a development studio that provides custom skill-rating and ranking systems to games.&nbsp;</p><p>After a handshake, a brief introduction, and a joke or two, we sat down to talk the nitty gritty about SBMM, how important it is for live-service games, and whether or not there’s any solutions&nbsp;for players in higher-skilled brackets. But one thing seems for certain; SBMM is not going away in Call of Duty, and arguably, any other live-service game that wants to be successful.&nbsp;</p></div>



<figure></figure>



<p><br>But first, I wanted to address the elephant in the room when it came to Call of Duty’s SBMM whitepaper and its legitimacy, because as we all know, there’s always a sense of doubt when a giant company tries to be transparent. When asked, Olson told me that the whitepaper is accurate and he can attest to it based on his own analysis at Call of Duty and on other games. Live-service games need SBMM, and SBMM needs MMR, he said. He continued to explain that both are needed to ensure long-term sustainability and player engagement, which are both crucial components in ensuring a successful live-service game. “But&nbsp;that doesn’t mean everyone should just shut up and like SBMM,” said Olson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On stats, Olson explained that around half of players would be driven to stop playing without SBMM, because the “sometimes you stomp, sometimes you get stomped” narrative only applies to around 40% of players by skill, with 10% of the very top players doing 90% of the pubstomping. Olson used XDefiant as an example of churn-based matchmaking and explained that although XDefiant had team-balancing, “people don’t like being the weak link repeatedly and high-skill players don’t like carrying a team of potatoes all the time.”</p>



<figure><figcaption>Ubisoft’s XDefiant announced it’s closure seven months after its release</figcaption></figure>



<p>When asked for a solution to SBMM, Olson believes that it is needed to ensure long-term sustainability for a live-service game, however thinks that its solution is transparency of where players rank with their skill. “The massive problem with SBMM though is that you don’t know what league you’re in anymore. SBMM takes away the sense of skill and mastery. There’s less skill feedback, stats don’t matter as much, KD is less of a bragging right; it’s a serious design problem really.”</p>



<p>He continued, “If you are trying to get better at the game, SBMM just rewards you with tougher opponents.&nbsp;I’d even say that SBMM punishes players for being good. That’s unfair, and players are right to complain about it.”</p>



<div><p>Olson thinks one solution is to reward players with more XP for being better at the game. “Casual  doesn’t need to be completely about skill like Ranked&nbsp;, but you should be able to see something about the average skill of your lobby or opponents, like maybe this match is a gold tier so you get a 1.2 XP multiplier. You should be able to see your MMR (matchmaking-rating, aka skill-rating) in the combat record. You shouldn’t have to file a personal data request with Activision just to get that information.”</p><p>He went on to explain that he did pitch such a system for Call of Duty on multiple occasions, even at a meeting at Infinity Ward during 2019’s Modern Warfare development. However, Olson noted that the lack of bandwidth that studios have to consider new ideas outside of the lead studio make such pitches an up-hill battle, especially coming from a non-designer. “So, I tried, but it didn’t catch on,” he said. “The other reason I think it didn’t catch on is that most designers just don’t know much about how MMR works and therefore aren’t comfortable using it as a component for design,” he continued.</p></div>



<figure><figcaption>Infinity Ward’s Office</figcaption></figure>



<div><p>I asked Olson to explain SBMM in a ‘for dummies’ explanation, to which he explained that SBMM consists of three different systems;&nbsp;matchmaking, team-balancing, and MMR (matchmaking-rating or skill-rating).&nbsp;MMR is the number that the matchmaker and team-balancer uses. The MMR system takes into consideration the ratings of everyone in the match and updates your rating based on your relative performance. In CoD, Olson said that that the MMR is more volatile in the mid-range, which is an issue that could be addressed. He said that CoD players who requested their data from Activision are likely seeing that volatility too, with their MMR bouncing around without a clear indicator as to why. But that’s why Olson believes that players should openly be able to see their MMR, for transparency and so they can see what’s going on. He noted that preventing people from seeing their MMR, or making you data request it from Activision leads to a lack of faith and ultimately leads to conspiracy theories that we often see flooding the internet.</p><p>“Contrary to what some players believe, you really don’t have to try your hardest every match. If you go off-META, your MMR will adapt after a few bad games, and matches will get easier. The exception would be when you’re playing low pop modes that attract high skill players, or during Open Betas,” he said. For example, you probably shouldn’t expect a gamemode like Domination, a gamemode that traditionally attracts higher-skilled players to get much easier. Speaking of conspiracy theories, Olson also pointed out that CoD’s SBMM gets mistaken for&nbsp;“EOMM” (Engagement-Optimized Matchmaking), but it’s really just because the MMR is highly responsive and volatile.</p></div>



<figure><figcaption>Marvel Rivals – A game with EOMM</figcaption></figure>



<p>What’s clear is that SBMM in CoD (and other live-service games) is likely never going to go away. They are fundamental systems to keep a game alive and thriving by keeping players around and has become even more apparent recently following Activision’s clamp down on VPN’s and patching SBMM ‘get around’ methods like two boxing – a method where a player would join the session of a lower-skilled dummy account to enter a lower-skilled lobby. The issue with CoD in particular seems to be transparency and players should be rewarded for being good at the game. Be that XP bonuses as Olson suggested, or even going one step further and offering exclusive calling cards, emblems, and so on.</p>



<div><p>Finding a solution to appease everyone when it comes to SBMM is definitely a complex issue, but one that should be talked about more at length.&nbsp;</p><p>Insider Gaming has also invited&nbsp;Charlie Olson to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhWUIWZUTas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming podcast</a>, to sit down and answer some of your questions at length on the issues. </p><p>So, if you have any questions, please visit the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/ama-charlie-olson-a-developer-who-wrote-call-of-dutys-sbmm.1697/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>, create an account, and ask away. And fingers crossed, we’ll have Olson as a guest in the coming weeks.</p></div>

It’s in the works at UK studio Playground, which is known for the much-loved Forza Horizon series of driving games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://youtu.be/7r1t_oDC7z8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the latest episode of the Xbox Podcast</a>, Craig Duncan (formerly Rare studio head who took over as head of Xbox Game Studios last fall) moved to reassure fans that this new Fable game is “definitely worth the wait.”</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“I just want to start with, really excited about progress,” Duncan began. “Really excited about where Playground are. We previously announced the date for Fable as 2025. We are actually going to give Fable more time, and it’s going to ship in 2026 now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While I know that’s not maybe the news people want to hear, what I want to assure people of is that it’s definitely worth the wait. I have unequivocal confidence in the Playground team. If you think about their history and legacy for Forza Horizon, the last few games, critically acclaimed, 92 Metacritic, award-winning, beautiful, play great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And just what they’re bringing to Fable as a franchise, just think of the visuals of what you expect of Playground games plus amazing gameplay, British humor, Playground’s version of Albion. So inspired by what’s gone before with the franchise but their take, in quite frankly the most beautifully realized version of Albion you’ve ever seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So really excited about the plans, and really excited about the future. I want the community to understand that we do these things for the best of the games and the teams, and ultimately that results in the best game for the community.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same breath as announcing the delay, Microsoft revealed 50 seconds of brand new pre-alpha gameplay showing Fable combat, some city walking scenes, a clip of the main character riding a horse through a fantasy-styled forest area, and of course, kicking a chicken. The admittedly brief gameplay gives us a decent idea of what Playground is going for here, as well as the visual fidelity Duncan mentioned on the podcast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We see combat with a one-handed sword, a two-handed hammer, a two-handed sword, and what looks like a fireball magic attack. One cutscene shows a man laying some sausages inside a trap. It emerges this is to entice a werewolf-type creature, who the main character subsequently fights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Playground’s revival of the fantasy role-playing game series was announced in 2020 as a “new beginning.” 2023’s Xbox Game Showcase then gave us a better idea of what to expect with a reveal courtesy of The IT Crowd's Richard Ayoade. Then, last year, Microsoft showed its Fable reboot once more, this time with a new trailer during its Xbox Showcase event in June 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This reboot is the first mainline Fable game since 2010's Fable 3 and one of Xbox Game Studios' biggest upcoming titles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Fior mes Ivèrno, the town at the centre of the Emerald Stair region, burns to the ground. Its people, already pushed to the edge of starvation thanks to failed harvests, are driven from their homeland by the tyrannical Steel Garotte, an army of fanatical paladins from the invading Aedyr Empire. When the flames finally fade, the city is removed from your map, its ruins occupied by the paladins who razed it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this is an Obsidian game. And so, as the developer’s tradition of branching storylines and player choice dictates, there is a way to prevent the town from burning. But unlike most choice-supporting RPGs, this isn’t achieved via completing an opposing mission branch. There simply isn’t a quest to stop this event from happening. Instead, the Steel Garotte is hidden in the region, plotting the town’s downfall, and it’s up to you to find them without instruction or waypoint. It’s an incredibly organic approach to altering the course of Avowed’s story, rewarding curiosity and authentic choices as opposed to the simple obedience of following an objective list in a journal. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/25/city-burning-avowed-1740495247930.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fior mes Ivèrno burns to the ground if you don't investigate the Steel Garotte. | Image credit: Obsidian / Xbox</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The journey towards saving Fior mes Ivèrno begins with rumblings and rumours. NPCs mention sightings of mysterious figures in the wilderness. Notes and documents theorise that the Steel Garotte has established a foothold in Emerald Stair. It's the sort of stuff that you could mistake for mere background world building, but this is actually the first breadcrumbs on a vital trail. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those breadcrumbs can be investigated in a number of ways. A hands-off approach is available through the use of intelligence-gathering spies. If you’re a dab hand at manipulating conversations you may have encouraged Elowe, a member of the Paradis resistance found in Avowed’s first region, to work as your spy. She’s not your only option; while wandering Emerald Stair’s forest you can bump into Kylecg, a spy in the employ of the Aedyran Ambassador who can also be sent to investigate those Steel Garotte rumours. Recruit either of these spies and they’ll send you a letter exposing the paladins’ plans before it's too late. It’s a neat reward for engaging with Avowed’s characters and pushing beyond the surface of their dialogue trees.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s no “Investigate the Steel Garotte” task added to your journal. For all this to work, you need to pay attention.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You’d be forgiven for never recruiting Kylecg or Elowe at all, though. While they are both easily encountered on your journey, Avowed’s story does not demand that they become spies. Thankfully, their help is not mandatory in uncovering the Steel Garotte’s hidden base. In fact, you can do it with no aid at all by simply exploring every inch of Emerald Stair; a completionist’s approach will eventually lead you to the inconspicuously named “Waterfall Cave" and the gang of plotting paladins inside. That’s enough to stop them… provided you find the cave and kill everyone before they stoke the fires as part of the region’s final main quest, that is. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the middleground between being directly told via a letter and stumbling across the paladins by random chance that proves the most satisfying, though. An optional side quest, Steel Resolve, will usher you in the right direction, as well as provide a satisfying story that neatly links to the grander plot. What starts as a run-of-the-mill bounty contract to kill some local bandits – a task you would typically consider open world “filler” – morphs into a quest to root out a traitor hiding amongst the ranks of Emerald Stair’s cohort of rangers. It’s classic RPG detective work that sees you unearth secret notes, trip over false leads, and bounce from one suspect to the next as you hunt for the dialogue tree that will force someone to crack. And crack they do – you eventually discover the headstrong Dorso is responsible for the murder of one of her colleagues and the imprisonment of another. Her admission of guilt opens up the option of executing her on the spot, but keep pushing and her story takes a much more interesting turn. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/25/inquisitor-lodwyn-avowed-1740495307036.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Inquisitor Lödwyn, leader of the Steel Garotte, quite literally has fire on her mind. | Image credit: Obsidian / Xbox</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously mentioned, Emerald Stair is suffering from famine. The people are starving. Somewhat understandably, Dorso is furious with the region’s impotent leadership, so much so that she’s decided Emerald Stair would fare better under the invading Aedyr Empire’s colonial rule. She’s been undermining the rangers in an attempt to soften them up so that the Steel Garotte may take control with minimal resistance. Ask the right questions and Dorso will eventually reveal that the paladins are plotting their takeover from a secret cave hidden behind a waterfall. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is all good stuff but the thing I really love about Obsidian’s approach here is that the reveal of the secret headquarters – be that via Dorso or your spy’s correspondence – does not trigger a quest to save Fior mes Ivèrno. There’s no “Investigate the Steel Garotte” task added to your journal. For all this to work, you need to pay attention and follow up on the information you’ve provided. Avowed is most certainly a<em> video game</em> RPG, but in this moment it does its best to emulate a tabletop RPG in which a dungeon master subtly drops a lead that can only unfold if a player notices it. And, like in those tabletop campaigns, Avowed blooms into something truly special if you chase the bait.   </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This secret quest is about exploring beyond the limits of unwritten video game rules.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The locked gate inside the secret cave is guarded by two paladins who pose a pretty simple ultimatum; either look the other way or die by their hand. They’re even willing to offer a bribe. Your choice here will no doubt be influenced by your existing relationship with the Steel Garotte and its Darth Vader-ish leader, Inquisitor Lödwyn. While very clearly an “evil” faction, Avowed allows you to express support for the Steel Garotte’s fanatical approach, and anyone on a villainous playthrough will want to leave them undisturbed. Everyone else has a few other options; you can butcher the guard and loot the key from their corpse, use an invisibility spell and lockpick to enter unseen, or make good use of Avowed’s exceptional level design and duck into a secret tunnel to bypass the guards entirely. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the locked gate, as you’d expect, lies a whole detachment of paladins ready to cause mayhem. Instructional notes from Lödwyn found around the cave reveal their mission: the Steel Garotte plans to burn Fior mes Ivèrno to the ground. These notes are your only insight into what lies ahead; push on with the main quest without investigating the cave and the pyrotechnic display comes without warning. But now you have warning, it’s obvious what needs to be done to save the city: kill everyone in the cave. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your bloody efforts are successful… ish. The Steel Garotte still attacks Fior mes Ivèrno, but with far fewer troops than it otherwise would have. And so rather than overwhelm the city’s defenders with fire and swords, the paladins are repelled. Their failure means that Fior mes Ivèrno remains open for business for the rest of the game. You can revisit its streets, continue to trade with its merchants, and complete any unfinished business you have there. </p><div id="how-do-you-rank-obsidians-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">How do you rank Obsidian's games?</h3><h3>How do you rank Obsidian's games?</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/avowed/comments/1iv0j82/bummed_that_there_was_a_way_to_prevent_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">couple of threads</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/avowed/comments/1itxvqo/kai_you_didnt_stop_the_steel_garrote/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Reddit</a> complaining that Avowed makes “no effort” to inform you about how you can save Fior mes Ivèrno. It’s in these complaints that the real magic of this story is revealed. This whole secret section of Avowed is about more than just ensuring a city remains accessible on your map. It’s about encouraging genuine curiosity. It’s about exploring beyond the limits of unwritten video game rules. It’s about recognising your ability to properly comprehend and respond to information. It is a reward for acting on something because you care about the results of a conflict, not because it ticks off a box in a quest log. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through this quest that is not actually a quest, we see an example of Avowed’s hidden depths. Beneath the thick surface layer of action-heavy combat lies an admirably knotty RPG full of intersecting choices. Side quests overlap with main missions to adjust the flow of the story. Minor decisions, such as convincing a woman in a church to be your informant, can result in major payoffs many hours later. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the magic that RPGs are built upon – the stuff that Baldur’s Gate 3 is adored for – and I wish more games were willing to put trust in their players to find optional quests that are more impactful than simple collectable trinkets. Imagine if, in Playground’s upcoming Fable, pushing for an evil playthrough organically leads you to a thieves den where, if you just sit and listen for a while, you can eavesdrop on a conversation which reveals a planned heist that overlaps with an upcoming main quest. Or a discovery in a future Assassin’s Creed game that puts you on the trail of a secret target whose death allows you to step into an open power vacuum. These kinds of activities, when presented without any on-screen prompt or quest log addition, become genuine discoveries rather than video game “content.” They are an excellent example of the RPG golden standard: a world that responds to your choices. And in its secret quest to save Fior mes Ivèrno, Avowed really captures the true spirit of role-playing games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Ahead of its release on August 28, the PC requirements for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6514614/" data-ref-id="1100-6514614">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> have gone live on Steam. It's not the most exhaustive list of minimum and recommended PC requirements--especially this far out from its launch--but it does give a good indicator of what you'll need to run the Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater remake.</p><p>On the GPU side, the minimum recommendation here is an RTX 2060 Nvidia graphics card, with no mention of an AMD equivalent yet, and it's recommended that you have an RTX 3080 GPU. Early looks at Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater have shown off a very lush environment for players to sneak through, and with the game being developed in Unreal Engine 5, you're naturally going to need a lot of storage capacity for the game's install files.</p><p>Konami recommends 100GB of storage capacity, and while an SSD isn't mandatory, it is recommended. Beyond that, the CPU and RAM requirements seem quite reasonable, although the PC requirements are subject to change before the game arrives. We also don't know yet what these requirements are targeting in terms of resolution and frame rates.</p><h2>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Minimum PC requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>Operating System:</strong> Windows 10, Windows 11 (64-bit OS required)</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel i5-8600 or AMD Ryzen 5 3600</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> RTX 2060 Super (8GB)</li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 12</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 100 GB available space</li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> SSD recommended</li></ul><h2>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Recommended PC requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>Operating System:</strong> Windows 10, Windows 11 (64-bit OS required)</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel i7-8700K or AMD Ryzen 5 3600</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> RTX 3080</li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 12</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 100 GB available space</li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> SSD recommended</li></ul><p>If you're looking to save some cash, you can preorder Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and get a 25% discount off of a Steam key for the game from Fanatical. This drops the price down to $52.49 for the standard edition and $60 for the deluxe version that comes with 48-hour early access.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will also launch for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p>
