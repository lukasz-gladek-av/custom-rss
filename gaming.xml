			<p>Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy has quite the history, this remake bringing back Benoit Sokal’s Amerzone from 1998, which itself was based on a comic strip from 1986. Amerzone was the first major adventure game Sokal was behind, setting the foundations for its better known cousin, Syberia. Microids’ remake has a lot to live up to from a reputational perspective, and it generally does.</p>
<p><iframe title="Amerzone: The Explorer's Legacy - Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q62WD2p-uaA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy puts players in the shoes of a nameless journalist, who has their first big break with the opportunity to interview the explorer Alexandre Valembois. Valembois has agreed to speak about his trip to the mysterious South American country of Amerzone, which took place approximately 50 years prior to the events of the game. However, the invite for an interview takes a turn and it leads to the journalist embarking on a trip to Amerzone to return an egg.</p>



<p>This isn’t any old egg that you buy by the half-dozen, but one that ties into the mythology of the indigenous people of Amerzone, holding within it a unique species of bird that is believed to bring good luck to Amerzone. It may seem like a superstition, but since the egg left the country, Amerzone has fallen into a military dictatorship and the indigenous groups have been all but wiped out. Getting to Amerzone is no easy feat since the country’s borders are closed with any interlopers shot on sight. Luckily for the journalist, Valembois has built a vehicle called a Hydrofloat that has all sorts of modes that allows someone to travel from the Brittany coast of France to the secretive South American nation and within it too.</p>

<p>Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy is the very definition of a point and click adventure game. There is no free movement for players. Instead you look in a direction where an arrow appears, press a button, and the character will move along a predetermined path on their own. You can watch the walking animation or choose to skip and be instantly be transported to the next location. In most areas, you will find items to interact with that will either be useful items that you put in your inventory or provide you with information.</p>

<p>You see, aside from attempting to return the egg to its rightful place the journalist is documenting their journey too. Along the way, different investigations will pop up and you can decide to dig further into these by exploring each location thoroughly or moving on and focusing on the main path. Naturally, you will come across items related to these side investigations, and most will draw you in. Amerzone’s environmental story telling is excellent providing a lot of contextual information so you can piece together what has happened in the past, whether it is to do with Valembois’ own story or something completely different.</p>
<p>Amerzone’s main story is fine and does move along at a decent pace. It has some good writing but there are moments which could have benefited from having a bit more of a build-up or not being quite so predictable. You can guess what will happen with the main story beats pretty early on, but with a game like this the journey is more important. The Traveler mode will have more documents and clues to find in the environment to help with puzzles, along with a hint system that will eventually give you the answer if you get stuck. The Adventurer mode, meanwhile, provides fewer clues meaning you will get stuck more often and have to connect the clues yourself to find solutions.</p>

<p>Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy does look very good with environments that have lots of detail to them, from thick foliage in the jungles to some nicely designed beaches on Shipwreck Island. There are some minor performance issues here and there with a bit of stuttering, but on the whole the game performs fine too, and it’s hardly an issue for this style of game. Amerzone’s music is well done too with tunes that fit the atmosphere, though there are moments of silence that could have been filled with song.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/ghost-of-yotei-launches-october-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>The Onryo’s List</strong></p><p>Alongside today’s news, we’ve also released our latest trailer for <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, “The Onryo’s List.” Sixteen years ago in the heart of Ezo (called Hokkaido in present day), a gang of outlaws known as the Yotei Six took everything from Atsu. They killed her family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree outside her home. But Atsu survived. She learned to fight, to kill, and to hunt, and after years away she has returned to her home with a list of six names: The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito.</p><p>One by one, she’s hunting them down to avenge her family, armed with the same katana used to pin her to that burning tree all those years ago. But while Atsu’s story begins with vengeance, she’ll find there’s more to her journey than just revenge. As she explores Ezo, Atsu will meet unlikely allies and forge connections that help give her a new sense of purpose.</p><p>We hope the brief looks in today’s trailer give you a taste of what you can expect from <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>. Beyond your first look at the Yotei Six, you’ll spot some of the gorgeous scenery of Ezo as well as a handful of Atsu’s new weapons, a few of her allies, and even a new gameplay mechanic that will allow you to glimpse Atsu’s past and understand everything that was taken from her.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>But we’ve only scratched the surface. In <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, we’ve built upon and evolved the way you explore the open world, offering even more freedom and variety than in <em><a title="Games > Ghost of Tsushima [32 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a></em>. You’ll choose which leads to follow as you pick which Yotei Six member you want to hunt down first. Atsu can also track other dangerous targets and claim bounties, or seek out weapon sensei to learn new skills. Ezo is wild, and as deadly as it is beautiful. As you trek across the open world you’ll find unexpected dangers and peaceful reprieves (including some returning activities from Tsushima), and you’ll be able to build a campfire anywhere in the open world for a rest under the stars. We want you to have the freedom to explore Ezo however you decide to, and we can’t wait to share more.</p><p><strong>Pre-Orders</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ghost-of-Yotei_Pre-Orders_04-23-25_001.jpg"></a></figure><p>Today we can also reveal that pre-orders for <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> begin next week, on May 2 at 10:00 a.m. in your local time zone (10:00 a.m. ET for those in the United States), and you’ll be able to choose between multiple different editions, including our amazing Collector’s Edition.</p><p>First, if you pre-order any edition of <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> you’ll receive a unique in-game mask, as well as a set of seven <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [47,430 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> Network avatars featuring concept art of Atsu and each member of the Yotei Six at launch.

You’ll also receive a unique horse color and unique saddle dye, plus an in-game Charm, gold Sword Kit, and an early unlock of Traveler’s Maps, which allow you to find statues throughout the world to upgrade your skills.</p><p><strong>Collector’s Edition</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ghost-of-Yotei_Pre-Orders_04-23-25_004.jpg"></a></figure><p>Finally, we are thrilled to reveal the <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> Collector’s Edition, which will be available for pre-order at <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Direct</a> in parts of the world where it is available, or at select retailers in other regions. Collector’s Edition pricing will be announced at a later date.</p><p>This packed edition includes all of the pre-order bonuses, all in-game items from the Digital Deluxe Edition, and a digital copy of the game, as well as a replica display edition of Atsu’s Ghost mask. The mask is built to-scale with Jin’s mask from our <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> Collector’s Edition. If you have both, they look great next to each other on a shelf! The mask measures 6.8 x 5 x 5.9 inches and is made of resin, plus includes its own display stand.</p><p>Also included is a replica of Atsu’s sash, complete with the names of all six members of the Yotei Six (but you’ll have to cross them off yourself). The sash measures 71 inches long and is made of a cotton blend, a perfect cosplay accessory or wall decoration.</p><p>There’s also a replica of the Tsuba from Atsu’s katana, forged by her father in the image of two twin wolves. This Tsuba measures roughly 3 x 3 inches and also includes its own display stand.</p><p>In addition to all of the above, the <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> Collector’s Edition also includes a pouch of coins and instructions to play Zeni Hajiki, a game of skill you’ll play throughout <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>. There’s also a foldable papercraft ginkgo tree along with a wolf at its base, and a set of four 5 x 7-inch art cards featuring the sash, the wolf, Atsu’s Ghost mask, and our key art.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"It's been nearly five years since we shipped <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, and in that time we’ve been hard at work making Ghost of Yōtei something special," wrote Sucker Punch's Andrew Goldfarb, announcing today's release date news. </p>
<p>"While the stories are unrelated, it's important to us to make this a worthy follow-up to Jin's journey, and we can't wait for you to experience Atsu's quest for vengeance later this year."</p>
<p>The studio also released a new trailer for Ghost of Yōtei, which you can check out below.</p>
<p>This trailer gives us more insight into Atsu's aforementioned quest for vengeance. We already knew she was seeking revenge for her ravaged home and family life, but now we know just <em>who </em>it is she is hunting down - that would be a gang of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six.</p>
<p>"They killed her family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree outside her home. But Atsu survived. She learned to fight, to kill, and to hunt, and after years away she has returned to her home with a list of six names: The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito," Sucker Punch teases.</p>

<p>Today's trailer is but a small taste of what players can expect on Ghost of Yōtei's release, the developer added. Sucker Punch previously said it is going to ensure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-follow-up-will-have-a-less-repetitive-open-world">Ghost of Yōtei has a less repetitive open world compared to its predecessor</a>, with criticisms for Ghost of Tsushima often directed at its somewhat repetitive activities, so this remark is in keeping with the studio's overall plan for the sequel.</p>
<p>Those interested in pre-ordering Ghost of Yōtei will be able to do so from next week, with those pre-orders starting on 2nd May (how is it May next week?!). As is the case with many releases these days, there will be a number of different editions to choose from.Regardless of which edition you plump for, those who do pre-order will receive a unique in-game mask, as well as a set of seven PSN avatars featuring concept art of Atsu and each member of the Yōtei Six (see below).</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Sucker Punch affirmed that it remained committed to Ghost of Yōtei's 2025 release window on PS5. There had been some speculation the studio and PlayStation may nudge it back a touch to make way for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">a game many expect will dominate the gaming landscape when it releases this autumn</a> (unless it gets delayed).</p>

            <p>After plenty of rumours, speculation and leaks, Bethesda finally announced and released the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">spruced up version of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion last night</a>.</p>
<p>Soon after this, the studio stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-say-no-official-mod-support-for-its-oblivion-remaster">there was no official mod support for its Oblivion remaster</a>, but that hasn't stopped plenty of players already releasing mods for it anyway.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, there are currently 96 Oblivion Remastered mods <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/oblivionremastered/mods?sort=updatedAt&amp;page=1">available on Nexus Mods</a> (at least as I can see while not being logged in), but I suspect it will soon pass 100.</p>
<p>These mods include things like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/100">Faster (And Slower) Levelling</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/97">Slower Item Degradation</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/13">improved HUDs</a>. There's also the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/15">Adoring Fan desktop shortcut icon replacer</a>, because <em>of course </em>he is going to pop up.</p>
<p>So, yes, people have certainly been busy since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> debuted yesterday. Meanwhile, I am sitting here just chuffed that I have at least managed to get it installed on my Xbox in the time since last night.</p>

<p>Away from my not-very-impressive-Xbox-flex, The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered has pulled in some impressive player numbers for Bethesda and co-developer Virtuos on Steam, where it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-off-to-a-good-start-on-steam">has an 182,298 concurrent player peak so far</a>. Are you one of them?</p>
<p>Earlier this month our Jim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">called upon Bethesda to remake Morrowind rather than Oblivion</a>. "You cowards," Jim wrote, calling Morrowind a "special game, where a beautifully unique fantasy setting is locked away behind technology and interface design that has aged particularly badly".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>New Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mods released today introduce two new full-fledged playable characters as well as new abilities for playable Sephiroth.</p>
<p>Following the video preview shared <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-playahble-characters-pc/">last week</a>, D3DNieR released today on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/976?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a> a new <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/976?tab=description">mod</a> that introduces playable versions of Reno and Rude. The two new characters, which replace Cloud and Tifa, have some small issues, but they feel like proper playable characters with some unique mechanics, such as Rude's ability to use more basic attacks after using the Unbridled Strength skill, the ability to cancel some animations by pressing the strong attack button, a counterattack, and much more.</p>
<p>While Sephiroth has been made playable past the flashback sequence at the beginning of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth already, his moveset is considerably limited compared to the other playable characters. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/980?tab=videos">The new mod</a> released by Eulymedon today, however, partially addresses this issue by introducing abilities taken from the boss version of Sephiroth, including Heartless Angel, Errant Whisper, Wicked Augment, and more. You can check how these abilities work in the video below.</p>

			<p>Ghost of Yotei has been rated in Taiwan today, suggesting that, judging from some precedents, the game may not be too far from release.</p>
<p>As reported by Gematsu, the second entry in the series developed by Sucker Punch received an R rating for violence, tobacco and alcohol and inappropriate language, which was predictable looking at the first entry in the series. While the rating also highlights how a launch date has not been revealed yet, we are likely going to hear more about it very soon, as not much time usually passes from the first ratings in Asian countries to the release date announcements. For Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, another big PlayStation 5 exclusive launching in 2025, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/">launch date</a> was confirmed a little over a month after the game was rated in <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-korean-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/">South Korea.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Ghost of Yotei has been rated in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Gematsu page: <a href="https://t.co/Kbfm65SWCI">https://t.co/Kbfm65SWCI</a> <a href="https://t.co/vBIef8RHMH">pic.twitter.com/vBIef8RHMH</a></p>
<p>— Gematsu (@gematsu) <a href="https://twitter.com/gematsu/status/1914870872667488508?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We haven't seen much of Ghost of Yotei since its announcement last year. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-gets-new-details-from-official-website/">Back in March</a>, the game's official website confirmed some details regarding the new protagonist, Atsu, and some new gameplay mechanics, including new weapons like the odachi, kusarigama, and dual katanas, more varied environments that players will be able to take advantage of, and more.</p>
<p>Ghost of Yotei is scheduled to release in 2025 on PlayStation 5. A PC version has yet to be officially announced, though there's little doubt that a port will be coming at some point.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tenderfoot-tactics">Tenderfoot Tactics</a> is a wistful and dreamlike turn-based indie that I had a real soft spot for the year it released. It's still available on Steam and well worth a look, but won't be available on the Xbox Store from today. In an act of solidarity with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">BDS boycott of Microsoft</a> following their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/23/israeli-military-gaza-war-microsoft">reported connections with the Israeli military</a>, the development team have removed their game from sale on Microsoft's storefronts.</p>

Nintendo does not have the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> stock to meet customer demand in Japan, it has admitted, in a stark warning from the company's president.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media this morning, <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1914982671522083155">Nintendo boss Shuntaro Furukawa revealed</a> an astonishing 2.2 million people had applied to buy a Switch via the My Nintendo Store as part of a lottery process.
</p>
<p>
Furukawa admitted this was a number that "far exceeds expectations" and "far exceeds the number of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles that can be delivered" at launch.

</figure>
<p>In Japan, Nintendo has offered a cheaper, region-locked version of Switch 2 that will only play Japanese games and only be compatible with Japanese Nintendo accounts. The thinking here is that this version can be offered to Nintendo's key home market, which is currently impacted by a weak Yen, while also ensuring it cannot be bought up and resold online to those elsewhere. 
</p>
<p>But creating a Japan-only version of Switch 2 may also present its own problems - such as creating an additional line of stock that has to be manufactured separately, and cannot be topped up by additional units made for elsewhere.</p>
<p>
Nintendo is now telling its Japanese fans that "a significant number of customers" will be unable to get Switch 2 at launch. Anyone who has applied to buy the console so far will be automatically entered into a second lottery - but this too will result in an undisclosed number of applications being unsuccessful.
</p>
<p>
"We deeply apologise for not being able to meet your expectations despite our prior preparations," Furukawa wrote.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo says it is "further strengthening" its Switch 2 production as a result, and that pre-orders via other Japanese retailers will open tomorrow, should fans want to try their luck there.
</p>
<p>
"With the cooperation of retailers, we will continue to ship the console and make efforts to get as many Nintendo Switch 2 consoles as possible into your hands," Furukawa added.
</p>
<p>
"We plan to continue producing and shipping a considerable number of Nintendo Switch 2 units in the future. We apologise for the delay in our ability to meet your expectations, and we appreciate your understanding."
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media, <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1914985844189933700">Dr Serkan Toto</a>, CEO of Japanese game industry consultancy firm Kantan Games, described the amount of interest in Switch 2 as "ridiculous", but also noted Nintendo had "originally promised enough supply for launch - which of course immediately sounded like a fairy tale for anybody with a basic understanding of the game market".
</p>
<p>
Overseas, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">Switch 2's launch has already proven bumpy in North America</a> - where Nintendo has had to factor in the current US trade war with China into its launch pricing. In the US, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">Switch 2 will still arrive on 5th June alongside the rest of the world, though prices for its accessories have now been raised</a>.

            <p>It may have now released its own remaster of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, but that doesn't mean Bethesda is planning on shutting down work on the fan-made Skyblivion mod.</p>
<p>Let's be honest, we all knew a spruced up version of Oblivion was on the cards. Along with those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">screenshots on developer Virtuos' website</a>, references to the project were also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-references-now-found-on-bethesdas-website">spotted on Bethesda's own website</a> before Bethesda had made any official announcement. Then last night, it finally got around to telling us what we all knew already: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered is real</a>, and available to play now.</p>

<p>However, while this was an exciting bit of news for many, there is one particular group this announcement was perhaps less than welcome for, at least in terms of timing. That would be TESRenewal, the team working Skyblivion, a volunteer-based project seeking to remake Oblivion in the Skyrim engine.</p>
<p>When word of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remaster started gaining more traction last week, project lead Rebelzize said Bethesda's then-impending announcement "changes nothing" as far as the Skyblivion team were concerned. Rebelzize, on the outside at least, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skyblivion-fan-project-lead-reacts-to-oblivion-remake-news-with-all-love-and-no-hate">remained positive about the project and the upcoming remaster being able to both thrive</a>, stating it was a "win-win" for fans of Oblivion.</p>
<p>Now, the TESRenewal team has gone one step further and assured its Skyblivion community Bethesda has "no intention of shutting down our project". It additionally thanked the studio for the Oblivion Remastered game keys Bethesda gifted the entire modding team.</p>
<p>"This means so much to us. Thank you for everything," the <a href="https://x.com/TESRSkyblivion/status/1914754195674333459">TESRenewal team shared on social media</a>.</p>

<p>While this is good news for the Skyblivion team and all those looking forward to the project's release (which is slated for some time this year), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-say-no-official-mod-support-for-its-oblivion-remaster">Bethesda itself has said it has no plans for Oblivion Remastered official mod support</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile since its release last night, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> has pulled in some impressive player numbers for Bethesda and co-developer Virtuos.

            <p>There's no official mod support for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>. But when has that ever stopped modders from forcibly isekai-ing their favourite anime characters into the wrong realm? Not even 24 hours have passed since the fantasy RPG remaster was released in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-release-oblivion-remastered-for-50">"surprise" announcement</a> by Bethesda, and the modding scene has already created <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/oblivionremastered/mods">90+ mods and counting</a> (and that's just on one popular modding website). What's most intriguing is that they've discovered some old mods for the original game still work in the remaster. It's an exciting time to be an Elder Scrolls modder. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivionmods/comments/1k5c77z/from_the_bethesda_discord/">posted on Reddit</a>, one curious player dusted off a simple mod from 2008 which <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/20947">adds late game armour</a> to your prison cell at the start of the game. When they tested this in the new remaster it "worked perfectly" - but only after manually updating a plugins.txt file in the game's folders. </p>
<p>This plugins file is usually handled by the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/2097">Oblivion mod manager</a> but that won't work in the remaster, so you have to add an extra line to the end of the .txt file by hand. But aside from that bit of fiddling, it works. Another user followed the same steps and found that, yes, the spiffy Daedric armour from late in the game <a href="https://imgur.com/a/iHwxwHu">does indeed appear</a> in your shiny remastered cell. </p>
<p>While this opens up a lot of possibilities, it'll likely take time for the roving gangs of modders to scrounge their way through the ancient library of Oblivion mods in search of the most compatible ones. Right now it looks like simpler mods which involve model swaps are doable, provided you add new models to Unreal's paks (paks are basically beefy little folders full of assets). But not everything is going to be so cut and dry. Also, this is all in service of a fancy schmancy remaster, which means many older glow-up mods, like texture packs, are somewhat redundant. But others which involve new quests or characters, or rejigged systems of magic, might feasibly be ported. Who knows.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bethesda</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Meanwhile, modders are cracking on with other straightforward alterations for the remaster. On NexusMods, there's a mod that <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/72">bumps up the colour</a> so that the world looks as bright and saturated as you remember. Another <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/109">removes the need to repair weapons</a>. And, of course, there's one that lets you <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/14">skip the Bethesda and Virtuos logo screens</a> on startup. </p>
<p>The current most popular mod lets you <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/48">remove carry weight restrictions</a> altogether. Which I find deeply insulting to the spirit of Oblivion. Is it even an Elder Scrolls game if you don't spend half your time by the roadside dumping surplus arrows and pots you accidentally picked up in a neighbour's house? Come on, folks. Embrace the chafe.</p>
<p>The remaster changed a lot of stuff. The user interface, for instance, has been completely reworked. And your character's movement has seen a lot of tweaks and improvements. There are new sound effects, VFX, and it's all slathered in Unreal's real-time lighting. Most significantly, the levelling system has been redesigned, so the divisive level scaling you may remember from - ugh - two decades ago is no longer present in the same form. I can't wait to see some absolute masochist mod it back in.</p></div>

            <p>
Who would have suspected Bethesda to shadow drop Oblivion yesterday! Well, quite a lot of us, in fact. 
</p>
<p>
But regardless of whether fans had already prepped themselves for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> or not, they turned up in huge numbers.
</p>
<p>
Over on Steam, which <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2623190/charts/">publicly reveals its player data</a>, Oblivion Remastered has an 182,298 concurrent player peak so far - placing it ahead of anything else on Steam except stalwarts <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>.

<p>
Oblivion Remastered is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the best-selling game on Steam right now, and has launched with a Very Positive user review rating from those who have played.
</p>
<p>
Of course, Steam's numbers only count for a fraction of those who have jumped in so far. Oblivion Remastered is also available via the Microsoft Store on PC, and via the PC Game Pass subscription, as well as on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Game Pass Ultimate.
</p>
<p>
We'll be keeping an eye out for combined player numbers from Bethesda when they're available.
</p>
<p>
As announced - and launched - yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">the Oblivion Remaster is really more of a ground-up remake</a> using Unreal Engine 5 from talented co-developer Virtuos. 
</p>
<p>
The new version of Bethesda's classic role-player includes the game's previous expansion content and boasts various gameplay tweaks such as a refreshed levelling system inspired by Skyrim, additional dialogue, modern controls including sprinting. It now also runs at 4K 60fps.
</p>
<p>
Last night, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-say-no-official-mod-support-for-its-oblivion-remaster">Bethesda said it had no plans for Oblivion Remastered official mod support</a>, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-already-almost-100-mods-for-oblivion-remake-even-without-official-support-from-bethesda">plenty of unofficial mods have popped up now anyway</a>. Bethesda also made the welcome gesture of gifting access to the Oblivion Remaster to the team of fans currently remaking Oblivion in the Skyrim engine, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-has-no-intention-to-shut-down-fan-made-skyblivion-mod">which it has indicated it approves of</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-seems-to-be-rather-well-suited-to-mods-and-one-of-them-adds-ray-reconstruction/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Shortly following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiling and release</a> of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, the legion of Elder Scrolls modders jumped on it to see what could be done. There seems to be good news: since the game logic still runs on the original Gamebryo engine, several of the mods made for the original game are being ported and appear to be working. The usual Bethesda plugin structure based on .esp files is also intact, so users can simply add new mods (.esps) to the data folder and then make sure to also add the .esp name to the plugins.txt file.</p>
<p>In the span of mere hours, there are already around ninety mods on Nexus. Some of these are simple, run-of-the-mill skip-the-intro mods, but others are far more interesting. For example, modder sammilucia has already <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uploaded</a> a version of their Ultra + mod, which was previously released for many PC games (Hogwarts Legacy, RoboCop: Rogue City, Silent Hill 2 Remake, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, Ghostrunner 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Avowed, Runescape: Dragonwilds, Black Myth: Wukong). Interestingly, this mod adds NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction to Oblivion Remastered, which is not supported by default (DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation are natively available, though). The game offers hardware-accelerated ray traced Lumen global illumination, and Ray Reconstruction can boost its quality. Ultra + also makes other tweaks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved fog quality</li>
<li>Fix fog ghosting</li>
<li>Fix fog artifacting against the sky</li>
<li>Include fog in Lumen tracing for GI and reflections</li>
<li>Increase lighting quality in general via modifying the game's PostProcessVolumes</li>
<li>Add several lighting quality levels, allowing maximum theoretical lighting quality</li>
<li>Improved reflection quality</li>
<li>Fix screenspace reflection issue when Hardware Lumen is enabled</li>
<li>Performance tuning</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are already many more mods on Nexus. Some attempt to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/44" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restore the original game's colors through ReShade presets</a>. Others ensure that <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/113" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quest rewards are unleveled</a> so that they are always received by the player at their maximum quality.</p>
<p>There are also tweaks to game mechanics, such as equipment degradation, which can either be <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removed</a> or significantly <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/97" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slowed down</a>; carry weight can be <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/48" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boosted to infinity</a>; spell restrictions to spellcrafting or enchanting can be <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/138" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removed</a>; the HUD can be made <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sleeker and less intrusive</a>. But, as mentioned earlier, arguably the most promising aspect is that Oblivion Remastered appears to be compatible with some original mods, such as <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/87" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPCs Catch Fire</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/153" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horse Whistle - Summon and Follow</a>. It remains to be seen if the same will hold true for more complex mods, but if that were to be true, the game's modding potential could be enormous. We'll keep a close eye on the modding scene's development, that's for sure.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, the second episode of The Last of Us' second season aired. While much of the episode's run time was made up of the infected's attack on Jackson, there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-internet-reacts-to-the-last-of-us-season-twos-latest-episode">one particular moment that left fans of the series in shock</a>: Joel's death.</p>
<p>As in the video game it is based on, in HBO's adaptation Joel - played by Pedro Pascal - is killed by new character Abby with a golf club, following a harrowing and bloody beating. While Abby's reasons for killing Joel are not explained until much later in the game's narrative, resulting in a surprising twist for players, HBO's showrunners decided to change this, laying out Abby's intentions from the beginning.</p>
<p>The second series begins with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-one-makes-a-big-change-to-the-chronology-of-abbys-revelation-and-im-not-sure-about-it">Kaitlyn Dever's Abby mourning the loss of her fellow Fireflies following Joel's rampage at the end of season one</a>, vowing to kill him for what he has done. Now, Bailey has spoken about the changes in the script, stating she believes them to be a wise choice by the showrunners.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Screenshot-2025-02-14-at-12.41.40.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>When it first leaked that Abby kills Joel in The Last of Us Part 2, Bailey received online abuse and death threats aimed at herself and her son. "Every time I went online, that's all I saw. Death threats and threats of violence," she said in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2s-abby-actor-reveals-online-abuse-didnt-just-threaten-her-life-but-her-baby-son-too">behind-the-scenes documentary, Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2</a>, which was released in February last year.</p>
<p>Now speaking with <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/the-last-of-us-abby-voice-actress-interview-backlash.html">Vulture</a>, Bailey says she feels it was a good decision by the showrunners to brace viewers for Joel's fate ahead of the event itself. "I think that's why HBO is doing what they're doing," she said. "You're prepared for it."</p>
<p>Bailey called her own experiences with the online abuse "a very rough period of time" for her. "I knew it was going to be intense. I knew it was going to be controversial," the Abby actress said.</p>
<p>"But I was still so excited to share it with the world, because I poured so much into that performance, and I was really proud of it. So to get <em>that </em>reaction right away was really tough. I don't think anybody predicted what the fallout would be from it. I was not prepared. But I don't think anybody on the team was."</p>
<p>Bailey admitted there is still a part of her that is anxious Joel's TV death will stir things up again, and while things have "definitely calmed down" in the five years since The Last of Us Part 2's first release, "there's definitely still a contingent of people that have not calmed down" from the events of the game.</p>
<p>"You know, anytime anything gets posted about [The Last of Us Part 2], or anytime I post anything random, there's going to be at least one comment from somebody," Bailey revealed.</p>
<p>"And I honestly don't know: Is it just the same hundred people that keep commenting? And they just won't let go? It's one of the reasons I don't really post on social media anymore. I don't want to say I was scared away from it, because I don't think that's what it was. It just kind of made me more guarded, you know?"</p>

		<p>On the horizon, the number 34 glows on a black monolith. Beside it is the Paintress, an immense humanoid creature with long white hair that covers her face. She waves her hand at the number and it fades away, only for her to replace it with ’33’. Just as she does so, everyone in the world who is of that age turns into smoke and dies, blowing away in the wind. Gustave, is preparing for Expedition 33, the 77th expedition to venture into the fractured world and attempt to defeat the Paintress.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vmJ9mE8LMq4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That’s the delightfully weird setup for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, a theme that runs throughout the game. It’s not just felt through the story or the world either, this is a turn based RPG with real time parrying and dodging elements. It’s got tiny creatures made of wood and giant mythical creatures that are somehow all equally eccentric. And it’s got a protagonist that looks a bit like Robert Pattinson, who played Batman, yet he is voiced by Charlie Cox, who played Daredevil. Like I said, it’s weird from top to bottom.</p>


<p>Gustave is from Paris, or at least from a fragment of Paris that found itself torn from its usual place and left as an island in an ocean after the apocalypse. It’s from here that you set out to reach and defeat the Paintress, after the above setup of course. Then, after everything immediately goes wrong as expected, you find yourself exploring a world made up of the remaining fragments of the old world as you find the survivors of your expedition and make your way towards your goal.</p>


<p>Of course it’s not just a pleasant hike, there’s a variety of strange creatures in your way, so it’s pretty handy that you’ve got magic powers. The turn-based battling here is distinctive and very satisfying. In a manner not too dissimilar from Mario’s RPGs, quicktime events are sprinkled throughout each encounter, boosting your attacks to deal more damage if you time button presses just right, increasing healing, or causing additional status effects, like burn. When on the defensive, timing your dodge will let you avoid damage entirely, while parrying all the hits in an attack let you launch a counter to deal quite a bit of damage in return.&nbsp;Dodging and parrying don’t have onscreen prompts, so you’re left to work out the timing based on the attack animations, some of which can be fiendishly deceptive, and if you miss the mark you’re going to soak up the damage instead.</p>
<p>Each member of your party is radically different, yet exceptionally powerful in their own way. Gustave, for example, builds up charges that can be used to deal very large amounts of lightning damage to enemies, whilst Maelle has skills that switch her between stances that have different effects, such as an aggressive stance that increases damage or a defensive one that increases defence and action point accumulation.</p>

<p>As they level up you’ll naturally be able to unlock more attribute points and new skills to tailor them to your preferred playstyle, but then there’s also the Picto system. Each Picto provides your character a bonus, such as a perfect dodge granting an additional action point, or a basic attack having a chance to apply marked to an enemy, increasing the next damage it takes. Once you’ve had a Picto equipped on any character for four battles, anyone in the party can equip this effect by spending Lumia points, which are only limited by how many of a certain resource you can find.</p>
<p>Basically, you can add a suite of additional effects to each character to further customise them to your playstyle. The combat system is intricate and full of depth, enough that finding another character can sometimes feel a little overwhelming with all the new information you suddenly need to learn. Thankfully they’re carefully explained in a tutorial for each, so it doesn’t take long to get used to things again.</p>
<p>The enemies you’re fighting are a varied bunch, too. From little wooden creatures to gigantic creatures made of stone and glowing runes. They’re admittedly not the most unique designs and could slot quite easily into a few other games, but most importantly there’s a lot of variety in how they fight. Sure, one area tends to have a lot of the same enemies wandering through it, just waiting for you to run up to them and hit them so you get the first hit once it transitions to combat, but the regularity with which the game introduces unique and novel mechanics, sometimes even just for a single fight, keeps things fresh. A couple of highlights include fighting off the Gestrals, the aforementioned wooden creatures that fight inside huge suits made of cloth, hay, and cannons, and a battle with a turtle who couldn’t move.</p>

<p>Probably my favourite aspect of the game, however, has come to be its sense of humour. The Gestrals, which caused immediate dread in me when I first encountered them after the many adorable and annoying creatures I’ve seen through my gaming life, turned out to be quite funny in a chaotic way and managed to not outstay their welcome. Then there’s Esquie, a giant flying mythical being who is equal parts powerful, eccentric, and disinterested, another irreverent bit of comic relief. More than that, the conversations between the main characters are well written and really helped along by excellent performances from the voice cast and very expressive character models as well. The lighter moments really help you warm up to the characters and make them feel far more convincing, so when the darker, more serious moments hit they stand out better and hit harder.</p>
<p>Where it all leads, though, I’m not yet sure, as I’ve yet to finish the main story. This is a relatively long game with plenty of side stuff to get distracted by and, well, I’m not a machine! But so far, I’m really enjoying Expedition 33. The combat is a lot of fun provided you love some well timed parrying and there’s a lot of depth to tailoring your characters. You can even find clothes to dress them up in, which is especially entertaining in the cutscenes – one of my characters currently has red sunglasses, a black and white striped shirt, and a baguette strapped to her back like a sword. So it’s great, but I’ll let you know just how great once I’ve finished it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> has become something of a media darling since its announcement last year. Sandfall Interactive’s next big thing has made quite a splash with its fantasy designs and turn-based stylings.</p>

<p>In an age where high-profile turn-based games have become a rare item, <em>Clair Obscur</em> intends to shatter trends by forgoing an action-based system and creating something that evolves from tradition. This philosophy in design is something that became ever clearer the more I delved deep into the full game.</p>

<p>But can that type of nostalgic pull last for a full 30-hour outing? I think largely it can, and the doors it opens next will be something to keep an eye on.</p>

<p><em>Clair Obscur</em> starts off in a fanciful way fitting of its overlong name: this is a world marked by death, but it’s not as grim as it might seem from the outset. Each year, a mysterious entity known as the Paintress wakes from her slumber and paints a number on a monolith, signaling the death of everyone who has passed that age, with more deaths set to pile up year after year as the number decreases.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20250408174146_1.jpg?itok=x2vvH3nB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20250408174146_1.jpg?itok=jjKomXTH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This year marks the year she’ll paint 33, and it's from here that the story kicks off the titular Expedition 33 in a mission to stop the Paintress once and for all.</p>

<p>The members of this Expedition 33 include Gustav, an engineer; Maelle, Gustav’s foster sister; Lune, a scholar and focused mage; and Sciel, a scythe-wielding foreteller. There are some other characters the Expedition will meet along the way as well, and much of that happens naturally over the course of the story.</p>

<p><em>Clair Obscur</em> thrives on that sort of sense of discovery. Not everything is handed to the player upfront – there’s a lot of earning to be done, and the way this applies to the story makes for some great impact. I feel the sort of slow introduction to everyone really helped build up an emotional investment that says these characters are worth spending time with.</p>

<p>And they are, because they’re all in this together, and each one is just as valuable as the other.</p>

<p>The story itself is built on tragedy, sure, but the core theme of banding together to bring hope back to the world is a strong throughline. It helps that the emotional investment is earned, and the payoff complements the setup in spades.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20250411214811_1.jpg?itok=pohJPcZm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20250411214811_1.jpg?itok=NA_Kc-mD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The gameplay of <em>Clair Obscur</em> centers around a turn-based battle system that calls back to classic PS2 RPGs of old, such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/final-fantasy-x-endgame-bitesize-nature" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy X</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/rewind-review-shadow-hearts-covenant" rel="nofollow"><em>Shadow Hearts</em></a>. The twist is, they’ve expanded on those traditional systems with the incorporation of time attacks that happen in real time.</p>

<p>What that means is that it works twofold for both party members and enemies. Party members can take advantage of a mechanic known as Free Aim, which lets characters such as Gustav fire a gun and target potential weak points on opponents while consuming Action Points or AP. Main attacks come with quick time prompts that need to be hit successfully to improve the viability of each attack.</p>

<p>On the enemy side of things, the Expedition will be forced to manually dodge or parry incoming hits at the tap of a button, with the reward being 1 AP for the effort. <em>Clair Obscur</em> makes it vital to study attack patterns, or else it’s really going to hurt, and I found it especially punishing later in the game when the bosses really ramp up the difficulty.</p>

<p>Even some normal enemies can decimate the entire team, so it’s important to use everyone to their strengths and exploit things like elemental weaknesses when at all possible. Executing everything perfectly leads to some flashy, satisfying attacks.</p>

<p>To facilitate this, <em>Clair Obscur</em> offers up a lot of different customization options when it comes to each character and their actions in battle. In addition to the RPG-typical upgradable weapons, the Expedition can equip items known as Pictos, which increase stats and allow for passive abilities known as Lumina. Lumina abilities are then equipped using Lumina Points.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20250408155641_1.jpg?itok=lHeeCAav 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20250408155641_1.jpg?itok=nKf2vuPf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>They’re pretty handy when it comes to tailoring the type of playstyle, and especially when encountering some of the tougher enemies.</p>

<p>Also like other RPGs, <em>Clair Obscur</em> relies on a Skill Tree system where each character can be assigned Attribute Points to unlock new skills as they level. Paying attention to skills will become more important as the game goes on and can be respeced if needed.</p>

<p>Outside of combat, the other core part of <em>Clair Obscur</em> centers on exploration. While there isn’t a minimap charting out where to go, there is a scaled-down world map that exists between each area. Eventually, the Expedition will be able to travel across the sea as the story progresses.</p>

<p>Camping is one of the activities exclusive to the world map. They’re a good place to unwind, chat with other party members, and build relationships by spending time with them. It's here where weapons can be upgraded using field items known as Chroma Catalysts.</p>

<p>All of this is wrapped up in some of the most gorgeous art direction and design I’ve seen in a contemporary game. Colors are plentiful, and there’s an artistic feel to each area that transcends traditional fantasy. For example, there’s an area that’s essentially a waterless sea complete with creatures floating about like they would in water.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20250409155149_1.jpg?itok=FJNOwCyH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20250409155149_1.jpg?itok=yPNFFg93 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The overall aesthetic in <em>Clair Obscur</em> comes together in its own original way, and the breadth of imagination here is staggering.</p>

<p>It’d be remiss of me to forget about the music, which is just as plentiful and full of character. There’s so much variety here, and some tracks really kick up in the middle of boss battles or important moments. The soundtrack is simply a feast for the ears.</p>

<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is, without a doubt, one of the best games so far this year. It’s incredibly polished in what it sets out to do, has spectacular art direction, music, and a compelling story and characters. Whilst difficulty can ratchet up unexpectedly and getting the timing down for encounters can at times be frustrating, the ultimate payoff for getting through those challenges makes it well worth it.</p>

<p>On top of all that, there’s even more to do aside from the main story, so with that in mind, I see myself coming back to explore for just a little while longer.</p>

The French RPG is clearly inspired by the Japanese greats like <em>Final Fantasy </em>and <em>Persona</em>, but its <em>Paper Mario</em>-style timing elements and wealth of original mechanics keep its grind engaging and decidedly modern. My time with the game hasn’t been without frustrations, but I’m writing these impressions wishing I could be playing the game instead.

As the number ticks down with each subsequent painting, the human life expectancy dwindles with it, for people disappear into dust when they reach the designated age. In a years-long effort to stop the Paintress from shortening human life, people in their final year form expeditions dedicated to reaching and killing her. The titular 33rd expedition has many world-weary characters among its ranks, including the swordsman and gunslinger Gustave, the mage Lune, and the rapier-wielding Maelle, and they set off bravely on their daunting journey. Soon, however, they cross paths with a mysterious man who has somehow aged beyond the 33 on the Paintress’ monolith, who then slaughters most of the group, except a small crew.</p><p>Despite heavy losses, protocol is to keep moving forward, and that’s because the expeditions don’t seek out the Paintress because they believe they can be the ones to stop her; they do it to lay the groundwork for those who, they hope, eventually can. Gustave, the de facto leader of the group, often says “for those who come after” when doing his signature attacks in battle or writing in his journal about their journey. As I travel through different regions across the game’s sizable world, I keep finding old documents from the expeditions that came before. Being part of an expedition isn’t an act of self-preservation; it’s believed to be a suicide mission to make way for the next one. <em>Clair Obscur</em> is bleak, melodramatic, and full of dramatic gut punches that make the team’s efforts feel futile. There’s not much reason to hope. Nevertheless, the expedition persists.</p><figure id="" data-id="79fe2026a8dc711cfca2f19f6cf16eaf" data-recommend-id="image://79fe2026a8dc711cfca2f19f6cf16eaf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gustave looks up as petals fall around him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gustave looks up as petals fall around him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="79fe2026a8dc711cfca2f19f6cf16eaf" data-recommend-id="image://79fe2026a8dc711cfca2f19f6cf16eaf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gustave looks up as petals fall around him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Clair Obscur</em>’s core premise has drawn me in, but the game pulls from so many different genres that I’m still figuring out the nature of its world. Sometimes it looks like a steampunk setting full of ramshackle technological advancements; elsewhere, like in an underwater area that the expedition can somehow walk around and breathe in, the magic bubbles to the surface. This eclectic approach manifests not just in the world, but also in the creatures who inhabit it, and even in a surprisingly diverse soundtrack that draws from genres ranging from orchestral to Skrillex-esque dubstep. And as you cross the distance between home and the Paintress, you’ll find inhuman creatures, beings who were long believed to be fairy tales by humanity, and what seem to be the remnants of long-lost societies..</p><p>While the world is fascinating enough that I often get distracted from my expedition’s stated goal by my desire to explore and learn more about its history, unfortunately the game has also forced me to do some meandering I’d rather not have engaged in. One of the biggest problems undermining my travels has been the lack of a mini-map in dungeons, towns, and other bespoke locales. I am historically a directionally challenged individual. I have to have a GPS open to navigate my own city just to reassure myself I’m going the right way. So moving through dark caves or villages I’ve never been to before without any kind of navigational tools has been annoying at best, momentum-killing at worst. Last year, <em>1000xResist </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fellowtraveller.games/blog/1000xresist-now-has-a-map&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fellowtraveller.games/blog/1000xresist-now-has-a-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patched in a map</a></span> after enough people complained about how hard it was to get around the adventure game’s hub. I hope <em>Clair Obscur </em>follows suit because I’ve been hugging walls just to make sure I’m not running in circles.</p><p>Also getting in the way have been the various monsters I’ve faced on my journey. Its sense of melodrama is one obvious way in which <em>Clair Obscur</em> draws from <em>Final Fantasy</em>, but it’s the turn-based systems that I’ve been missing from the series for decades. At a glance, <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s battles look like your standard turn-based RPG fights full of elemental affinities and status effects, but what helps it stand out is how each party member has their own distinct mechanics that create really interesting opportunities for party synergy.</p><p>For example, Maelle has different stances that determine her damage output or intake. But you don’t simply switch between them freely; they’re determined by what ability you use in the previous turn. There are stances that prioritize attack or defense, but there’s a third one called Virtuose Stance that doubles her damage output for her next attack. Maelle swaps between these three depending on which attack she uses and if they can chain together with other status effects and abilities. One attack shifts her into Virtuose Stance if she’s aiming at an enemy afflicted with a burn status, but after she unleashes one attack in that stance, she’ll default to her “stanceless” mode. Normally, it would take a couple of turns of setup to get her back into that superpowered stance to deal that kind of damage again, but I unlocked an attack that, if used while in Virtuose Stance, maintains it for the next turn, letting me skewer an enemy once again the next time it was Maelle’s turn.</p><figure id="" data-id="045afd111ab1b411b3d2a442416be715" data-recommend-id="image://045afd111ab1b411b3d2a442416be715" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Clair Obscur battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Clair Obscur battle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="045afd111ab1b411b3d2a442416be715" data-recommend-id="image://045afd111ab1b411b3d2a442416be715" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Clair Obscur battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The more I learned how best to wield each character’s original skills, the more I got into <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s groove. Gustave has a powerful ability called Overcharge, in which he uses his prosthetic arm to unleash a powerful electric blast on an enemy, but it has to charge throughout several turns. Through equipping him with different Pictos, which give characters far-reaching passive abilities that go beyond simple stat buffs and debuffs, I was able to let him gain charges simply by avoiding enemy attacks. So if I were fighting a powerful boss that would periodically unleash a barrage of attacks against my team, I could easily unleash my own devastating Overcharge in a turn or two. </p><p>I keep being surprised at how robust the customization options are and how they let you feed into these kinds of strategies. Everyone’s kit is built to tactically bounce off one another’s, and there’s a lot of room to experiment. Turn-based RPGs can easily drive you into simple patterns of attacking elemental weaknesses or just grinding until the numbers go up enough to overpower any foe you face. <em>Clair Obscur</em> has so many systems that allow for creativity, all without ever getting too overwhelming. There are still some characters I’m trying to wrap my head around, including the scythe-wielding Sciel whose mechanics are a bit more complicated, but the more I play, the more I discover how well these systems fall into place and feed into each other.</p><p>The key element that strings all of these together are the timing-based moves reminiscent of those in something like <em>Paper Mario</em>. Every attack in <em>Clair Obscur </em>can be dodged or parried, but you have to do this manually for each incoming strike. Dodges have a slightly larger timing window, but parries can be followed up with a strong counterattack. However, most enemies will unleash combos on the team, and you have to parry every hit to counter, so there’s a risk vs. reward aspect at play. And when enemies do land a hit, it <em>hurts</em>. <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s defensive moves aren’t just a cool thing you can do if you’re feeling spicy; they’re integral to surviving in battle.</p><p>I really love this concept on paper because it could make even the most tedious, grindy encounter engaging, but in practice, after 15 hours with the game, I still find there to be a lack of consistency on the cues for when to dodge. Really, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to every enemy as their combos are all different, they move in distinct ways, and sometimes they’ll use an attack that can only be avoided with a specific method. Which is good for keeping you on your toes, but there are several points at which the dodge window is so precise, and also so poorly telegraphed, that it can be as frustrating as it is rewarding. Not to be one of those sore losers who declares “it’s not me, it’s the game,” but I grew up on character action games and fighting games and like to think I’m a pretty rhythmically inclined player. I know how to dodge and parry, I’m a sicko for that shit, but <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s integration of these techniques lacks clarity.</p><p>That being said, I’m getting better at it as I go along. <em>Clair Obscur </em>isn’t necessarily challenging in the traditional sense, but it can be punishing when you miss a dodge and find yourself on the wrong end of a team wipe. But all of its systems still coalesce into something that’s really rewarding to experiment with, and I’m excited to keep going. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m gonna submit this draft and play some more so I can get a more comprehensive review out the door. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
