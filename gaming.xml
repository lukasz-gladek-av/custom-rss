            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox chief Phil Spencer has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24175149/xbox-handheld-phil-spencer-interview-2024">dropping hints about an Xbox handheld</a> for months, but what about Windows handheld gaming PCs? Jason Ronald, Microsoft’s VP of “Next Generation,” tells <em>The Verge</em> that we should expect to see the Windows handheld gaming experience change within this calendar year. </p><p>Ronald was a roundtable panelist this evening at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/19/24325072/lenovo-legion-go-ces-event-valve-microsoft">an AMD and Lenovo event</a> titled “The Future of Gaming Handhelds,” which was mostly a coming-out party for Lenovo’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">Legion Go S</a>. But he did hint on stage that Microsoft plans to bring the Xbox experience to Windows PCs, rather than the other way around — and expanded on that considerably after we caught up with him later.</p><p>“We’ve been really innovating for a long time in the console space, and as we partner across the industry it’s really about how do we bring those innovations that we’ve incubated and developed in the console space and bring them to PC and bring them to the handheld gaming space,” said Ronald. </p><p>After we caught up with him after the event, he confirmed that Microsoft is looking at combining Xbox and Windows experiences together — and that we should see changes this very year, rather than needing to wait for an Xbox handheld <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295461/dont-expect-an-xbox-handheld-any-time-soon">that might still be years away.</a></p><div><figcaption><em>Microsoft’s Jason Ronald speaks at the Lenovo/AMD event, flanked by Valve SteamOS designer Pierre-Loup Griffais (left) and AMD chief gaming architect Frank Azor (middle right).</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>“I would say it’s bringing the best of Xbox and Windows together, because we have spent the last 20 years building a world-class operating system, but it’s really locked to the console,” says Ronald. “What we’re doing is we’re really focused on how do we bring those experiences for both players and developers to the broader Windows ecosystem.”</p><p>Right now, Windows sucks on handhelds, to put it rather bluntly, to the point that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">a community-created fork of Valve’s SteamOS experience</a> can be a far better way to pick up and play games. Ronald is clearly aware of the issues. “We’re focused on really simplifying that and making it much more like a console experience. Our goal is to put the player and their library at the center of the experience and not all the [Windows] work that you have to do today.”</p><p>Microsoft has done compact modes for Xbox apps on Windows that are focused on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219741/microsoft-windows-game-bar-xbox-handheld">improving the handheld experience</a>, but it’s a lot like putting lipstick on a pig instead of addressing the core experience. “I think we’ll have a lot more to share later this year,” teases Ronald. “I think it’s going to be a journey and I think you’ll see a lot of investments over time that you’re starting to see already, but we’ll have a lot more to share later this year.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Microsoft has made several Xbox apps more handheld-friendly over the past year.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>How Microsoft goes about this merging of Xbox and Windows will be key, but it doesn’t sound like the company is suddenly going to port a custom Xbox operating system to Windows. It sounds more like Microsoft wants to make Windows all up better at gaming with an Xbox experience on top so the pesky desktop, notifications, and legacy of Windows is hidden away.</p><p> “I think, at the end of the day, our goal is to make Windows great for gaming on any device,” says Ronald. “The reality is the Xbox operating system is built on top of Windows. So there’s a lot of infrastructure that we built in the console space that we can bring to the PC space and really deliver that premium gaming experience on any device.”</p><p>Specifically, Microsoft has to tackle a lot of the very basics of making Windows more friendly to controllers and getting that Xbox experience to really drive things instead of the taskbar, Start menu, and other elements. “There’s just certain things in Windows that were not designed for if you don’t have a keyboard and mouse, like thumbstick support or joypads and stuff like that,” Ronald admits. </p><p>“There’s fundamental interaction models that we’re working on to make sure that regardless of the operating system details it feels very natively like a gaming-centric device and a gaming-centric experience.”</p><p>Ronald says the goal is to put an Xbox experience at the center — “not the Windows desktop that you have today.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, People Make Games was urged to revisit its reporting on Brandoville more recently, after accusations went viral on Indonesia social media of continued crunch, as well as physical, verbal, and mental abuse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/brandoville-studios-cherry-lai-abuse-psychological-physical-allegations/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheGamer reported</a> on the allegations in September of last year, pointing at CEO Ken Lai's wife, Cherry Lai, as the instigator of much of the studio's worst issues. Numerous screenshots and videos verified by TheGamer as well as shared publicly across social media told a story of Lai's abusive behavior, which included sending threatening and insulting messages to staff, verbally berating and insulting them, and in at least one case, repeatedly physically assaulting an employee and ordering them to physically hurt themselves as "punishment" for poor performance. That employee, Christa Sydney, has shared much of her story publicly, including claiming Lai once slapped her head so hard it caused tinnitus, and at other times choking her, pushing her down the stairs, and forcing her to bang her head on the wall until she had a concussion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">People Make Games' follow-up investigation goes further to verify and detail these claims, including sharing a video Sydney was allegedly forced to send to Lai of her slapping herself 100 times. In addition to Sydney, People Make Games' report details other accounts, including allegations that Lai pit employees against one another by verbally berating employees in the office or gossiping about them, forced employees to participate in Christian worship on a daily basis, and would insist on approving employee outfits every day before work. One former employee in the video claims Lai manipulated him into giving him a significant part of his salary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another former employee, Syifana Afiati, tells a story of being overworked while pregnant to the point of being asked to work while she was in the hospital. Afiati's child was born prematurely, and she was asked to return to work just one month after giving birth, despite her maternity leave being three months and her son still being treated in intensive care. Her son died four months later. Three days after he passed away, Lai sent a message to company HR, strategizing on how to avoid supporting Afiati and deprive her of benefits while she was on leave.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ken Lai did not comment to People Make Games when asked, but Cherry Lai provided a statement to People Make Games: "To me, my part of the story is not important, as long as my team are good and safe now," but ghosted the outlet without much further commentary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Brandoville Studios was shut down last year. While Ken and Cherry Lai attempted to spin up a new company with some of the former Brandoville employees, LaiLai Studios – it's unclear if the company is currently running or working on anything. As of September, <a href="https://jakartaglobe.id/news/brandoville-studios-faces-legal-action-over-labor-violations-and-abuse-claims" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jakarta police were actively searching for Cherry Lai as part of an investigation into Brandoville</a>. Lai suggested in an email to People Make Games that she may have fled to Hong Kong, but that has not yet been confirmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has reached out to Naughty Dog, Xbox, and Ubisoft for comment on their partnerships with Brandoville in light of this story and will update if a response is received.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

        <p>"We will be working over the next few weeks to find all of our team new homes."</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Jar of Sparks, the Seattle-based "AAA" studio established by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> head of design Jerry Hook back in 2022, has halted work its currently unannounced first title as it searches for a new publishing partner, and that's it's looking to "find all of our team new homes" as a result.
</p>
<p>
When Jar of Sparks was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-design-jerry-hook-leading-new-netease-studio-jar-of-sparks">initially unveiled</a> in July 2022, it was described as a first-party developer for Chinese publisher NetEase that would focus on creating the "next generation of narrative-driven action games". Little has been heard from the studio since then, but Hook - who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinites-head-of-design-jerry-hook-leaves-343-industries">announced his departure</a> from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/343-industries">343 Industries</a> and Microsoft back in May 2002 - has now <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/jar-of-sparks/posts/">shared a statement on LinkedIn</a>, suggesting Jar of Sparks' future is uncertain.
</p>
<p>
"Earlier today," Hook wrote, "we notified our team that Jar of Sparks will be halting work on our current title as we search for a new publishing partner who can help bring our creative vision to life. Throughout this journey, our passionate, driven, and innovative team took bold risks and pushed boundaries, striving to create something truly new and exciting for the industry. We couldn’t be prouder of the groundwork we’ve laid together."
</p>
<p>
"As we prepare for this next step," Hook continued, "our talented team members will be exploring new opportunities... From the day we formed Jar of Sparks to this very moment, this team has accomplished remarkable feats—proving that a small, focused, and dedicated group can achieve great results. We thank each of them for their courage, skill, and friendship."
</p><p>
Jar of Sparks' announcement doesn't mention layoffs explicitly, but a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jerry-hook-1807781_earlier-today-we-notified-our-team-that-activity-7282186867880407040-fNNK">separate post from Hook</a> says the studio "will be working over the next few weeks to find all of our team new homes as we close our first project", suggesting the majority of staff will be departing following today's news. Eurogamer has reached out to Jar of Sparks for clarification, and to NetEase regarding its current relationship with the studio.
</p>
<p>
"Thank you to everyone who supported us throughout our journey here at Jar of Sparks," the statement concludes. "We look forward to updating you all with our next step in our journey."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-rtx-kit-shows-how-neural-rendering-will-power-the-next-visual-leap-in-gaming.1076619/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-kit-shows-how-neural-rendering-will-power-the-next-visual-leap-in-gaming/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Alongside the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-32-gb-gpu-1999-usd-2x-performance-of-4090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs</a>, CES 2025 also marked the debut of the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA RTX Kit</a>, a new suite of neural rendering technologies that promises to empower game developers to deliver the next visual leap in graphics. The NVIDIA RTX Kit suite has vast applications, from accelerating ray tracing with AI to portraying much more realistic digital humans to rendering scenes that feature massive amounts of geometry.</p>
<p>Let's begin with what's arguably going to be the biggest innovation. With the Blackwell architecture, NVIDIA is introducing the so-called RTX Neural Shaders. These are small neural networks that are meant to be injected into programmable shaders for various beneficial effects. With the upcoming RTX Neural Shaders SDK, game developers can train their game data and shader code on an RTX AI PC accelerated with NVIDIA Tensor Cores. During the training phase, the neural game data is compared to the output of the traditional data and refined over multiple cycles.</p>
<p>There are currently three main applications for RTX Neural Shaders, all of which we&nbsp;<span>previously covered from NVIDIA's research papers: RTX <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-neural-compression-technique-unlocks-16x-texture-detail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Texture Compression</a>, RTX <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-real-time-neural-materials-models-up-to-24x-shading-speedup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Materials</a>, and RTX <a href="https://wccftech.com/neural-radiance-cache-technique-aims-to-make-path-tracing-faster-on-nvidia-gpus-thanks-to-tensor-cores-and-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Radiance Cache</a></span>. RTX Neural Texture Compression is invaluable for easily compressing thousands of textures in less than a minute while also saving up to 7x more VRAM compared to traditional block-compressed textures, with no purported downside to quality. In the new tech demo, RTX NTC textures only occupy 80MB, whereas regular block-compressed textures require 520MB VRAM.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RTX-NTC-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>RTX Neural Materials uses AI to compress complex shader code typically reserved for offline materials, delivering up to five times quicker material processing and enabling higher quality assets to be available in games.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RTX-Neural-Materials-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Lastly, AI is used in RTX Neural Radiance Cache to infer an infinite number of bounces after the initial one to two bounces, thus improving multi-bounce indirect lighting and performance. NRC has already been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtxgi-2-0-available-next-frontier-ray-traced-visuals-neural-radiance-cache-spatial-hash-radiance-cache-dynamic-diffuse-global-illumination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available for a while</a> as part of the RTX GI SDK and will soon be introduced to RTX Remix and Portal with RTX.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RTX-Neural-Radiance-Cache-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The RTX Neural Shaders and RTX Neural Texture Compression SDKs will be added to the NVIDIA RTX Kit later this month. Microsoft also <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/enabling-neural-rendering-in-directx-cooperative-vector-support-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today that DirectX will soon add support for Cooperative Vectors, providing accelerated performance for GeForce RTX GPUs when using RTX Neural Shaders. Bryan Langley, partner group program manager of Silicon, Media, and Graphics at Microsoft, stated:</p>
<p><em>Microsoft is excited to partner with NVIDIA to catalyze this next generation of graphics programming by bringing industry-wide support for neural shading technology. DirectX will soon support Cooperative Vectors, which will unlock the power of Tensor Cores on NVIDIA GeForce RTX hardware and enable game developers to fully accelerate neural shaders on Windows.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RTX-Mega-Geometry-Off-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The NVIDIA RTX Kit also includes RTX Mega Geometry, which will <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debut in Remedy's Alan Wake 2</a> with a free update later this year. The CES 2025 demo video provided a preview of the technology, which aims to improve the ray tracing load in scenes with vast amounts of geometry, like in games powered by Unreal Engine 5's Nanite. According to NVIDIA, RTX Mega Geometry accelerates BVH building, enabling ray tracing of up to a hundred times more triangles than the current standard. It will be available later this month in the RTX Kit, and soon through the NVIDIA RTX Unreal Engine branch.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RTX-Mega-Geometry-On-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>RTX Neural Faces is the tool in the NVIDIA RTX Kit that takes a regular rasterized face with 3D pose data as input and infers a more natural face through a real-time gen AI model. The generated face is trained from thousands of offline generated images of that face at every angle, under different lighting, emotion, and occlusion conditions. The training pipeline can use real photographs or AI-generated images. The trained model is then optimized using NVIDIA TensorRT to infer the face in real-time.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Standard-Face-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This is paired with the RTX Character Rendering SDK for hair and skin. With the new GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, NVIDIA added Linear-Swept Spheres (LSS), a GPU-accelerated primitive that reduces the amount of geometry required to render strands of hair. LSS uses spheres instead of triangles to match hair shapes more accurately. LSS enables ray-traced hair to be rendered with better performance and a smaller memory footprint. RTX Skin and Hair algorithms using the RTX Character Rendering SDK, which will be available later this month, just like the NVIDIA RTX Kit. The Hair algorithm will debut in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle with a free update coming soon. The Skin algorithm will be available through RTX Remix, too.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RTX-Neural-Face-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Last but not least, NVIDIA also promised a big update to its Audio2Face technology. Truth be told, we weren't exceedingly impressed with its implementation in GSC Game World's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STALKER 2</a> game; the AI didn't do a great job of delivering decent facial animations based on audio inputs. The brief new demo video looks a lot more expressive, though. According to NVIDIA, a new Audio2Face real-time diffusion-based architecture has been implemented to deliver more accurate and detailed lip synchronization, vivid emotions, and natural non-verbal responses.</p>

          <p>Almost exactly a year ago, we were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/why-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-should-ditch-windows-for-steamos/">publicly yearning</a> for the day when more portable gaming PC makers could ditch Windows in favor of SteamOS (without having to resort to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/the-linux-coders-turning-the-rog-ally-and-other-handhelds-into-steam-deck-clones/">touchy unofficial workarounds</a>). Now, that day has finally come, with Lenovo <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-legion-unleashes-next-gen-gaming-power-at-ces-2025/">announcing</a> the upcoming Legion Go S as the first non-Valve handheld to come with an officially licensed copy of SteamOS preinstalled. And Valve promises that it will soon ship a beta version of SteamOS for users to "download and test themselves."</p>
<p>As Lenovo's slightly downsized followup to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/lenovo-legion-go-suggests-gaming-portables-arent-big-enough-need-a-mouse/">2023's massive Legion Go</a>, the Legion Go S won't feature the detachable controllers of its predecessor. But the new PC gaming handheld will come in two distinct versions, one with the now-standard Windows 11 installation and another edition that's the first to sport the (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-return-of-steam-machines-valve-rolls-out-new-powered-by-steamos-branding/">recently leaked</a>) "Powered by SteamOS" branding.</p>
<p>The lack of a Windows license seems to contribute to a lower starting cost for the "Powered by SteamOS" edition of the Legion Go S, which will start at $500 when it's made available in May. Lenovo says the Windows edition of the device—available starting this month—will start at $730, with "additional configurations" available in May starting as low as $600.</p>

<p>Valve <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/529834914570306831">said in a blog post on Tuesday</a> that the Legion Go S will sport the same version of SteamOS currently found on the Steam Deck. The company's work getting SteamOS onto the Legion Go S will also "improve compatibility with other handhelds," Valve said, and the company "is working on SteamOS support for more devices in the future."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shows-off-conceptual-immersive-gaming-tech-that-lets-you-stand-in-a-tv-box-and-sniff-the-last-of-us<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Curious to know what wild ideas Sony might be pondering for the future of gaming? Well, you're in luck: it's just unveiled new conceptual technology designed to ramp up immersion by sticking players inside a TV box and squirting smells into the room. So if you've ever wanted a whiff of Kratos after a hard day's slaying, your dreams are now one step closer to reality.
</p>
<p>
Not that Sony's Future Immersive Entertainment Concept (as it's officially known) is likely to be coming to living rooms anytime soon. As its name suggests, this is very much a CES 2025-focused proof-of-concept, showcasing just one possible future avenue for more immersive gaming, and not something even remotely close to production. It is, though, kind of neat, in a wildly gimmicky kind of way - taking some already existing ideas (all-encompassing displays, atmospherics whiffs, and so on) then reimagining them with cutting edge tech.
</p>
<p>
Essentially, Sony's Future Immersive Entertainment Concept is a giant cube of LED panels that completely surrounds the players inside. As they explore the game world - that of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s The Last of Us in the case of Sony's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jnhpsJe4bQ">new showcase trailer</a> - players are bombarded with  "audio, haptics, scent, and atmospherics" designed to draw them further into the experience.

<p>
Additionally, it's possible to wield physical tools that interact with the world on-screen, and we're shown a flashlight that only illuminates whatever it's being pointing at, as well as various weapons. The downside to all this, of course, is that it's really only convincing with static scenes (plus you'd need an arena-sized living room and a big wad of cash to accommodate it), but the upside is it could finally let you whiff the fruity fungal bouquet of a mouldering Clicker. <em>Yum</em>.
</p><p>
Some might argue a more immediately viable solution for greater gaming immersion would be VR, but Sony doesn't appear to be in any particular rush to do anything meaningful with PSVR2 - so your closest equivalent to its The Last of Us immersive concept right now is probably standing in the kitchen with the lights off and getting someone to pelt you with mushrooms.
</p>

If all the above sounds like an excessively energetic way to get your The Last of Us fix, you could also just plop yourself in front of the TV ready for season two of HBO's acclaimed live-action adaptation, which was recently confirmed to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-trailer-teases-two-of-the-games-most-impactful-scenes">airing this April</a>. PC owners can also get <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-finally-gets-itself-a-pc-release-date">stuck into The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a> at the same time (3rd April, more specifically), but there might be a bit of a wait for new The Last of Us stuff given that Naughty Dog its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">currently working on sci-fi hack-and-slasher Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.

The iconic board game, which started as a critique of unchecked capitalism, has been around for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/monopoly-hasbro-100th-anniversary-edition-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a century</a> with countless spin-offs. But Hasbro's plans involve a retooling of the original, and the official introduction of premium expansions.</p>

<h2>The <em>Monopoly</em> 2025 Roadmap</h2>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/492505/monopoly-new-version-expansions-announced" rel="nofollow">Polygon</a>, Hasbro senior vice president Brian Baker stated the changes coming to Monopoly in 2025 was to make the board game more inviting to modern players.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monopoly-2025-plastic-organizer.jpg?itok=1Ppa85hy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monopoly-2025-plastic-organizer.jpg?itok=bZMz3iHH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>To that end, the classic board game gets a new box and pieces. The game will now be contained in a square box instead of its tradtional rectangle, allowing for easier storage. In addition, the play money, deed, Community Chest, and Chance cards have been revised. The metal movers, house and hotel models have also been made bigger.</p>

<p>All of these new game pieces can easily be organized and set up thanks to a new robust plastic organizer. According to Baker this was done so the game would be easier to set up and put away..</p>

<p>But the biggest change coming to <em>Monopoly</em> in 2025 is the official introduction of expansion packs. These expansions are designed to speed up the process of play.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monopoly-2025-box-and-expansions.jpg?itok=Lhwj5DZL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monopoly-2025-box-and-expansions.jpg?itok=lhkTG2SJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are currently three planned expansions. <em>Monopoly Free Parking Jackpot Expansion</em> is a riff on the house rule of treating the Luxury Tax as a grand prize. It adds a spinner to the board, allowing players to let it ride without adding money back into the in-game economy.</p>

<p>The second expansion is <em>Monopoly Go To Jail</em>. This expansion lessens the impact of going to jail with the introduction of corruption cards. Thesecards are only available to convicted felons.</p>

<p>Third is the <em>Monopoly Buy Everything Expansion</em>. As the name implies, it allows you to buy anything. Even the bank.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We don’t necessarily need to sell more Monopolys,” Baker said. “Most people already own Monopoly. What they’re looking for is a reason to play it again.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This new version of <em>Monopoly</em> and its expansions will be coming to Amazon, Target, and Wal-Mart later this year. The base game will be sold at an MSRP of $19.99. The expansions are available at an MSRP of $9.99 each.</p>

When he goes back to see if the cat is still there, he discovers it’s missing. So, he knocks on the door of a home, and its Lumon boss Ms. Cobel (Patricia Arquette). It’s in this meeting that we would have witnessed the one element that would’ve made it a very different series.</p><p>“There’s a sequence of her showing him her pet rat, who she then tortures. But, it turns out the rat is severed. So, she switches, and suddenly the rat is now snuggling her. That’s how she explains to him what severance is,” Erickson says. After this encounter, Mark returns to Cobel’s house only to see it replaced with a Porta Potty, which Mark communicates to Cobel in through some unspecified way. </p><p>Notably, that rat sequence would’ve introduced audiences to the idea that animals can not only be severed but also switched between severed and conscious states instantly. That would’ve given a bit more explanation as to why there are goats on the severed floor later in the season, a mystery that is still one of the main unsolved questions for <em>Severance </em>fans.</p><figure id="" data-id="a522df4d2487c98b012ee48366f6aafe" data-recommend-id="image://a522df4d2487c98b012ee48366f6aafe" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="1601" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ms. Cobel sitting at her desk" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ms. Cobel sitting at her desk" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Apple</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a522df4d2487c98b012ee48366f6aafe" data-recommend-id="image://a522df4d2487c98b012ee48366f6aafe" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="1601" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ms. Cobel sitting at her desk" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Mark’s Outie being introduced to Cobel as a Lumon employee who’s recruiting him to be severed would’ve eliminated one of the main tensions of the first season, as well as the upcoming second season. In the series as we know it, he goes through the severance process as a way to deal with the grief of his wife’s passing. It’s a major factor in the entire series, setting up the big twist that his wife is, in fact, likely not dead, because she’s the wellness counselor Ms. Casey (Dichen Lachman) on the severed floors. His Innie has this revelation, and it’s one that is the impetus for much of his awakening in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-ben-stiller-adam-scott-apple-tv-news-1851713808&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-ben-stiller-adam-scott-apple-tv-news-1851713808">upcoming second season</a></span>.</p><p>Another change is that the original version of the pilot script involved Mark waking up on the table at his Lumon orientation, and then being “birth[ed] out of a giant sphincter in the ceiling,” according to Erickson. The episode would’ve followed his first day at Lumon, where he’d be trained by Helly R (Britt Lower), get lost in a storage closet that never ends, and see his welcome video from his Outie. </p><p>This is drastically different from the pilot episode we’ve all come to know and love, in which it’s Helly who wakes up on the table and is trained by Mark. She doesn’t end up in an endless storage closet, but she does repeatedly run through an exit door that warps her back into the severed floor before seeing her Outie’s welcome video explaining her decision to go through the severance process. That change alone would’ve altered the dynamic of the core cast. Instead of Helly being the one willing to write a message to her Outie into her arm or attempt suicide, all in efforts to leave the severed floor, it could’ve been Mark. </p><figure id="" data-id="66c7091bb659aa8b7f17e1bfae8d2f8e" data-recommend-id="image://66c7091bb659aa8b7f17e1bfae8d2f8e" data-format="png" data-width="1374" data-height="798" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mark staring confused" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mark staring confused" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Apple</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="66c7091bb659aa8b7f17e1bfae8d2f8e" data-recommend-id="image://66c7091bb659aa8b7f17e1bfae8d2f8e" data-format="png" data-width="1374" data-height="798" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mark staring confused" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are still eight more episodes of the podcast set to be released before Season 2's January 17 premiere date. If these are the types of revelations we’re getting from just the first 20 minutes of the first episode, we may never see <em>Severance</em> the same way when we’re done listening to it all. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nvidia has good news and bad news for people building or buying gaming PCs.</p>
<p>The good news is that three of its four new RTX 50-series GPUs are the same price or slightly cheaper than the RTX 40-series GPUs they're replacing. The RTX 5080 is $999, the same price as the RTX 4080 Super; the 5070 Ti and 5070 are launching for $749 and $549, each $50 less than the 4070 Ti Super and 4070 Super.</p>
<p>The bad news for people looking for the absolute fastest card they can get is that the company is charging $1,999 for its flagship RTX 5090 GPU, significantly more than the $1,599 MSRP of the RTX 4090. If you want Nvidia's biggest and best, it will cost at least as much as four high-end game consoles or a pair of decently specced midrange gaming PCs.</p>

<p>Nvidia also announced a new version of its upscaling algorithm, DLSS 4. As with DLSS 3 and the RTX 40-series, DLSS 4's flagship feature will be exclusive to the 50-series. It's called DLSS Multi Frame Generation, and as the name implies, it takes the Frame Generation feature from DLSS 3 and allows it to generate even more frames. It's why Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang claimed that the $549 RTX 5070 performed like the $1,599 RTX 4090; it's also why those claims are a bit misleading.</p>
<p>The rollout <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-geforce-rtx-50-series-opens-new-world-of-ai-computer-graphics">will begin</a> with the RTX 5090 and 5080 on January 30. The 5070 Ti and 5070 will follow at some point in February. All cards except the 5070 Ti will come in Nvidia-designed Founders Editions as well as designs made by Nvidia's partners; the 5070 Ti isn't getting a Founders Edition.</p>

<p>The RTX 5090, based on Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture, is a gigantic chip with 92 billion transistors in it. And while it is double the price of an RTX 5080, you also get double the GPU cores and double the RAM and nearly double the memory bandwidth. Even more than the 4090, it's being positioned head and shoulders above the rest of the GPUs in the family, and the 5080's performance won't come remotely close to it.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Although $1,999 is a lot to ask for a graphics card, if Nvidia can consistently make the RTX 5090 available at $2,000, it could still be an improvement over the pricing of the 4090, which <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-rtx-4090-supplies-are-dwindling-resulting-in-higher-prices-the-same-thing-that-happened-with-past-gpu-generations">regularly sold for well over $1,599</a>&nbsp;over the course of its lifetime, due in part to pandemic-fueled GPU shortages, cryptocurrency mining, and the generative AI boom. Companies and other entities buying them as AI accelerators may restrict the availability of the 5090, too, but Nvidia's highest GPU tier has been well out of the price range of most consumers for a while now.</p>
<p>Despite the higher power budget—as predicted, it's 125 W higher than the 4090 at 450 W, and Nvidia recommends a 1,000 W power supply or better—the physical size of the 5090 Founders Edition is considerably smaller than the 4090, which was large enough that it had trouble fitting into some computer cases. Thanks to a "high-density PCB" and redesigned cooling system, the 5090 Founders Edition is a dual-slot card that ought to fit into small-form-factor systems much more easily than the 4090. Of course, this won't stop most third-party 5090 GPUs from being gigantic triple-fan monstrosities, but it is apparently possible to make a reasonably sized version of the card.</p>
<p>Moving on to the 5080, it looks like more of a mild update from last year's RTX 4080 Super, with a few hundred more CUDA cores, more memory bandwidth (thanks to the use of GDDR7, since the two GPUs share the same 256-bit interface), and a slightly higher power budget of 360 W (compared to 320 W for the 4080 Super).</p>
<p>Having more cores and faster memory, in addition to whatever improvements and optimizations come with the Blackwell architecture, should help the 5080 easily beat the 4080 Super. But it's an open question as to whether it will be able to beat the 4090, at least before you consider any DLSS-related frame rate increases. The 4090 has 52 percent more GPU cores, a wider memory bus, and 8GB more memory.</p>

<p>At $749 and $549, the 5070 Ti and 5070 are slightly more within reach for someone who's trying to spend less than $2,000 on a new gaming PC. Both cards hew relatively closely to the specs of the 4070 Ti Super and 4070 Super, both of which are already solid 1440p and 4K graphics cards for many titles.</p>
<p>Like the 5080, the 5070 Ti includes a few hundred more CUDA cores, more memory bandwidth, and slightly higher power requirements compared to the 4070 Ti Super. That the card is $50 less than the 4070 Ti Super was at launch is a nice bonus—if it can come close to or beat the RTX 4080 for $250 less, it could be an appealing high-end option.</p>
<p>The RTX 5070 is alone in having fewer CUDA cores than its immediate predecessor—6,144, down from 7,168. It is an upgrade from the original 4070, which had 5,888 CUDA cores, and GDDR7 and slightly faster clock speeds may still help it outrun the 4070 Super; like the other 50-series cards, it also comes with a higher power budget. But right now this card is looking like the closest thing to a lateral move in the lineup, at least before you consider the additional frame-generation capabilities of DLSS 4.</p>

      Many of Nvidia's most ostentatious performance claims—including the one that the RTX 5070 is as fast as a 4090—factors in DLSS 4's additional AI-generated frames.

<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/nvidias-399-4060-ti-comes-with-no-price-hike-but-mild-performance-improvements/">When launching new 40-series cards</a> over the last two years, it was common for Nvidia to publish a couple of different performance comparisons to last-gen cards: one with DLSS turned off and one with DLSS and the 40-series-exclusive Frame Generation feature turned on. Nvidia would then lean on the DLSS-enabled numbers when making broad proclamations about a GPU's performance, as it does in its <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-geforce-rtx-50-series-opens-new-world-of-ai-computer-graphics">official press release</a> when it says the 5090 is twice as fast as the 4090, or as Huang did during his CES keynote when he claimed that an RTX 5070 offered RTX 4090 performance for $549.</p>

<p>DLSS Frame Generation is an AI feature that builds on what DLSS is already doing. Where DLSS uses AI to fill in gaps and make a lower-resolution image look like a higher-resolution image, DLSS Frame Generation creates entirely new frames and inserts them in between the frames that your GPU is actually rendering.</p>
<figure>
    
          <figcaption>
        <div>

      DLSS 4 now generates up to three frames for every frame the GPU is actually rendering. Used in concert with DLSS image upscaling, Nvidia says that "15 out of every 16 pixels" you see on your screen are being generated by its AI models.

<p>The RTX 50-series one-ups the 40-series <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations/">with DLSS 4</a>, another new revision that's exclusive to its just-launched GPUs: DLSS Multi Frame Generation. Instead of generating one extra frame for every traditionally rendered frame, DLSS 4 generates "up to three additional frames" to slide in between the ones your graphics card is actually rendering—based on Nvidia's slides, it looks like users ought to be able to control how many extra frames are being generated, just as they can control the quality settings for DLSS upscaling. Nvidia is leaning on the Blackwell architecture's faster Tensor Cores, which it says are up to 2.5 times faster than the Tensor Cores in the RTX 40-series, to do the AI processing necessary to upscale rendered frames and to generate new ones.</p>
<p>Nvidia's performance comparisons aren't indefensible; with DLSS FG enabled, the cards can put out a lot of frames per second. It's just dependent on game support (Nvidia says that 75 titles will support it at launch), and going off of our experience with the original iteration of Frame Generation, there will likely be scenarios where image quality is noticeably worse or just "off-looking" compared to actual rendered frames. DLSS FG also needed a solid base frame rate to get the best results, which may or may not be the case for Multi-FG.</p>

      Enhanced versions of older DLSS features can benefit all RTX cards, including the 20-, 30-, and 40-series. Multi-Frame Generation is restricted to the 50-series, though.

<p>Though the practice of restricting the biggest DLSS upgrades to all-new hardware is a bit frustrating, Nvidia <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations/">did announce</a> that it's releasing a new transformer module for the DLSS Ray Reconstruction, Super Resolution, and Anti-Aliasing features. These are DLSS features that are available on all RTX GPUs going all the way back to the RTX 20-series, and games that are upgraded to use the newer models should benefit from improved upscaling quality even if they're using older GPUs.</p>

<p>Nvidia's laptop GPU announcements sometimes trail the desktop announcements by a few weeks or months. But the company has already announced mobile versions of the 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti, and 5070 that Nvidia says will begin shipping in laptops priced between $1,299 and $2,899 when they launch in March.</p>
<p>All of these GPUs share names, the Blackwell architecture, and DLSS 4 support with their desktop counterparts, but per usual they're significantly cut down to fit on a laptop motherboard and within a laptop's cooling capacity. The mobile version of the 5090 includes 10,496 GPU cores, less than half the number of the desktop version, and just 24GB of GDDR7 memory on a 256-bit interface instead of 32GB on a 512-bit interface. But it also can operate with a power budget between 95 and 150 W, a fraction of what the desktop 5090 needs.</p>

<p>The other three GPUs are mostly cut down in similar ways, and all of them have fewer GPU cores and lower power requirements than their desktop counterparts. The 5070 GPUs both have less RAM and narrowed memory buses, too, but the mobile RTX 5080 at least comes closer to its desktop iteration, with the same 256-bit bus width and 16GB of RAM.</p>

                <p>Parkour has been an important part of the Assassin's Creed franchise from the beginning, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> will be making some adjustments to the acrobatic running style. Ubisoft has already hinted that Naoe--one of Shadows' new leading characters--can Naruto run in the game. But that's just the beginning of what she can pull off while running.</p><p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4TA6gKaTvtOC1mOjZIxCZd/assassins-creed-shadows-parkour-system-overview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared an extensive breakdown</a> of Shadow's new parkour options, as well as the revised button map for the game. One of the most notable changes is that the crouch and the dodge buttons have traded places. That will allow the player to either crouch or lie in a prone position. Naoe can even kill her targets while lying prone.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTuL0Ob2EnU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uTuL0Ob2EnU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Yasuke--the game's other lead character--and Naoe can both perform dodges while crouched, but only the latter can pull off a dodge in her prone stance. The other new parkour moves that Naoe can pull off include a wall-run eject and a backward dodge, which you can see below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXehGq8UkuM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WXehGq8UkuM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Some of the parkour and climbing moves can be performed by both Yasuke and Naoe, but she's more suited for those because she's light on her feet and able to pull off a recovery roll while falling.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Yq6RcLE8Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/33Yq6RcLE8Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The developers also noted that not every wall surface in the game will be climbable for either character.

            <p>
While some handheld gaming PC manufacturers are busy cornering the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acer-unveils-dubiously-portable-nitro-blaze-11-handheld-gaming-pc-with-1095-inch-screen">comically large form factor market</a>, Lenovo has slipped in to announce several new - and considerably more portable - devices of its own, including the Legion Go 2 and a handheld utilising SteamOS.
</p>
<p>
Starting with the Legion Go 2, that's Lenovo's currently still-in-prototype second generation handheld gaming PC, which - alongside its built-in kickstand and ergonomically improved detachable controllers - sports an 8.8-inch OLED display with VRR support, and comes equipped with either the upcoming AMD Ryzen Z2 or Ryzen Z2 Extreme. It can also sport up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB of SSD storage, to further boost its beefy credentials.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, there's no hint of a release window or price for the Legion Go 2 just yet, with Lenovo instead choosing to focus its attention on its other newly announced handheld gaming PC: the more modest, and more imminently available, Legion Go S.
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
The Legion Go S offers a sleeker alternative to Lenovo's existing Legion Go, doing away with the former's detachable controllers in favour of a more rounded all-in-one design. It features an 8-inch, 16:10 IPS LCD multi-touch screen (with a 120Hz variable refresh rate and 1920 x 1200 resolution), alongside hall-effect thumbsticks, a redesigned D-pad, and dual stage triggers.
</p><p>
As for the insides, Legion Go S includes either an AMD Ryzen Z2 Go or Z1 Extreme processor, and can be equipped with up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD. All this lives inside a 299mm x 127.6 x 22.6 shell and weighs upwards of 730g - around 90g heavier than Steam Deck. Lenovo tells <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">The Verge</a> it's targeting two to 2.5 hours of battery life for demanding games.

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
Lenovo's first Legion Go S model begins shipping this month, costing £649.99/$729.99 with the Z2 Go processor, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. It'll be followed in May by a slightly lower-specced £600/$599.99 variant, featuring the Z2 Go, 16GB RAM, and 1TB storage. Both machines utilise Windows 11, but Lenovo is also working on a SteamOS-powered Go S, making it the first authorised third-party handheld gaming device to utilise Valve's operating system. This is the cheapest of the bunch, costing $499.99 with the Z2 Go, 16GB RAM, and 512GB storage - and The Verge reports it should also arrive in May.
</p>
<p>
For anyone with an eye on the slightly more distant future, however, Digital Foundry has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-amd-announces-next-gen-ryzen-z2-apus-for-gaming-handhelds">taken a look</a> at AMD's newly announced trio of next-gen Ryzen Z-series APUs - the kind that'll be packed into Lenovo's second generation Legion Go 2 - if you're curious to learn more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/warframe-digital-extremes-balatro-vampire-survivors-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As we’ve <a href="https://aftermath.site/warframe-1999-romance-dating-tennocon-soulframe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously established</a>, <em>Warframe </em>– originally a cooperative multiplayer shooter about space ninjas – now contains just about every system known to man. Fishing? Yep. Hoverboarding? Absolutely. A full-blown dating sim? Yes, thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr30oQoKeIo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recently-released <em>1999 </em>update</a>, <em>Warframe </em>even includes that. You might examine the game’s feature list and conclude that Digital Extremes is weeping, for there are no more worlds left to conquer. But in that regard, you’d be wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>During an interview in LA last month, I asked creative director Rebb Ford about the <em>Warframe </em>team’s pie-in-the-sky system ideas. What, I wondered, are the most off-the-wall mechanics they could plausibly implement? And where do the intimidatingly bounteous sci-fi opus’ limits lie?</p><p>"I like to think that it's usually a reflection of the things I'm actively playing," Ford told Aftermath. “And because I've played so much <em>Balatro</em>, I'm prone to say something with the cards [you use to modify equipment] beyond modding would be cool. But we do pitches. We look at, like, what if the mods in <em>Warframe </em>had a playable aspect to them? You get so close to committing, and then you're like 'Well, who's this for? And why are we doing this? So let's just focus on what people play <em>Warframe </em>for.' But yeah, the temptation is always there."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Ford added that there’s a “shadow of a card game” that exists in internal documents at Digital Extremes, as well as a “shadow of a <em>Vampire Survivors</em>-style thing” in design director Pablo Alonso’s build of <em>Warframe</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>"But I do feel like our responsibility as custodians of <em>Warframe </em>is to make things that the audience probably came for in the first place and take, like, one risk per update – like the dating system,” Ford said. “So measure and try, because if you stray too far, you end up making no one happy."</p><figure><blockquote><p>We look at, like, what if the mods in <em>Warframe </em>had a playable aspect to them? You get so close to committing, and then you're like 'Well, who's this for? And why are we doing this?'</p></blockquote></figure><p>As for additions that are unlikely to happen on Ford’s watch, she pointed to a regularly-requested feature: overhauled PVP.&nbsp;</p><p>"We have been tempted by redoing [PVP mode] Conclave,” said Ford. “I think true PVP, done better than we do, would be very difficult for us to commit to just because there's some things we're never going to change – like our networking architecture, dedicated servers, [etc]. We can't compete with the <em>Valorants </em>of the world, and I'd rather play <em>Valorant </em>or <em>Fortnite</em>, right? I'll just go play that and then come to <em>Warframe </em>for a totally different flavor. As heartbreaking as that might be for our Conclave community – I say this apologetically, not cavalierly – I just don't see us saying, like, 5v5 team fights are on the table.”</p><p><em>Warframe</em>’s teetering tower of systems might suggest a throw-shit-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks mentality, but maintaining the game is a careful balancing act. Some modern triple-A games boast development team sizes in the thousands, but not <em>Warframe</em>; Ford estimated that around 280 people are working on the game currently. Keeping it alive 12 years and countless updates after release requires careful planning.&nbsp;</p><p>"We typically try and have unique features with each major update we do, and if it's gonna be good and people like it and it has legs, we will push it into newer stuff,” said Ford. “We plan, but we plan to adjust. We already know all of [2025's] major updates, but what isn't started is where we have to add or remove things based on reactions to <em>Warframe: 1999</em>. … One thing we haven't accounted for is reception to [the dating sim and character interaction] feature. And if it goes over well – if, I would say, more than 80 percent of people really like it – we will need to change plans for [2025]. But if it's just a cool-enough thing that added to the world, we'll do what we have to do to make other features."</p><p>This approach, Ford believes, explains a common complaint in the <em>Warframe </em>community: Not every system in the game gets the same amount of attention, and some feel like they’ve been abandoned.</p><p>"I think abandonment is a fair perspective for some features,” she said. “It's in the eye of the beholder. Like 'Oh, they abandoned PVP.' Actually, yeah, we kind of did, because none of us at the new leadership level are playing PVP games. You don't want PVP made by me. You really don't. ... I think that's a reasonable truth to share with our players, and we do. And then the [features] that we want to come back to, we only talk about when we're sure."</p><p>“It’s a big game,” Ford added. “12 years of tech debt, and everything has to work. We do our best.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/acer-nitro-blaze-11-screen-too-big-steam-deck"><h3>Too Big</h3></a><p>Unless you are a giant</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Not only will Lenovo ship <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">the first third-party SteamOS handheld</a> this May, Valve has now revealed it will let you install a working copy of SteamOS on <em>other </em>handhelds even sooner than that. </p><p>Pierre-Loup Griffais, one of the lead designers on the Steam Deck and SteamOS, tells me a beta for other handhelds “is slated to ship after March sometime,” and that you might discover the OS <em>just starts working properly</em> after that happens! </p><p>Griffais and his co-designer Lawrence Yang would not confirm which handhelds might just start working, though there are some obvious candidates: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">the company confirmed to us in August</a> that it had been adding support for the Asus ROG Ally’s controls. </p><p>Also, quite a few PC gamers have also discovered that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">Bazzite, a fork of Valve’s Steam Deck experience that I loved testing on an Ally X</a> and vastly preferred to Windows, also works wonderfully on the Lenovo Legion Go. There still aren’t that many handhelds out there at the end of the day, and I would think Valve would take advantage of work the Linux gaming community has already done on both.</p><p>Speaking of Bazzite, Valve seems to be flattered! “We have nothing against it,” says Yang. “It’s a great community project that delivers a lot of value to people that want a similar experience on devices right now,” says Griffais, adding later “In a lot of ways Bazzite is a good way to kind of get the latest and greatest of what we’ve been working on, and test it.” </p><p>But he says Bazzite isn’t yet in a state where a hardware manufacturer could preload it on a handheld, nor would Valve allow that. While users can freely download and install the SteamOS image onto their own devices, companies aren’t allowed to sell it or modify it, and must partner with Valve first.</p><p>There are some non-selfish reasons for that. Among other things, Griffais explains that the Lenovo Legion Go S will run the same SteamOS image as the Steam Deck itself, taking advantage of the same software updates and the same precached shaders that let games load and run more smoothly, just with added hardware compatibility tweaks. Valve wants to make sure SteamOS is a single platform, not a fragmented one.</p><p>“In general, we just want to make sure we have a good pathway to work together on things like firmware updates and you can get to things like the boot manager and the BIOS and things like that in a semi-standardized fashion, right?” says Griffais, regarding what Valve needs to see in a partnership that would officially ship SteamOS on other devices.</p><p>Valve isn’t currently partnered with any other companies beyond Lenovo to do that collaboration — Yang tells me the company is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337913/no-valve-isnt-working-with-gpd-to-bring-steamos-to-its-handheld"><em>not</em> working with GPD on official SteamOS support</a>, despite that manufacturer’s claim. </p><p>Valve’s also not promising that whichever Windows handheld you have will necessarily run SteamOS perfectly — in a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F593110%2Fview%2F529834914570306831">new blog post</a>, Valve only confirms that a beta will ship before Lenovo’s Legion Go S, that it “should improve the experience on other devices,” and that users “can download and test this themselves.”</p><p>As far as other form factors, like possible SteamOS living room boxes, Valve says you might have a good experience trying that. And partnerships are a possibility there too: “if someone wants to bring that to the market and preload SteamOS on it, we’d be happy to talk to them.”</p><p>Valve wouldn’t tell me anything about the rumors that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/11/19/24300757/valve-steam-controller-2-roy-deckard-leak">developing its own Steam Controller 2, VR headset with wands</a>, and possibly its own living room box, but did tell me that we “might expect more Steam Input compatible controllers in the future.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Lenovo has announced the Lenovo Legion Go S, the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-announces-steamos-is-available-for-third-party-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-party handheld</a> gaming PC to come with SteamOS installed instead of Windows. The announcement was made on Tuesday at CES 2025.</p>



<p>Launching in May, Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS will cost $499. The <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-legion-unleashes-next-gen-gaming-power-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">handheld features</a> an eight-inch 16:10 touch display at 120Hz. Internal specs include a Lenovo-exclusive AMD Ryzen Z2 Go or AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor,16GB of memory, 512GB of storage, and a 55.5Whr battery. </p>



<p>Other features include Wi-Fi 6e support, two USB 4 ports, and a MicroSD slot for expanded storage. Regarding battery life, Lenovo says that the Legion Go S should have 2.5-3 hours on a full charge, depending on the gaming being done.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As far as what’s gone from the original Legion Go, the new device no longer features a kickstand or detachable controllers akin to the Nintendo Switch. By removing these features and making the device slightly smaller, it brings the weight of the Legion Go S down to 1.61lbs.</p>



<p>The Lenovo Legion Go S will also launch with a version that comes with Windows preinstalled for those that prefer Microsoft’s operating system. The Windows version of the device will release this month for $729.99 and include 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. As with all Windows devices, Steam can be installed as a standalone application.</p>



<p>The Windows version comes in white while the SteamOS version comes in black.</p>

                <p>Nvidia finally revealed their next-generation RTX 50-series graphics cards at CES 2025, with some big performance improvements expected thanks to the new Blackwell architecture. But since 2020 and the launch of the RTX 20 series, Nvidia has been working on and expanding its range of AI enhancements as part of its DLSS suite of exclusive features, with its latest iteration, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ray-tracing-rtx-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DLSS 4</a>, set to propel both new and older GPUs forward.</p><p>DLSS 4's biggest new feature is one that will be exclusive to the new RTX 50-series GPUs. Multi Frame Generation is the next step in the Frame Generation race that Nvidia kicked off with the RTX 40-series range. Instead of just injecting a single, AI-generated frame between two traditionally rendered one, Multi Frame Generation now offers up to four AI-generated frames to be inserted, substantially increasing a game's frame rate. Nvidia says that its new GPUs can deliver nearly eight times more performance than "brute-force" rendering, but how well each generated frame looks and how this impacts input latency has yet to be determined.</p><p>Digital Foundry was given access to an engineering sample of the RTX 5080 and limited time to test Multi Frame Generation in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/" data-ref-id="5000-143160">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and came away impressed with both the image quality and fluidity of the experience.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpzufsxtZpA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xpzufsxtZpA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Perhaps more interesting are the DLSS 4 improvements that will be supported on all of Nvidia's RTX GPUs. Nvidia has updated its transformer model that powers DLSS Super Sampling, Ray Reconstruction, and DLAA for the first time, moving away from its previous convolutional neural networks approach. What this means is that its newer model is more adept at identifying parts of a rendered image that are important and with more granularity, offering up more stable upscaling and ray-tracing quality as a result.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15853545/4423817-0726012417-nvidi.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423817" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15853545/4423817-0726012417-nvidi.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423817"></a><figcaption>Breakdown of DLSS 4 enhancements for various RTX GPU generations</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15853545/4423817-0726012417-nvidi.jpg"></figure><p>DLSS Super Resolution (Nvidia's AI-enhanced upscaling solution), Ray Reconstruction, and DLAA will be improving thanks to this upgrade across all RTX hardware, starting with the RTX 20 series. Nvidia is also adding the ability to switch between specific DLSS releases from within its GeForce Experience application in the near future, which previously had to be manually done for each game if you wanted to experiment with newer DLSS versions that hadn't been patched in by developers. This can potentially give some new life to older hardware, at least from an image-quality standpoint.</p><p>There's no question that the headline feature for DLSS 4 is the one that only works on Nvidia's latest and greatest hardware, which starts shipping later this month and will be supported in over 75 games and apps immediately. But unlike the update for Frame Generation with the RTX 40 series launch, there's a lot more to get excited about for the many more already on Nvidia's platform.</p>
