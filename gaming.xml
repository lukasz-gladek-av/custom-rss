            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-school-shooter-lawsuit/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>On the second anniversary of the Uvalde school shooting, two lawsuits were revealed, filed on behalf of the families of the victims against a weapons manufacturer – and Activision Blizzard. The families are being represented by Josh Koskoff, who has gone on record as saying, ‘There is a direct line between the conduct of these companies and the Uvalde shooting.’</p>



<p>Meta was also named in one of the lawsuits, but the bulk of the litigation is being aimed at Activision Blizzard as the publisher of Call of Duty and Daniel Defense, a manufacturer of the weapon used in the school shooting that left 22 dead and a further 21 injured.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-knowingly-exposed">‘Knowingly Exposed’</h2>



<p>At the heart of these lawsuits, which were revealed on May 24, sits a claim that Activision and Meta have joined forces with the weapons manufacturing industry to ‘reach’ young, impressionable people. That’s the damning claim set forth by Koskoff in a statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The truth is that the gun industry and Daniel Defense didn’t act alone. They couldn’t have reached this kid but for Instagram. They couldn’t expose him to the dopamine loop of virtually killing a person. That’s what Call of Duty does.</p>



<p>(Meta and Activision Blizzard) knowingly exposed the Shooter to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as the solution to his problems, and trained him to use it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This isn’t the first time that Call of Duty has been set forth as a root cause or a figure of blame for a tragic school shooting. In 2012, the Sandy Hook shooter – who also ran rampant in an elementary school – was accused of being obsessed with video games, particularly Call of Duty. It was a few years ago that <a href="https://www.koskoff.com/in-the-news/sandy-hook-families-achieve-historic-victory-holding-gunmaker-accountable-for-role-in-school-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Josh Koskoff successfully led a legal campaign</a> against Remington, the manufacturer of the weapon used in <strong>that </strong>shooting.</p>



<p>Activision Blizzard published an immediate response to the lawsuits, stressing that they were sympathetic to the ‘horrendous and heartbreaking’ events that took place in Uvalde in 2022, but ‘Millions of people around the world enjoy video games without turning to horrific acts.’</p>



<p>That has long been the argument in favour of violent video games. When Donald Trump took to a podium in 2019 to ‘take a firm stance’ <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-suggests-video-games-blame-mass-shootings-n1039411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">against violent games</a> like Call of Duty, communities worldwide were quick to highlight that there are two billion gamers, many of which play violent games, and the research indicates that said games <strong>aren’t </strong>influencing them to go on vicious rampages armed with assault rifles.</p>



<p>If the lawsuit is successful against Activision Blizzard, the claims that these games are ‘knowingly promoting dangerous weapons to millions of vulnerable young people’ could have dramatic ramifications against the industry. From Fortnite to Grand Theft Auto, and from Rainbow Six to Battlefield, real-world weapons are replicated in thousands of video games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cod-black-ops-6-ps4-xo-october/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will reportedly also release on the last-gen consoles, including the PS4 and Xbox One.</p>
<p>Some days ago, following <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-gulf-war-rumor-early-access-period-unusually-long/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plenty of rumors</a>, Activision officially announced a new entry in the Black Ops series - no subtitle, just Black Ops 6. Aside from releasing later this year on the current-gen consoles and PC, Tom Henderson from Insider Gaming now also reports that the shooter will be released on last-gen consoles, in a similar fashion as last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-2023-that-familiar-feeling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Modern Warfare 3</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently, retailer GameStop <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1794089299589132780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had listings for the game, mentioning an SKU for PS4 as well</a>. Although there doesn't seem to be a separate Xbox One SKU, Henderson writes that the Xbox Series S|X version is a cross-gen version, which will also work on Xbox One. "Insider Gaming has been able to verify with multiple sources that the image is legitimate and that Black Ops 6 will be coming to past-generation consoles", Henderson writes in his article.</p>
<p>As for when Black Ops 6 will launch, outlet The Verge reports that the title is slated for a late October 2024 release. As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-to-release-october-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> by Insider Gaming, this likely means that the shooter is dropping on October 25 since the 18th of October would be considered mid-October.</p>
<p>More details about this year's Call of Duty entry will be shared during a special Black Ops 6 Direct broadcast, which will take place immediately after <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-call-of-duty-direct-dated-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft's Xbox Showcase on June 9</a>. "<em>Like our double-feature last year with Starfield Direct, immediately following the Showcase we’ll be airing a special deep-dive into the next installment of a beloved franchise", Microsoft wrote last month. "We can’t say much, so for now we’ll call it the Xbox Games Showcase followed by [REDACTED] Direct. This will also be our first Showcase featuring games from our portfolio of studios across Activision, Blizzard, Bethesda and Xbox Game Studios, in addition to titles from our third-party partners.”</em></p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as more information about Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 comes in.</p>

Its nomer has now become a misnomer.</p> <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="260" data-injectable="false">The new roomisode features the eponymous Dangeresque’s counterweight Dangeresque Too as he fights the fickle stubbornness of elevator doors using adventure game logic. That’s all I got, about the new episode, so here are the bullet points from the release:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true"> <li>Um, more puzzles</li> <li>Uhh, more cutscenes</li> <li>More entertaining ways to die</li> <li>Single click interface!

 <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">As legend has it, <em>Dangeresque: The Roomisode </em>came out in 2008 around the time of the blockbuster <em>Strong Bad’s Cool Game for Attractive People</em>.

 <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false">It’s really good! If I can talk real here, the fact that Videlectrix squished down the point-and-click formula to fit in one room (later three) is quite the design flex. Take that, doors. We don’t need you.</p> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true">The new Roomisode, <em>Roomisode X</em> was teased way, way back a few months ago when my life peaked and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-brothers-chaps-of-homestar-runner-fame-talk-about-videlectrix-and-the-future-of-good-graphics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I interviewed the Brothers Chaps</a>. That was a fun time. Let’s all reflect on that for a while.</p>
 <p data-characters="120" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"><em>Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate </em>is available on PC and Linux. <em>Roomisode X</em> should have been glued on there by now.</p>

Both suits arrive on the two-year anniversary of the shooting, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary School. The documents claim that Activision, Meta, and Daniel Defense each took part in "grooming" the gunman to be a mass shooter.</p><p>Activision and Meta are being sued, essentially, for the roles the documents allege they played in promoting the gun used in the shooting to 18-year-old Salvador Ramos. The Uvalde families are being represented by lawyer Josh Koskoff, best known for reaching a $73 million settlement with the maker of another AR-15-style rifle that was used in the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school shooting.</p><p>“Daniel Defense is a predator but can’t get to the prey without the help of these other third parties,” Koskoff says.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/uvalde-1716591211262.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The families of Uvalde shooting victims are suing Activision, Meta, and Daniel Defense. (Image credit: Wu Xiaoling/Xinhua via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></output><p>Ramos allegedly bought the gun a week before the shooting, just 23 minutes after his 18th birthday, the suit alleges. Koskoff argues that this came months after he started playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare which, according to the lawyer's account, began a spiral of the teenager becoming obsessed with guns. The gun that Ramos did end up purchasing, a DDM4 V7, was featured on Modern Warfare's opening title page, the lawsuit says.</p><p>“Within a week of downloading Modern Warfare on Nov. 5, 2021, the shooter’s phone indicates a growing obsession with weapons and accessories associated with the game," Koskoff says, according to the NYT. </p><p>The suit goes onto allege that, by December 2021, Ramos was looking into Daniel Defense, reasearching what models he might use, and making several Instagram posts about weapons. In the process, Koskoff claims, the teenager was "targeted and cultivated online by Instagram, Activision and Daniel Defense."</p><p>"This three-headed monster knowingly exposed him to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as a tool to solve his problems and trained him to use it," Koskoff says.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“Daniel Defense is a predator but can’t get to the prey without the help of these other third parties.</p></div><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uvalde-shooting-families-wrongful-death-lawsuit-meta-activision-daniel-defense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS News</a>, Koskoff added that Instagram created a "connection" between the gunman and the gun manufacturer.</p><p>"And nobody exploited Instagram for this purpose more than Daniel Defense," he said. "If Instagram can prevent people from posting pictures of their private parts, they can prevent people from posting pictures of an AR-15. And of course, Instagram doesn't care. They don't care. All they care about is driving traffic and generating attention, drawing attention and getting their ad revenue."  </p><p>Meta and Daniel Defense did not immediately respond to IGN's request for comment. When reached by IGN, Activision issued the following statement:</p><blockquote>The Uvalde shooting was horrendous and heartbreaking in every way, and we express our deepest sympathies to the families and communities who remain impacted by this senseless act of violence. Millions of people around the world enjoy video games without turning to horrific acts.</blockquote><p>The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) has also issued the following statement, more broadly addressing violence in video games:</p><blockquote>We are saddened and outraged by senseless acts of violence. At the same time, we discourage baseless accusations linking these tragedies to video gameplay, which detract from efforts to focus on the root issues in question and safeguard against future tragedies. Many other countries have similar rates of video gameplay to the United States, yet do not see similar rates of gun violence.</blockquote><p>The new lawsuits come just days after the same 19 Uvalde families <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uvalde-school-shooting-settlement-texas-city-lawsuits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reached a $2 million settlement</a> with the Texas city, in which they were also represented by Koskoff. They also announced a number of new lawsuits against the Texas Department of Public Safety officers and Uvalde's school district, including one $500 million suit against nearly 100 state police officers. </p><p><em>Thumbnail credit: Wu Xiaoling/Xinhua via Getty Images</em></p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

As noted in the lawsuit, the families accuse Activision and Meta of “grooming” young men and putting them on a path toward violent acts. On May 24th, 2022, 18-year-old Salvador Ramos opened fire at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, killing 21.</p><p>The lawsuit says that the gunman played <em>Call of Duty </em>“obsessively, developed skill as a marksman, and obtained rewards that become available only after a substantial time investment.” It also claims that the game features the AR-15 used in the shooting. At the same time, the lawsuit alleges that “the shooter was being courted through explicit, aggressive marketing” on Instagram that showed “hundreds of images depicting and venerating the thrill of combat.”</p><div><p>“Activision should stop training and habituating kids to kill”</p></div><p>In addition to Activision and Meta, the families of the Uvalde victims are also suing Daniel Defense, the gun company that made the AR-15 used in the shooting. The lawsuit alleges Daniel Defense promotes its weapons to minors on Instagram through posts “glorifying” combat. Meta’s rules <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/09/facebook-gun-sellers-10-strikes/">theoretically</a> ban companies from selling guns on its platforms, though, and the gunman purchased the AR-15 from Daniel Defense’s website — not through Instagram. </p><p>Section 230 immunizes platforms from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/18/21262248/supreme-court-rejects-stuart-force-facebook-section-230-lawsuit-algorithms">civil lawsuits such as these</a> if they arise from posts made by their users, though things are a little more complicated in cases <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/25/23889747/facebook-biased-ad-algorithm-aclu-court">where a platform’s targeted advertising</a> is the primary issue. Meta didn’t immediately respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment.</p><p>“Companies like Instagram and Activision do more than just allow gun companies to reach consumers — they underwrite and mainstream violence to struggling adolescents,” wrote Josh Koskoff, the attorney for the Uvalde families. “Instagram should stop enabling the marketing of AR-15s to kids by gun companies; and Activision should stop training and habituating kids to kill. It’s that simple.”</p><div><p>Video game companies <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/5/17082832/video-game-industry-esa-trump-meeting-violence-school-shooting-controversy">have long pushed back</a> on the idea that video games can cause real-world violence, something <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754793/trump-gun-control-video-games-violence-republicans-no-evidence-dayton-el-paso-texas-ohio">politicians have often claimed following mass shootings</a>. However, <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/02/stanford-researchers-scoured-every-reputable-study-link-between-video-games-gun-violence-politics-mental-health-dupee-thvar-vasan/">research has shown</a> that video games don’t cause violent acts, and lawsuits targeting video game companies for the actions of other school shooters have failed.</p></div><p>In a statement provided to <em>The Verge</em>, Activision’s head of corporate communications Delaney Simmons writes: “Millions of people around the world enjoy video games without turning to horrific acts.”</p><p>Koskoff previously won <a href="https://www.koskoff.com/in-the-news/sandy-hook-families-achieve-historic-victory-holding-gunmaker-accountable-for-role-in-school-massacre/">a $73 million settlement</a> for the families of Sandy Hook school shooting victims from gun manufacturer Remington.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The book takes fans on a frame-by-frame journey through the expansion's seven bosses and The King's Leap challenge arena. Delicious Last Course also introduced Ms. Chalice as a playable character and numerous new NPCs who will likely be featured in this art book.</p><p>If you've played Cuphead, you know the level of detail on display in each of the game's inventive boss battles. The DLC actually has as many frames of animation as the base game, despite it only comprising about 25% of the full Cuphead experience. The Art of Cuphead, which focuses on the base game, is a fascinating, must-have book for fans, so we'd expect The Art of Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course to provide a similarly insightful look inside Studio MDHR's creative process.</p><p>Along with frame-by-frame animation of the bosses you can find in The Delicious Last Course, this book contains early concept art as well as unused ideas.</p><p>With Amazon's preorder price guarantee, you'll get The Art of Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course for the lowest price offered between the time you order and release.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xdefiant-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>XDefiant is an FPS with an identity crisis. This arcade-style arena shooter pulls characters and locations from various Ubisoft games, and it feels a little bit like a lot of different things as a result: It's fast and twitchy in a way that’s similar to games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-multiplayer-review">Call of Duty</a>, but has class abilities that might put it closer to something like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-review">Overwatch</a>. It’s got fast respawns and faster deaths, but offers objective-based modes that prioritize teamwork over straight killcount. That combination of disparate elements helps XDefiant play a little differently overall from most competitive shooters, but it also makes it feel a bit jumbled, like its parts aren’t always working together toward the same goals.</p><p>Call of Duty figured out the fun of grounded but fast-paced competitive play in this vein way back in the late 2000s, and XDefiant is clearly chasing that same success with its solid FPS design. Though the weapons are all pretty standard for military shooters like this, they still feel distinct and satisfying to use – the AK-47 hits harder and kicks a little differently than the M41A, for instance, and it feels meaningful to pick one over the other for your play style. Guns are also, for the most part, appropriately deadly, but you'll get the most out of them when you spend time mastering the way recoil pulls your aim and what benefits you get from equipping a specific scope or stock. XDefiant pairs that with class abilities like healing teammates, dropping shields, and launching explosive drones, which can change the flow of a fight when they're used well, but they're not so powerful that they ever override the emphasis on its central shooting mechanics.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>XDefiant Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>If nothing else, this is a fun shooter where the gunplay feels good, and you can do a whole lot worse than that as a solid foundation. It's the other stuff layered on top of that gunplay, however, that XDefiant struggles to mix into a coherent whole.</p><p>The hook is that XDefiant is a sort of multiverse of different Ubisoft worlds combined into a single competitive shootout. When you jump into a match, you choose a character from one of four factions based on Ubisoft’s games (a fifth can be unlocked through gameplay or purchased), which function as your classes, and they're all <em>just</em> distinct and interesting enough to play differently without feeling like they’re mismatched and shoehorned into the same game. The Libertad faction from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/far-cry-6-review">Far Cry 6</a>, for example, is essentially a medic class. They recover from damage faster and can either fire off a fast-heal charge in a radius around the player who activates it, or drop a stationary device that slowly heals anyone nearby. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/10/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-breakpoint-review">Ghost Recon</a> Phantoms are tanks that don’t die quite as quickly as other factions. They're able to either deploy a stationary barrier that they and their allies can shoot through, or pull out a personal riot shield that's pretty effective at stopping bullets in both directions. There are also factions based on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/20/the-division-2-review">The Division</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/watch-dogs-legion-review">Watch Dogs</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/14/splinter-cell-blacklist-review">Splinter Cell</a>, and like in any class-based shooter, picking the right ability at the right time is important enough that it can change the flow of a fight. But you’re not locked into that choice for the whole match, so every time you kill an enemy you know they can adapt to your strengths and come back as a new class with a different set of skills. Knowing how and when to counter an enemy’s abilities is almost as important to your team as your aim.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Each faction mostly feels pretty distinct, but some definitely stand ahead of others.</p></div><p>The final major difference between each faction is their ultra ability: This big special power can only be used after you've charged it by racking up kills or scoring points toward objectives, but unlike many games’ ultimate abilities, there’s usually a way for the other team to shut them down if you’re not careful. For instance, the Phantoms’ ultra gives them a personal energy dome that protects them from all damage coming from outside of it, but opponents who are quick and smart – and avoid the defensive cannon – can slip through and kill whoever’s generating it, canceling the ability. The same is true of the Libertad healing device that pumps up anyone in its vicinity to double health. Enemies might seem nigh invulnerable while standing in its range, but you can shoot the device <em>itself </em>to destroy it and make them mortal again. In that way, ultras are generally strong without being ridiculous and require you to be smart about how and when to use them.</p><p>Still, it's important to add a caveat: while each faction <em>mostly</em> feels pretty distinct, balanced, and fun, some definitely seem to stand ahead of others, and a few come off as completely useless (unless the community just hasn’t figured out how to use them yet). The biggest offender on this front is DedSec from Watch Dogs, whose gameplay style leans toward hacking enemy abilities. Their deployable spider drones automatically chase down the other team and shock or totally blind them, leaving them fully vulnerable – pretty cool. Their other ability, however, allows you to hijack the other team's deployables, and I’ve yet to see a single person use it effectively. There just aren't that many things to steal or many opportunities to do so, and every time I tried to sneak up to a shield or health station to try to hack it, I was killed – by the players who, of course, were currently using the thing I wanted to hijack. That’s especially egregious because you either need to pay $10 to unlock DedSec, or sink a whole lot of time into playing the other four factions to earn it for free.</p><p>On the flipside, other abilities feel overly strong. The Echelon faction, which is inspired by the stealthy gameplay of Splinter Cell, can either become nearly invisible or activate a pulsing sonar ability that lets your whole team see enemies through walls. Their ultra ability, Sonar Goggles, greatly increases the range of that legalized wallhack and gives you the 5.7 pistol, which fires slowly but takes enemies down in one or two hits. The only way to deal with the Sonar Goggles, as far as I can tell, is just to kill whoever's using it. Where the other factions have abilities that are a lot more situational or team-oriented, there's basically no drawback here – it’s never not to your advantage to see through walls. The lack of effective balance at launch means some classes are more popular than others in matches, and that weakens the faction system overall.</p><p>Generally, though, the larger issue with abilities is that they don't really fit with XDefiant's “the quick and the dead” approach to gunfights. Since shootouts are often over almost as soon as they begin, a lot of abilities are just a non-factor in most situations. Firing off a heal or launching an explosive drone delays you from shooting back, which means you'll almost definitely die when all it takes to drop you is a couple of hits. That means you must have a Jedi-like sense of what <em>will </em>happen to make real use of them, like leaving a healing device or a shield where you think a fight is about to break out or launching an explosive drone toward where you anticipate someone to be. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Abilities don't really fit its “the quick and the dead” approach to gunfights.</p></div><p>Why equip the moltov of The Division's Cleaners faction, which you'll only be able to use if you get within a few feet of an opponent, when you could choose the Phantom's deployable shield and have several seconds of free shots at any distance? What good is the ability to hack a healing device from up close if sniping it from a distance is much more effective at neutralizing it without dying?</p><p>Balancing is an issue with some weapons at the moment, as well. The longer I played XDefiant, the more people started appearing in lobbies wielding sniper rifles, and it quickly became clear why: Sniping very often gets you a one-hit kill regardless of where the shot hits your target. Even at close ranges, if you can draw a bead on someone and snap off a shot, you'll likely drop them before they have a chance to double-tap you. Skilled players picked up on this very quickly, and if you jump in today you'll probably find yourself getting taken out instantly, regardless of how far away the enemy is. It quickly made me feel like a chump for opting for a different gun. So I guess I’m a sniper now.</p><p>It’s only partly because of the sniper advantage that shotguns and light machine guns feel a bit useless at the moment. Both have significant drawbacks; shotguns have very short range and slow firing rate, while LMGs seem to be tuned more to destroy enemy devices like shields and appear to do less damage to actual enemies. Both weapon types seem to punish you for choosing them over assault rifles or submachine guns, which have fewer drawbacks.</p><p>None of that is a dealbreaker, though, because XDefiant doesn’t care if your kill:death ratio is negative, so long as you’re helping your team get closer to the match objective. You don’t have to be among the fastest guns on the internet to grab a riot shield and focus on surviving long enough to push a payload from one end of a map to the other, or play support or defense on capture points by helping to keep your more lethal teammates alive. All of that is good fun, but it could certainly use a few more game modes with more imaginative and interesting approaches to shaking up gameplay in order to prevent us from falling into a routine for a bit longer.</p><p>XDefiant has only five modes at the moment, all of which are fairly standard fare for this kind of shooter. Those modes all support six-on-six unranked play – XDefiant will also have a four-on-four ranked mode, which will use skill-based matchmaking, but it's only available as a preview right now. Zone Control, Domination, and Occupy are variations on capture-point modes, with Occupy taking place on a linear map while the other two are played in XDefiant's big, dense arenas. That cuts down on variety, and a lot of the matches you'll play during any given session start to feel repetitive pretty quickly. Whether you’re capturing one control point that moves around the map, three simultaneously, or several in a specific order, it doesn’t change the gameplay enough to really differentiate those modes from each other.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The modes don't excite, but the maps themselves are largely standouts.</p></div><p>Meanwhile, Hotshot is a version of Call of Duty's Kill Confirmed in which you only score if you pick up a dropped item after a kill, but there’s an added VIP twist: The person with the most items becomes speedier and scores more points for every item they pick up, so you want to protect your own team’s Hotshot and hunt down opposing ones. Escort, on the other hand, is a straight-up payload mission on a linear map, with no meaningful differences from the mode that's been in Overwatch for years (and in Team Fortress 2 before that), so it’s not terribly novel or innovative. Neither of these options do much to play to XDefiant's particular strengths or help differentiate it from other games.</p><p>The maps themselves, on the other hand, are largely standouts. Ten are arenas and four are linear, and they all borrow liberally from the same games from which XDefiant pulls its factions to make for visually interesting and varied spaces. For the most part they're highly open, with multiple pathways in and out of any given place. That means you're as likely to get shot in the back as you are to get the drop on someone, but it's nice that they encourage fast movement and a minimal amount of camping, and facilitate a lot of different types of engagements with just about every step. That helps make all of the factions and weapons feel viable (except maybe DedSec), at least from a playstyle perspective; running around with a shotgun is just as fun as hanging back with a sniper rifle, even if the power of the guns themselves are a little uneven. The open design also keeps things fair, as there are no locations where someone can hide and dominate alone with a sniper rifle or where a team can hunker down to make themselves nearly invulnerable.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Phil Hornshaw's Favorite Class-Based Shooters</h3><p>Teamwork makes the dream work.</p></div><p>There's also a fairly expansive (if basically standard at this point) progression system that unlocks weapons, weapon attachments like scopes, and various faction characters as you play. Additional pieces for are unlocked for a weapon just by using it, so you can start to kit out guns to your liking after a few rounds with them. Additional guns and characters require completing challenges by using the weapons you have in specific ways, like earning point-blank SMG kills or notching a certain number of one-shot snipes. The challenges help encourage you to vary your playstyle, and none of them are arduous to unlock – they perfectly balance pushing you to experiment with different loadouts and gear, while quickly rewarding you with new weapons for your trouble.</p><p>The same can't be said of the grind to unlock the DedSec faction, however. Four factions are available when you start in XDefiant, but the fifth requires earning some 700,000 experience points from completing objectives, scoring kills, finishing and winning matches, and completing daily challenges. To put that in perspective, a kill gets you 100 XP, a finished match earns 2,000 – and another 2,000 if you win – while the four challenges available each day range from 5,000 to 10,000 XP. That makes it a fairly intense grind to do for free, but of course you can unlock DedSec instantly if you're willing to fork over $10. But again, given how weak that faction seems to be with the current balance, neither the grind nor the cost seems especially worth it.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>XDefiant joins the free-to-play shooter crowd as a respectable competitive FPS built around various Ubisoft franchises, but little makes it really stand out. Its shooting mechanics generally feel great, and even dying doesn’t kill the momentum since you're dropped right back into the action within a few seconds. Some of its issues, like weapon balance, are relatively minor elements that we can expect Ubisoft to adjust over time. Tougher to solve, however, is the clash between its main ideas: fast time-to-kill makes a lot of its class abilities feel difficult to make the most of because you’re usually dead before you can use them. It’s also lacking a defining mode, leaning on samey point-capture ideas and tried-and-true but tired concepts like Payload and Kill Confirmed. On the other hand, excellent maps keep things interesting longer than they otherwise would be, so hopefully it’ll have the time it needs to carve out its own niche.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You're a cute cat piloting a cozy armored mech in this game, a metroidvania with stylish monochromatic visuals. As you trek through an alien underworld full of irritable creatures and treacherous obstacles, you'll get closer to rescuing your stranded captain and salvaging his crashed spaceship. You'll need to blast and dash through dangerous terrain, as well as venture outside the mech and risk all nine lives to access areas and uncover cool secrets.</p><p>Gunbrella will see you engage in side-scrolling action as you use the lethal rain-deflecting tool to glide, swing, dash, and shoot your way through people who are out for your head. A gritty noir-punk action-adventure game with heaps of fun platforming, you'll also interrogate bizarre characters on your quest for answers in this thrilling game.</p><p>Finally, Demon Throttle tells the story of a beautiful vampiress and dusty gunslinger on a quest for vengeance. A demon has been up to no good and has wronged both of the unlikely partners, and revenge calls for a violent assault on that fiend's domain. Interestingly, Demon Throttle was <em>only </em>available as a physical Switch game, so this is a fresh chance to play Demon Throttle and experience its arcade action in case you missed its limited release the first time around.</p></div>                      </div><p>For more game deals, you can grab a preorder for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-preorder-guide-nintendo-switch/1100-6523267/">Nintendo World Championships Deluxe Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-up-to-50-on-popular-ps5-xbox-and-switch-games-at-best-buy-this-week/1100-6523612/">save up to 50% on physical PS5, Xbox, or Switch games</a> at Best Buy, and secure a hard-to-find <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-preorder-guide-collectors-edition/1100-6522856/">Metaphor: ReFantazio's Collector's Edition</a> preorder now that it's back in stock--at least for now.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mad-max-5-film-limited-edition-4k-collection-and-furiosa-steelbook-up-for-preorder/1100-6523703/">Mad Max 5-Film Limited Edition 4K Collection And Furiosa Steelbook Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cuphead-delicious-last-course-art-book-has-never-before-seen-content-limited-edition-up-for-preorder/1100-6523733/">Cuphead Delicious Last Course Art Book Has Never-Before-Seen Content, Limited Edition Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-series-x/1100-6523506/">Walmart Has An Exclusive Edition For EA Sports College Football 25</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-nintendo-switch-preorder-guide/1100-6521751/">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Preorders - Release-Day Delivery Still Available</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-over-60-on-12-months-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-with-targets-limited-time-deal/1100-6523230/">Save Over $60 On 12 Months Of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate With Target's Limited-Time Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-preorder-guide-nintendo-switch/1100-6523267/">Nintendo World Championships Deluxe Set Preorders Are Only Available At Select Retailers</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-restock-guide/1100-6520876/">PlayStation Portal Is Back In Stock At Multiple Major Retailers</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <p>
Skull and Bones - Ubisoft's extraordinarily long in the works (and not particularly good) open-world pirate adventure - is getting a free week-long trial next week, and it'll coincide with the launch of the live-service game's second season of post-launch content.
</p>
<p>
When Skull and Bones released in February - some 11 years after its troubled development started - Ubisoft trumpeted "record player engagement", but did not share sales figures. It's unclear just how well the pirate game has done for the publisher, then, but Ubisoft evidently believes it needs a bit of a boost given its <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/skull-and-bones/free-weekend">impending week-long trial</a>.
</p>
<p>
That'll take place across all platforms - Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5 and PC (via Epic and Ubisoft Connect) - from Thursday, 30th May until Thursday, 6th June. During that time, players can sail as much as they like with access to the whole thing, and progress will be carried over should they decide to purchase the full game. And to tempt those wallets out, Ubisoft is slashing the price of Skull and Bones by 50 percent across all platforms for a "limited time".

<p>
Skull and Bones' free week-long trial coincides with the game's second season of post-launch content, which launches on 28th May. Ubisoft hasn't said much about what it'll bring, but there's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8mjbgIwj-c">story trailer to watch</a> and a bit of teasing blurb. "The Hubac Twins have been dispatched by the Compagnie Royale to seize control of the Indian Ocean and eliminate the pirate scourge," it writes. "Demonstrating dangerous abilities through song, they blaze across the high seas, hunting pirates in a violent duet and laying claim to the region's riches."
</p>
<p>
And is it worth your time? I wasn't especially convinced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-review">in my two star review</a> earlier this year. "There are moments when Skull and Bones weaves a convincing spell," I wrote. "Cannon balls flying in ship-to-ship combat, impromptu engagements with other players, the brief dopamine rush when a resource slog culminates in a shiny new toy, or even when the light hits just right on another glorious view. But it's soon swept away on a tide of uninspiring fetch quests and tedious traversal that just can't sustain its live-service grind. Skull and Bones is okay, fine even, on rare occasions maybe even great - but, ultimately, it comes down to this: no game, let alone a swashbuckling pirate adventure, should be so consistently dull."

<p>When DOOM: The Dark Ages launches, it won’t be an Xbox Series X|S console exclusive. According to one insider, DOOM: The Dark Ages will be available on PlayStation 5 (PS5) as well.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1794109253856161986" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nate the Hate said that the game </a>will be multiplatform. While specifically mentions PS5 as another platform for the game, he doesn’t mention last-gen Xbox One or PlayStation 4.  </p>



<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to be revealed</a> at the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9. The game has been in development for four years and will be set in a “medieval-inspired” world. Prior to getting an official name, the game was known as “Year Zero”.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-avowed-and-indiana-jones-previews-are-coming-after-xbox-games-showcase">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-avowed/">Avowed and Indiana Jones Previews Are Coming After Xbox Games Showcase</a></h6>



<p>As of publishing, it’s unclear when the game will be released. Releasing the game on PS5, however, falls in line with Microsoft’s plan to bring its first-party games to other platforms. The company aims to bring “Xbox to every screen”, including its games.</p>

                <p>On May 24, 2022, Salvador Ramos entered his former school, Robb Elementary, in Uvalde, Texas, and murdered 19 children and two teachers, while injuring 17 others. Now, on the two-year anniversary of the school shooting, the families of the Uvlade victims have filed multiple lawsuits, including one in California that's targeting Call of Duty publisher Activision and Facebook and Instagram's parent company, Meta, for their alleged role in putting the gun in the killer's hands.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/05/24/uvalde-lawsuits-daniel-defense-meta-activision/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post</a>, the lawsuits were filed by attorney Josh Koskoff, who contends that Activision and Meta share responsibility for "grooming... socially vulnerable" young men with violent video game fantasies. The complaint also states that both companies "knowingly exposed the Shooter to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as the solution to his problems, and trained him to use it."</p><p>"Over the last 15 years, two of America’s largest technology companies--Defendants Activision and Meta--have partnered with the firearms industry in a scheme that makes the Joe Camel campaign look laughably harmless, even quaint," continues the complaint. "To put a finer point on it: Defendants are chewing up alienated teenage boys and spitting out mass shooters."</p><p>As spelled out in the lawsuit, the families allege that Ramos downloaded a copy of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare that features the same DDM4V7 model rifle that he later purchased and used for the school shooting. Additionally, it accuses Meta of sending Ramos targeted ads for the same gun on Instagram from the manufacturer, Daniel Defense.</p><p>Meta doesn't allow gun manufacturers to purchase direct advertisements for weapons or explosives. But the lawsuit suggests that Daniel Defense got around that restriction by posting promotional material about the weapons on the company's Facebook and Instagram accounts. A separate lawsuit was also filed by the families against Daniel Defense.</p><p>GameSpot has reached out to Activision for comment.</p>

 <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="245" data-injectable="false">The Ademola Lookman RTTF SBC costs around 120,000 coins, but you can always save resources by sourcing fodder from your Ultimate Team inventory.

The Technical+ and First Touch+ should make this card feel amazing when you try to dribble. For its price, you can’t really go wrong by completing this SBC in <em>EA FC 24</em> Ultimate Team. As an alternative, the Renato Sanches Flashback SBC offers a solid midfield card and dominates in the middle of the pitch. </p>

In addition to Apple’s own version of Tetris, the engineering sample iPod also came loaded with other unreleased titles, including games called <em>Block0</em> and <em>Klondike, a</em>s noted by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-built-a-tetris-clone-for-the-ipod-but-never-released-it-173810144.html?src=rss"><em>Engadget</em></a>. </p><p>On the back of the prototype iPod, a “DVT” (Design Validation Testing) label is etched where the storage capacity normally goes, which, Apple Demo explains indicates it was from the middle stage of development. Two songs still in its storage and a helpfully-named playlist suggest this device was used for battery testing.</p><p>After some tinkering and transplanting the internal hard disk into a second-generation iPod Apple Demo got the hard disk to boot as normal, and out of the games available, they only demoed Stacker.</p><p>They even contacted the ex-SVP of Apple’s iPod division, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23053632/tony-fadell-build-decoder-apple-iphone-google-alphabet-steve-jobs">Tony Fadell</a>, to learn why the Tetris clone was never released. However, Fadell’s only comment, from 2022, says, “because we added games with later software release,” leaving the internal story of Stacker a mystery for now. Apple did release a licensed Tetris game years later on the “Classic” iPod models, which supported new game titles <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/27/3417870/apple-ipod-click-wheel-games-history">purchased from the iTunes Store</a>.</p><p>Stacker uses the iPod’s click wheel to move falling blocks left and right, and the center button drops them to the bottom of the screen. The objective, like Tetris, is to shoot for a high score by completing and clearing lines of bricks and not overstacking pieces off the top. The game isn’t entirely polished — there’s at least one bug shown in the video where a brick overlapped a stack and got stuck when rotated. But it works!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p id="MrTp79"><strong>Genre: </strong>Epic sci-fi<br><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 46m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Denis Villeneuve<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson</p>
<p id="t132SU">The follow-up to the 2021 sci-fi epic doesn’t disappoint. In fact, it surpasses all expectations and even makes the first Dune movie better. </p>
<p id="enGoPW">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24078649/dune-2-review-release-date-cast-zendaya-denis-villeneuve-part-two">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="2rpMnh">For those who loved it, the promise of <em>Part Two</em> was that the conclusion of Paul’s journey would be even more exciting, beautiful, and poignant. For those who were bored during <em>Part One</em>, the promise was that all the slow, exposition-heavy pacing was in service of streamlining this next installment. <em>Dune: Part Two</em> is exactly the movie <em>Part One</em> promised it could be, the rare sequel that not only outdoes its predecessor, but improves it in retrospect. </p></blockquote>

<p id="F8tcaG"><strong>Genre: </strong>Action comedy<br><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 6m<br><strong>Director: </strong>David Leitch<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Ryan Gosling, Emily Blunt, Aaron Taylor-Johnson</p>
<p id="ARjsIF">This Ryan Gosling/Emily Blunt action-comedy-romance, a big blockbuster adventure movie built around huge feels and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24134146/fall-guy-stunt-team-action-interview">even bigger practical stunts</a>, did so poorly in its opening weekend at the box office that it spawned a wave of panicked “Are theatrical blockbusters dead?!?” thinkpieces. (Spoiler: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24153946/mid-budget-movies-hollywood-blockbusters-cinemacon">Maybe? If so, that’s fine.</a>) Now it’s hitting VOD just three weeks after its theatrical debut. </p>
<p id="SG0fzD">But don’t let the hand-wringing worry about its flop status put you off from watching it at home. It’s a pretty charming movie, much in the spirit of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22995169/the-lost-city-review-channing-tatum-sandra-bullock"><em>The Lost City</em></a>, with big stars bantering, flirting, and fighting in between ’splosions and some really fun fight scenes. <em>—Tasha Robinson</em></p>

<p id="3tdb2q"><strong>Genre: </strong>Dystopian thriller<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 49m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Alex Garland<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Kirsten Dunst, Wagner Moura, Cailee Spaeny </p>
<p id="GvFNsg">Alex Garland’s thriller stays away from present-day political themes to instead focus on war correspondents and journalism. </p>
<p id="F33yDe">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24099490/civil-war-review-2024-alex-garland">review</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p id="9OHHHz">The entire film is paced and planned with that dynamic involved. It’s a particularly gorgeous drama, shot with a loving warmth that reflects its point of view, through the eyes of two photographers used to conceiving of everything around them in terms of vivid, compelling images. A late-film sequence shot as the group drives through a forest fire is especially beautiful, but the movie in general seems designed to impress viewers on a visual level. </p></blockquote>

                <p dir="ltr">Businesses love running Memorial Day Weekend sales, and at Best Buy, that means a big sale on laptops, among other tech gear. Headlining the best laptop deals at the retailers is a <a href="https://shop-links.co/1843158747471150758?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lenovo Ideapad i1</a>, which usually retails for $500 but is on sale for $280.</p><p dir="ltr">The Ideapad is a budget laptop that's a solid option for lower-intensity school and work requirements--things like browsing the internet and doing research, and writing documents and emails. This model weighs 3.5 pounds and is only 0.7 inches thick, making it really easy to use on the go, and Lenovo claims it'll get 10 hours of battery life.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4308490-lenovoideapad.png" data-ref-id="1300-4308490" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4308490-lenovoideapad.png" data-ref-id="1300-4308490"></a><figcaption>Lenovo Ideapad i1</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4308490-lenovoideapad.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The i1 offers a 15.6" screen and 8GB of RAM, but with only 256GB of SSD storage, but is workable if you're using it for tasks that are on the simpler side. It also includes an Intel i3 processor and Intel Iris Xe Graphics, as well as an HDMI output port and media reader for photo transfer.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for more discounts, it's worth paging through <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1811325386063967692%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmemorial-day-laptop-deal-lenovo-ideapad-for-less-than-300%2F1100-6523723%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy's Memorial Day sale</a>.

            <p>
Epic has announced it's bringing Fortnite back to iOS devices in the UK at some point "in the second half of 2025" - and launching its Epic Games Store on the platform at the same time - as the UK's Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act passes into law.
</p>
<p>
The new <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3453/publications">Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act</a> gives the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) - the regulatory body that made headlines when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-blocks-microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal">initially blocked</a> Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard - new powers to prevent tech giants from using their position to disadvantage competitors and consumers.
</p>
<p>
As per the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/digital-markets-competition-and-consumers-act-receives-royal-assent">government's announcement</a>, the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act could "give consumers the room to freely choose the services they use, or stop companies from withholding information consumers need to make good decisions." It also gives the CMA powers "to intervene and direct a firm to change its behaviour to boost competition – whether that is to benefit people using smartphones or businesses dependent on cloud services."

<p>
The act is somewhat reminiscent of the EU's Digital Markets Act, which, among other things, requires big tech companies to open their mobile platforms up to app stores owned and operated by other companies. The EU's act has been instrumental in enabling Epic to muscle its way back onto iOS after Apple revoked its Fortnite developer account in 2020, preventing the game from being distributed on its devices.
</p>
<p>
Following Apple's decision - a move it made after Epic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-boss-pledges-more-legal-action-as-supreme-court-dismisses-apple-lawsuit-appeals">deliberately circumvented</a> contractually mandated App Store payment mechanisms within its Fortnite iOS app, which would have allowed it to avoid Apple's 30 percent platform fees - both parties have been embroiled in legal tussles in the US which has so far <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-boss-pledges-more-legal-action-as-supreme-court-dismisses-apple-lawsuit-appeals">largely ruled in Apple's favour</a>. 
</p>
<p>
However, Epic has been quick to take advantage of the EU's Digital Markets Act, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-secures-ios-developer-account-europe-mobile-store-and-fortnite-launch-this-year">earlier this year announced</a> it would be launching an EU version of its Epic Games Store for iOS - and returning Fortnite to the platform - in 2024. And it's now announced similar plans for the UK following the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act's royal assent.
</p>
<p>
"Shoutout to the UK for passing a new competition law," the official Fortnite X account <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1794096002762244392">posted</a>. "Epic Games Store and Fortnite are coming to iOS in the UK in the second half of 2025".
</p>
<p>
Epic's announcement does, however, seem somewhat premature; with the act now law, the CMA must first determine which of the "most powerful global technology companies" are deemed to hold 'strategic market status', before it can decide which, if any, interventions will be placed on each of these firms - a decision the affected companies are able to appeal. The UK government has, however, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-markets-competition-and-consumers-bill-supporting-documentation/a-new-pro-competition-regime-for-digital-markets-policy-summary-briefing">previously suggested</a> Strategic Market Status firms might be required to "allow users to access alternative app stores", a stipulation Epic will doubtless be hoping is applied to Apple so its own iOS store plans can proceed.
</p>
<p>
Today's announcement is presumably more intended to preemptively whip Epic's young Fortnite audience into a frenzy should regulatory intervention flounder, but time will tell if it manages to hit its "second half of 2025" deadline in the UK.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-final-fantasy-helldivers-politics<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’ve spent enough of your precious life on this horrible old internet, you’ve probably seen lists of so-called “non-political” games floating around that include deeply political works like <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> and, more recently,<em> Helldivers 2</em>. Maybe people even approve of specific ideals in those games but despise them when they’re expressed in the real world. What’s happening there? Where are people’s brains short circuiting? On this week’s episode of Aftermath Hours, we discuss that.</p><p>This time around we’re joined by Janus Rose, who now holds the historic distinction of being Aftermath’s first-ever freelancer. This week we <a href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-vii-remake-rebirth-terrorism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published her piece</a> about what<em> Final Fantasy VII</em> had to say about resistance in the face of imperialism and how that does and does not map onto real-world conflicts, like Israel’s ongoing attacks on Gaza. We begin by discussing what inspired the piece before moving on to a wider discussion of colonialism, imperialism, and protest (and occasionally <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>).&nbsp;</p><p>Then we talk about IGN’s recent purchase of The Gamer Network and <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-gamer-network-eurogamer-gamesindustrybiz-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the layoffs that ensued</a>, concluding that journalism probably needs to operate at a more sustainable scale, but execs are only interested in making the line go up. Somehow, after all that, we also find time to praise <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> – which remains good – and share some of our favorite recipes (one of which comes from <em>Scott Pilgrim</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can finally make every game political, even <em>BioShock</em>.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>It is interesting to have the use of Mako energy [in <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>] be recontextualized to not just be powering weapons; it’s also the things that allow you to forget about the weapons that [the Shinra Corporation] is making.</p><p><strong>Janus:</strong> Many such cases! It’s really crazy to me how people play this game and they don’t see these parallels. For me, it’s very in your face.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> This was something you touched on a little bit in your piece, but I think all of us have engaged at various points in our lives – as kids and adults – with pieces of media that are very opposed to the powers that be, to the status quo, that identify systems of oppression. But it seems like a lot of that is lost on people, even as adults; it makes more sense when you’re a kid because a lot of stuff goes over your head.&nbsp;</p><p>But I mean, there’s that whole faction of gamers who’ll say, “Here are all of my favorite non-political games,” and one of them is <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>. And it’s like, you’ve identified some of the most political games! And yet somehow, you don’t see the direct parallels [to real-world events]. And so I wonder: Why are people so limited in their ability to perceive these things when they’re<em> right there</em>?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Janus: </strong>It’s a really interesting question, something I’ve thought a lot about. I don’t think I have a really good answer for it despite considering this for such a long time. But there’s something very intentional about consuming or framing these works as entertainment rather than as art. And I think that a lot of people have a hard time when presented with something that is meant to be art in the way that I would define it in this case, which is something that shows truth of the world.</p><p>There was a really great piece by Mimi Zhu who <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7CQq8wORl5/?igsh=MXRpdWk4dDdmdnpsMg%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote recently about</a>, like, what is your art if it’s not engaging with the issues of the time? What is your art if you’re claiming that it’s not political? Because the point of art is to tell the truth, and you’re lying. Which I thought was a really good way of putting it. They’re really brilliant. That was what was making me think about this topic more. Because of the way a lot of these things are structured as products, that makes people see it as – like what we were talking about before, to tie it all together – with the Gamergate people, they feel that this is a product that’s being made for them. They have these expectations.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>They want it to reaffirm their worldview, to congratulate them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah, to not challenge them. But that’s interesting to me unto itself. Because I think having something made for you can also mean having it be made specifically to challenge you. Because it’s still oriented around you and what your preconceived biases and notions are. It’s just approaching them in a different way. Rather than reaffirming them, it’s saying, “Let’s spin this a little differently. Let’s test out some ideas you maybe hadn’t considered before.” That strikes me as beneficial and good. I think people should want that, even if it’s uncomfortable. But the way we do things now in games and entertainment is this whole reaffirming approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Janus:</strong> Somebody in chat is mentioning media literacy. I think that’s a good point. We don’t have media literacy – especially in America.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> We dismantled all the systems that allowed people to understand works of art. There was this whole push for STEM students in college. Now there’s way too many programmers in the job market and not enough people who understand that depicting something is not the same as endorsing it.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>That part’s wild to me, when people are like “This villain in your story seems to have said and done bad things? So that means you agree with them, yes?” No! Of course not! It’s the literal villain in the story, man!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Janus:</strong> Yeah, media literacy is a real problem, and I think if I had to answer that question that you posed earlier, I think media literacy would be one of the answers for why people feel this way. But I also think that it’s about consumerism and specifically this idea I was touching on earlier about how people are paying money for a product. And I think that anytime you are doing that transactional relationship, you are expecting to get X, Y, Z from having spent your hard-earned money on a product, right? And there are a lot of times where that’s a perfectly reasonable assumption. If I buy toothpaste and it doesn’t clean my teeth, I’m gonna be upset.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But there is no utilitarian point of art. It exists to express ideas and to tell truth. I think maybe a lot of people get upset because from their point of view, they are paying money, and they have this relationship where it’s like “If it’s not giving me what I wanted out of this transaction, then it’s bad.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Today on Twitter I just wrote a little thread about criticism. I was reading some tweets that pissed me off, and I decided to obliquely refer to them by talking about the topic that was pissing me off. And it was about criticism and the function of criticism. People assume that criticism is about recommending things for you to buy, and that’s not why I write criticism. I write criticism because I observe art and I look at the world and I have ideas. I synthesize something new out of these other things, and that to me – the writing itself – is the point.</p><p>This really ties everything that we were talking about this episode together: We’re no longer in a society that encourages and provides space for people to be able to look at and interpret the world around them in an effort to help other people understand the world too. It’s interesting in the world of video games because in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050407021224/http://www.alwaysblack.com/blackbox/ngj.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kieron Gillen’s New Games Journalism [manifesto]</a> way back in the day, before I started writing about games, he said something like the UK model of games journalism was modeled after music criticism, which is about expression and trying to understand artistic expression. Engaging with the ideas. And then the American version of video game journalism was more like car journalism. And having worked with people at Jalopnik, there are interesting ways to do car journalism. But it is more material. It’s about facts and figures and numbers and things that can be assessed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You still see – in Rock Paper Shotgun, especially, a site Kieron Gillen founded – that attempt toward a music journalism-esque version of games journalism. But more often than not, the car journalism version wins out. That’s just where we are.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Janus: </strong>Another thing to mention here is, the way in which games are produced – a lot of these larger games – they are putting all this money into this thing to produce essentially a product. It is a cultural product, but it’s still a product. And so the other side to this is that it <em>is </em>meant to be consumed as a product. Then people have that expectation that it has to fulfill a certain je ne sais quoi for them. Otherwise, it’s not worth your money or time. We all have limited time and money on this earth. That is a fact.&nbsp;</p><p>But that was interesting what you said about the UK model. It’s so different because they engage with art and music in a fundamentally different way. With American media, it’s always so consumer based. But I think that the best criticism is the kind that doesn’t assign specific numeric values to things. I don’t really read video game reviews anymore unless they don’t use a score system. I’m not interested in the numeric value of “Will I enjoy this game or not?” Because honestly, I’ve played a lot of games that have been very critically acclaimed, and I wound up being like “This is not for me.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Best games are 7/10s.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Janus:</strong> Right. And inversely, a lot of the games that are my favorites of all time are critically not liked.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Remember the critical reaction to <em>Deadly Premonition</em>, which is now considered a cult classic? It is a weird-as-fuck game, and it is broken. It is a totally broken game in a lot of ways. But it’s got something. It’s got the juice.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Janus:</strong> That is always the kind of art I like engaging with, no matter what it is: the kind that makes me feel something I wasn’t expecting to.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Yes. My line is always, show me something that I’ve never seen before. That can be something big or something small. But I want to see something I’ve never seen before anytime I go to a movie or a live concert or play a video game. Just something. You know, there’s the thesis and the antithesis. I need the synthesis. Please give it to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The much-anticipated remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> is here, and much like the Gamecube original, the game is bursting with puzzles, secrets, and some quirky mechanics that new players may find slightly perplexing. Don’t worry though, we’re here to cut The Thousand-Year Door’s more confusing aspects down to size.</p>
<p>In order to kick off Chapter 5 of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, you’ll need to find a way to recruit eventual party member Admiral Bobbery and sail to Keelhaul Key. This requires a few steps, but don’t worry, we have you covered…</p>
<p><em>Note: The following guide contains minor Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door SPOILERS.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd45.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>After finishing up Chapter 4, you’ll note there is now a large ship at the dock in Rogueport, but nobody’s on board. The ship is owned by Flavio – the pirate-y looking merchant guy who hangs out at the Rogueport bar downstairs from the inn. Go talk to Flavio and tell him he needs more thrills in his life.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd46.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Flavio will now get aboard his ship, but… they don’t have a navigator. He’ll ask you to go find a Admiral Bobbery to help steer the ship.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd47.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Bobbery’s house is the unmarked one in Rogueport’s east side, next to Professor Frankly’s place. But the door is locked. So, how do you get in? Use the Yoshi kid to get across this gap, then climb up the boxes onto the nearby rooftops.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd48.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Once on the roof of Bobbery’s place, roll into a tube so you can get into his chimney.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd49.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Ah ha! You’ve found Bobbery! But he's in a bad mood and refuses to return to sea for some reason and requests you leave.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd50.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Head back to the bar, and talk to the barkeep, Podley. He’ll tell you about Bobbery’s tragic backstory and give you a long-lost letter from his wife. Take this letter to Bobbery and he’ll agree to set sail.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd51.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Head back to the ship and off you go to Keelhaul Key! You’ll be separated from Bobbery again before you get there, but don’t worry, that’s all part of the story.</p>
<p>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is available now on Nintendo Switch. You can check out all of&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-guides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech’s Paper Mario The Thousand-Year Door guides here</a>.</p>

The DMCC helps regulate and expand digital competition on computers and phones. </p><p>The new law is similar to the European Union’s DMA, which in January gave Epic a path to bring <em>Fortnite </em>to iPhone owners in the EU. This newly passed DMCC bill is the UK’s equivalent of the DMA and was directly shouted out by Epic on Twitter.</p><p><em>Original story continues below</em></p><p>Over three years ago, in August 2020, Epic tried to add new ways for people to buy in-game items in <em>Fortnite’s </em>mobile ports. These new methods would be cheaper for users and would circumvent Google and Apple’s store cut that the tech giants usually collect on all in-app purchases on their respective devices. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store-1844717397&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store-1844717397">Within hours, both Google and Apple had yanked <em>Fortnite</em></a></span><em> </em>from their digital stores and Epic began <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/everything-thats-happening-in-the-apple-vs-epic-case-1846856678&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/everything-thats-happening-in-the-apple-vs-epic-case-1846856678">a legal fight with both companies</a></span> that is just now wrapping.

Apple will also have to allow sideloading, the ability for users to install their own apps directly onto their devices. These are both features of Android phones, but not the more locked-down iOS ecosystem. But thanks to the DMA, that’s changing in the EU and Epic wasted no time calling out Apple and announcing <em>Fortnite</em>’s<em> </em>return via its own third-party app, the Epic Games Store.<br></p><p>“Remember <em>Fortnite </em>on iOS?

Presumably, at Apple.</p><p>“Later this year <em>Fortnite </em>will return in Europe on iOS through the Epic Games Store. (Shoutout DMA - an important new law in the EU making this possible). @Apple, the world is watching,” Epic tweeted.<br></p><h2 id="h50177"><a id=""></a>Epic’s CEO isn’t happy about Apple’s new rules</h2><p>Of course, Apple allowing sideloading and third-party apps isn’t as simple as it sounds. The tech giant has implemented <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050200/apple-third-party-app-stores-allowed-iphone-ios-europe-digital-markets-act&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050200/apple-third-party-app-stores-allowed-iphone-ios-europe-digital-markets-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a ton of rules and various restrictions</a></span> that could be costly for independent devs and limit just how useful third-party storefronts can be. Epic’s CEO, Tim Sweeney, isn’t happy about the iPhone maker’s restrictions and new policies, calling them “hot garbage.”<br></p><p>“Apple proposes that it can choose which stores are allowed to compete with their App Store,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1750589570880516402&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1750589570880516402" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeney wrote in a lengthy tweet on January 25</a></span>. “They could block Epic from launching the Epic Games Store and distributing <em>Fortnite </em>through it, for example, or block Microsoft, Valve, Good Old Games, or new entrants.”<br></p><p>“There’s a lot more hot garbage in Apple’s announcement. It will take more time to parse both the written and unwritten parts of this new horror show, so stay tuned,” posted Sweeney.<br></p><p>For now, the plan seems to be—despite the terrible rules, according to Epic’s CEO—that the company will bring <em>Fortnite </em>and its store to iPhones in the EU, unless Apple tries to intervene. <br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Larian Studios, the team behind the critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, recently announced that those who purchased the game's physical deluxe edition for the PS5 in North America will now have to wait until July to receive the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The statement came from the studio's <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1794059975746105362?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" rel="nofollow ">official X/Twitter account</a>. The post reveals that the new delay is due to "production changes" outside the studio's control, and it "had to follow certain processes specifically set by production companies when manufacturing the PS5 discs." Because of the processes taken, the approval for certain regions has taken much longer.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1794059975746105362?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We have disappointing news to share with you.<br>While we were so hoping to not have to update owners of the console physical Deluxe Edition with any further news of delay, we’ve now run into more production issues which means that players who pre-ordered their PS5 North America…</p>  — Larian Studios (@larianstudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/larianstudios/status/1794059975746105362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Despite the delay, Larian Studios went on to say that it expects all PS5 physical deluxe editions for North America to be ready fairly soon:</p><p dir="ltr">"We expect all PS5 North America copies to be ready in around 14 days - followed by another 10 days to begin delivering these directly to players.

It adds that the title has been in development for at least four years and judging by early details from last year, it may feature a medieval theme.</p><p>id’s next mainline Doom game has been rumored for years, though it has been called a different name in the past. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document"><u>Leaked Microsoft court documents</u></a> from 2023 revealed something known as Doom: Year Zero. If Doom: The Dark Ages is real, it's likely the final name for that same project. While Bethesda has never officially confirmed that such a project exists, a recent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-heavily-rumored-for-xbox-june-showcase-amid-bethesda-trademark-and-other-hints"><u>“IDKFA” trademark filing</u></a> from ZeniMax Media had many fans hoping an announcement could be on the horizon.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/doom-eternal-1716579323349.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>DOOM MAY SOON TAKE PLAYERS TO THE DARK AGES. IMAGE COURTESY OF BETHESDA.</figcaption></figure></output><p>It’s been four years since id unleashed its modern Doom sequel, Doom Eternal, for PC and consoles in March 2020. It’s not been completely quiet in the time since, though, as the studio also released The Ancient Gods Part One and Part Two in late 2020 and early 2021, respectively. Without confirmation that Doom: The Dark Ages is real, it’s probably best to keep expectations low. Either way, we won’t have to wait much longer to see if the rumors hold any weight.</p><p>For more on Doom, you can read <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-eternal-final-review"><u>our review of Doom Eternal</u></a>. We loved the way the follow-up brought the FPS franchise into the future, awarding it a 9/10 at the time. We said, “Whether you're a new Doom fan or a veteran one, Doom Eternal is bound to delight &amp; entertain you. It's gloriously fun.”</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

The company added that they're in talks with the manufacturer "to understand whether it is possible to hire extra temporary staff to reduce assembly times."</p><p>The good news is, this delay only seems to affect those PS5 North American copies. In <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1794060178196738449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a follow-up post</a>, Larian said Xbox copies are now shipping, while PS5 EU and Oceania have left their warehouse and should, at the very least, be with the relevant courier.</p><p>Still, Larian was wildly apologetic in its statement today, bemoaning that they had no desire to share "any further news of delay," and adding that they wanted to capture that "nostalgic" feeling of unboxing your newest game in the latest physical release of their Game of the Year winner.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/06/30/shadowheart-1688125651772.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Those who ordered the Baldur's Gate 3 Deluxe Edition on PS5 in North America have a little longer to wait. (Image courtesy of Larian Studios)</figcaption></figure></output><p>"Knowing that there are some of you still waiting to play Baldur’s Gate 3, despite the fact we are unable to substitute physical goods with digital versions, we can only deeply apologise that your preorders have again been delayed," the studio said.</p><p>As Larian alludes to, this is only the latest delay news in regards to the Deluxe Edition on console in particular. At the beginning of May, <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1786064234884862439" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Larian announced</a> it had to delay the shipping date of North American PS5 orders and all Xbox orders due to production issues, although PC editions had shipped by then. At the time, the studio said they hoped to ship all Deluxe Edition orders by the end of May. </p><p>This is the second physical release of Baldur's Gate 3, with the Collector's Edition launching alongside the game's initial release last August. That edition, however, has long been sold out. Larian has assured fans that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-no-need-to-buy-the-baldurs-gate-3-physical-deluxe-edition-from-scalpers-larian-says">there will be plenty of stock to go</a> around when it comes to the Deluxe Edition, advising against turning to scalpers. </p><p>Those who've been waiting for the Deluxe Edition to play Baldur's Gate 3 have plenty to look forward to, at least, as it was easily one of the most-lauded games of 2023. In addition to a bevy of Game of the Year awards, Baldur's Gate 3 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">also got a 10/10 from IGN</a>, with Leana Hafer calling it "the new high-water mark for CRPGs."</p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

                <p>Earlier this week, Hellblade 2 launched to shockingly divided reviews. While critics unanimously praised the game for its visual and audible presentation, they were torn on how engaging its gameplay was. It's a topic we touched on in our own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review-hell-and-high-water/1900-6418229/" data-ref-id="1900-6418229">Hellblade 2 review</a>, in which Jessica Cogswell wrote the game is "ultimately undermined by its emphasis on fidelity over story and gameplay."</p><p>In this week's episode of Spot On, Tam and Lucy dig even deeper into the subject and discuss if graphical prowess can ever truly make up for subpar gameplay, as well if there were misconceptions about what exactly Ninja Theory's latest action-adventure game set out to do. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLWXzmCQto" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XvLWXzmCQto" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Spot On is GameSpot's weekly news show in which managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest game news. Given the massive video game industry's highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle, there's always something to talk about. Unlike most news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic instead of recapping all the news. Spot On airs each Friday.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Not much is known about this new entry, but according to the report, it will take place in a "medieval inspired Doom world" and could potentially serve as a prequel of sorts to 2016's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom/" data-ref-id="5000-285543">Doom</a> and 2020's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-eternal/" data-ref-id="5000-483372">Doom Eternal</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/kids-on-bikes-second-edition-now-available<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in October 2022, Hunters Entertainment launched a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/kids-on-bikes-second-edition-now-live-on-kickstarter">Kickstarter campaign</a> for <em>Kids on Bikes Second Edition</em>. This refinement of the popular urban fantasy TTRPG was a great success, raising <span>$182,049 on an initial funding goal of $20,000. Now, the newest edition is finally coming to retail.</span></p>

<h2><span>The K<em>ids on Bikes Second Edition</em> retail release</span></h2>

<p><span>According to an official press release, <em>Kids on Bikes Second Edition</em> is a TTRPG about everyday people grappling with strange and terrifying forces they can barely comprehend in their backyard. It draws heavy inspiration from similar works like Netflix's <em>Stranger Things</em> and various short stories by Stephen King.</span></p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kids-on-bikes-second-edition-tropes-screenshot.jpg?itok=XkCw3QVN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kids-on-bikes-second-edition-tropes-screenshot.jpg?itok=MDVG9UkT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ready to grab your flashlights again?</figcaption></figure><p><span>Everything you need to play a game of <em>Kids on Bikes Second Edition</em> is contained within this single softcover book. It is meant for 2-6 players ages 13 and up.</span></p>

<p>The latest edition of this urban fantasy TTRPG includes streamlined rules and mechanics. These include refined Powered Character rules, collaborative storytelling sections complete with bike-ride-themed tools, and player-scaleable states for violence.</p>

<p>For Game Masters, <em>Kids on Bikes Second Edition</em> includes an extensive section on creating their unique creatures. If you're a new GM, the book contains a sample module titled "Point Pleasant, New Jersey."</p>

<p>If you have run <em>Kids on Bikes</em> before, some of your older material will work in this new edition. For example, if you own <em>Strange Adventures Vol. 1</em> <em>and 2, </em>they are compatible with the new rules.</p>

<p><em>Kids on Bikes</em> was created by Doug Levandowski and Jonathan Gilmour. The game has been featured on actual plays like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-gauntlet-at-garden-rolls-dice-at-madison-square-garden">Dimension20's</a> <em>Misfits and Magic</em>&nbsp;and HyperRPG's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/zac-lim-eubank-and-yellowspoongirl-discuss-strange-world-of-kollok"><em>KOLLOK</em></a>. It has spawned several spin-offs, including the magic school-themed <em>Kids on Brooms</em>, the space fantasy of <em>Teens In Space</em>, and the recently announced <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/kids-in-capes" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Kids In Capes</em></a>.</p>

<p>Kids on Bikes Second Edition is available <a href="https://renegadegamestudios.com/kids-on-bikes-core-rulebook-second-edition/?_kx=0vMXQ_-Jo-jAcQc31HOmfUJDKpV16mYMPjcGq2WzfBs.WUk6qc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right now</a>. It is currently being sold at an MSRP of $39.99.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24164022/george-miller-hideo-kojima-mad-max-metal-gear<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="23cgJh">According to a much-circulated red-carpet comment, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24157385/furiosa-review-no-spoilers-george-miller-anya-taylor-joy"><em>Furiosa</em></a> director George Miller would love <a href="https://x.com/hideo_kojima_en/status/1788859151319507304?s=46">his number one fan</a> Hideo Kojima to make a Mad Max video game. “You know, I’m one of those people that I’d rather not do something unless you can do it at the highest level,” Miller, who <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24057164/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-state-of-play">has an acting role in Kojima’s forthcoming <em>Death Stranding 2</em></a>, told <a href="https://x.com/gamingbible/status/1792566156810756105">Gaming Bible</a>. “I’ve just been speaking to Kojima here [...] and he would take it on, but he’s got so much fantastic stuff in his own head that I wouldn’t ever ask him.” It’s a courteous professional compliment, from one auteur to another, that humbly assumes Kojima has better things to do.</p>
<p id="tULClF">My first thought was to agree. Whatever you think of Kojima and his games, he definitely has <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22688402/death-stranding-directors-cut-review-ps5-changes">a distinctive vision</a>, and his work carries a strong personal imprint. Making a movie adaptation seems like a waste of his talents, even for such a movie-obsessed creator. You wouldn’t expect George Miller to make a Metal Gear Solid movie, would you?</p>
<p id="2cYeDf">My second thought was: Damn, a George Miller Metal Gear Solid movie would be <em>awesome</em>.</p>
<p id="5Sd76W">My third thought was: Isn’t it a double standard, even a kind of snobbery, to consider Miller and Kojima above adapting each other’s work? Nobody would bat an eyelid at the prospect of a famous movie auteur (like, say, Paul Thomas Anderson) adapting a novel (like, say, Thomas Pynchon’s <em>Vineland</em>, which Anderson is <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/is-paul-thomas-andersons-mysterious-big-budget-new-leonardo-dicaprio-film-an-imax-thomas-pynchon-movie">rumored to be making</a> at the moment). An adaptation like that is seen as a conversation between two great artists, one bringing their own perspective to the other’s work. But we’ve been primed to think of movie-to-video-game crossovers (and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23669990/super-mario-bros-movie-review-references">the reverse</a>) as mere brand extensions — because they mostly are. (Including the not-bad-not-great <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/8/31/9190443/mad-max-review-ps4-playstion-4-xbox-one-pc-windows">2015 <em>Mad Max</em> game</a>, which Miller told Gaming Bible “wasn’t as good as [he] wanted it to be,” earning <a href="https://x.com/CHSundberg/status/1793611234249482268">an annoyed response</a> from one of the developers.)</p>

<p id="ScvXSe">In his comments about Kojima, Miller dared to dream of something better. So let’s go along with that platonic ideal of adaptation and assume it’s possible, if only because it should be. Is Kojima really the right fit for Mad Max? I’m not sure. Miller’s world is famously one of few words. (Anya Taylor-Joy says she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/movies/anya-taylor-joy-furiosa.html">went months on <em>Furiosa</em>’s set without speaking</a>.) </p>
<p id="xBazVN">Kojima’s worlds… are not that. The Mad Max aesthetic is anarchic, rude, unapologetically metal. The Kojima aesthetic is techno-organic, militarized, sinister but tasteful. Kojima’s gameplay is painstaking and obsessed with detail; Miller’s action filmmaking is about big gestures on an empty canvas of desert. I think Kojima would smooth Mad Max out, flatten its pop iconography with too much world-building.</p>
<p id="LY5X4X">The other way around, though — imagine a Metal Gear movie with the dialogue stripped to the bone, the nuclear dread implied rather than spelled out in philosophizing monologues, the imagery punched up even further. Consider what it would look like if Miller’s talent for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24161947/mad-max-fury-road-doof-warrior-origins-furiosa-george-miller">flamboyant introductions to outlandish characters</a> was applied to the great Metal Gear antagonists, like Psycho Mantis. Think of the crazed intensity he would get his actors to bring to Kojima’s operatic spy narrative. Realize that Miller would insist the prop department build an <em>actual working Metal Gear mech</em>.</p>
<p id="9Z5CWo">It could never work, of course. Apart from anything else, Miller would have to work with Konami rather than Kojima Productions on the project, and Konami, which has <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/1/17067982/metal-gear-survive-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc">not shown a good grasp</a> of Metal Gear’s appeal since an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/12/16/10220356/hideo-kojima-konami-explainer-metal-gear-solid-silent-hills">acrimonious split with Kojima</a>, might not get it. I’m sure there are many reasons development of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/4/22153421/metal-gear-solid-movie-solid-snake-actor-oscar-isaac-jordan-vogt-roberts">the actual Metal Gear Solid movie</a> has stalled, but I bet Konami is one of them.</p>
<p id="CnhA8e">So no, I’m not seriously suggesting George Miller, who will be 80 years old next year, should spend his time making a Metal Gear Solid film. He, too, has got too much fantastic stuff in his own head. But just imagine. It would rule. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24163194/dont-starve-board-game-preview-kickstarter-release-date-price<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="vnaZ8n"><a href="https://glasscannonunplugged.com/">Glass Cannon Unplugged</a>, a publisher known for board game adaptations of video games such as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/25/17281672/frostpunk-steam-pc-impressions"><em>Frostpunk</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22913452/dying-light-2-review-techland"><em>Dying Light</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24062132/apex-legends-season-20-breakout-respawn"><em>Apex Legends</em></a>, has ambitious plans for its next crowdfunding project. This time the Polish studio is tackling <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2013/5/29/4362838/the-birth-and-re-birth-of-klei">Klei Entertainment</a>’s breakout hit from the 2010s with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glasscannonunplugged/dont-starve-the-board-game/"><em>Don’t Starve: The Board Game</em></a>. But what does a roguelike survival game even look like on the tabletop? Polygon recently spoke with both teams of creatives about defining the board game’s relationship to the original and exploring the mechanics that will help bring this physical object to life.</p>
<p id="mCL6BH"><em>Don’t Starve </em>is a multi-platform, third-person video game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/6/26/4439118/dont-starve-review-eat-to-live">first published in 2013</a>. In it, players take on the role of a wild-haired scientist named Wilson who gets trapped in a dim, parallel dimension known as the Constant. They explore bizarre landscapes; craft weapons, tools, and structures; and make food in hopes of keeping Wilson alive and his sanity intact. Drawing from disparate influences such as<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23681749/minecraft-legends-review-action-strategy-army-overworld-piglins"><em>Minecraft</em></a> and Tim Burton films, the game has a steep learning curve spiced with permanent character death. But it developed a rabid following nonetheless, thanks in part to a rich narrative layer. </p>
<p id="Y7LQt8"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24112612/dont-starve-the-board-game-announcement-price-release-kickstarter"><em>Don’t Starve: The Board Game</em></a> is a highly modular design with many interlocking systems. The most basic is the map itself, which — like much of the game assets — will feature original art created by Klei. Players will explore that map hunting for resources, and eventually attempt to flee from it in the game’s final rounds. The current build uses rectangular playing cards to represent different biomes, which are then laid out onto a hexagonal grid to create the map. The result is a landmass with unique paths and chokepoints — the perfect environment for a tense exploration game.</p>
<p id="Q6PKJT">Players control their characters from a sideboard, which tracks their health, hunger, and sanity. They also have an inventory, which includes items worn on the body, items held in the hands, and items stuffed inside a small backpack. As in the video game, much of the gameplay revolves around scavenging biomes and fighting monsters, all in the hope of collecting the resources needed to complete ever more complex tasks and recipes.</p>
<p id="VqnZio">“The thing we wanted to focus on in <em>Don’t Starve: The Board Game</em> was actually the feeling of exploration,” explained lead designer Rafał Pieczyński. “Going into the unknown, exploring the areas, having fun with your friends as well, but sharing a little bit of knowledge, a little bit of discovery [between] the playthroughs. With every single game you learn something new, you go further into the story, or [discover] the things that might happen.”</p>

<p id="2m3QX2">One of Pieczyński’s innovations on this project is in combining both a linear campaign and a series of one-off scenarios. It’s not a legacy-style game, and nothing in the box is permanently altered or destroyed. But there can be carry-over from game to game.</p>
<p id="MVuJOf">“You will be able to play [it] as a campaign game, or as a scenario-based game, or both at the same time,” Pieczyński said. “It’s quite [a] unique construct in that way. And the progression from the campaign will be saved [between] playthroughs [allowing players to] affect the world permanently.”</p>
<p id="asg3dX">According to Glass Cannon CEO Jakub Wiśniewski, the tabletop adaptation began — as most board games do — as an unthemed prototype. The system was built by a young designer named Natanel Apfel, who’s now a visual effects artist at Riot Games. Apfel’s core design, as well as the revisions carried out by the current lead designer Pieczyński, who took over the project, eventually won out.</p>
<p id="FDyd6h">“Nate is an avid board game player,” Wiśniewski said. “He showed us a prototype, and we were like, ‘Holy smoke, this is really good survival! Maybe we should think about something like this!’” Before long, the team reached out to 11 bit studios, who they’d worked with previously on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/8/14/16146006/this-war-of-mine-the-board-game-review"><em>This War of Mine: The Board Game</em></a>. That studio, headquartered in Poland just like Glass Cannon is, played the good neighbor and was able to broker an introduction to Klei’s team in Canada.</p>
<p id="yXDkLl">“When we spoke,” Wiśniewski said, “[Klei] had already rejected a lot of prototypes, both internally and externally.” </p>
<p id="4zBYBi">“There was clearly a lot of love and care put into how the game both looked and played even in the early prototypes,” said Corey Rollins, head of marketing at Klei. “They also explained to us their process for designing a tabletop game and it was very similar to how Klei has been using Early Access as a core part of our DNA. [...] It seemed like a more natural fit to work with Glass Cannon.”</p>
<p id="HQfHx8">In a campaign, players can carry over the resources, recipes, and even some of the things that they’ve constructed from game to game. Just as in the video game, crafting options will unlock and expand over time to provide new short-term goals as well as enabling the larger narrative to unfold. But players must always pay close attention to those three core stats of health, hunger, and sanity (they may not start each game quite as healthy or sane as they might like to be).</p>

<p id="AektLi">Like any good survival game, hunger may be the most important stat of all. With a full stomach, players will receive more Focus Tokens, which allow you to re-roll dice. Focus Tokens can turn the tide in the game’s dice-based combat.</p>
<p id="6eeGER">All of this means that, like many other Glass Cannon projects, <em>Don’t Starve: The Board Game</em> is a fairly literal interpretation of the moment-to-moment action found in the video game. That design ethos has been both a boon and a burden for this team in the past. For instance, in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/8/14/16146006/this-war-of-mine-the-board-game-review">Polygon’s review of <em>This War of Mine: The Board Game</em></a>, a title co-designed by Glass Canon’s CEO Wiśniewski, we noted that it was a pretty tough sell for those who hadn’t already played the original — or for those who already owned the original and could play that instead. The same can be said of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/25/17281672/frostpunk-steam-pc-impressions"><em>Frostpunk: The Board Game</em></a>, although that title seems to have fared much better with consumers.</p>
<p id="nAM0nP">Wiśniewski says that this time around his team is designing <em>Don’t Starve: The Board Game</em> with board gamers, not video game players, more firmly in mind.</p>
<p id="g9Ev9P">“<em>Don’t Starve</em> is such an incredible work of art, because the game overlaps on so many levels,” Wiśniewski said. “Not only the art, the music, but also the design, the story, how it’s hidden, how they go about each peculiar detail. Getting rid of some aspects would [...] not do it enough justice. So we’d rather have extra work on our side thinking how to serve it on a more digestible platter than cut things and lose them as we go.”</p>
<p id="EmizCX">“The fun thing for me is that a lot of people that have seen the game, they feel like it’s a literal adaptation of the game, but it’s amazing that with all the streamlined rules that the game itself isn’t really that hard to play,” Pieczyński said.</p>
<p id="U6obUQ"><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glasscannonunplugged/dont-starve-the-board-game/"><em>Don’t Starve: The Board Game</em></a> will come to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157232/kickstarter-wonders-of-the-first-forsaken-controversy">Kickstarter</a> for its initial round of funding this fall, with the current goal to ship the game by the fourth quarter of 2025. The team also tells Polygon that at least seven languages will be available at launch, including English, German, French, Polish, Spanish, Italian, and Czech. Pricing has not yet been determined. </p>
