		<p>Reigns of Ruin: Runegate answers the question “What if it was Stargate, but it’s dwarves, and fighting against goblins instead of humans with worms living in their tummies?” This game tasks you with stepping through the titular portal in an effort to re-establish a sanctuary for dwarven civilisation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Regions of Ruin: Runegate Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r7q3I3rdwAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What that looks like is a side-scrolling hack and slash RPG where you travel to micro levels, battle baddies and gradually build up your home base to further your adventuring options.</p>


<p>It starts, though, with fleeing from the goblins that threaten the last vestiges of the stronghold that you canonically built in the original Regions of Ruin. At the last possible moment, you run through the portal opened in the Runegate and arrive at what will be your new home, an abandoned, crumbling underground city that will be your task to restore and repopulate.</p>
<p>And so it’s time to step through the Runegate time and again, venturing to other planes to gather resources, convince other dwarves to join your cause, and battling the forces of evil that you might encounter along the way.</p>

<p>Though certainly still in keeping with the original game, there’s a good step forward for the visual style of Runegate. It’s still got a low-resolution pixel art style, there’s still this flattened parallax tone, but there’s also just a lot more finesse to the character designs, the scenery you’re running through, everything. It’s much more in keeping with better examples of this art style, such as its Raw Fury stablemate <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/07/kingdom-two-crowns-review/">Kingdom Two Crowns</a>.</p>

<p>Exploring each realm has a pleasing feel to it, as you’re presented with a world map that you need to fill in. From the revealed land around the Runegate, you can reveal another path of land and reveal points of interest to visit, so long as you have enough food supplies to meet the one-time cost that it takes to get there. You could immediately travel to the farthest flung reaches of the map, if you had enough food, but really the game’s intention is that you’ll start local and branch out from there, following narrative and mission threads as you go.</p>
<p>Happening on a dwarven settlement in a dank-looking cave and talking to its people, they initially seem reticent to come and join your small group on the other side of the Runegate. But if you prove yourself by, for example, clearing out a bunch of goblins, battling packs of wild wolves, reuniting lost brothers, then they’ll consider it more seriously. That then means heading back to the world map, maybe paying the fee to explore a nearby patch of darkness and reveal new locations to venture to. You’ll rarely know exactly what to expect, but odds are there will be someone or something to fight.</p>
<p>This is where we come to the meat and potatoes of an action RPG. As a side-scrolling game, there’s only so many ways that combat can really unfold. You can attack with your equipped weapon (whether it’s one or two handed), block if you have a shield, wind up to fire a crossbow or throw a javelin, and dodge. You can boost your abilities by levelling up stats in Combat, Defence, Ranged and Rogueish attributes, and you might gravitate toward a particular style and type of weapon – I quite liked the standard axe and shield, after sending an opening crossbow bolt at any enemies.</p>

<p>Avoiding damage is rather tricky when attacks from onrushing melee assailants and more distant archers come quick and fast, but the pace of combat means you can clobber your way through. It also helps that you can have allies alongside to take some of the aggression.</p>
<p>Once any battle is done and dusted, then comes the time to smash everything in sight to pieces and gather up the resources they provide. You’ll need things like wood or stone for when you travel back through the Runegate to your home base and get to fixing up the joint. There’s crumbled bridges to repair, there’s marketplaces to rebuild, people to talk to for more missions, and more.</p>

<p>There’s a potentially rather moreish gameplay loop to discover here, the snackable combat going hand-in-hand with exploration and base building. What’s especially nice is how little stories and ideas can unfold, like finding a captive and releasing them before you’ve been asked to, just because you stumbled across the goblins first, or thinking it a good idea to release a caged wolf… who seems to blame you for their captivity. Thankfully not all wolves are immediately hostile. In fact, we stumbled across one rather eerie area with just a large pack of wolves seemingly standing guard, and one of them with whom we could engage, giving food until they let us pet them and actually recruit them as a battle companion.</p>
<p>Also, when you drink a stein of beer, you raise your other weapon-holding hand while necking it, and then smash the glass on the floor. Classic dwarves.</p>

			<p>A new Wilds Hearts S comparison shared online during the weekend highlights how the Nintendo Switch 2 can hold its own with other current-generation systems, and in some cases, even surpassing them.</p>



<p>The new comparison shared on YouTube by Cycu1 is based on the recently released playable demo, putting the Nintendo Switch 2 release side by side with every other console version, doing an excellent job highlighting the differences between the different versions. While the Switch 2 version of the game loses to the others in terms of geometry and the details of the environment, it looks surprisingly pleasant, especially as the haze that surrounds all of the game's environments has been toned down considerably, resulting in a sharper image despite the evident lower resolution. In some other instances, the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game clearly surpasses the Xbox Series S version of the game, sporting higher-quality resolution textures, highlighting once again how important it is to have more available RAM. Wild Hearts S also runs at a higher framerate than the Xbox Series S version, targeting 60 FPS, as opposed to the 30 FPS targeted on Microsoft's sytstem</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's great to see how Nintendo Switch 2 owners won't have to make do with a several cut-down version of Wild Hearts, as the game developed by Omega Force is one worth experiencing for fans of Monster Hunter and similar games. You can learn more about what makes the game so engaging, and the performance issues that impacted the experience at launch on PC and, to en extent, on PlayStation 5, by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wild-hearts-hanging-celestial-thread/">review.</a></p>



<p>Wild Hearts S launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on July 25 worldwide.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A battle between three former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> developers and their publishers at Krafton intensified over the weekend, after an internal document appeared online showing how the scope of the survival game has reduced during development. The source of this document remains unknown. In fact, quite a lot of facts about the document remain unknown. Nevertheless, Krafton have since leapt at the chance to confirm its authenticity. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>For those new to the drama, Subnautica 2 is one of the most wishlisted games on Steam. A couple of weeks ago three senior management folks at studio Unknown Worlds were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">kicked out and replaced</a> by the head of another Krafton-owned studio. The three ousted developers were co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max MacGuire, alongside CEO Ted Gill. No explanation was given, but Cleveland later revealed he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-is-ready-for-early-access-says-co-founder-ousted-from-studio-but-the-publishers-seem-to-disagree">disagreed with the publisher</a> over whether the game was ready to be released or not. He said Subnautica 2 was ready for early access. Krafton did not agree.</p>
<p>Then a report by Bloomberg revealed the leviathan in the room: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-plan-to-delay-subnautica-2-and-deny-the-studio-a-250-million-bonus">a $250 million payout</a> that Unknown Worlds employees would receive if a released game sold sufficient copies by the end of 2025. Following the leadership coup Krafton announced they would delay the game until 2026, making this "earnout" impossible. The fired managers then filed a lawsuit against Krafton, and Krafton in return released a statement <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing">accusing those managers of being negligent</a>. The whole thing is very messy.</p>
<p>This weekend it got messier. On Friday, two slides from a presentation of unknown length were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/">posted to Reddit</a> by an unknown party. The slides seem to show how the scope of the game's features were reduced over a two year period. It claims that the game was "deemed to lack the level of polish" required for release. </p>

</figure>
<p>"Compared to the originally planned EA launch specifications," says one line, "the current target content volume has been reduced or adjusted across various elements such as biomes, creatures, equipment/progression, and features. Due to a gap between the current state and the content volume assumed during the initial launch planning, it is necessary to reassess the release timeline and roadmap."</p>
<p>It's not unusual for games to have features stripped away during development, but this is the exact point on which Krafton and the fired developers disagree. Krafton confirmed the authenticity of this presentation in a statement to RPS and many other press outlets.</p>
<p>"The document that has been circulating on social media and reported by various outlets is indeed part of an internal milestone review conducted as part of the Subnautica 2 project," the statement reads, adding that milestone reviews "are conducted regularly in collaboration with KRAFTON’s creative studios across all projects.</p>
<p>"Given these circumstances, KRAFTON has determined that transparent communication is necessary and has chosen to
confirm the authenticity of the document. KRAFTON believes that minimizing speculation and ensuring accurate
communication with players must take precedence."</p>
<p>For all Krafton's talk of transparency, there is an astounding amount of information we do <em>not</em> know about this document. The document is incomplete. There is no date or timestamp to show when it was written. There is no attribution to show who originally authored it. It does not show who the intended recipient of the document is (ie. was this written to be sent to Unknown Worlds, or was it written to be shared between parties within Krafton?). The identity of the person or persons who posted the document is not known: it came from Reddit account "Complete_Bread_4924", who has made no other posts or comments.  </p>

</figure>
<p>What we can say is that Krafton stand to benefit from its appearance, inasmuch as it supports their side of the narrative about Subnautica 2's delay. They have confirmed the slides are authentic in their statement to the press - itself a practice that is rare for companies when it comes to leaks. Given this unusual development, and the speculation it might raise, we have asked Krafton, via their PR, several questions about the origin of the document.</p>
<p>We have asked Krafton to confirm or deny that they are the source of this leak. We also asked what date the document was authored, among other questions. They have so far answered by resending us the press release quoted above. We'll let you know if they get back to us with anything more solid. </p>
<p>The games media has broadly been attempting to keep up with the fast pace of this implosive fracas, and to understand the facts about the story. Krafton hasn't been particularly helpful. The publishers say that under the circumstances, "transparent communication is necessary". However, they have chosen only to show a tiny fragment of the internal discussion around the game, inviting onlookers and the media to make more judgements and speculation about what happened. Krafton jumping on this suggests that they believe the slides will help them further their version of events.</p>
<p>As for the ousted developers, they have retreated firmly into lawyer mode and are no doubt weighing up the likelihood of a victory against the corporate giant. "Suing a multi-billion dollar company in a painful, public and possibly protracted way was certainly not on my bucket list," said Cleveland last week. "But this needs to be made right." </p>
<p>So what do we take away from all this? The confirmation of the slides' authenticity feels distinctly like another angry volley from Krafton, directed at Cleveland, MacGuire, and Gill. Krafton would undoubtedly rather avoid a lengthy legal dispute about the game, especially considering the $250 million payout being disputed. Whether that loud noise is enough to scare the ousted developers remains to be seen.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-leak-is-authentic-say-publishers-who-benefit-the-most-from-that-leak]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Romanian MEP Nicolae Ștefănuță says he's signed the initative's petition to EU lawmakers</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>One of the European Parliament's vice presidents has voiced his support for the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign, and said he's signed the group's <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home">petition to the European Commission</a> to stop publishers rendering online games unplayable by shutting down their servers.</p>
<p>The petition surpassed a million signatures <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-hits-a-million-signatures-but-a-significant-number-could-be-fake">recently</a>, though there are concerns that some of the signatories are fake. It has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-only-games-prohibitively-expensive-to-create-argue-eu-lobby-group">received some pushback</a> from bodies representing game publishers, so it's no surprise the organisers have welcomed an endorsement from Nicolae Ștefănuță.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://x.com/nicustefanuta">Ștefănuță</a> voiced his support for Stop Killing Games via his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nicustefanuta/#">Instagram story</a> over the weekend, writing: "I stand with the people who started this citizen initiative. I signed and will continue to help them. A game, once sold, belongs to the customer, not the company."</p>
<p>If you don't keep up with EU politics on a daily basis, Nicolae Ștefănuță is a Romanian MEP currently representing the left-leaning Greens–European Free Alliance in the European Parliament. He's also one of the legislative body's fourteen vice-presidents, having been elected to that position in July last year.</p> <div>

<p>These <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/faq/13/who-are-the-meps-in-key-functions-and-how-are-they-elected">vice-presidents</a> work underneath the EU Parliament's president - right now that's Maltese politician Roberta Metsola - and may be asked to fill in for them by doing stuff like chairing debates. They're also part of "The Bureau", which sounds a lot cooler than it is, that being the thing which oversees the rules and admin that keep the parliament running efficiently.</p>
<p>So, certainly the kind of person that could help make the case for Stop Killing Games in debates, but still just one guy that's part of a wider body currently made up of 720 MEPs in total. If you're keen to learn more about Ștefănuță, who's been an MEP since 2019, it's well worth checking out <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/58766/NICOLAE_STEFANUTA/home#detailedcardmep">his profile</a> on the EU Parliament's website. It includes <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/plenary/en/vod.html">videos</a> of what he's said in plenary debates.</p>
<p>For instance, last Wednesday, July 9th, he was discussing lessons that could be taken from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/01/budapest-pride-viktor-orban-far-right-lgbtq">Budapest's recent pride parade</a> amid a crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights by Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, in terms of the need for anti-discrimination laws and "defending fundamental rights against right-wing attacks".</p>
<p>We'll have to see how many other EU politicians opt to get behind Stop Killing Games, but it's clear MEPs are becoming aware that they need to engage with the issue and work out where they stand.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/european-parliament-vice-president-throws-his-support-behind-stop-killing-games-campaign]]></content:encoded>

It’s already safe to say that Gunn’s initiative is proving to be a success.</p><p>DCU movies have been in steep decline over recent years, as the muddle of tonally confusing films saw decreasing interest. Putting aside the various distinct <em>Batman</em> films <em>not</em> set in the shared universe, the last time a DC movie opened domestically to over $100m was <em>Wonder Woman</em>, nine years ago in 2017. Soon after, the Snyder-infused films dropped sharply, with <em>Justice League</em> falling to under $94m, and 2018's <em>Aquaman</em> reaching just shy of $68m, before things got a lot worse.</p><p>In fact, the only two films in the franchise to open to over $50 million since are 2019's <em>Shazam!</em> ($53.5m) and 2023's <em>The Flash </em>($55m)—the latter a deservedly considerable flop, its lifetime U.S. gross scraping to just $108.1 million. The final two movies in the contained franchise, <em>Blue Beetle</em> and <em>Aquaman 2</em>, both barely topped $25m in their opening weekend.</p><figure id="" data-id="21e7be7406234dda108cd28cc0b70a94" data-recommend-id="image://21e7be7406234dda108cd28cc0b70a94" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="665" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Superman and Lois kiss while floating in the middle of a mall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Superman and Lois kiss while floating in the middle of a mall." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->DC</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="21e7be7406234dda108cd28cc0b70a94" data-recommend-id="image://21e7be7406234dda108cd28cc0b70a94" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="665" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Superman and Lois kiss while floating in the middle of a mall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So, two years have gone by, the previous version of the DCU now (mostly) retconned, and <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>’s James Gunn has reinvented everything. With a ludicrously long list of superhero movies planned, including <em>Supergirl</em>, <em>Clayface</em>, <em>The Authority</em>, <em>Swamp Thing</em> and <em>Sgt. Rock</em>, among many others, <em>Superman</em> absolutely had to be a success, or the entire project would look extremely unlikely. So Big Blue’s initial success must be a huge relief to an awful lot of people.</p><p>This is certainly helped by the movie being quite good. While padded and oddly paced, Gunn managed to deliver a much more interesting opening take on the classic superhero, with a fun ensemble cast and an overt commentary on America’s current attitudes toward immigration.

It beat <em>Man of Steel</em>’s previous record of $116.7 million, although if you count Snyder’s po-faced 2016 <em>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</em>, that steaming turd of a film somehow brought in $166m in its first two days.</p><p>It’s a promising start to the Gunniverse, although names as obscure to non-comics readers as <em>Clayface</em> and <em>Sgt.

Last week, however, former Striking Distance CEO, Steve Papoutsis, joined Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds as CEO. The shock announcement confirmed that the previous leadership team — Ted Gill, Charlie Cleveland, and Max McGuire — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-developers-entire-leadership-team-replaced-in-shock-move-krafton-said-will-bring-renewed-energy-and-momentum"><u>were replaced "effective immediately</u></a>." In a subsequent statement, co-founder Cleveland responded to what he called the "shock" decision to replace the leadership team, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ousted-subnautica-2-developer-breaks-silence-after-shock-removal-to-find-that-im-no-longer-able-to-work-at-the-company-i-started-stings"><u>saying that "after all these years, to find that I’m no longer able to work at the company I started stings."</u></a> The statement also intimated that while the former leadership team considered the game ready for early access release, Krafton did not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, last week, reports came to light that Subnautica 2 had been delayed to 2026 just months before Krafton was due to pay <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/more-drama-in-the-murky-world-of-subnautica-2-as-official-delay-confirmation-comes-hot-on-the-heels-of-damaging-report-into-now-unlikely-250m-bonus"><u>a $250 million bonus to the development team</u></a>. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bloomberg</u></a> said the delay was “against the wishes of the studio’s former leadership,” and that the $250 million bonus would have kicked in if Unknown Worlds hit certain revenue targets by the end of 2025. Now, without Subnautica 2 coming out this year, that bonus wouldn’t be paid out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement to IGN, Krafton insisted the decision had nothing to do with “any contractual or financial considerations.” Instead, Krafton claimed, the delay was about responding to feedback from playtests, and delay talks were already under discussion before Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill were outed. Shortly after this statement, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ousted-subnautica-2-leadership-files-lawsuit-against-parent-company-krafton-as-row-over-250m-bonus-gets-personal"><u>the former leadership team revealed they were filing a lawsuit against Krafton</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now the drama continues, with the leak of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an internal review document</u></a> that shares a less-than-stellar mid-cycle review. Rather than deny the leak, however, Krafton has authenticated it, saying: "Given these circumstances, Krafton has determined that transparent communication is necessary and has chosen to confirm the authenticity of the document."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The leaked images themselves show <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>two pages of a development review</u></a>, and appear to be photographs of a PC monitor. They show the disconnect between where Krafton expected development to be versus the as-is position. While we don't know who or which company authored the report, it's clearly critical of Unknown Worlds, recommending Subnautica 2 should "launch with an MVP-level build that allows players to experience the core loop at a high level of quality," but adding that, as it currently stood, the game "lacks the level of polish and market impact required to drive IP growth and expansion."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It is recommended to enhance the content volume and level of polish before launching so that it can appeal to a broader market from the [early access] release stage," the report says. "While the game includes a variety of content, it currently lacks the freshness and volume expected of a sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In addition, it falls short of meeting the high expectations of the OWSC and the Asian market."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is currently unclear how the leaked document began circulating publicly online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Krafton is issuing the following statement in response to growing speculation surrounding the development of Subnautica 2," Krafton said in a statement to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-latest-subnautica-2-twist-krafton-confirms-this-leaked-internal-review-document-is-real" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Eurogamer</u></a>. "This statement aims to offer clarity and context regarding the current situation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The document that has been circulating on social media and reported by various outlets is indeed part of an internal milestone review conducted as part of the Subnautica 2 project. Krafton has confirmed that portions of it have been leaked and are now being widely shared across online platforms and within the fan community. Krafton recognises the confusion this has caused.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Given these circumstances, Krafton has determined that transparent communication is necessary and has chosen to confirm the authenticity of the document," the publisher added. "Krafton believes that minimising speculation and ensuring accurate communication with players must take precedence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Milestone reviews are conducted regularly in collaboration with Krafton's creative studios across all projects. These reviews help assess development progress, define clear objectives, and ensure that each project aligns with Krafton's standards in both creativity and quality. This process is central to Krafton's commitment to delivering polished, high-quality games at the right time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Krafton will continue working closely with Unknown Worlds to ensure that Subnautica 2 meets the expectations of players who have supported the franchise over the years," the statement concluded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> started development after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> was finished, Nintendo has said, and work first began on the original Switch console.</p>
<p>The forthcoming game is the first 3D game featuring Nintendo's gorilla since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, but in an interview with <a href="https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20250710/10876902/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2-entrevista.html">La Vanguardia</a>, Bonanza's producer Kenta Motokura stated the team felt "this was the right time to develop this game".</p>
<p>When asked when development began, Motokura replied: "Although I can't give you very precise details, I can tell you that we started developing it after finishing Super Mario Odyssey (2017)" (via machine translation).</p>

<p>Later in the interview, director Kazuya Takahashi discussed how Donkey Kong Bananza's focus on destruction was only made possible on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>"As we mentioned before, we wanted to generate continuity through chain destruction, and to do this we needed to place a large number of destructible objects," said Takahashi. "This was only possible on Switch 2, which allowed so many elements to be placed on the screen, as well as different materials and large-scale destruction. In addition, to increase the feeling of satisfaction when destroying, we have put a lot of care into the effects and sounds, and also in the appearance of the objects that are destroyed."</p>
<p>Nintendo confirmed earlier this month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-donkey-kong-bananza-is-being-made-by-the-mario-odyssey-team">Donkey Kong Bananza has been developed by the team responsible for Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier today we reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-film-copyright-registered-by-nintendo-as-gorillas-prominence-continues">Nintendo has registered copyright for a Donkey Kong film</a>, which will likely follow the forthcoming Mario film sequel and Legend of Zelda film.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-started-development-after-super-mario-odyssey-and-wouldnt-have-been-possible-on-the-original-switch]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Haru Urara has been sent an absurd amount of tasty ryegrass, thanks to her appearance in Uma Musame: Pretty Derby and an influx of new fans.</p>

            <p><strong>Uma Musume: Pretty Derby</strong> fanatics have come out en masse to send packages of delicious ryegrass to their favourite horse from the game: Haru Urara. 
</p>
<p>Uma Musume, if you're not in the know, is an extremely popular gacha game that is getting more players by the day: over the weekend, it enjoyed over 50,000 concurrents on Steam alone (notable, since the vast majorioty of the playerbase is on mobile). In-game, you must further the careers of a variety of horses - obviously represented as horses, here - in order to progress. And it just so happnes that Haru Urara is the current fan favourite.  </p>
<p>This flood of new fans have been so passionate in their support the <a href="https://namabokusobank.jp/article/%E3%83%8F%E3%83%AB%E3%82%A6%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A9">Japanese ryegrass gifting website Live Grass Bank</a> has been sporadically crashing for days due to the intense traffic. However, <a href="https://x.com/namabokusobank/status/1944550718050042228">a public statement from the site</a> has confirmed the orders have been received and these gifts will be sent out over time.
</p>
<p>Haru Urara, depicted as a lighthearted pink-haired horse girl in Uma Musame: Pretty Derby, isn't a particularly great horse. During her professional career, the actual racehorse didn't win a single race, which is reflected in-game with career goals focused on gaining fans rather than taking home trophies.
</p>

<p>However, her delightful character has proven more than enough to garner a fresh fanbase with the worldwide release of free-to-play hit Uma Musame: Pretty Derby. An exceptionally popular gacha game available on both mobile and PC, many players who have yet to nab one of the rarer horses have nonetheless been having a blast with Haru and the other basic characters.
</p>
<p>Messages of support for Haru Urara are numerous on the ryegrass gifting website. Alongside each gift, you can leave a lovely message of support, such as "enjoy the grass from a loving sailor", or the short but sweet "never give up". We know Haru's getting the grass too, <a href="https://x.com/animal_love_kaz/status/1942472338420666628">courtesy of videos posted on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.
</p>
<p>Then, of course, you have social media, where artists have galloped along to immortalise this feeding frenzy <a href="https://x.com/HARUURARA_mochi/status/1943903597994901727">with custom illustrations</a>. It's safe to say that while Haru Urara may not have won any races in their career, winning the hearts of gacha fans will keep them full for a while.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/so-why-exactly-are-uma-musume-pretty-derby-players-are-sending-massive-amounts-of-grass-to-a-retired-japanese-race-horse]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto IV with the iCEnhancer 4.0 mod is the remaster that Rockstar Games still doesn't seem interested in releasing, introducing plenty of improvements that enhance the game's visuals considerably.</p>



<p>The release of the new version of a classic mod for the fourth entry in the series, which has been in the works for quite some time, has been announced with a new trailer which highlights the improvements it brings, including new physically-based lighting, new shaders that bring better fog rendering and water and more. As of now, the mod only works with version 1.0.3.0 and 1.0.4.0 of the game, as they are the ones that work best with ENB, so make sure to have either version installed before downloading the mod from its <a href="https://icelaglace.com/mods/ice4.html">official website.</a></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Grand Theft Auto IV has originally been released back in 2008, and it is the only 3D entry in the series that is not natively playable on current-generation systems, although Xbox Series X and S owners can play the original Xbox 360 release via backward compatibility. An official remaster has been rumored to be in the works for a while, but it has never materialized, nor has any straightforward port, although one is rumored to have been in the works for a year and may be released <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-iv-port-current-generation-max-payne-3/">before the end of the year</a>. With <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">Grand Theft Auto VI slipping to May 2026</a>, the port releasing before the end of 2025 would make a lot of sense, so hopefully, the rumors are true, and the fourth entry in the series will indeed make its return to current generation systems to make the wait for the next entry in the series much more bearable.</p>

<p>Are you excited? Because we are excited! Yes, it's getting mighty close to the return of everyone's favourite video game ape, and to celebrate Nintendo has posted a little movie on its social media (and to its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today</a> app, naturally) to remind us all that there are precisely <em>three days to go</em> until the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>

<p>Nice! We hope DK gets over that rather crushing blow in time for our adventures later this week, though.</p>
<p>Of course, for a game that hadn't really got us particularly excited in the lead up to the launch of the Switch 2 itself, Bananza has rapidly become one of our most-anticipated games of the year over the past month or so.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8htqkug&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The game's excellent Direct did lots to whet our appetites, revealing the clever layered world and smashing traversal styles at the heart of it all, and finding out that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-has-been-revealed">the Super Mario Odyssey team are behind this one</a> has now got us 100% on board.</p>
<p>It seems that physical copies of the game have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/uh-oh-it-looks-like-donkey-kong-bananza-is-already-out-in-the-wild">found their way into gamers' hands already</a>, but the rest of us don't have too long to wait until the Thursday launch. How many days was it again? Make sure to check out our preview of the game, too, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/donkey-kong-bananza-dks-getting-his-own-odyssey-and-its-a-helluva-trip">which is sounding mighty positive thus far</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the DK sphere, the game's director has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-director-acknowledges-performance-drops-we-prioritized-fun-and-playability">acknowledged some performance dips</a>, and a copyright filing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-might-be-getting-his-own-movie">suggests</a> the ape may be getting his very own movie.<em><br></em></p>

			<p>The prices for the two ROG Xbox Ally models have leaked online, and they are surprisingly reasonable, considering what they offer.</p>



<p>As spotted by Spanish publication 3D Juegos, ASUS itself leaked the price of the two systems for Europe. The cheaper model will cost €599, around $650, while the premium, more powerful X model will cost €899, around $975. While these prices may look steep for the average user, they are in line with the other handheld PCs on the market and are in the ballpark of the price most expected. </p>



<p>The ROG Xbox Ally systems were rumored to be in the works for some time, and have been officially announced last month during this year's Xbox Game Showcase. The base model will be powered by an AMD Ryzen Z2A processor and will balance performance and power consumption to maximize battery life. The premium X model will be powered by the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme Processor, delivering higher framerates and sharper visuals than the base model. Neither of the two models will come with an<a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-explains-why-the-rog-xbox-ally-doesnt-have-an-oled-screen/">&nbsp;OLED display</a>, which was ruled out by the necessity of having VRR support and balancing power draw and costs.</p>



<p>As of now, we do not know when the two ROG Xbox Ally models will launch worldwide. Earlier rumors suggested the handheld systems will launch sometime in <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-launching-october-price/">October,</a> and with the prices leaking online, there's a good chance ASUS and Microsoft are gearing up for an official price and release date announcement.</p>

                <p>If weapons are the stars of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/terraria/" data-ref-id="5000-105503">Terraria</a>, accessories are the quiet directors backstage. A single slot might not seem like much on its own, but with up to seven of the right trinkets equipped, your humble pixelated self transforms from target practice to terror incarnate.</p><p dir="ltr">There’s no shortage of options, especially once you start combining effects or tinkering with modifiers. So, rather than flood you with 37 “great picks” and a dozen situational caveats, we’re cutting through the fat and crowning the best-in-class endgame accessories for each of Terraria’s four core playstyles: Melee, Ranged, Magic, and Summoner. Simple as that.</p><p dir="ltr">And yes, you should absolutely still stack damage, crit, and movement speed modifiers like your life depends on it, because it does.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529528-melee-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529528" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529528-melee-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529528"></a><figcaption>Melee accessories</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529528-melee-terraria-accessories.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Best accessories for melee</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Fire Gauntlet</strong>: +100% knockback, up to +12% damage, +10% melee weapon size, enables autoswing, inflicts fire damage over time</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mechanical glove</strong>: +12% melee damage and speed, +10% melee weapon size, enables autoswing</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Warrior Emblem</strong>: +15% melee damage</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Frozen Shield</strong>: Immune to knockback, reduces damage by 25% (when below 50% health), absorbs 25% of teammate damage (when above 25% health)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Yoyo Bag</strong>: Increased yoyo range, can wield two yoyos</li></ul><p dir="ltr">It all starts with a modest little pair of claws. Then you fuse it with a Titan Glove. Then you wrap it in lava. Welcome to the Fire Gauntlet, the undisputed king of melee accessories.</p><p dir="ltr">The appeal is straightforward. More damage, faster swings, increased knockback, and automatic autoswing on everything from katanas to solar eruption whips. This thing turns your character into a buzzsaw. Whether you’re carving through Plantera’s vines or trying not to get deleted by a Moon Lord phase change, the Fire Gauntlet keeps your offence brutal and relentless.</p><p>It also applies a permanent Hellfire or On Fire! debuff on hit depending on your platform, which stacks with other damage-over-time effects to shred enemies faster than they can blink. If you’re running a melee build, you want this. And ideally with a Warding modifier, unless you’ve got a death wish and a nurse on speed dial.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529529-ranged-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529529" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529529-ranged-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529529"></a><figcaption>Ranged accessories</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529529-ranged-terraria-accessories.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Best accessories for ranged</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Molton Quiver</strong>: +10% damage, increased arrow speed, 20% chance not to consume arrows, and turns Wooden Arrows into Flaming Arrows</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Stalker’s Quiver</strong>: +10% arrow damage, increased arrow speed, 20% chance not to consume arrows, and enemies are less likely to target you</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ranger Emblem</strong>: +15% ranged damage</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Recon Scope</strong>: + 10% ranged damage, +10% critical strike chance, enemies are less likely to target you, and increases view range for guns</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Let’s not beat around the bush. Guns and bows don’t hit their stride until you start buffing the hell out of their crit rate and projectile behaviour. That’s where the Recon Scope steps in.</p><p dir="ltr">Born from the union of Putrid Scent and a Sniper Scope, the Recon Scope does two things exceptionally well. It increases ranged damage and boosts critical strike chance. Combine that with its long-range targeting assist and it turns you into Terraria’s deadliest cameraman, blowing heads off from a safe distance.</p><p dir="ltr">The real magic, though, lies in how it works with multi-projectile weapons. Fire a Tsunami or Daedalus Stormbow and you’re suddenly raining death with terrifying precision. It’s especially lethal in multiplayer, where you can comfortably sit behind your meat shield friends and delete bosses before they even notice you.</p><p dir="ltr">Bonus points: Stack it with a Molten Quiver or Stalker’s Quiver for synergy with bows. Yes, they stack. Yes, it’s busted. No, we’re not complaining.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529531-magic-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529531" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529531-magic-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529531"></a><figcaption>Magic accessories</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529531-magic-terraria-accessories.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Best accessories for magic</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Celestial Emblem</strong>: +15% magic damage, increased Mana Star pickup range</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Celestial Cuffs</strong>: Restores mana when damaged, +20 increased maximum mana, increased Mana Star pickup range</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Sorcerer Emblem</strong>: +15% magic damage</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mana Regeneration Band</strong>: +20 increased maximum mana, increases mana regeneration rate</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mana Cloak</strong>: -8% mana cost, uses mana potions automatically, causes stars to fall upon damage</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Arcane Flower</strong>: -8% mana cost, uses mana potions automatically, and enemies are less likely to target you</li></ul><p dir="ltr">You don’t need to be a wizard to know that mana is a problem in early Hardmode. That’s why many players rush the Celestial Cuffs, a surprisingly stacked accessory that restores mana when you take damage and sucks in mana stars from across the screen like a magical Dyson. Pair that with a Mana Cloak, and you’ll generate the very stars you need to keep afloat.</p><p dir="ltr">But if we’re choosing the top-tier pick for endgame spell-slinging, there’s only one champion. The Celestial Emblem.</p><p dir="ltr">This bad boy grants a flat 15% boost to all magic damage, and if you’ve ever nuked a boss with Nebula Blaze or decimated crowds with Last Prism, you know how much that multiplier matters. The emblem synergises perfectly with high-DPS magic builds, making it the clear favourite for mages who want to kill first and mana-manage later.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529533-summoner-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529533" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529533-summoner-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529533"></a><figcaption>Summoner accessories</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529533-summoner-terraria-accessories.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr"><span>Best accessories for Summoner</span></h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Papyrus Scarab</strong>: +1 max minion count, +15% summon weapon damage, and +2 minion knockback</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Hercules Beetle</strong>: +15% summon damage, +2 minion knockback</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Summoner Emblem</strong>: +15% summon damage</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Necromatic Scroll</strong>: +1 max minion count, +10% summon damage</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Pygmy Necklace</strong>: +1 max minion count</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Summoners have always had it rough in Terraria. For the longest time, you had to choose between looking cool and actually doing damage. But once the Papyrus Scarab enters your inventory, the suffering ends.</p><p dir="ltr">This elegant little bug boosts minion damage by 15%, increases knockback, and lets you summon one extra minion. That might not sound revolutionary, but when your build revolves around overwhelming the screen with spiderlings, Stardust Dragons, or Terraprisma clones, more is always better.</p><p dir="ltr">Papyrus Scarab is a fusion of the Necromantic Scroll and Hercules Beetle, both found post-Plantera, so it’s a late-game investment. But summoners are used to that. The payoff? You become a walking army, effortlessly chewing through invasions and bosses while you stand back and admire your minions like the world’s most bloodthirsty talent scout.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The bottom line</h2><p dir="ltr">Accessories in Terraria aren’t just side perks. They’re the spine of every build. Whether you’re swinging swords, firing arrows, hurling magic, or sending your minions to do the dirty work, the right pick for your <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-weapon-types/1100-6533073/" data-ref-id="1100-6533073">Terraria weapons</a> amplifies your power, shores up your weaknesses, and gives you the edge you need when the screen starts flashing red.</p><p dir="ltr">Want to go even further? You can. With accessory slots expanding thanks to items like the Demon Heart and the Void Bag letting you swap builds on the fly, there’s plenty of room for experimentation. But if you’re looking for a definitive loadout anchor per class, this is it.</p>

                <p>There's nothing worse in The Sims 4 than encountering bugs in gameplay, especially when you've run into something unusual that's difficult to do a Google search about. It's an inevitable thing, though. The Sims 4 is more than a decade old--it's an early PlayStation 4 game, after all--and so some serious creakiness is to be expected. Things just break down and get messy from time to time.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately, The Sims 4 has been so popular that it'd be tough to encounter a bug that's completely unique to you. At this point, we've got a fairly clear set of steps you can take to figure out what's wrong when your game is just kinda freaking out on you. Scroll on for your best options.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Reset your Sim(s)</h2><p dir="ltr">Sometimes your Sims will be going about their business when they just stop responding to orders and seemingly freeze up. It's the most common issue in The Sims 4, and the first thing to try in those situations is to reset the bugged-out Sim in question. To do this, open the cheat console by pressing ctrl+shft+C on PC, or by holding down all four shoulder buttons on Xbox or Playstation. Next, type ResetSim and then the name of the Sim in question--like "ResetSim Dina Caliente." If you've activated cheats (console command "testingcheats true"), PC and Mac users will also have the quicker option of pressing shift while clicking on the Sim, and then choosing the option "Reset Sim (Debug)."</p><p dir="ltr">Resetting a Sim clears out all their random impulses from their action queue. Sometimes, Sims just get too many things going at the same time, like a bunch of other Sims trying to get their attention all at once, and it overloads their li'l computer brains and locks them up while they try to figure out what has the highest priority. Resetting will free their mind, so to speak.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Clear the cache</h2><p dir="ltr">Likewise, the cache for The Sims 4 as a whole can become overloaded in the same way that a Sim itself can be, but we can solve that one by clearing the game cache. Clearing the cache on PC or Mac is simple, as it merely involves deleting two files. First, navigate to Documents &gt; Electronic Arts &gt; The Sims 4. Once you're there, you'll delete two files: localthumbcache.package and avatarcache.package.</p><p dir="ltr">If you play The Sims 4 on Xbox or PlayStation, clearing the cache is even easier than it is on PC. Just turn your system all the way off--not rest mode--and then unplug it for 60 seconds. This clears the cache for the entire system.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Check your mods</h2><p dir="ltr">For a lot of Sims PC players, it's tough to imagine playing without mods. But it's those same mods that often get us into trouble, usually when they haven't been kept up to date. And after 11 years, there are<em> a lot</em> of old, abandoned mods out there. Unfortunately, it's not always easy to tell which mod is causing you problems, or whether it really is a mod that's responsible for your problems at all. So we've got a couple steps you can take to pinpoint whether a mod is the issue, and narrow down which mod it might be.</p><p dir="ltr">First, you'll want to test if a mod is the culprit at all by disabling them completely. You can do this by going to the Other section of the game settings, and unchecking this check box:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4529568-sims4screenshot2025.07.03-00.45.29.63%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529568" data-ratio="0.65407407407407" data-width="1350" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4529568-sims4screenshot2025.07.03-00.45.29.63%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529568"></a><figcaption>This is where you can disable all your mods at once.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4529568-sims4screenshot2025.07.03-00.45.29.63%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Save your settings, restart the game, and see how it works. If your bug isn't presenting itself anymore, then it was probably a mod that caused it. Now you'll need to narrow down which mod is the issue. One relatively easy test you can try is to pull half of your mods from the mods folder in your Documents folder, clear the cache, then load your game again. If you still have the bug, then one of your active mods is the problem--and if you don't, then it means one of the inactive ones is causing the trouble. You can continue narrowing it down from there by doing the same thing with the half that seems to have the problem mod, or if you've narrowed it down to your satisfaction, you may want to start removing specific mods you think might be the culprit.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4529570-screenshot%28152%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4529570" data-ratio="0.56289129197496" data-width="1757" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4529570-screenshot%28152%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4529570"></a><figcaption>Here is where you can repair your Sims 4 installation in the EA app.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4529570-screenshot%28152%29.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Repair installation</h2><p dir="ltr">You may have key game files that are missing or corrupted--another occasional side effect of using out-of-date mods. In these situations, you can use the EA app to check your installation directory and replace any crucial files that have gone missing or been corrupted. Just navigate to the main Sims 4 page in the app, and click on the Manage button to the left of Play. Select Repair from the dropdown menu. The EA app will then scan all your base game and DLC files for anything anomalous. This process <em><strong>does not</strong></em> check your mods, only the game files themselves.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Consider culling Sims</h2><p dir="ltr">There is a limit to how many Sims that The Sims 4 can support at once. By default, the game caps the total population at 200, but you can remove that cap in the settings if you want. But no matter how good your computer may be, The Sims 4 will eventually slow down significantly if you add too many Sims. Even playing on a modern gaming rig with an RTX 4080 and an i9 CPU like I do, The Sims 4 tends to get real creaky when my world's population gets past 750 or so.</p><p dir="ltr">The Sims 4 is built to prevent that creakiness from happening by culling unplayed Sim families from the game periodically, but you can also protect a household from being culled by adding them to your list of played households. If your game has way too many Sims, the population could be the source of your problems. Moving inessential households over to the unplayed bucket will allow the game to remove them when or if it needs to. This is only a concern for players who have more than a couple hundred Sims in their game, however.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Consult the community</h2><p>Lastly, there are two immense community resources you can take advantage of if the above checklist doesn't handle your issues: the <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/the-sims-4-bug-reports-archive-en/re-read-first-compiled-list-of-reported-issues/11182959" rel="nofollow ">EA forums</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/comments/1lp8wwd/troubleshooting_thread_bugs_errors_mod_issues_ea/" rel="nofollow ">Reddit</a>. Those have been the two most central discussion hubs for The Sims 4 since it launched--presuming your problem isn't unique to your setup, there's a very good chance you'll be able to find somebody else who's had the same issue in the past.</p>

            <p>Morning all! The working week once again looms above us like a bulldozer driven by raucous and somehow loveable sheepdogs in top hats and cufflinks. Quickly now, lob a few new PC game releases under the caterpillar treads to slow its passage. It's not clear where those sheepdogs are going, but your and my wellbeing are clearly of secondary importance.</p><!--more-->
<h2>Monday 14th July</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today is all about factory games, apparently. My highlights among the mass producers are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kaizen-a-factory-story">Kaizen: A Factory Story</a>, a craftsmanlike automation puzzler from former Zachtronics devs, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3320980/MoteMancer/">MoteMancer</a>, in which you build fantastical factories in different dimensions that overlap in real-time. Note: the MoteMancer devs have said that genAI was used to "ideate" the art, though the final art assets were created by regular humans - or "skinloads" as we are known in the trade.</li>
<li>If you despise factories, please take your resentments to the tiles of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3040170/Arashi_Gaiden/">Arashi Gaiden</a>, a turn-based ninja slicer. Where is my ninja factory sim, games industry.
</li></ul>
<h2>Tuesday 15th July</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today is all about comebacks of one kind or another. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2738630/Dungeons__Dragons_Neverwinter_Nights_2_Enhanced_Edition/">Dungeons &amp; Dragons Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition</a> is Aspyr Media's revamping of one of the D&amp;D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> people venerated before "D&amp;D RPG" became synonymous with "Baldur's Gate 3".</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3024040/Stronghold_Crusader_Definitive_Edition/">Stronghold Crusader: Definitive Edition</a> is Firefly's remastering of 2002's answer to Angry Birds.</li>
<li>Troubled Bungie FPS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> has a new edition and DLC rollout - Year Of Prophecy. The first of the new DLC packs is The Edge Of Fate, which includes a new planet featuring lost humans and forgotten Fallen houses.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/becoming-saint">Becoming Saint</a> is today's token Actual New Game. It's a pleasantly cracked real-time tactics roguelite in which you try to get yourself canonised before you are martyred.
</li></ul>
<h2>Wednesday 16th July</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today, it is time to exsanguinate Pikmin and daub gory geometry in occult squad tactics puzzler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/worship">Worship</a>, which should remind you instantly of Cult Of The Lamb.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 17th July</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1315320/The_Necromancers_Tale/">The Necromancer's Tale</a> (pictured) is an open world RPG with Disco Elysium-esque dialogue windows in which you are a questing liche (quiche?), building up your rotten retinue (rotinue? Let's go with it) while going to the occasional ball.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3343160/Fill_Up_The_Hole/">Fill Up The Hole</a> is a chirpy 2D landfill empire simulator. Can't spell wholesome without hole, etc.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-labyrinth">Shadow Labyrinth</a> attempts to make a horror game out of Pac-Man, overlooking that Pac-Man is already perfectly horrible. Pac-Man, a game in which you are an insatiable orb in a maze of ghosts.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-drifter">The Drifter</a> could be this week's highlight. It's a pulp adventure joint inspired by "King, Crichton and Carpenter, with a dash of 70s Aussie grindhouse", in which you a homeless man asked to investigate his own murder.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 18th July</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do you enjoy besieging Rainbows? Do you enjoy kicking doors? Have some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2841770/Phantom_Squad/">Phantom Squad</a>, then.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are we denizens of the Treehouse up to this week? Well, Nic and Jeremy spent a lot of this week's all-hands meeting complaining about gardening - possibly gardening in a video game. I can't quite remember, because I was myself too busy complaining about the 1990s. Possibly the 1990s in a videogame - again, I can't quite remember. This happens a lot at the minute. </p>
<p>Mark has some embargoed stuff on the boil, and James is just back from break, freshly bronzed and hungry for words. Ollie is tidying up some bits and pieces before he, too, embarks on holiday. Graham is staring at us all patiently from the corner of the video call, waiting for people to shut up about their roots. What are you up to this week? Assuming you haven't been smooshed by sheepdogs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-stronghold-destiny-and-neverwinter-nights-lead-a-host-of-drifters-necromancers-and-pac-monsters]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> creator Kinetic Games will be creatively involved in the recently announced film, and, the studio has told Eurogamer, it will begin seeding lore across the game in order to develop a story for it.</p>
<p>"Yeah, we are involved in the creative side of it as well," the game's creator, Daniel Knight, told me as part of a longer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-of-phasmophobia-how-the-witcher-3-inadvertently-saved-the-ghost-hunting-game-that-sold-25-million-copies">Phasmophobia interview</a>. "We do want to make sure it is a Phasmophobia film and it's what everybody will expect going in. We're not just making a ghost-hunting film. It will be a Phasmophobia-themed film, and it's our job to make sure it's what everybody wants."</p>
<p>But as people pointed out in reaction to the film's announcement, the game doesn't really have a story. It follows a series of procedurally generated ghost hunts that take place across apparently unconnected properties. How does that translate into a film?</p>

<p>"There's some very minor story parts in the game right now," Knight responded. "We do have a lore update planned as well. We were planning on doing that before the whole film stuff came about.</p>
<p>"We'll do our own lore and story for the game and design it in a way where it's a puzzle for people to figure out," he added. "There's not going to be any story mode or campaign or anything like that. You're just going to be poking around in different locations. And that will be used for the film stuff as well."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-has-earned-itself-a-movie-adaptation-from-m3gan-and-five-nights-at-freddys-production-company-blumhouse">The Phasmophobia film was announced in June</a> as a collaboration between Kinetic and Blumhouse (M3gan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a>), and production company Atomic Monster (Annabelle, The Nun, The Conjuring). But apparently Blumhouse wasn't the first film studio to express interest.</p>

<p>"We had a few different studios reach out," Knight told me. "We had quite a lot of interest. Even shortly after release, we had quite a big studio reach out," he said. I asked him who this was but he couldn't remember; I pursued this and genuinely seemed unable to recall the name. "We had quite a few over the years," he added, "and then Blumhouse reached out and we're all fans of all their horror films, and they were the perfect fit.</p>
<p>"A lot of them all play the game as well," he said. "I think it'll be like they will take the game stuff into the film, rather than the other way around."</p>
<p>It's been an extraordinary five years for Knight and Kinetic Games since Phasmophobia was released. Still only in Early Access, the game has sold more than 25 million copies - a new grand total Knight gave me when we spoke. The recent console releases and major Chronicle update have rejuvenated player activity in the game, and now all eyes turn to 2026 and the major 1.0 release, which is so significant, Knight said you should feel like you're playing a new game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-of-phasmophobia-how-the-witcher-3-inadvertently-saved-the-ghost-hunting-game-that-sold-25-million-copies">The full story of Phasmophobia</a>, from near-miss to extraordinary success, is live elsewhere on Eurogamer now.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-will-begin-seeding-lore-to-build-story-for-the-film]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Chains of Freedom is a turn-based strategy game, similar to XCOM, but set in a post-apocalyptic Eastern European country instead of an alien invasion. As with every other apocalypse, the land is messed up, full of unhinged lunatics, and there’s mutants about. It’s a good thing that you’ve got a squad of tactically minded folks to fight through these enemies with.</p>
<p><iframe title="CHAINS OF FREEDOM | Official Launch trailer | Nordcurrent Labs" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZuXpfuYO4tM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The story of Chains of Freedom isn’t going to blow your mind and the characters aren’t exactly novel, but it’s enough to keep you going to the next combat at least. A mysterious disease called EDEN is spreading through the land and those it doesn’t just kill become deformed, crystalline monsters who, naturally, make up a good chunk of the enemies you’ll be facing. Again, it’s not particularly unique, but I found some moments to be enjoyable enough even if I ended up treating the story as a thread to connect the combat encounters.</p>


<p>The biggest issue with the story is that it will take characters from your party without warning, suddenly replacing them with other characters who have different abilities. These new characters are perfectly functional, of course, but you’ve just spent hours with the others and equipped them with essential tools. When they’re taken away it means the time you spent preparing them was wasted, and if anyone can be gone at any given moment, it becomes very easy to not care at all about any of them. I only truly cared about a character when they had unique abilities, but even then sometimes they’re taken away from you, leaving you without that ability. Whilst this does force you to switch up your tactics, not being able to rely on having your carefully assembled squad of characters is a pain.</p>


<p>Thankfully the actual combat is pretty great. If you’ve played XCOM, you know what to expect here. Each character has action points that are spent on moving, attacking, and using abilities or consumables. A few abilities can make certain characters feel really quite powerful, such as a grappling hook which I was using to reposition a sniper, but could also be used to quickly get into or out of combat for a little melee punishment, or to flank around hunkered down enemies. Another character could sacrifice a third of her health to gain 20AP, which has saved her life many times, not to mention ended quite a few enemies’ lives. Since there are no limitations on how many times you can attack per turn, she could attack four times with that ability, making her very powerful.</p>
<p>The other side of this is that the game does feel a little bit easy, with the only real challenges being bosses, and even they’re not that tough. There are a few enemies that I would consider annoying, but not really challenging, such as one that teleports away when damaged, leaving behind a lesser enemy, which wasn’t really difficult to handle, but made the combat longer and more laborious. Some combat encounters will also bring in a few waves of reinforcements, often just appearing right next to your characters upon arrival, which is rather annoying in a game about tactics. Despite these issues, the combat can be very satisfying and was the real reason I wanted to keep playing.</p>

<p>Characters are customisable, though mostly by equipping weapons, tool, and consumables that you find whilst exploring the environment and looting defeated enemies. Favouring sniper characters to keep enemies at a distance, I found a crossbow that causes bleed and burning on enemies that I was partial to, but there’s plenty of variety through shotguns, flamethrowers, as well as various types of grenades, like cryogenic grenades. They provide a lot of effective options, so long as you don’t mind combing every area for loot. The walk speed is needlessly slow and there’s little of interest in the environments other than the loot, so exploration can feel a bit dull. Crafting materials will allow you to craft many of the aforementioned things, as well as ammunition for all your guns, which I had to do a lot as I was constantly running out.</p>
<p>The most interesting things you find through exploring are biocrystals. These are a weaponized form of the EDEN virus that will give a character a bonus. Some are incredibly useful, whilst others are basically useless, but at least there’s a lot of options if you find them. Characters can be upgraded to be able to equip more biocrystals,&nbsp;but only at certain shrines that can only grant a limited amount of biocrystal slots. This is how your character progresses and since it seems like you can miss some of these shrines &nbsp;– there’s been a few moments where I realised I hadn’t seen one for a while and got suspicious – it also seems to be possible to just miss some character progression. Also, as mentioned, you can give these upgrades to characters only for them to suddenly be removed from your party and replaced with someone else, wasting all your time and investment.</p>

<p>The graphics in Chains of Freedom are good, but not that impressive. It does the job well enough. Being post-apocalyptic, the environments are all drab, broken down buildings and such like that aren’t particularly interesting to look at in addition to the game not being pretty on a technical level, so the only draw for exploration is the loot you can find. The game sounds good enough as well, with some punchy gun sounds, though the voice acting oscillates between “serviceable” and “a bit off”.</p>

<p>Yes, the Switch 2's flagship title has landed the gold medal once again, but it wasn't without competition. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> made a gnarly arrival, kickflipping into second in its debut week (with only 11% and 10% of sales coming from Switch 2 and Switch 1, mind you) and the likes of <strong>The Sims 4: Enchanted by Nature</strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/legacy_of_kain_soul_reaver_1_and_2_remastered">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered</a> also put up good enough numbers in the first week to disturb the waters of the chart's upper ranking.</p>
<p>Everything else is a pretty familiar sight, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_25">EA Sports FC 25</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> all hanging about in the top 10. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> has taken a bit of a tumble this week and now finds itself in tenth, while <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/assassins_creed_shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has made an almighty leap from 25th to fifth.</p>
<p>That's a brief overview of the numbers, but here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>

            <p>It's time. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s gotten a randomiser mod, just in case the base game isn't quite maxing out your unexpected chaos-per-run meter at this point, despite its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-hero-for-our-times-elden-ring-nightreign-boss-becomes-unbeatable-by-refusing-to-show-up">revamped bosses</a>.</p>
<p>While FromSoft's roguelike-ish twist on the established souls formula already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review">switches things up</a> in a manner that's a bit like a randomiser <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-best-mods">mod</a> makeover of one of the series' traditional entries, modder thefifthmatt has still found ways to tinker with it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Enter their <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/277?tab=description">Nightreign randomiser and derandomiser</a>, which can be used to scramble map layouts beyond what's possible in the base game, which has a finite range of different map patterns it can chuck at you per Nightlord. It's a first foray into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a> randomising that the author says will serve as a "basis for more advanced randomisation" down the line.</p>
<p>"At a base level, the only difference you might notice using the randomizer is that Night Bosses are more varied for a given Nightlord," thefifthmatt wrote. "Under the hood, it's creating map patterns nearly from scratch and has a tremendous amount of freedom in its placements. In the future this can be extended to randomising enemies and bosses within maps and in-depth placement customisation."</p>
<p>The randomiser works by modifying files when you start up the game, and comes with three distinct randomness presets, "similar to base game", "balanced random", "extra random". They all basically do what they say on the tin, with "balanced" looking like the one you'll want to try first, while "extra" ditches some "placement restrictions which are normally helpful for balancing purposes" to make things tougher for uber-hardcore folks.</p>
<p>You can also pick "any custom combination of these options or other options like greatly increasing the frequency of double Night Bosses". Plus, thefifthmatt's chucked in extra options like increasing the chance of shifting earth being a factor or reverting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-its-first-patch-but-more-importantly-a-trailer-thatll-really-help-you-wake-up">patch 1.01's tweaks</a> to runes and revives so uber-sweaty solo players can wind back the clock to a time of enhanced hardness.</p>
<p>Not every aspect of the maps has been made randomness-eligible yet, but as the modder says, it's a start, and one that's compatible with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/while-you-wait-for-an-official-update-elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-a-two-player-co-op-mod">Nightreign's Seamless Co-op mod</a> so you can dive in with however many buddies you like. If you fancy giving it a go, you'll need to grab <a href="https://me3.help/en/latest/">Mod Engine 3</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-inevitable-randomiser-mod-is-here-to-spice-up-your-runs-with-extra-funky-map-scrambling]]></content:encoded>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-card-shop-robbed-of-valuable-cards-by-other-pokemon-card-shop-a-few-blocks-away/">Automaton</a>, a 35-year-old Japanese man was arrested on suspicion of robbery on 9th July 2025 and is alleged to have stolen 123 items at knifepoint worth approximately $94,000 from a Pokémon Trading Card store. The twist? The accused is apparently the owner of his own Pokémon and One Piece-focused trading card shop within the same neighbourhood.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22firgnto&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Although the police didn't disclose such information, the owner of the target store posted a message on <a href="https://x.com/MASTERS_gifu/status/1943158484863693250">X</a> to confirm that the accused is the manager of a competing store. The post concludes by stating that anybody else involved in the crime should "surrender immediately", asking those who might have information to come forward.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regarding the robbery incident that occurred at our store on 6/14,<br>
following Sakaguchi and Ando, the manager of the neighboring store Treca Junky @toreca_junky, Yuji Watanabe, has also been arrested as an accomplice in the robbery.</p>
<p>Those still involved should surrender immediately.<br>
Thinking you won’t get caught is impossible.</p>
<p>We will absolutely catch everyone.</p>
<p>We welcome any information, no matter how small.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The post has since attracted quite a bit of attention, though it remains unclear whether there have been any further developments at this stage.</p>
<p>It's good that at least <em>some</em> progress is being made to get the whole thing sorted, mind. It's likely pretty difficult to deduct who might be perpetrating such crimes at the best of times, but when the stolen goods are then sold on immediately in a rival store..? Gosh, that must be rough.</p>

<p>Relic have confirmed that Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of War: ReDawned: War For All: Come Get Some War Down Ya: One Dawntillion Wardollars Edition will be compatible with "over 20 years of lovingly crafted community mods". Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of War: This Dawn, Its Warsenal Edition <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/relic-reveal-warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-with-full-dlc-and-mod-support">also comes bundled with all four expansions</a>.</p>
<p>All told, the full package contains four campaigns and nine factions, namely Orks, Eldar, Spicy Eldar, Space Marines, Spicy Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Tau, Necrons, and Sisters Of Battle. Tyranids were never released, but you have to remember this was 2004, and the idea of having a swarming species of hive-minded purple bug aliens in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> was ridiculous.</p>
<p>In terms of multiplayer, Relic <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3556750/Warhammer_40000_Dawn_of_War__Definitive_Edition/">say they've</a> been "fixing some of the most egregious legacy bugs", though balance will remain the same. They also plan to hang around for a bit after launch to fix "high priority issues", and experiment with with changes to things like flying unit behaviour, unit pathing, and "quality-of-life settings such as grid key presets".</p>
<p>As for general improvements, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of Phwoar, That's A Lot Of War(hammer) edition features: image-based lighting, unit texture upscaling ("at least four times their original resolution), new world lighting, unit reflections, surface gloss, emissive lighting, and new shadows. There's also an integrated mod manager, an "improved camera", better draw distances, 4K support, and a better HUD for widescreen.</p>
<p>There is apparently a very minor controversy going on over the new trailer (above) replacing a Space Marine's scream. The word 'iconic' has been used. This does not bother me, because everything that has ever come out of a Space Marine's mouth is stupid, and the setting would be vastly improved if you replaced it all with goat noises. Although, as an Ork enjoyer, I realise I'm throwing stones from the glassiest of houses here.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-gets-an-august-release-date-with-a-chunky-discount-for-anniversary-owners]]></content:encoded>
