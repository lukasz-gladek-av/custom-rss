              <p>I may be born and raised in this fine city of New York, but oh do I love the desert. Strange, unexplainable stuff happens out there, what with the aliens, supernatural beings, drugs, or, in this case, video game promotional material that is sure to have confused some unfortunate soul wandering the dunes at night.</p> <p>Over the weekend, Geoff Keighley posted his most cryptic teaser yet for the upcoming Game Awards show on December 11, 2025. Featuring an image of a creepy-looking stone statue of skeletons in the middle of the desert, folks were quick to realize that the Keighley’s caption, “regal.inspiring.thickness,” was actually an address using the <a href="https://what3words.com/clip.apples.leap">What3words geocode service</a>.</p>

 <p>It uses randomized words to quickly pinpoint virtually any location on the surface of the planet. Those three words took internet sleuths to a&nbsp; location in the Mojave desert where there’s presently a wild-looking statue.</p> <p>Keighley’s initial post only showed part of the wild-lookin’ statue. Those who were in the neighborhood, however, were able to get up close and personal and, well, it’s certainly fuel for some interior decorating that my roommate surely won’t appreciate. Check it out:</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Game Awards Monolith at night <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@thegameawards</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@geoffkeighley</a> <a href="https://t.co/Tcdk9xmUYc">pic.twitter.com/Tcdk9xmUYc</a></p> <p>— 𝑳𝑨𝑽𝑨 (@lava037) <a href="https://twitter.com/lava037/status/1994957660161282393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>That’s it at night, where it lights up like I wish Christmas trees would, all red and devilish, beckoning for you to surrender your soul for the promise of power. Here it is during the day:</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/An38ClGFcY">pic.twitter.com/An38ClGFcY</a></p> <p>— Triodug (@TotallyNOTTrio) <a href="https://twitter.com/TotallyNOTTrio/status/1994843918786335123?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The ominous statue looks like a gateway to hell made out of countless skeletons cobbled together and a spidery-lookin’ eyeball thing right in the center above some small steps. Someone must have paid a lot to have it commissioned and dropped off in the middle of nowhere.</p>

 <p>Keighley has been on a little mini reign of terror lately, sharing all kinds of <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1991907624951136477">cryptic tweets</a> that have tortured the poor denizens of various <i>Half-Life</i> subreddits. Some began wondering if the statue was a tease for the next <i>God of War</i> or some completely new franchise.</p> <p>But, based on reporting <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1995065300539347395">from <i>Windows Central</i></a>, the Mojave desert stunt might actually be teasing the next big expansion for <i>Diablo 4</i> and not some mysterious death metal spin on the Electric Sun Desert Music Festival. Shucks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s never been a better time to grab tech essentials that feel a little out of reach the rest of the year. We’re talking PCs, gaming monitors, premium laptops, top-rated tablets, solid headphones, and even external storage solutions. Cyber Monday sales have slashed prices across all these categories and more, making today a great time to finally treat yourself to what you’ve been eyeing for long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6130/">Those looking to grab a new Windows laptop; we’ve got great news. The 15-inch Dell touchscreen laptop just dropped by 80% on Amazon</a>. It typically sits at a not-so-friendly tag of $4,500, but this deal lets you bring one home for just $900, though it’s limited to Prime users. And as if the discount wasn’t enough, the retailer is also throwing in a bunch of freebies worth $100 with your purchase. Of course, as you’d expect, the discount is only around for a short period of time. Since today is technically the last day of this week-long sale that started before Black Friday officially kicked off, you only have a few more hours left to grab it. Be quick to avoid last-minute rush and disappointments.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6130/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Processor for All Your Tasks</h2>
<p>At just 4.2 lbs and under 0.7 inches thin, it’s a lightweight laptop that slides into any bag without adding bulk and goes with you wherever you do, with ease. There’s nothing too crazy going on with the design, which gives off a professional, premium look that blends into any workspace without drawing too much attention to itself. Open it up, and you’re greeted with a spacious 15.6-inch Full HD (1920×1080) WVA touchscreen. It pushes vibrant, clear visuals consistently, whether you’re sitting in a dimly lit room or out there in the sun. Touch support makes navigation easy, letting you use your fingers to swipe, scroll, draw, and even type when you’re not in the mood to press some buttons.</p>
<p>The screen is paired with a comfortable keyboard, which features a lift-hinge design for better wrist support. There’s a numeric keypad on the side; great for those of you who need to work with numbers on a regular basis. Battery life is just as impressive. On a full charge, you can go up to 8 hours without plugging it in. Recharging doesn’t take forever, either, as the machine hits 80% in just about an hour.</p>



<p>Power-wise, Dell has packed the laptop with the 10-core 13th Gen Intel Core i7-1355U processor, which holds up well during both everyday and resource-intensive tasks. Multitaskers will appreciate the massive 32GB RAM. It keeps slowdowns at bay, even during busy days that require you to do a whole bunch of tasks using different applications at once. For storage, there’s a 1TB SSD built right in. You’ll be able to house all that you own, plus enjoy ultra-fast boot and load times. Ports are plenty, so connecting peripherals won’t be a problem. Speaking of peripherals, the accessory kit comes with a Redragon wireless keyboard and mouse combo, for absolutely free.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6130/">On a regular day, this laptop would run you around $4,500, but Prime members can grab it for just $900 right now</a>. Non-Prime members will still see it at its retail price as of now. It offers a nice blend of performance, portability, and a stable battery, which makes it great for work professionals, creatives, students, and even casual users. It’s a Cyber Monday deal, so it’s only valid for today. Act fast to snap it up before it’s too late.</p>

              <p>During these revolting times, what we need are heroes. Step forward one such person, offering a bright light of hope into our murky days: the Kabuto King. This anonymous figure (because all the best superheroes are) appeared from nowhere in August this year, with a single and singular goal: to collect every first edition Kabuto card from the <em>Pokémon</em> <em>TCG</em>‘s Fossil set. He’s currently at 1,748.</p> <p>Why? Because no one else did yet.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">New Kabutos: 30<br>Total Kabuto Count: 1748</p> <p>The show goes on 👑 <a href="https://t.co/saoScQIslC">pic.twitter.com/saoScQIslC</a></p> <p>— Kabuto King (@KabutoKing_) <a href="https://twitter.com/KabutoKing_/status/1994810431442227615?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s not uncommon for&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> collectors to try to find one of every card of a favourite pocket monster. I, for instance, have collected one of every English-language Mantine and am working on the Japanese versions now. But most people tend to stick to one of <em>each</em>, rather than every single one of the same card. That is Kabuto King’s goal: gathering the cards in any condition, graded or loose, in their thousands, with the intention of buying up every single one.</p>

 <p>What makes the Kabuto King’s quest quite so excellent is that Kabuto is…look, I’m not setting out to offend anyone, but it’s hardly the most glamorous of Pokémon. Not one of Ken Sugimori’s most inspired designs, the creature first introduced in the original <em>Pokémon</em> games is essentially just a brown horseshoe crab with glowy red eyes at the front. Kabuto first appeared in the <em>Pokémon TCG</em> in 1999’s Fossil set, in the ignominious position of 50/62, tucked between the similarly unimaginative Horsey and Krabby. It received no holo pattern, and until the last few months—even with a 1st Edition badge—was of almost no value. In July of this year, you could have bought yourself one for less than a dollar. Right now, the market price, according to <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/44452/pokemon-fossil-kabuto?page=1&amp;Language=English"><em>TCGPlayer</em></a>, is over $28.</p>

 <p>Catching on as a meme, many people are rooting through binders to see if they’ve a spare card they can send the King’s way (I checked, I don’t, sadface emoji), while the masked figure scoops up every example they can find on eBay and other marketplaces. And as a result, the prices are climbing fast. Kabuto King himself has noticed that eBay sellers are suddenly declaring themselves “sold out,” likely in order to relist the previously worthless cards at their new, higher price.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wow. Ebay sellers cancelling orders from days ago saying “out of stock”…</p> <p>That is BS. They will 100% re-list later at a much higher price. If you list something and someone buys it for your asking price you need to honor it.</p> <p>— Kabuto King (@KabutoKing_) <a href="https://twitter.com/KabutoKing_/status/1995322305556164690?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Incredibly, after <a href="https://x.com/KabutoKing_/status/1993684329248043039">a post from the X account on November 26</a> went viral, some are trying to compare King Kabuto’s antics to those of NFT sellers and the farce of artificial scarcity. As observed by <a href="https://x.com/StarPlatinum_/status/1995120664034811969">@StarPlatinum</a>, humorless people began claiming this action is the same as “whale concentration,” presumably because the crypto-brained are really incapable of discerning reality from the imaginary nonsense that drives their every moment. Big news here, but <em>Pokémon</em> cards are actually real objects, tangible and corporeal, and as such, their scarcity is never artificial. This is just one person buying all the real-life cards because they want to, and it’s funny. And, of course, no one cared a jot about the Kabuto cards before they started.</p>

 <p>With daily updates on X, Kabuto King shows a photo of all the new 1st ed Kabuto he’s bought, and then the bulk box in which they’re all being stored. It’s a beautiful sight, and the speed with which it’s all happening is breathtaking. The card had never been worth more than $10 in its 26 years of existence, but now it is the priciest non-holos in the Fossil set! Extraordinarily, <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/search/pokemon/fossil?productLineName=pokemon&amp;setName=fossil&amp;productTypeName=Cards&amp;page=1&amp;view=grid">it’s currently valued higher</a> than the non-holo Moltres, Articuno, and Zapdos, traditionally the three best regular cards to pull in the set. It’s only $11 behind the cheapest holo, too—Muk, watch out, it’s coming for you!</p> <p>What a splendidly joyful thing to see happening: it’s utterly harmless, deeply charming, and having a bonkers real-world effect on the price of a formerly unloved piece of cardboard. Step aside Gengar, there’s a new card everyone’s hoping to pull from Fossil. Although a sealed 1st Edition Fossil pack will cost you $250 to $370 (people want the Aerodactyl pack art much more), you might want to think twice.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>During a new interview, the Metal Gear Solid series producer spoke about how difficult it was to port MGS 4: Guns of the Patriots to current-gen consoles and systems. </p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake was recently released and had a successful launch, selling <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-sold-over-1-million-copies-in-2-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 1 million copies in just 2 days</a>. It seems fans want to play the next parts as well; however, after the producer’s comments, it appears that developing a current-gen port for MGS 4: Guns of the Patriots isn’t as easy as it looks. </p>







<p>During a new interview with a Japanese publication called <a href="https://t.co/MsrWWmYbRW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Real Sound</a>, Metal Gear Solid series producer, Noriaki Okamura, was asked about MGS 4 coming to current-gen consoles. Okamura first stated that “the hardware at the time required a very particular design to produce 3D performance with the technology available at the time.” Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots was a PlayStation 3 exclusive title, released in 2008. </p>



<p>Okamura added that Metal Gear Solid 4 also has “quite a unique code,” and these factors make it “tough to bring it over now”, the producer said laughingly. The producer’s statement doesn’t outright reject the idea of a port, but does reveal that it won’t be easy if they plan to do so. </p>



<p>In other news, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-deltas-fox-hunt-mode-gets-october-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer mode</a>, Fox Hunt, was released this October. Additionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-x-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-crossover-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delta Force</a> is going to feature a Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater crossover soon.

But that's not stopping CD Projekt Red from stating again that a whole new trilogy might launch within a six-year timespan. That's been the plan for years, but the company reasserted this position during a <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf" rel="nofollow ">recent financial call</a>, according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-whole-new-witcher-trilogy-of-games-released-within-six-years-of-each-other-is-that-even-possible-cd-projekt-red-thinks-so" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">CD Projekt co-CEO Michal Nowakowski was asked about the company utilizing Unreal Engine 5 for The Witcher 4 and whether that could lead to shorter development cycles for future sequels. "In a way, yes, I do believe that further games should be delivered in a shorter period of time--as we had stated before, our plan still is to launch the whole trilogy within a six-year period, so yes, that would mean we would plan to have a shorter development time between [The Witcher 4] and [The Witcher] 5, between [The Witcher] 5 and [The Witcher] 6 and so on," Nowakowski said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Nowakowski's co-CEO at CD Projekt, Adam Kicinski, discussed this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-coming-2025-at-the-soonest/1100-6508062/">six-year timespan for the new Witcher trilogy</a> in 2022--over three years ago. To be clear, the clock would start ticking on six years once The Witcher 4 launches, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-release-date-is-not-soon-as-dev-discusses-why-it-wont-use-genai/1100-6530369/">that won't happen until 2027 at the earliest</a>.

			<p>The Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake is reportedly launching as early as mid-January 2026 on PC and consoles, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>Speaking on the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@insider_gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a> podcast, well-known leaker Tom Henderson, who has revealed numerous accurate details about Ubisoft's projects before official announcements in the past, confirmed that the remake will be released in mid-January.</p>



<p>As for when the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake will be shown again, Tom Henderson couldn't confirm. What he knows is that Ubisoft is internally planning to market it for only one month before the release date, so a new showing at next week's The Game Awards show would make the most sense to get as many eyes as possible on the game. Still, there's no real indication this may happen, so the marketing for the game may also involve a simple trailer drop on YouTube in the next few days.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake has been in the works for quite some time. Confirmed initially back in September 2020, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-remake-announced/">the game was slated for an early 2021</a> release which never came to pass, as it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-was-just-delayed-indefinitely/">delayed indefinitely in February 2021</a>. The reason for the indefinite delay was only provided in 2022, when it was confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-montreal/">development had been rebooted, with the reins passing to Ubisoft Montreal, the developer of the original game</a>.</p>



<p>Even with the original developer back at the helm, the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake development, it took some time to learn that development was proceeding smoothly. <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-has-passed-an-important-milestone-ubisoft-says/">An important development milestone was passed in November 2023</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-2026-no-word-on-splinter-cell-remake/">an early 2026 release window was finally confirmed this May.</a></p>



<p>If the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake indeed launches next month, it would be the third entry in the series to release in the span of two years after a very long hiatus. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-who-needs-sands-time/">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown brought the series back to its 2D origins in January 2024,</a> while <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-the-year-of-the-prince/">The Rogue Prince of Persia expanded the series' 2D gameplay with roguelike elements</a> <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-xbox-game-pass/">this August</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Fortnite</em>‘s mega-<a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868">popular<em> Simpsons</em> event</a> is over and season 7 is now officially live in the battle royale. The victory lap for one of the game’s biggest months in a while has been short-lived, however. No sooner did the new update go live than fans started side-eyeing some of the new sprays, music, and art in the game, wondering if it’s AI-generated. The latest slop witchhunt comes just days after Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney argued against storefront disclaimers for games that use AI.</p> <p>Season 7 features a new battle pass with cameos from The Bride from <em>Kill Bill</em> and Marty McFly from <em>Back to the Future</em>. In keeping with this loose ode to classic cinema, the game also now features new posters and sprays that some players think look suspiciously like they might be at least partly the work of gen AI. “Did <em>Fortnite</em> use AI to make this poster?” is now <a href="https://x.com/Duba_legitleaks/status/1995152082731733329">the question</a> ricocheting <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1pahvnv/is_this_chapter_7_art_ai_generated/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-fans-are-saying-no-to-ai-slop-after-spotting-what-they-believe-are-ai-generated-images-in-game">around social media</a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">it's unfair to criticize those that raise suspicion on this kind of thing. </p> <p>suddenly, there are several images that have that "AI look" to them. Likely touched up and not fully generated, but there's something mildly off about shading and lighting</p> <p>and then the toes on one <a href="https://t.co/cynddbBH56">pic.twitter.com/cynddbBH56</a></p> <p>— WayComet ☄️ (@WayComet) <a href="https://twitter.com/WayComet/status/1995264510098366888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>At the center of the debate is a yeti poster, a <em>Back to the Future</em> spray, a tomatohead talk show billboard, and a new emote song in the battle pass called “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1paauzo/the_new_icon_emote_latata_is_an_ai_song/">Latata</a>.” Unlike most of the backlashes to AI we’ve seen in gaming, however, this one is based more on vibes than obvious tells. There’s not yet any clear evidence that gen-AI was used, and Epic Games hasn’t officially commented on the controversy yet.</p>

 <p>But the sheer association with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/nhl26-ai-ea-college-football-madden-card-packs-2000646229">slop aesthetic</a> has already blown up into calls to boycott the season. The debate has gotten so messy that r/FortNiteBR, which features over 1 million active users, has already created a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1pasao6/ai_content_in_fortnite_megathread/">dedicated mega thread</a> to stop it from consuming the rest of the subreddit.</p>

 <p>In addition to calls for commenters to stay “civil,” there’s also an informal poll asking for players’ positions on the use of AI in games. Nearly 2,000 respondents said AI has no place in any game. Only 4 percent said they had no issues with generative AI being used in gaming.</p>   <p>At least one of the artists whose work was involved in season 7 has come out rejecting the AI accusations. Sean Dove, a freelancer who goes by andthankyou on Instagram, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/andthankyou/?hl=en">responded after</a> his Marty McFly spray became one of the witchhunt’s targets. “I guess someone on Reddit thinks this is AI,” Dove wrote. “I think the culprit is a clock in the background.” The face clock in question has incorrect numbers. The artist said he grabbed a bunch of clock images from an image search to collage them.</p>

 <p>“It’s entirely possible I grabbed an AI clock and wasn’t paying attention,” he wrote. Dove followed up with a time-lapse image of making the spray.</p> <p>It’s a perfect example of how poisoned the well has become. On the one hand, you have people so suspicious of slop being forced on them that they are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/1p7c6cm/no_bungie_did_not_use_ai_for_dredgen_baels/">pointing fingers everywhere without proof</a>. On the other hand, you have an artist potentially unknowingly introducing AI into their work simply by using random online references for household objects.</p>

 <h2>Time Sweeney rails against Steam AI rules</h2> <p>The cloud currently hanging over <em>Fortnite</em> was made darker by recent comments from Epic’s boss. Sweeney recently argued against AI disclosures on Steam and other storefronts. “The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation,” <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993687499621728312?s=20">Sweeney wrote on X</a> last week. “It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production.”</p>

 <p>When another user on the platform alleged that Epic might already be using gen-AI for coding its Unreal Engine, the executive denied the claim. “I just hate to see Valve confiscate ever more opportunity from small developers by facilitating new categories cancel campaigns and review bombing,” he wrote. “Steam used to just facilitate downloads. Then they foreclosed on payments, then price competition, then crypto, now AI.”</p> <p>Sweeney’s bullishness on generative AI is the spark that’s helping fuel skepticism about <i>Fortnite</i>‘s latest season. After all, if the CEO of a company tells you gen-AI will be involved in “nearly all future production” and thinks that fact shouldn’t have to be disclosed, it’s not a huge leap to consider that’s already happening in his company’s game. No wonder some players just want to be done with the whole thing rather than having to become a part-time <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-spot-generative-ai-art-according-to-artists/">internet forensic</a> whenever their favorite game introduces new art, music, or voices that sound slightly off.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-hits-a-new-cyber-monday-low-while-apple-clears-out-its-black-friday-leftovers-2000648832</link>
            <guid>1369138</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If your first post-Thanksgiving stop is the gym to work off some of that massive feast, you’ll want to make a little Cyber Monday detour to Amazon first to upgrade your wireless earbuds. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6129/">Right now the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 wireless noise cancelling earbuds are $50 off, making them a great buy at just $200</a>.</p>
<p>These are the latest Powerbeats Pro, having dropped less than a year ago, and they’re packed with features that will earn them a permanent place not just in your gym bag, but anywhere that you’re wanting high-quality sound and pro-level noise cancellation. They work equally well with both Apple and Android devices — which has long been one of the top Beats features — and with the charging case they have up to 45 hours of listening time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6129/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ready for Sweat</h2>
<p>There really isn’t a situation that’s wrong for the Powerbeats Pro 2, but they truly excel as workout buds. The secure-fit earhooks keep them firmly in place no matter how hard your workout is, with five different sizes of ear tips included to ensure the best possible fit. The earhooks are upgraded from the previous Beats, with nickel titanium reinforcement for flexibility, grip, and overall strength. The Beats app for iOS and Android has a Fit Test feature built in so you can check that you have the best fit and therefore the best sound and best noise cancellation.</p>
<p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 are also IPX4 sweat- and water-resistant to hold fast during your hardest workouts or if rain or snow show up during your outdoor run or bike ride, and this model comes with a heart rate monitoring feature that you can read on the Beats app. The Beats app is also where you’ll be able to find the customizable controls, battery status, and Locate My Beats feature.</p>



<h2>Big Upgrade</h2>
<p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 come with a number of significant upgrades from the previous version, starting with the charging case. It’s significantly smaller, reduced in size by roughly a third to make them more pocket-friendly. The case can now charge wirelessly, and a full charge of both the case and the buds combine to create up to 45 hours of total battery life. If that somehow runs out and you’re in need of a quick boost before you run for the door, the Fast Fuel feature turns a 5-minute charge into 90 minutes of listening time, enough for a workout or a run.</p>
<p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 are all-around great wireless buds, above and beyond working out. They’re armed with stable Bluetooth, built-in voice isolation, and multiple mics for hands-free phone calls. The Active Noise Cancellation is top-notch, and there’s also a Transparency mode that lets you enjoy your music or podcast fully while being aware of your surroundings for safety’s sake. The Powerbeats Pro 2 also fully support spatial audio.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6129/">The $50 Cyber Monday price drop at Amazon pushes the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 wireless earbuds to the head of the class for great audio deals</a>. Check them out now before this 20%-off deal expires.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-quietly-offloads-era-100-for-cyber-monday-wifi-and-bluetooth-compatible-speaker-at-record-low-2000649099</link>
            <guid>1369111</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sonos is known for making high-end WiFi speakers that are meant for home audio systems but the<strong> Era 100 adds Bluetooth connectivity and real portability</strong> to the company’s signature sound quality. This speaker has better sound quality than any other portable Bluetooth speaker and it combines the convenience of wireless pairing with the ability to play music in multiple rooms.</p>
<p>Right now, the<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/"> Era 100 is now $169 instead of its usual $199 price for Cyber Monday which is the lowest price this model has ever been</a> since it came out. You only have a few hours left to get this deal, which is basically studio-quality audio in a size that makes it easy to move between rooms.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Better sound with upgraded architecture</h2>
<p>The new processor is 47% faster than the old Era design and when used with more Sonos speakers, it can <strong>handle more complicated audio processing</strong> and keep everything in sync better. This processing power makes the dual-tweeter acoustic architecture work which lets a single small unit create real stereo separation by putting instruments and vocals in different places in space instead of mixing them all together into mono mush.</p>
<p>The tweeters make high frequencies sound clear which lets you hear cymbals shimmer and voices breathe, which cheaper speakers hide. The midwoofer is 25% bigger than the last generation which makes the bass sound deeper and this combination gives you full-range sound that doesn’t need a separate subwoofer for casual listening. However, if you want room-shaking low end, you can still get it.</p>
<p>The Sonos app uses Trueplay tuning technology to <strong>look at the acoustics of your room and automatically changes the speaker’s EQ</strong> to make up for reflective surfaces, furniture placement, and room size. This adaptive processing stops the bass from getting too loud near walls and the sound from getting too thin in rooms with high ceilings and few soft furnishings.</p>



<p>The small size means it can fit on bookshelves, kitchen counters, nightstands and desk corners without taking up too much space or needing its own furniture. The <strong>Era 100 is a good size for smaller rooms</strong> where bigger speakers would be too much. It also encourages people to try out different placements because it only takes a few seconds to move it instead of needing help.</p>
<p>A <strong>single button press turns on Bluetooth pairing which lets you connect to phones, tablets, and laptops</strong> right away when WiFi isn’t available or isn’t convenient. This means that the Era 100 is great for outdoor parties on patios or balconies where your home network might not work well. It also lets guests play music from their devices without having to join your WiFi network or download the Sonos app.</p>



<p>Setting up takes just a few minutes and is very easy: All you have to do is plug it in and connect your phone to the same WiFi network. The Sonos app tells you where to put your speakers and how to calibrate Trueplay without using technical language or menus that are hard to understand. With Alexa integration, you can control playback, change the volume, and skip tracks without having to touch anything.</p>
<p>At this price of $169, Sonos sound quality is on par with that of mid-range Bluetooth/WiFi speakers that don’t have multi-room capabilities and have worse audio processing. The Cyber Monday sale ends tonight, so this is your last chance to get the Era 100 at the lowest price ever before it goes back to regular price tomorrow.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="627">Black Friday passed but lots of deals are still active on Cyber Monday. You haven’t missed your change to save big on either some gifts for the family or some nice tech upgrades for yourself.&nbsp; <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/">Right now, Amazon is offering the Anker Laptop Charger at 40% off. Normally priced at $100, this USB-C compatible charging block is available for just $60—a savings of $40—for a limited time</a>.</p>
<p data-start="629" data-end="1269">These days, we carry an ever-growing number of gadgets that constantly need to stay charged. It’s no longer just our smartphones that require a nightly plug-in. If you enjoy listening to music or podcasts during your daily routine, your wireless earbuds or Bluetooth headphones also need regular recharging. Anyone relying on a smartwatch for fitness tracking or health monitoring has to keep its battery topped up to ensure it performs at its best. And that’s only the beginning. Tablets, laptops, and even handheld gaming systems such as the Nintendo Switch 2, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally, or the Steam Deck all demand consistent charging to stay powered throughout the entire day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="629" data-end="1269">Dual High-Speed USB-C Ports</h2>
<p data-start="629" data-end="1269">The Anker Laptop Charger is designed to to simplify powering all these devices. Featuring three USB-C ports, this small yet efficient charging brick is capable of supporting essentially any piece of hardware that relies on USB-C for power. It can output up to 140W, allowing it to rapidly charge larger electronics like a 15-inch MacBook Air. Impressively, the Anker Laptop Charger can boost a MacBook Air from completely drained to 50% battery in only 30 minutes. Either of the first two USB-C ports provides that maximum charging speed, so you can plug into whichever one is most convenient without losing performance. The four port is USB-A to ensure compatibility even with older devices you need charged.</p>
<p data-start="629" data-end="1269">The smart display screen on top of the charging brick can provide you with useful insights into your charging. With multiple devices plugged in an charging, it will breakdown for you port-specific details on the power output of each as well as their total together. It displays with high definition color so it is easily legible when you need to see this information.</p>


<p data-start="629" data-end="1269">The display can also be used to show your temperature data. Maintaining a cool temperature will increase charging performance and this gives you insight into how optimal your charging conditions are.</p>
<p data-start="629" data-end="1269">On the subject of temperature, the Anker Laptop Charger employs safety features like ActiveShield 4.0. This system monitors the device temperature over 10 million times per day to protect against your devices from overheating.</p>
<p data-start="629" data-end="1269">In the box, you get the Anker Laptop Charger capable of 140W output along with a five foot 240W USB-C to USB-C cable. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/">The Anker Laptop Charger is available in both dark gray and silver. Both color options are part of the Cyber Monday sale which shaves the price down to just $60 for a limited time.</a></p>

<p><strong>Assassin's Creed</strong>, Ubisoft’s flagship series, has delivered two decades of time-hopping adventure. Over the years, it has spawned a glut of expansions and spin-offs, building a franchise with a legion of faithful fans.</p>
<p>Moving away from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hitman_absolution">Hitman</a>-like structure of working through a target list, the series reinvented itself and shifted into gigantic open-world sandboxes filled with light RPG elements and enough quests to keep you busy until the next instalment arrived.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Shadows</a>, which launched on other platforms in March, landed at a moment of truth for the franchise. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/assassins_creed_mirage">Mirage</a> received a lukewarm reception, and confidence in Ubisoft’s output has been fading. Finally unsheathing the long-requested feudal Japanese setting felt like a Hail Mary, and for the most part, it works. This is one of the most engrossing worlds the series has created, supported by two engaging and wildly different protagonists who are a joy to play as.</p>

<p>This instalment also marks the first time the new(est) mainline title has been released on a Nintendo console since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/assassins_creed_iv_black_flag">Black Flag</a> on Wii U back in the bygone age of 2013. It’s a huge game, a technical powerhouse, competing with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a> for the opportunity to make your Switch 2 really sweat. It’s worth noting early on that performance and general visual presentation are solid, with some caveats, but more on that later.</p>
<p>Taking place at the tail end of the Sengoku period, Shadows tracks two parallel journeys across the Kansai region of Japan. Though shaped by the machinations of Nobunaga Oda, a pivotal figure in Japanese history, the story is a familiar revenge tale. Driven to recover a mysterious family heirloom and avenge her father, Naoe hunts down the Onryo, a masked clan of villains. Meanwhile, the Mozambican slave turned samurai Yasuke serves under Nobunaga and struggles through a life of self-discovery and moral conflict.</p>
<p>Their paths eventually cross, and the two become allies, hunting down the corrupting forces spreading across the land and taking down the Onryo one mask at a time.</p>
<p>The Animus element has been pushed far into the background of the series of late, although there is still an overarching mystery involving an omniscient voice, who occasionally reminded me that I was controlling someone who was, in turn, controlling Naoe and Yasuke.</p>
<figure><a title="Assassin's Creed Shadows Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160923/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The hook that separates Shadows from other titles in the series is the stark mechanical differences between its dual heroes. Naoe is your traditional assassin type, athletic, sneaky, and equipped with the traditional hidden blade. Sneaking through shadows (light sources can be snuffed out for better stealth), clambering across rooftops and utilising tools to escape combat, this is Naoe’s bread and butter.</p>
<p>Yasuke, on the other hand, is essentially a walking brick wall. He’s an armour-clad brute who smashes through gates, dominates groups of enemies in a fight and has the loudest methods of offence. Unlike <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/assassins_creed_syndicate">Syndicate</a>, the series' last stab at swappable protagonists, these characters never have parity. They remain two distinct playstyles and expansive upgrade trees only broaden the gulf between them.</p>
<p>Given his size, Yasuke is incapable of most stealth and traversal options, comically falling through tightropes and crashing to the ground during leaps of faith. Conversely, Naoe doesn't last long in fights with multiple enemies, favouring hidden blade kills and misdirection.</p>
<figure><a title="Assassin's Creed Shadows Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160910/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some quests are meant for either Yasuke or Naoe, and long stretches of the story lock you into one specific character. For the most part, though, you are free to cycle between them. This contrast adds a sense of variety and choice that the series hasn't really had before. It’s engaging to look at an enemy outpost and decide on the sneaky approach or the one-man army raid.</p>
<p>Combat is also pleasingly versatile, with both protagonists having several main weapon and projectile choices. Highlights include Naoe’s Kusarigama moveset and Yasuke’s Teppo build (long guns and explosives). Outside of weaponry, there’s a mountain of gear to be collected, upgraded and cosmetic-swapped. There is, of course, a microtransaction store for ever more elaborate gear, but this can be ignored.</p>
<p>Establishing a rhythm with both characters is easy because you’re going to spend a lot of time with them. Modern Assassin's Creed games are overflowing with activities scattered across their expansive maps. You get a titanic main quest that can easily take 80 to 100 hours to finish, along with hundreds of side quests, including Animus quests that refresh endlessly.</p>
<figure><a title="Assassin's Creed Shadows Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160916/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are many more organisations to dismantle outside the Onryo, new ones popping up on your objective board almost constantly. If you want to dive deep into a single game for a couple of hundred hours, Shadows is built for that kind of time sink.</p>
<p>Still, it all feels a bit stretched. Many quests boil down to long treks across the map to speak with an NPC, followed by another trek back to the quest giver so you can start the next errand. There are plenty of activities that try to break up the repetition, including a painting minigame with cute animals and a fun but shallow base-building mechanic, also with cute animals. Even so, I still find myself longing for the simplicity of Altair and Ezio’s adventures.</p>
<p>But what of performance? How does this, a uniquely tailored current-gen experience, play on Switch 2? The short answer is mostly good.</p>
<figure><a title="Assassin's Creed Shadows Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160917/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ubisoft has been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-technical-rundown-detailed-by-ubisoft">uncharacteristically transparent</a> about how Shadows has been tuned to run on Nintendo’s hardware. Much like the exemplary port of Cyberpunk 2077, Shadows uses DLSS for upscaling and VRR to maintain stable frames in undocked mode.</p>
<p>Visual sacrifices have been made to the game's detailing to preserve stability. Players familiar with other versions will notice the difference, yet it remains an impressive-looking game. Some of the character models can look a bit waxen in dialogue scenes and occasionally texture issues blight the environment, but these issues aren't too frequent.</p>
<p>Busy population centres like Osaka can cause the frame rate to dip below its 30fps target, and that becomes far more noticeable when undocked. You spend a lot of time moving through areas packed with NPCs, so this lack of stability stands out.</p>
<figure><a title="Assassin's Creed Shadows Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160920/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Combat with multiple enemies, which is a staple of playing as Yasuke, holds up better even when smoke and explosions fill the screen. Sneaking around as Naoe relies on the spatial awareness that a smooth camera provides, and that is never an issue here.</p>
<p>For the most part, Shadows is an admirable port of a graphical powerhouse. I cast my mind back to 2017, when I played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/doom">DOOM</a> on Switch and was astonished at how well it had been optimised for the underpowered console. Shadows on Switch 2 feels like a colossal achievement, only slightly reduced by moments when it strains under the pressure of the handheld console's capabilities.</p>
<p>This technical ambition is most evident when taking in the rich design of the open world. Racing through the Kansai countryside while the wind kicks up leaves and ground clutter around your horse feels richly atmospheric. The amount of colour and detail on display is staggering at times. Seasonal changes add to the natural splendour even more, creating ever-shifting biomes.</p>
<figure><a title="Assassin's Creed Shadows Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160911/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Touch controls are included, but only for menus and the base builder, and mouse controls are sadly missing. There is a useful Ubisoft Connect feature that lets you carry your progression across consoles. The Switch 2 version comes with all patched-in content that is already available on other systems. The Claws of Awaji expansion is not bundled, although it will be available to purchase separately in February.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Outside of the technical ups and downs of its transition to Switch 2, Assassin's Creed Shadows remains a thoroughly enjoyable refresh for the series. Taking its most captivating open world to date and offering two distinct playstyles, it goes a long way toward appeasing current franchise fans while nurturing a new generation of assassins, presenting a huge, intricately crafted depiction of feudal Japan and giving you enjoyable dual protagonists to usher you through it.</p>
<p>Shadows isn't a <em>perfect</em> port, then, but it’s still a colossal achievement and one of the best-looking games on Nintendo’s console.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The future of the Metal Gear Solid series is uncertain at this time, but it may include new entries in the series as well as other remakes, according to producer Noriaki Okamura.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://realsound.jp/tech/2025/11/post-2232566.html">Japanese publication Real Sound</a>, Okamura-san was asked about what could be next for the series, which was brought back this year with the release of <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. The series producer wants to continue working on the series, but how the franchise's future will be shaped is still uncertain, and may involve both remakes and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"new works".</em></p>



<p>The Metal Gear series is akin to the history of video games, spanning from pixel art games to cinematic experiences, so the remake approach for each title would be different, Okamura-san explained. As such, the remake method used to remake Snake Eater wouldn't work for every remake, which would need to be considered separately. This suggests that Konami may not pursue a 3D remake of the original 8-bit Metal Gear games, as the producer indicated the Delta method isn't universally applicable.</p>



<p>Still, with almost every main entry in the series to date being playable on current gaming systems<a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-release-october/"> thanks to either backward compatibility or remasters</a>, there's not a pressing need to remake any of them, except the fourth entry in the series, Guns of the Patriots, which is still only available on PlayStation 3. Speaking about this game, Okamura-san noted that the notorious difficulty of developing for the PS3 resulted in the creation of special, highly complex code that would pose unique challenges for a modernization effort.</p>



<p>No matter if with a remake or remaster, a modern version of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots would be rather welcome. Following the release of the Master Collection Vol 1, there have been indications that <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-metal-gear-solid-4/">the fourth entry in the series would be included in the hypothetical Master Collection Vol 2</a>, so the time when players will be able to experience the end of Solid Snake's story on modern hardware may not be too far in the future. Hopefully, Okamura-san and his team will face these development challenges head-on to provide fans of the series quick access to a game that has been too long stuck on original hardware.</p>

            <p>I'm still a little burned-out on Carrollian adaptations after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nightingale">Nightingale</a>, but I will not let that tarnish my enjoyment of Wonder of Blue, a fey 2D labyrinth roguelite based on fiction's most famous Alice after Alice Bee (RPS in peace). It features a lovely selection of pixelart colour palettes, and some pleasingly tricksy enemies. You play Liddell – yes, I too had forgotten Alice's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Liddell">second name</a> isn’t “in Wonderland” – and you are trying to navigate a series of procedurally generated dungeons made up of single-screen rooms. At the end of the journey waits the Red Queen. </p><!--more-->

<p>Along the way, you’ll encounter: owls that fly up and turn invisible before diving at you; butterflies that spit orbs that home within a certain range, often catching you from behind when you dodge-twirl past them; floral fans that whirl themselves towards you in fits and starts. I like the arcane yet sparse nature of the enemy movements. It makes me think of the geometric design of the older Castlevanias - and of the maddening mathematics of Carroll's original novel.</p>
<p>I also like that my default special move consists of hurling a cat named C.C., because this has me fumbling after connections between cc’ing people on emails and the disappearing Cheshire moggy from the books. Please discuss.
</p>
<p>As for the roguelite elements, you’ll find treasure chests that offer a choice of three random items, a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>. These include playing cards for alternative special moves, and exploration tools such as a map and compass. You may need all the help you can get: even when playing the demo on Casual, which lets you retry individual labyrinths on defeat rather than permadeathing you back to square one, I found progress tough. Liddell’s hitbox and damage cooldown timer are not as generous as they might appear from the blithe presentation. A tip: opponents don’t spring into motion until you’ve fully entered a room.
</p>
<p>You can find it on <a href="https://velveteenio.itch.io/wonder-of-blue">Itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3712860/Wonder_of_Blue/">Steam</a>. I like this. I like its unassuming yet hypnotic floor patterns and nested timescales and absent-minded background music. Sort of hoping for a surprise David Bowie appearance, tbh.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/acer-goes-rogue-on-nitro-v-gaming-laptop-i7-rtx-4050-1tb-now-selling-at-all-time-low-for-cyber-monday-2000649093</link>
            <guid>1369081</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cyber Monday is the last day of this week-long shopping spree, and gaming laptops have had some of the biggest price drops on Amazon. The <strong>Acer Nitro V</strong> has become one of the most popular gaming machines on the platform, and right now,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6136/"> it’s at a record low price of $799, down from its usual price of $949</a> – and this setup has an <strong>Intel Core i7-13620H processor, an Nvidia RTX 4050 GPU, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, an 15.6-inch Full HD screen (165Hz) and a 1TB Gen 4 SSD</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6136/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>RTX 4050 Offers AI-Enhanced Graphics</h2>
<p>The RTX 4050 GPU has 194 AI TOPS of processing power which lets it use DLSS 3.5 to boost frame rates and improve ray tracing quality at the same time. This technology can handle complicated lighting, shadows and reflections at speeds that would slow down older graphics cards and it means you can use ray tracing in games that support it without losing playability.</p>
<p>DLSS uses AI prediction to make more frames instead of traditional rendering which means you get higher frame rates while keeping the visual quality, which often looks sharper than the native resolution. This is important, especially at 1080p, where the RTX 4050 performs best, pushing most new games well above 60 fps with high settings on.</p>
<p>The <strong>165Hz refresh rate display</strong> updates almost three times faster than standard 60Hz screens. This makes motion smoother, which makes it easier to track enemies in competitive shooters and makes racing games more immersive. This refresh rate noticeably lowers motion blur and input lag and gives you an edge when your reflexes are most important. The 15.6-inch Full HD resolution makes text and details clear without needing the extra power that 1440p or 4K displays do and lets the RTX 4050 run smoothly and give you high frame rates in all of your games.</p>



<p>The <strong>Intel Core i7-13620H processor combines performance cores and efficiency cores</strong> in a hybrid architecture that handles both gaming and productivity workloads effectively. The six performance cores handle tough single-threaded tasks like game logic and physics calculations, while the four efficiency cores handle background tasks without taking resources away from your main apps. This design lets you stream gameplay to Twitch, record it locally, and use Discord all at the same time without the stutters and slowdowns that happen when processors don’t have this core separation.</p>
<p>The 16GB of DDR5 memory runs faster and more efficiently than DDR4 and reduces latency and improving frame times in memory-intensive games while speeding up application launches and file operations. You can upgrade the laptop’s memory from 16GB to 32GB using two DIMM slots. The 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD loads games and boots Windows in seconds instead of minutes and it has enough space for your operating system and a large game library, so you don’t have to keep uninstalling games to make room for new ones.</p>



<p>The dual-fan cooling system with its own exhaust vent <strong>keeps the temperature stable during long gaming sessions</strong> and stops the thermal throttling that happens after the first hour of play and makes performance drop. <em>NitroSense</em> software lets you keep an eye on temperatures and fan speeds in real time. It also lets you make your own fan curves that balance noise levels and cooling performance based on what you like. The Thunderbolt 4 port supports simultaneous power delivery, data transfer at 40 Gbps, and display output to external monitors, essentially providing three functions through a single cable connection.</p>
<p>This $799 price undercuts competing laptops with similar specs by $300 to $400, and it brings RTX 4050 performance down to pricing where you’d typically find GTX 1650 or RTX 3050 configurations with weaker processors and slower storage. The Cyber Monday discount expires tonight, making this the last opportunity to grab this configuration at record-low pricing before it returns to regular retail tomorrow.</p>

<p>We’re spotting plenty of deals, but one that caught our attention and deserves a mention is the impressive 29% drop on the Microsoft Surface Pro 2-in-1 laptop/tablet from last year. It usually sits at $1,200, but the current discount lets you grab one for just $850. Nab it for yourself, or gift it to someone who likes being productive on the go, this holiday season. Since multiple retailers are offering it for less, you might not be able to see the highlighted discount on it right away. If you can’t, click on the “See all buying options” button on the right, and scroll through the list to spot the drop. Add it to your cart, and the offer will apply automatically.</p>

<h2>Vibrant Screen, Plus Exceptional AI Capabilities</h2>
<p>Microsoft calls it a 2-in-1, but it’s not the type where the screen flips all the way around. You’re getting a 13-inch touchscreen display, and you can pair it with a detachable Surface Pro Flex Keyboard, which is sold separately, to convert it into a full-fledged laptop. The screen comes with a built-in kickstand that lets you prop it anywhere you like, whether it’s on a table or your bed for some late-night streaming.</p>
<p>The PixelSense Flow LCD display is bright, delivering sharp, vibrant, and clear visuals to enhance the quality of your favorite shows and movies. The screen is ultra-lightweight at just 1.97 pounds, making it easy to carry around with you on the go. Exceptional power comes from the 10-core Snapdragon X Plus processor, which provides solid performance for both everyday and demanding tasks. You’ll be able to browse, stream, work, and even edit photos/videos without experiencing significant slowdowns. Its powerful NPU is great for those looking forward to using some AI-focused features (real-time translation, noise-canceling, document retrieving, etc) on a regular basis, too.</p>



<p>The built-in 16GB RAM makes multitasking a breeze, whether you’re hopping between a bunch of tabs or trying to use multiple applications at the same time. Storing all your data won’t be a problem, either, thanks to the built-in 512GB SSD. It’s not massive, but still enough to house hundreds of photos and videos, tons of applications, and even a couple of games without feeling limited. Speaking of apps, you’re getting a whole bunch of both useful and popular pre-installed.</p>
<p>Of course, Copilot+ takes the experience even further. Apart from answering your basic questions or generating art from prompts, it provides assistance with retrieving documents, emails, and web pages on your PC. Video calls are made better with auto noise cancellation and distraction blurring. You’ll also enjoy real-time subtitles for 44 languages during video calls or streaming.</p>
<p>Despite all this power and efficiency, the battery life holds up well. On a single charge, you’re looking at around 14 hours of continuous usage, which means you can go an entire day without hunting for your charger or an outlet. There’s a lot more to like about this 2-in-1 machine, whether you’re planning to use it as a tablet or pair it with a keyboard for the ultimate laptop experience. There are multiple color options to choose from, as well, so you can pick the one that suits your aesthetics. Grab the discount sooner rather than later, as it’s not going to be around forever.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-boss-location-hush/</link>
            <guid>1369075</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fresh challenges await with the launch of Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, which includes several new bosses to defeat, and this guide has all the location details for Hush.</p>



<p>Hush is one of three bosses waiting to be encountered in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, alongside <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-boss-location-human-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Human Bill</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-boss-location-beach-brutus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beach Brutus</a>, with unique weapons and abilities available as rewards once defeated.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has all the boss location details for Hush in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 below, along with all the loot earned for defeating them.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-hush-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">Where to Find Hush in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>

<p><strong>Like the other bosses in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, Hush doesn’t have a single guaranteed spawn location, with several potential spawn points across the map instead.</strong></p>



<p>Though this can be frustrating if you’re on the hunt for a specific boss, like Hush, and the available loot, it keeps things fresh in every Fortnite match and prevents a flood of players dropping on the same guaranteed spawn location for an all-out brawl to defeat the boss and claim the loot.</p>



<p>Here’s a list of potential Hush boss locations in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ripped Tides</li>



<li>Classified Canyon</li>



<li>Painted Palms</li>



<li>South of Paws Inn</li>



<li>Sunset Falls</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for Hush, the best landing spot is Painted Palms, as this is a potential spawn location for all three bosses. Additionally, it’s near two other spawn points, so there’s quick rotation if your first point of call doesn’t yield the results you’re looking for.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-hush-loot-drops-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">All Hush Loot Drops in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<p><strong>Hush has a decent crop of valuable loot when defeated in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, including the ability to transform into the boss and benefit from increased Health and Shields.</strong></p>



<p>Alongside those boosts, transforming into Hush unlocks the Kit In ability, which is used to Zero Point Dash. With this ability, traversal in combat, or for general movement across the map, becomes much faster.</p>



<p>In terms of weapon, defeating Hish drops Hush’s Deadeye Assault Rifle, a Mythic version of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapon available elsewhere in the map</a> with increased headshot damage, and low recoil. This makes picking enemies off at mid-to-long range much easier and can be a turning point in the battle.</p>



<p>Like the other bosses, defeating Hush also drops a Chug Jug, which can be used to restore Health and Shields. With a boost to both when you turn into the boss, it’s another invaluable piece of kit.</p>

                <p>Several months have passed since the release of Silent Hill F, and thanks to online chatter, memes, and an active community, the survival-horror game is still trending. That's according to Silent Hill series producer Motoi Okamoto and writer Ryukishi07, who recently spoke about how Silent Hill F continues to stay in the spotlight.</p><p>"Recently, discourse about games is being consumed at a rapid pace," Okamoto said to <a href="https://dengekionline.com/article/202511/57863" rel="nofollow ">Dengeki Online</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/silent-hill-fs-success-was-helped-greatly-by-memes-fanart-and-theories-it-inspired-devs-say-a-new-approach-to-writing-characters-unlocked-potential-for-virality/" rel="nofollow ">Automaton</a>), . "But games that do get talked about even months after release are the ones that are fun to theorize about and analyze, and they usually get a lot of character fan art. From my experience, titles which are able to show us that kind of hype tend to live on for longer."</p>

<p>Ryukishi07 added that games that resonate with players also tend to have more than just 15 minutes of fame. "That’s why protagonists of such games tend to be on the less-talkative side, so players can immerse themselves in the game," Ryukishi07 said, explaining that he hopes that Silent Hill F will show just how flexible the franchise is at expressing itself, rather than being a template for future games to follow.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-update-adds-new-casual-difficulty-skip-feature-for-new-game-plus/1100-6536180/">A new update for Silent Hill f recently rolled out</a>, and it added a new Casual difficulty mode to the game. Several other changes were made to the game, including a quicker stamina recharge and fewer enemies in certain sections. Silent Hill F has been nominated for two awards at this year's The Game Awards show--Best Narrative and Best Audio Design--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-silent-hill-franchise-sees-big-discounts-for-black-friday/1100-6536109/">and you can save $20 on it for Cyber Monday</a>.</p><p>"With its brilliant writing, haunting atmosphere, well-designed gameplay, and spectacular visuals, Silent Hill f sets a new benchmark for the Silent Hill series," Jessica Cogswell wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-f-review-spirited-away/1900-6418411/">Silent Hill F review</a>.</p>

<p>It's Tomba time (again)</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Limited Run Games <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-limited-run-games-showcase-2024-every-switch-announcement-and-physical">announced</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomba_2_the_evil_swine_return_special_edition">Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return Special Edition</a> way back in June 2024, and while a good chunk of time has passed us by since then (including a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/08/poll-tomba-special-edition-is-out-but-have-you-been-able-to-play-the-thing-on-switch">rather buggy</a> release of its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomba_special_edition">platforming predecessor</a>), the release date is almost upon us!</p>
<p>Tomba 2 will arrive on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tomba-2-the-evil-swine-return-special-edition-switch/">Switch eShop</a> on <strong>15th December</strong> for <strong>$19.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent), marking the first time that the 3D PlayStation platformer has been available on Nintendo systems.</p>
<p>For those who didn't try this one out in the early 2000s, Tomba 2 took the same jungle platforming precedent as the first game in the series, but moved things into the wonderful world of 3D. With the now-chiselled Tomba given an extra dimension to play with, the game packed in new weapons and power-up costumes on top of a huge number of fresh missions and events.</p>
<p>This Switch 'Special Edition' throws in a museum gallery mode, <em>and</em> the chance to rewind and save at any time, so while the polygonal visuals remain, there are at least some ways to get around the game's less favourable nostalgic elements.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the new release's key features and a handful of screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>• Gorgeous 3D graphics that instantly transport you to Tomba's world<br>
• All new weapons, items and costumes to collect and use against the Evil Pigs<br>
• A massive 137 different missions to complete<br>
• New exclusive features such as rewind and save anywhere<br>
• A museum filled with rare artwork and much more</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the original Tomba would go on to be a perfectly acceptable slice of throwback platforming on Switch, it launched in such a state that some of us found it essentially unplayable on the hybrid console. Let's hope that things get off to a smoother start with its sequel.</p>

            <p>Right, so. There's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>, the official Oblivion remaster which released earlier this year. There's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a>, the fan-made Oblivion remake mod which still currently looks due out relatively soonish, despite its release window having been a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivions-2025-release-goal-is-pointless-and-unachievable-claims-longtime-dev-accuses-two-leads-of-rushing-the-mod-out">source of drama a few months ago</a>.

Simple. The last one of those has just released a fresh teaser.</p>

<p>Despite having already released one of its regions as a very well-received and popular forerunner - that'd be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> map expansion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyrim-beyond-bruma-mod-released">Beyond Skyrim: Bruma</a> - the same team's full version of Cyrodiil doesn't look as far along in the development process as Skyblivion. That said, is devs have still been sharing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ar__IhI5cs">regular progress updates</a> over the past couple of years. Their latest is a teaser of the mod's questline surrounding Anvil, with getting the gold coast city up and running having been a key focus of their work this year.</p>
<p>What's afoot in the picturesque southern port town? Well, two important-sounding dudes are having a chat about birds in front of Anvil's count. One of them is called Ramon and the other's Anvil's viscount. The former's concerned about a mysterious idealist/criminal dubbed The Wren, who's threatening to throw a spanner into the works of the trade which keeps Anvil running. There's also some courtly bickering going on about succession, with debate over whether a lad named Corvinus, seemingly the viscount's son, is fit to rule the city and deal with its fowl predicament.</p><p>As that chat plays out, the modders show off a bunch of shots in and around their version of Anvil. It looks lovely, if suffering from the unavoidable limitation of looking more like Skyrim in a new hat than a game built from scratch would. The Discord post accompanying the teaser also offers an intro to one of the side quests Anvil'll offer. It's about you becoming an entrepreneurial child's minion.</p>
<p>"The city of Anvil is home to many up-and-coming business dealers, though some fall further outside the norms than others," the modders' blurb for this quest reads. "Meet the future saltwater business owner; Jinol! He has plans for creating a business run and owned by the children of Anvil and he is looking for any would-be business partners passing through Anvil to help him in this innovative endeavour." God, imagine what the Elder Scrolls equivalent of those terrible CEO grind-themed podcasts would be.</p>
<p>The Beyond Skyrim lot plan to show off more during an Anvil stream set to take place on their YouTube channel on December 6th, and they're keen to recruit folks for the following roles: "Animators, writers, editors, navmeshers, concept artists, 3D artists, experienced exterior landscapers, dungeon designers, creation kit implementers, sound effects artists, and quality assurance".</p>
<p>By the looks of their last update, the areas which include Leyawiin, Bravil, Cheydinhal, and the Imperial City all have plenty of work that needs doing once Anvil's sorted. I'm intrigued by the idea of returning to Cyrodiil down the line for something that isn't trying to repackage TES IV and have really dug the time I've spent with their Bruma mod, so I'll be keeping an eye on the Beyond Skyrim folks' progress.</p>

            <guid>1369054</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The biggest sale of the year is coming to an end, but with a bang. Cyber Monday is here, offering one last chance to stock up on the items you missed grabbing during Black Friday. Most of the hefty discounts we saw during Black Friday are still available, but the deals bid adieu tonight. Whether you’re after a multi-port charger or are finally ready to grab a 100-inch TV to enjoy better movie nights during the holidays, today is your day to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6128/">Those after a reliable storage solution for their Xbox Series X|S should consider grabbing the Seagate 2TB SSD, which is going for 29% off on Amazon.</a> It normally retails for $260, but the current deal drops the price to $185. Both Prime and non-Prime members will also enjoy free delivery with their orders, so there are no extra costs to worry about. Be sure to grab it quick, as the retailer has marked the discount as a fast-selling one. With this speed, it might not even be around after just a couple of hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6128/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Capacity, No Compromises on Performance</h2>
<p>No one likes deleting old titles to make room for the latest releases. This SSD gets you a massive 2TB storage capacity, which is enough to house a bunch of games that won’t squeeze into your console’s internal storage. It’s the sweet spot for most casual gamers who are looking to enjoy fresh releases without feeling limited. There’s a 1TB, plus 4TB version of the SSD too, going for $121 and $380, respectively.</p>
<p>The SSD is designed in partnership with Xbox. It uses the Velocity Architecture and lets you play Xbox Series X|S games directly from the expansion card without sacrificing graphics, latency, frame rates, or load times. Thousands of Original Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One games offer the exact same experience as the console’s internal SSD, so you won’t feel a difference when you switch between them. You’ll just have way more space, while still enjoying ultra-fast load times and stunning visuals for a truly immersive experience. Additionally, Quick resume support means you can hop between multiple titles from the internal SSD or the expansion card within seconds, without those annoying wait times that kill the momentum.</p>



<p>The setup is plug-and-play. Start by locating the storage expansion slot on the back of your console. Remove the protective cover from the card, and insert it into the slot. Once it clicks into place, you’ll know it’s ready to use. The console will recognize the card and display a notification confirming it. Follow the on-screen instructions to proceed. You can also head to your console’s Settings, then choose System &gt; Storage devices to verify the installation. Once everything is set, start playing without feeling limited by storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6128/">Amazon throws in a 3-year limited warranty with your purchase, which provides some extra peace of mind.</a> If anything goes wrong, the retailer will replace or repair your expansion card. All things considered, if you’re looking to game better without storage issues coming in your way this holiday season, now is a great time to make the move. This Cyber Monday deal brings the price down of this 2TB expansion card by $75, letting you grab it for $185. If it’s more than you need, consider the 1TB option. Those looking for even more space can grab the 4TB version. Both of these are also discounted. Just make sure to get your orders in fast, because Cyber Monday wraps up tonight.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 Beach Brutus Boss Location—Where to Find & All Loot]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-boss-location-beach-brutus/</link>
            <guid>1369051</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A fresh beginning has occurred in Fortnite with the launch of Chapter 7 Season 1, which brings with it a new map and new bosses to defeat, and this guide has all the location details on where to find Beach Brutus.</p>



<p>Beach Brutus is one of three bosses waiting to be encountered on the Fortnite map, alongside the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-boss-location-human-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Human Bill</a>, and offers unique rewards that can turn the tide in any match, so he’s well worth hunting down.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming is here to help you track down the boss location, along with details on the loot dropped once Beach Brutus has been defeated.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-beach-brutus-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">Where to Find Beach Brutus in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s go to the beach. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Like the other bosses in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, there isn’t a single location guaranteed to have Beach Brutus waiting. Instead, there are several spawn points across the map.</strong></p>



<p>While it can be frustrating to have rotating bosses with a list of several spawn locations, it adds additional variety to each Fortnite map. Additionally, Beach Brutus is possibly the easiest to find, as the majority of the spawn points are located near each other.</p>



<p>Here’s a list of where Beach Brutus can be encountered in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ripped Tides</li>



<li>Classified Canyon</li>



<li>Painted Palms</li>



<li>Paws Inn (East of Wonkeeland)</li>



<li>Sunset Falls (Southeast of Wonkeeland)</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for Beach Brutus, Painted Palms is a good place to start as he is often found here, and other spawn locations near Paws Inn and Sunset Falls are not too far away. However, he’s often found in Ripped Tides and Classified Canyon, both of which are popular initial landing locations, so competition to defeat him can be fierce.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-beach-brutus-loot-drops-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">All Beach Brutus Loot Drops in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<p><strong>Beach Brutus drops a host of valuable loot when defeated in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, including the ability to transform into the boss.</strong></p>



<p>Transforming into Beach Brutus provides a boost to maximum Health and Shields, along with a special ability in the Beach Brutus Kit that allows you to regenerate shields without needing to consume Shield Potions, which provides a huge boost in any combat situation, and you can also spawn Henchmen to assist in battle.</p>



<p>The downside, however, is that transforming into a boss like Beach Brutus will permanently mark your location to nearby players in a more precise manner than Medallions have done in previous Chapters and Seasons.</p>



<p>In terms of weapons, Beach Brutus drops The Brutus’ Twin Hammer Shotguns, a Mythic weapon that has a much faster reload speed than the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">non-Mythic variant</a>. While they have a limited range, they are extremely lethal and can either be fired at the same time, or individually.</p>



<p>Finally, defeating Beach Brutus will also drop a Chug Jug, a valuable item that restores both Health and Shields—and it’s even more useful with the boosted amounts you’ll receive of both when transformed into the boss.</p>

<p>If you know the name Ron Gilbert, it’s probably for his decades of work on classic point-and-click adventure games like <i>Maniac Mansion</i>, <i>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</i>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/review-return-to-monkey-island-is-must-play-point-and-click-brilliance/">the Monkey Island series</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/04/thimbleweed-park-review-nostalgic-to-a-fault/"><i>Thimbleweed Park</i></a>. Given that pedigree, October’s release of the Gilbert-designed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3773590/Death_by_Scrolling/"><i>Death by Scrolling</i></a>—a rogue-lite action-survival pseudo-shoot-em-up—might have come as a bit of a surprise.</p>
<p>In an interview from his New Zealand home, though, Gilbert noted that his catalog also includes some reflex-based games—<a href="https://www.backyardsports.com/">Humungous Entertainment’s Backyard Sports titles</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/07/its-funny-because-its-poop-ars-reviews-deathspank/">2010’s <em>Deathspank</em></a>, for instance. And Gilbert said his return to action-oriented game design today stemmed from his love for modern classics like <i>Binding of Isaac</i>, <i>Nuclear Throne</i>, and <i>Dead Cells</i>.</p>
<p>“I mean, I’m certainly mostly known for adventure games, and I have done other stuff, [but] it probably is a little bit of a departure for me,” he told Ars. “While I do enjoy playing narrative games as well, it’s not the only thing I enjoy, and just the idea of making one of these kind of started out as a whim.”</p>
<h2>Gilbert’s lost RPG</h2>
<p>After spending years focused on adventure game development with 2017’s <i>Thimbleweed Park</i> and then 2022’s <i>Return to Monkey Island</i>, Gilbert <a href="https://www.grumpygamer.com/dbs_history/">said</a> that he was “thinking about something new” for his next game project. But the first “new” idea he pursued wasn’t <i>Death by Scrolling</i>, but what he told Ars was “this vision for this kind of large, open world-type RPG” in the vein of <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>.</p>
<p>After hiring an artist and designer and spending roughly a year tinkering with that idea, though, Gilbert said he eventually realized his three-person team was never going to be able to realize his grand vision. “I just [didn’t] have the money or the time to build a big open-world game like that,” he said. “You know, it’s either a passion project you spent 10 years on, or you just need a bunch of money to be able to hire people and resources.”</p>
<p>And Gilbert said that securing that “bunch of money” to build out a top-down action-RPG in a reasonable time frame proved harder than he expected. After pitching the project around the industry, he found that “the deals that publishers were offering were just horrible,” a problem he blames in large part on the genre he was focusing on.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>“Doing a pixelated old-school Zelda thing isn’t the big, hot item, so publishers look at us, and they didn’t look at it as ‘we’re gonna make $100 million and it’s worth investing in,’” he said. “The amount of money they’re willing to put up and the deals they were offering just made absolutely no sense to me to go do this.”</p>
<figure>
    <div>
            <p>
              While crowdfunding helped <em>Thimbleweed Park</em> years ago, Gilbert says Kickstarter is “basically dead these days as a way of funding games.”

  </div>

      </figure>

<p>For point-and-click adventure <i>Thimbleweed Park</i>, Gilbert got around a similar problem in part by going directly to fans of the genre, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thimbleweedpark/thimbleweed-park-a-new-classic-point-and-click-adv">raising $600,000 of a $375,000 goal via crowdfunding</a>. But even then, Gilbert said that private investors needed to provide half of the game’s final budget to get it over the finish line. And while Gilbert said he’d love to revisit the world of <i>Thimbleweed Park</i>, “I just don’t know where I’d ever get the money. It’s tougher than ever in some ways… Kickstarter is basically dead these days as a way of funding games.”</p>
<p>Compared to the start of his career, Gilbert said that today’s big-name publishers “are very analytics-driven. The big companies, it’s like they just have formulas that they apply to games to try to figure out how much money they could make, and I think that just in the end you end up giving a whole lot of games that look exactly the same as last year’s games, because that makes some money.</p>
<p>“When we were starting out, we couldn’t do that because we didn’t know what made this money, so it was, yeah, it was a lot more experimenting,” he continued. “I think that’s why I really enjoy the indie game market because it’s kind of free of a lot of that stuff that big publishers bring to it, and there’s a lot more creativity and you know, strangeness, and bizarreness.”</p>

<h2>Run for it</h2>
<p>After a period where Gilbert said he “was kind of getting a little down” about the failure of his action-RPG project, he thought about circling back to a funny little prototype he developed as part of a 2019 game design meet-up organized by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-cook-8086973/">Spry Fox’s Daniel Cook</a>. That prototype—initially simply called “Runner”—focused on outrunning the bottom of a continually scrolling screen, picking up ammo-limited weapons to fend off enemies as you did.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>While the prototype initially required players to aim at those encroaching enemies as they ran, Gilbert said that the design “felt like cognitive overload.” So he switched to an automatic aiming and firing system, an idea he says was part of the prototype long before it became popularized by games like <i>Vampire Survivors</i>. And while Gilbert said he enjoyed <i>Vampire Survivors</i>, he added that the game’s style was “a little too much ‘ADHD’ for me. I look at those games and it’s like, wow, I feel like I’m playing a slot machine at some level. The flashing and upgrades and this and that… it’s a little too much.”</p>

      The 2019 “Runner” prototype that would eventually become <em>Death by Scrolling.</em>

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>But Gilbert said his less frenetic “Runner” prototype “just turned out to be a lot of fun, and I just played it all the time… It was really fun for groups of people to play, because one person will play and other people would kind of be laughing and cheering as you, you know, escape danger at the nick of time.”</p>
<p>Gilbert would end up using much of the art from his scrapped RPG project to help flesh out the “Runner” prototype into what would eventually become <i>Death by Scrolling. </i>But even late in the game’s development, Gilbert said the game was missing a unifying theme. “There was no reason initially for why you were doing any of this. You were just running, you know?”</p>
<p>That issue didn’t get solved until the last six months of development, when Gilbert hit on the idea of running through a repeating purgatory and evading Death, in the form of a grim reaper that regularly emerges to mercilessly hunt you down. While you can use weapons to temporarily stun Death, there’s no way to completely stop his relentless pursuit before the end of a stage.</p>

  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>“Because he can’t be killed and because he’s an instant kill for you, it’s a very unique thing you really kinda need to avoid,” Gilbert said. “You’re running along, getting gold, gaining gems, and then, boom, you hear that [music], and Death is on the screen, and you kind of panic for a moment until you orient yourself and figure out where he is and where he’s coming from.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h2>Is anyone reading this?</h2>
<p>After spending so much of his career on slow-burn adventure games, Gilbert admitted there were special challenges to writing for an action game—especially one where the player is repeating the same basic loop over and over. “It’s a lot harder because you find very quickly that a lot of players just don’t care about your story, right? They’re there to run, they’re there to shoot stuff… You kind of watch them play, and they’re just kind of clicking by the dialogue so fast that they don’t even see it.”</p>
<p>Surprisingly, though, Gilbert said he’s seen that skip-the-story behavior among adventure game players, too. “Even in <i>Thimbleweed Park </i>and <i>Monkey Island</i>, people still kind of pound through the dialogue,” he said. “I think if they think they know what they need to do, they just wanna skip through the dialogue really fast.”</p>
<p>As a writer, Gilbert said it’s “frustrating” to see players doing the equivalent of “sitting down to watch a movie and just fast forwarding through everything except the action parts.” In the end, though, he said, a game developer has to accept that not everyone is playing for the same reasons.</p>

<p>“There’s a certain percentage of people who will follow the story and enjoy it, and that’s OK,” he said. “And everyone else, if they skip the story, it’s got to be OK. You need to make sure you don’t embed things deep in the story that are critical for them to understand. It’s a little bit like really treating the story as truly optional.”</p>
<p>Those who do pay attention to the story in <i>Death by Scrolling</i> will come across what Gilbert said he hoped was a less-than-subtle critique of the capitalist system. That critique is embedded in the gameplay systems, which require you to collect more and more gold—and not just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coins_for_the_dead">two pennies on your eyes</a>—to pay a newly profit-focused River Styx ferryman that has been acquired by Purgatory Inc.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>“It’s purgatory taken over by investment bankers,” Gilbert said of the conceit. “I think a lot of it is looking at the world today and realizing capitalism has just taken over, and it really is the thing that’s causing the most pain for people. I just wanted to really kind of drive that point in the game, in a kind of humorous, sarcastic way, that this capitalism is not good.”</p>
<p>While Gilbert said he’s always harbored these kinds of anti-capitalist feelings “at some level,” he said that “certainly recent events and recent things have gotten me more and more jumping on the ‘Eat the Rich’ bandwagon.” Though he didn’t detail which “recent events” drove that realization, he did say that “billionaires and all this stuff… I think are just causing more harm than good.”</p>

<h2>Is the point-and-click adventure doomed?</h2>
<p>Despite his history with point-and-click adventures, and the relative success of <i>Thimbleweed Park</i> less than 10 years ago, Gilbert says he isn’t interested in returning to the format popularized by LucasArts’ classic SCUMM Engine games. That style of “use verb on noun” gameplay is now comparable to a black-and-white silent movie, he said, and will feel similarly&nbsp; dated to everything but a niche of aging, nostalgic players.</p>
<p>“You do get some younger people that do kind of enjoy those games, but I think it’s one of those things that when we’re all dead, it probably won’t be the kind of thing that survives,” he said.</p>
<figure>
    <div>
            <p>
              Gilbert says modern games like <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> show a new direction for adventure games without the point-and-click interface.

<p>But while the point-and-click interface might be getting long in the tooth, Gilbert said he’s more optimistic about the future of adventure games in general. He points to recent titles like <i>Blue Prince </i>and <i>Lorelai and the Laser Eyes</i> as examples of how clever designers can create narrative-infused puzzles using modern techniques and interfaces. “I think games like that are kind of the future for adventure games,” he said.</p>
<p>If corporate owner Disney ever gave him another chance to return to the Monkey Island franchise, Gilbert said he’d like to emulate those kinds of games by having players “go around in a true 3D world, rather than as a 2D point-and-click game… I don’t really know how you would do the puzzle solving in [that] way, and so that’s very interesting to me, to be able to kind of attack that problem of doing it in a 3D world.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>After what he said was a mixed reception to the gameplay changes in <i>Return to Monkey Island</i>, though, Gilbert allowed that franchise fans might not be eager for an even greater departure from tradition. “Maybe <i>Monkey Island</i> isn’t the right game to do as an adventure game in a 3D world, because there are a lot of expectations that come with it,” he said. “I mean if I was to do that, you just ruffle even more feathers, right? There’s more people that are very attached to <i>Monkey Island</i>, but more in its classic sense.”</p>
<p>Looking over his decades-long career, though, Gilbert also noted that the skills needed to promote a new game today are very different from those he used in the 1980s. “Back then, there were a handful of print magazines, and there were a bunch of reporters, and you had sent out press releases… That’s just not the way it works today,” he said. Now, the rise of game streamers and regular YouTube game development updates has forced game makers to be good on camera, much like MTV did for a generation of musicians, Gilbert said.</p>
<p>“The [developers] that are successful are not necessarily the good ones, but the good ones that also present well on YouTube,” he said. “And you know, I think that’s kind of a problem, that’s a gate now… In some ways, I think it’s too bad because as a developer, you have to be a performer. And I’m not a performer, right? If I was making movies, I would be a director, not an actor.”</p>
