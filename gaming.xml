            <p>A full-on remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a> 2 was "technically on the road map" to follow the original Knights of the Old Republic remake which has been in development for the past few years. Well, that's at least the plan LucasFilm Games and co had as of March this year, with the KOTOR 2 remake's current status looking to be up in the air.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This is according to court documents from earlier this year reported on by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/kotor-ii-restored-content-mod-dlc-switch-killed-disney">Game File</a> (paywalled) via <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-kotor-old-republic-2-remake-kotor-kotor2-lucasfilm-leak-court-docs-2000651434">Kotaku</a>. The docs, which saw Lucasfilm Games vice president Douglas Reilly mention the KOTOR 2 remake in some depositions, relate to a false advertising lawsuit filed against the licensor and Aspyr over failing to deliver on integrating fan-made mod <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=485537937">The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification</a> (TSLRCM) into KOTOR 2's Nintendo Switch port, as previously promised. Said lawsuit's since been settled.</p>
<p>As part of talking about that, Reilly revealed these plans for a full KOTOR 2 remake, confirming that it was codenamed Project Juliet. "Juliet was the code name for a project where we were going to do a full remake of KOTOR 2 with modern art, modern gameplay, you know, keep the story and the characters and the general—the general content of KOTOR 2, but remake it for modern hardware and modern machines with updated graphics and all those kinds of things," he said. "It was something we were discussing with Aspyr."</p>
<p>Reilly described this KOTOR 2 remake as being "technically on the roadmap" to come out after the remake of the first game, and confirmed the plan was for it to remake the cut content included in the TSLRCM mod. That was the state of play as of these depositions in March. As for that status of the KOTOR 2 remake right now, Game File's Stephen Totilo reports having had radio silence in response to reaching out about where it's currently at.</p><p>To be fair, it'd be weird for a KOTOR 2 remake to be an open book, given the messy and often worryingly silent development path the remake of the first Knights of the Old Republic has endured thus far. Announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-announced">back in 2021</a>, it's since reportedly been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-delayed-indefinitely">delayed indefinitely</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-doesnt-look-good-for-the-kotor-remake-again-as-reports-claim-its-not-being-worked-on-by-any-studio">feared to be cancelled</a>, then was being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-worry-at-least-two-people-are-reportedly-still-working-on-that-kotor-remake">worked on by at least two people</a>. Saber Interactive being sold off by Embracer Group <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-release-left-in-limbo-by-saber-interactive-sale">cast fresh doubt</a> over the game, and the most recent update was Saber's CEO <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-devs-insist-the-game-is-alive-and-well-after-their-split-from-embracer">declaring it "alive and well"</a> last April.</p>
<p>The court docs reveal's a good start, KOTOR 2 remake, but you've got a long way to go to catch up. Assuming you've not quietly gone the way of the dodo since March.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/i-am-looking-forward-to-finally-moving-on-indie-dev-tonda-ros-is-still-in-his-blue-prince-era</link>
            <guid>1376872</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Tonda Ros, the creator of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/blue-prince">Blue Prince</a>, is nearing the end of a triumphant year. His game released to critical acclaim and, more recently, accolades. It won Best Indie Game at the Golden Joystick Awards and was nominated for Game of the Year and Best Storytelling. And it’s been nominated for Best Independent Game and Best Debut Indie Game at The Game Awards 2025. A recent collaboration with iam8bit has resulted in Blue Prince merch — a dream for any small indie title. And Ros is on the cusp of finishing and releasing the final update to Blue Prince, which will include a color assist mode, control remapping, the long-awaited minigame Dirigiblocks, and (my personal favorite change) the addition of a cat to Mount Holly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I spoke to Ros last month, after the Golden Joystick nominations had taken place but before The Game Awards list was out. Like many of my colleagues, my brain had been eaten alive by Blue Prince earlier this year when I played it ahead of launch. I’ve ruined a perfectly good journal scribbling attempted puzzle solutions and wild conspiracy theories about what’s happening in Mount Holly, and how I might peel it apart like an egg to get at whatever was inside. I was thrilled beyond measure at Blue Prince’s fantastic victory lap of a final puzzle, but also driven absolutely bonkers by the fact that neither it nor any other puzzle in the game sufficiently answers every single last question Blue Prince asks. Like Lady Clara, I was left for months wondering, Does It Never End?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tonda Ros still won’t tell me whether it does or not. For me, it has — I’ve put down Blue Prince happy with my experience. For Ros personally, Blue Prince has not yet ended. But it will, eventually. He has many more, very different adventures ahead of him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the transcript of our full interview, very lightly edited for length and clarity. Though we don’t spoil any of Blue Prince outright, we do nod to some of the late-game themes throughout our conversation, so proceed at your own risk:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I loved your game. Thank you for eating away over 100 hours of my life earlier this year.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Tonda Ros:</strong> I'll say thanks. And I apologize too. I knew specifically for press that it would be like... there's so many games to cover, right? So it's always scary to give someone a very big meal because you are taking away some attention inadvertently from others, which kind of... I don't know. That's a weird thing to try to wrap your head around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: It's the problem of the universe, right? I mean, there's too much art. There's too many things. There's too many books I want to read, too many games I want to play.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ros:</strong> I know. It's like pick two mediums, and the rest you're going to have to be content with casually enjoying and appreciating it. But to really, really appreciate a medium, there's too much content to really sink your teeth in. So I think you have to pick at least two at a time and maybe throughout your life, you can have your book era and then your game era. But yeah, it's something I struggle with too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I wanted to ask you what you were up to now. This thing took eight years of your life, and it's out now and you don't need to constantly be patching things or whatever. What era are you in? What are you doing?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ros:</strong> I mean, honestly, it's still the Blue Prince era. I was always told there's a year of upkeep, even if you're fully done at the time of launch. And I was like, "Okay." I had been told that by enough people that I appreciated that that was true, even though I didn't really understand. But it is definitely consuming everything. I guess I care about every single little detail, which is I wish I could just let go. Iam8bit is releasing some cool products based on Blue Prince. So much of my time is just spent hyper-fixating on the details of the replica of the key and stuff to try to make sure it's right. So a whole bunch of stuff like that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then we just did the Mac port, so that was taking a lot of my time. I'm in there playtesting that nonstop to try to make sure that that is as accurate to the experience as it possibly can be. And likewise as we're working on various updates as they go. So I mean honestly, even though Blue Prince is out, I'm still fully focused on that, and that's not even counting the final Blue Prince update, which has been tied up in all these other things that have consumed me, we'll say. I'm probably still another year out from being onto my next era, but I am looking forward to finally moving on.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Blue Prince Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: It feels like there's something weirdly poetic here about a game that is at least in part about this obsession and not quite being able to put the mystery down. We're all trying to decide if all the secrets have been found, and you have not been able to put down the game either for different reasons.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ros:</strong> No, I was living it. I think my experience making it is it pretty much echoes the player's journey because in the beginning the project was very grockable. I could fathom the scope of it very easily and then throughout the whole project, the intricate web of systems and interconnected things just spiraled out of control. And I think near the end, I was as lost as anyone was, and I was like, "I think at some point I just have to release this because this is starting to get away from me."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I often joke that the house has a mind of its own. So even if I'm trying to implement new features or fix some quirks of the house, the house just won't let me. And at a certain point, I was just like, "I'm just going to have to respect what Mt. Holly is." And if she won't let me do something, I'm just going to be like, "Okay, that's the way you want to be, I'm just going to let you exist as an entity unto yourself." And I think that was it getting out of- it's spiraling out of control is just me saying, "This will probably just consume the rest of my life if I don't arbitrarily stop this at some point."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What do you make of the reaction to it? I mean it's obviously been very positive, but I feel like Blue Prince has taken off in a way that games of this genre don't normally get to see.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ros:</strong> Yeah, yeah. Super crazy. I would love to try to figure out- If I could separate myself from my own work, it's like, what set of circumstances has led to this? Because I think a lot of things in life, it's like the right place, the right time, the right appetite. There was a good window there where they just wanted to get into something like this that they hadn't. And that's not to say there weren't games like this, but they just for whatever reason hadn't come across their plate before. So I think for a lot of people it was even more of a fresh experience than it should have been. If maybe they had been playing a lot of the games in the genre, you could identify that this isn't super crazy. Maybe meshed together, it was pretty original. But yeah, I had always considered it pretty niche. In playtesting, I had a pretty good sense of the type of people that would like it. And I also knew that not all puzzle fans will like it because the strategy and very difficult board game aspect, it's not a game that's easy at all. And so I thought that that would probably further limit the audience. So yeah, to see the reception and to see it blow up has just been... I just feel really lucky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I think the one criticism I see come up over and over are the people who are really into the puzzles but who just bristle against the rogue-like elements or the randomness of them, especially when you know the answer to a puzzle, and you just need that specific room and you just can't get it. What do you make of that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ros:</strong> I knew that was coming, and that's why I'm surprised the game was as popular as it was given that, because I had seen that in play testing. And I knew that there was some people that they just have to have more control, and it's hard for them to let go a little bit of the control and be in a system. But I just wanted to make a game the way I like it. And I like when I'm in a system, even if it's a hostile system, part of the fun is figuring out a way to tame the beast and to navigate around those challenges. And it is very board game-coded in that way. And a lot of times in board games you're going to be in situations where you're going to have to work with the cards that you do draw to try to create a strategy. And that's fun with a lot of my favorite types of board games, is you have to use these things to develop a strategy on your own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So there's a level of player input and creativity, which I just absolutely love, but I don't think that's for everyone and certainly a lot of people from the puzzle community. I think puzzle games in general have historically been linear experiences, and so a big departure like this is going to ruffle some traditional feathers for sure.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: There were some discussions of player-antagonistic design this year around Blue Prince and some other games too, about what is the enjoyment and joy you get out of playing something that it feels like it's constantly fighting you in some way.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ros:</strong> Yeah. I think that's something that's largely been ironed out of a lot of games. I mean, I think if you at least go back to the '80s and '90s, things were a lot more, let's say, less smooth and less- more friction and more failure. Certainly in the game over era, just getting game overs and restarting was just a core component. And a lot of things were Ghosts 'n Goblins. We're just going to replay this, we're going to replay this. We're just going to get better and better with our skill. And obviously I think as people optimized player journey, I think the emphasis started being about polishing and making the player journey a lot less turbulent. And that's certainly not the types of games I like. I like to get challenged both mechanically but also challenged in terms of my own taste. Maybe if I'm used to playing a certain type of game, I'm totally okay with someone subverting genre norms or technical things to try something new even if it fails. I think it's cool to see someone try something that's not the default line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I feel like I know the answer to this already, but I got to ask. So to your knowledge, have players found everything? Is there anything left? Does it never end?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ros:</strong> I don't think I'm ever going to answer that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Yeah. I had to try.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ros:</strong> I think people are suspicious that I am reluctant to answer that. All I can say is that it's designed for a single player to be able to experience everything in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I feel like if you've gotten deep enough into Blue Prince, it's pretty easy to understand why you don't want to answer that question.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ros:</strong> Yep, yep. And it's probably just my personality type. I feel like I probably wouldn't want to answer that question for anything I make because answering that question definitively will close a bit of the magic off in some ways, I think. I think that as long as there's a chance that there's more to discover, then there will be the hope of players or let's say the exploration. It's like in the frontier. When there's unexplored territory, then adventurers can still dream. Even if they never go to those territories, there's still the imagination of what exists in the woods that have never been explored. And then with Google Maps and stuff, and now the land masses are all explored. Some of that magic and imagination is at least curbed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: This is maybe some of the same question. But would you ever consider adding more to Blue Prince? I mean, you said this is going to be the final update that you're working on. Is that just totally against the spirit of it?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ros:</strong> Yeah, I mean, I don't know the spirit of it, but for me, I do love complete games. And I do love when something is definitively done. So I had tried my best to get everything into the game at launch because that was something I just really wanted. I didn't want to eternally be updating this. Well, all I can say is that there is a definitive amount of stuff in the game that is planned, and some of it had to get sacrificed in order to increase stability and to work on some of the functioning systems to have a smoother experience for everyone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were a couple cinematics and cutscenes that were in the process of being created, but I was just like, "If I focus on these, I'm not going to be able to focus on any of the remaining bugs or gameplay stuff." And that's just a fact of it being my very first game and being such a small team of just me and a few people helping me. That I had to understand my own limitations and being like, okay, even though artistically I wish this could be a fully complete experience at launch and get all these cutscenes and gameplay elements, but I did manage to get everything gameplay-wise into the game with the exception of one arcade game, which was just, it's just a standalone mini-game and it really- It's completely separate from the rest of Blue Prince.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So that was an easy one to sequester off because it's like this was just like, I don't even know why I wanted to do a mini-game within a game for my very first game. But some of these ideas I get, I'm just like, "Oh, I really would love to try this." And at some point, it had woven itself too much in the thread for me to completely remove it, at least with the time I had.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When there's unexplored territory, then adventurers can still dream. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What about other language translations? I'm obviously very aware of the fact that translating this is a minefield because of the way the puzzles work, but I know that that was one of the things that was criticized about it at launch, is that there's really no way to play it if you don't speak English.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ros: </strong>And I think how difficult it is really appeals to me because it's almost like a historic undertaking of localization, and it appeals to me because I feel like it would be such a cool challenge to do. Now, probably the number of localizers and the number of specific- It's not even just localizers or translators. You actually need people from these individual cultures that excel in wordplay. And so getting together this dream team and tackling this is like, it's something I've thought a lot about and something that really appeals to me as a challenge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, the trade-off is it would probably take years of my life, at least one year per language to do. And so you get into this really weird thing of I would be giving up future games in order to make Blue Prince more accessible. And that's a crazy balance scale that I'm not sure how to proceed with. Let's say it's something I'm very interested in that has a lot of trade-offs creatively with how much time I have just in my life to make other games. How much time do I want to give to this? But it's appealing, we'll say. It's appealing in a lot of ways. Not just to let Blue Prince be able to be experienced by more people, but it is- If you haven't played the game fully, you might not quite understand how impossible of an undertaking it is. But I'll say it is absurdly difficult.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I guess thinking about that and moving on from Blue Prince, what's next? This was your first game. Are you going to make another one? Do you want to do something else?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ros:</strong> Yes. It'll always be something else. I can say I will never make a sequel to my work because I love creating something standalone and then going on to something completely different. It will likely not even be in the same exact genres. I will probably be mixing it up. You'll start to see overlap. You'll start to see overlaps with some of my interests. So it will be familiar, and hopefully I'll inadvertently have things that really worked with Blue Prince that I'll carry on in terms of at least technicals. But yeah, we'll see. I'm hesitant to do another 3D game because for my first game, 3D was so difficult. I really wish I did a 2D game. I probably could have done it in five years instead of eight. But yeah, I think it'll be something totally different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You modeled that whole ruin underground, and it's driving people crazy because it's 3D models, and they can't get over there.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ros:</strong> I know. A lot of the cutscenes show a lot of things too that we 3D modeled and created. And for me, it's like I think a lot of other people, you'd have the temptation just because you've done the effort, that you want to fully get as much value as possible. But some of my ideas are like, I'll just come up with an idea and it's like, "Okay, this is going to take three months to do." And the funny thing is, I probably wouldn't make that decision in the first year of making the game. It's like all your decisions about time are contextual to the project. So it's like, "Oh man, I have to spend 20 days adjusting text alignment." Right? That sounds really ridiculous in your first three months of the project. I'm going to spend 20 days aligning text. But once you're eight years in, you don't even blink at that type of stuff. It's like, oh, I did a change, and now I have to rescale every picture in the whole game. This will probably take me a month. And I'm like, "Okay, let's do that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so all these decisions are all contextual. But I don't really shy away from that because it's like if I come up with an idea, I usually don't let time be the reason I don't do it, because I think a lot of other games are on temporal budgets, not just monetarily, but they're on temporal budgets and they have to release. And that prevents a lot of high effort ideas from manifesting. And I didn't really have the same urgency to release. My decision to release was just I actually can't keep any of this in my head anymore. First off, I couldn't stop working on the game for even a week because I would forget too much about the way things interconnect and stuff. So I pretty much had to never take a break and just always keep it in my head. And so that just was like, the time was up. It had just dated to completion.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: There was an anecdote that was told to us in the Press Discord that I really wanted to ask you about. And that was that at some point in development, every once in a while if you had enough hallways in a straight line, there might be a shadowy figure at the end of the corridor or something. Is that real?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ros:</strong> I have heard this, and I think this is a cool rumor that's come out, and I'm not 100% sure. I'm not sure or 100% sure, but there was a cat in the game, and I think I can say that because the cat is planned for the final update because he was a part of the game. So there were playtesting iterations that had the cat, and the cat could be seen walking around the house. So it might've been someone mistaking the cat for a larger shadowy figure, perhaps conflating it with an Alzara thing. Part of the cool thing I've realized is- So I watched a lot of people play the game. I had my playtesters record sessions. And one of the things, you're always told how faulty human memory is. And it's one thing to hear that and then obviously to catch yourself being like, "I'm so sure I'm right. I remember it this way." And then if it's something that you can actually go back and look to, you realize, "I can't believe my brain just fabricated the way this occurred so vividly, so vividly."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And what I realized watching people play the game is they would make wild incorrect assumptions based on what they remembered perceiving on previous days, and they would be so sure, and I'm like, "We have recordings here. I would be able to show you that what you remember was completely false." Even though they're 100% confident. And I think for whatever reason, the way Blue Prince is set up, it really is able to play on that, because it's a game about making assumptions based on your experiences in previous iterations of this house. And I think that it does play into the idea of the house having a personality and a mind of its own, because at some point you start questioning whether things in the house are changing, and oftentimes they aren't. But it's just that your perspective that they're changing is correct. So I love that story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it was ever true or not, I'll leave it a bit mysterious. But I do think that to me, it exemplifies perhaps people's false memories that start to manifest that give rise to these rumors and probably is replicated in real-life mysteries and haunted houses. That it's not that people are even fabricating these stories, but that they grow out of perhaps not even apparitions that happened in the present, but apparitions that happened in memories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So Blue Prince has been nominated for some Golden Joysticks, which is awesome. And we're in awards discussions just generally right now. It’s being discussed that a lot of these game awards programs don't have a puzzle genre category even though they have action and adventure and all this other stuff. What do you make of that? Do you feel like Blue Prince challenges that a little bit? Do you think there should be one or shouldn't be?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ros:</strong> I mean, I love puzzle games a lot, and I think that there's enough of the big genres, we'll call them. Obviously there's a lot of very distinct little genres, and I feel like it's probably just math of how many players are playing certain things because if you look at- I don't know, some of the other ones that get representation. Multiplayer is obviously the biggest umbrella of all time. So I think there's a certain number of, in my opinion, there's a certain scale of umbrella that if you were representing things smaller than the puzzle genre and not puzzle genre, then I would say puzzle games certainly should have a place. But I'm okay if there's just not enough players for puzzles. I think it logistically makes sense that maybe they don't get representation until more people play, and hopefully games like Blue Prince that are super popular will be shifting those numbers. So that maybe we'll rise to the occasion. But I don't know the logistics. Maybe it is just a oversight and getting ignored. In which case, then I would advocate for its inclusion 100%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>[Author’s note: Following this interview, Ros reached back out to add some additional commentary to his response to this question.]</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I think back to my own childhood, and the games that were most formative for me, it was the puzzle games and puzzle books that played the most beneficial role in my development. They fostered my love of problem solving and engineering, and opened up the recreational world of mathematics, logic, and word play. I think it's fair to say these games and books had as large a role in my education as any class I attended in school, so I feel pretty strongly promoting  the genre, and supporting media that helps to shine a spotlight on these types of thinky games. If including a puzzle category in awards shows will help more kids discover these types of games, then I think it's something that we absolutely should advocate for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>[The rest of our original interview continues below:]</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Okay, one last question, and I’ll do a silly one. What do you make of the term Metroidbrainia?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ros: </strong>Okay, so if you play Blue Prince, you probably know I'm all about words and etymology. So for me, I love it because I just love how liquid language is, and I love when terms are created. So I think that being able to look at a word and seeing its etymological history, and that one has such a rich one, because if you even go and look at Metroid, it is itself a combination of Android and Metropolis. And so I think that if you could dissect this down and then you can go to Castlevania, and this was castle and Transylvania, and so it's almost like a family tree of words. And so I think that it's funny. I know that the term is, it's a little contentious in its acceptance, but I think it's funny because all of the words that are feeding into this are also sort of portmanteau combinations of sub-words.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even Transylvania has roots of, I think it's forest and people. And so it's funny because they're all coalescing into Metroidbrainia, and Metroidbrainia will likewise probably be used as a root of another word further on. So I think the more you're able to look at a word and the more rich history it has in its DNA, the more interesting it is to me. So I personally love it for that. Maybe phonetically it's not as aesthetically beautiful to hear out loud as some other terms. But I do love what a rich history it has of games of perhaps cinema with maybe Metropolis being part of that idea for Metroid. I don't actually know how they came up with that term, but I have read that it does come from Metropolis and Android, or Metro and Android might be subway-related.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But yeah, I love words, and I love the roots and I love the history of words, and I love how all these things can combine in different ways. And then I love that words’ meanings change from year to year, and the definitions shift. And I love the human instinct of trying to fight for definitions because that's the one you know, not realizing that every word you're using used to mean something else, and that it's all liquid. And that we're all in generational positions fighting for our own meaning, because language is a river that's always moving forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>1376869</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a lot of skateboarding games, and I feel like I’ve played most of them. Some of them are majestic. Some are not. The Simpsons Skateboarding was the absolute pits. Tony Hawk: Ride was tortuous pain. This year’s Skate is a microtransaction hellscape.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter Skate Story. Like those latter examples, it too is a trip to skateboarding hell and a study in pain. In this case, however, that’s actually the whole point of this extremely peculiar journey through perdition on a piece of 7-ply. I wasn’t <em>always </em>aboard for the sheer and utter weirdness of Skate Story’s broader adventure, but there’s no doubt developer Sam Eng has successfully married it to a robust and approachable set of skate mechanics – and it certainly makes for a memorable skateboarding game like no other I’ve ever played.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Skate Story is a slightly tricky game to describe, if only because attempting to even discuss the plot sounds a little like you’re making it up on the spot. The deal is you’re a demon made out of glass and pain, marooned in Hell. It’s referred to as The Underworld, more specifically – but the Devil is here, either way. I know this because I have his pants.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the Devil comes a deal. That is, you can be free on one condition: you find a way to flip, grind, and manual your way to the moon – and <em>eat it</em>. For some reason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Are you still following? Because I haven’t even got to the frog barista yet. Or the subway train with legs.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Are you still following? Because I haven’t even got to the frog barista yet. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m hesitant to say much else lest I spoil any of the particularly quirky developments along the way, so just be aware Skate Story is an incredibly weird trip through a bizarre underworld. To be candid, this isn’t <em>really </em>the kind of thing I’d typically seek out. That is, the stories I like normally feature big guys causing problems in small towns, assassins with grudges, or pictures of fighter planes on the cover. That is, I’m more David Leitch than David Lynch, if that makes sense. Skate Story did largely win me over, though. There were definitely moments I found myself getting a little numb to the weirdness, on account of just how offbeat it sometimes gets, but overall I admire the commitment to its surrealistic vision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its story is told via text that you can read through at your own pace. There’s no voice acting or voiceover – and there’s an argument to be mounted that it might’ve gained a bit of gravity from some kind of baritone narration à la The Stanley Parable or Bastion – but Skate Story’s finely honed soundtrack means there’s still plenty to listen to. Assembled by New Jersey band Blood Cultures, the music is a generous mix of the group’s experimental, electro-pop sound, and it ranges in tempo and intensity as the locations and pace of the levels vary. This sort of music is also comfortably out of my usual wheelhouse, but nonetheless I found it extremely evocative and catchy, and it suits Skate Story to a T. It fabulously complements The Underworld’s abstract environments, and the atmosphere of its eternal night backdrop.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t be fooled by Skate Story's grainy, low-fi look, either; this is one of the most eye-catching and imaginative-looking games I’ve played in recent memory. Its psychedelic vision for a neon underworld blends jagged forests of spikes with broken slabs of ancient architecture, and twisted blocks of New York City with carpets of stars. Watching this wild world refract through a sneaker-clad demon made entirely of glass is certainly something.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Pain in the Glass</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The controls are not immediately intuitive, because they’re noticeably different from the approach taken by the sorts of dedicated sports-oriented skating games a lot of us are familiar with. That is, Skate Story doesn’t have tricks mapped to flicking an analogue stick around like the Skate series (or <em>both </em>analogue sticks, as in the case of something like Session). It’s more in line with playing something like Tony Hawk, only imagine someone remapped all the buttons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Basic tricks are activated by a combination of either a shoulder button or trigger plus a face button, and grinds occur when you pop and land suitably on a rail or ledge. A variety of other, progressively more complex tricks are rationed out and taught to us as the story unfolds over its roughly six-hour duration. It’s not a revolutionary approach, sure, but it’s a smart one since having us always picking up new tricks keeps things fresh throughout. There was a moderate learning curve as I sought to archive decades of THPS muscle memory in order to learn Skate Story’s own specific trick system – but it didn’t take too long to come to grips with. </p><div id="rank-these-skateboarding-video-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank these skateboarding video games</h3><h3>Rank these skateboarding video games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s all very grounded and weighty, which I like, and the tricks look great in motion with the low slung camera that tumbles to the ground like a physical object each time you bail and shatter to bits. I love how the powerslides feel, and I love the slow motion enders we’re rewarded with for our successes. When it comes to vibes, Skate Story nails the landing.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s all very grounded and weighty... and the tricks look great in motion with the low slung camera.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a timing mechanism for executing tricks that results in different pop heights, which is illustrated by an on-screen doodle (a different shape for each trick). Depending on the speed of your skater, a marker will trace the doodle slowly or quickly – and there’s a sweet spot for getting max altitude – but I have to admit I generally paid little attention to it. On default settings, Skate Story never demanded a fastidious level of timing finesse to get through its levels and defeat bosses. This suits me just fine, but the fact that you <em>can </em>just essentially spam your way through a lot of the most frantic-looking segments may come across as a little trivial to anyone looking for a stiffer challenge.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Tony Hawk’s Underworld</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Boss battles are handled in an interesting way, and to win these encounters you need to build up combos and “stomp” them down inside a marked zone. They can be cleared with a bit of mild button-mashing, but there’s certainly room to be much more deliberate about your trick selection and timing if you choose to (and you will, admittedly, accumulate better combos and deal more damage – and faster – if you do). There are also a number of small and trippy sandbox-style levels to cruise around with various objectives to complete, but some of these tasks <em>do </em>get disappointingly trivial. For instance, one mission that called on me to gather up a selection of floating letters sounded like a cute nod to Skate Story’s ancestors – but most of them were just hovering at ground level, turning what could’ve been a brief but fun challenge into a basic fetch quest across the map and back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My favourite parts of Skate Story, however, were the speed segments, where you must hustle from your spawn point to an ethereal exit door – like some kind of haunted hill bomb. The music ramps up for these high-speed bursts, and I like the fast-paced trial-and-error nature of them as your fragile demon smashes to shards and you instantly get another crack. I always felt a little pang of regret when I reached the end of these runs, and I wish there were a few more of them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/skate-story-review]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A major shareholder in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has released a 100-page document criticising the company for its poor sales and urging for a "fundamental reassessment of the medium-term management plan".</p>
<p>3D Investment Partners is the third largest shareholder in Square Enix, with a 14.36 percent stake it began amassing back in April. Now the Singapore-based investment firm has gone public with its critique of the company, after reportedly being dissatisfied with Square Enix CEO Takashi Kiryu's response to its analysis back in October (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-enixs-major-shareholder-drops-100-page-presentation-criticizing-how-the-company-is-managed-rallies-other-shareholders/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.3dipartners.com/wp-content/uploads/square-enix-presentation-material-en-202512.pdf">The report</a> states Square Enix is a "preeminent Japanese game developer" that "possesses globally renowned game titles" including Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest. However, it's seen a "significant deterioration in earning power" and the investment firm believes the current management plan is insufficient in revitalising the company.</p>

<p>That management plan was shared by Square Enix last year, as it announced it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">"aggressively pursuing" a multiplatform strategy</a> for its games, aiming to "diversify earnings opportunities" following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-reviewing-overall-game-development-to-improve-quality">review of its development system</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-abandons-112m-of-in-development-projects-in-an-effort-to-improve-quality">abandonment of £112m of in-development projects</a>.</p><p>3D Investment Partners has argued Square Enix has stagnating profit margins. Games sales have reduced and margins have declined, which the investor attributes to platform exclusivity, poor revenue return on advertising expenditures, low sales of its legacy games, and excessive development costs, among many factors.</p>
<p>The document also goes to great lengths to compare Square Enix with key Japanese competitors like Capcom and Konami to highlight its lack of success, while claiming Square Enix relies too much on the domestic Japanese market and is failing to grow overseas.</p>
<p>It should be noted Square Enix is addressing some of these issues already - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-and-final-fantasy-7-remake-are-finally-on-xbox-but-is-it-too-late">Final Fantasy 16 made its way to Xbox</a> this year following PlayStation exclusivity, while the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-gets-switch-2-release-date">Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy will be coming to both Xbox and Switch 2</a> in future.</p>
<p>What's more, 3D Investment Partners is here an activist investor stirring up outside support. It offers little in the way of tangible advice, beyond picking holes in Square Enix's strategy, seemingly with an agenda to oust Kiryu as CEO. It's unclear where sales data in the report has been taken from, while sentiment against the likes of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake (which was certainly successful) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> (which certainly has a fanbase) have been hand-picked from Metacritic to highlight harsh criticism.</p><p>Still, the investment company claims Square Enix's current "Reboots" strategy justifies its lacklustre performance and fails to "articulate a forward-looking vision". Further, it highlights a "lack of synergy with non-gaming", stating its cross-media strategy with films, anime and the like is lagging, as are merchandise sales. Additionally, Square Enix's arcade and publishing (manga) business are said to be significantly underperforming.</p>
<p>The report comes at a critical time for Square Enix. The company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">admitted last year both Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth initially failed to meet sales expectations</a>. Its earnings report in May this year showed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sees-game-sales-drop-but-multiplatform-strategy-continues-in-earnest">year-on-year drop in sales of its single player games</a>, although profit did increase due to strong sales of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake.</p>
<p>Then, in November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-chasing-nfts-and-the-metaverse-square-enix-wants-generative-ai-to-do-70-of-its-qa-by-2027">Square Enix announced it wants generative AI to do 70 percent of QA work</a> by 2027. This announcement came alongside <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/square-enix-announces-mass-layoffs-as-restructuring-plan-pulls-development-from-overseas">mass layoffs as the company's "fundamental restructuring" plan pulled resources from "overseas" development</a> - an unknown number of US employees are at risk, while reportedly 137 jobs are at risk in the UK.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/">The Game Business</a>' Christopher Dring, physical sales for Prime 4 were down 15% when compared to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid Dread</a>, though he calls this marginal at "just a few thousand units".</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, which launched on the same day as Prime 4, almost didn't even chart at all, coming in at number 37 with the majority of sales on the original Switch. Similarly, though <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> saw a slight bump up from last week to land at number 19, Switch 2 sales still lagged behind the PS5.</p>

            <p>Developer Goichi "Suda51" Suda has assured Grasshopper Manufacture fans that the studio's next game, the ultra-violent Romeo is a Dead Man, contains no AI-generated material. </p>
<p>The executive director and scenario writer was <a href="https://x.com/suda_51/status/1998036236964135256?s=20">initially teasing a possible Nintendo Switch 2 version</a> of the game, stating Grasshopper is "looking into what we can do" to make that happen. Currently, Romeo is a Dead Man is slated for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3050900/ROMEO_IS_A_DEAD_MAN/">PC via Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10016000">PS5</a> and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Suda then went on to confirm Romeo is a Dead Man "contains no AI-generated stuff whatsoever", asking the community to "please rest easy on that front".</p>
<p>Suda's AI comment comes after a sequel to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-is-grasshoppers-refreshingly-different-return-to-form">studio's Let it Die</a> appeared to have been built using a considerable amount of generative AI, though Grasshopper was not involved with this project. Rather, Let it Die: Inferno was developed by Supertrick Games, and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/made-with-ai-let-it-die-sequel-inferno-discloses-substantial-generative-ai-use">met with a number of raised eyebrows on its debut earlier this month due to its use of AI</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-inferno-developer-responds-to-generative-ai-controversy">developer then released a statement to address the controversy</a>, saying: "We'd like to begin by being transparent about the use of AI tools during development."</p><p>But, back to Grasshopper and Romeo is a Dead Man. The game is due to release next year, on 11th February, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suda-51s-next-game-is-the-ultra-violent-romeo-is-a-deadman">having initially been announced in June</a>. The ultra-violent shooter will see players take the role of FBI investigator Romeo Stargazer, who tracks down wanted criminals across spacetime and battles with both guns and swords. You can check out a trailer below.</p>

<p>As for AI, well this is a topic we can't hide from, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">many developers now flirting with the technology</a>. Last week, publisher Running with Scissors cancelled upcoming game Postal: Bullet Paradise - a co-op "bullet-heaven" first-person shooter from developer Goonswarm Games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/has-caused-extreme-damage-to-our-brand-and-our-company-reputation-running-with-scissors-cancels-postal-bullet-paradise-over-ai-generated-assets-two-days-after-reveal">after feedback to the reveal two days ago said much of the game appeared to have been made using generative AI</a>.</p>
<p>Also last week, Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> told Eurogamer that while he sees AI as a "tool", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-and-elder-scrolls-boss-todd-howard-defends-ai-in-game-development-but-aims-to-protect-artistry-and-human-intention-in-his-games">the studio always aims to "protect artistry" and "human intention" in its games</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In September, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-nearly-saved-take-two-deal-fell-through/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Take-Two tried to save the Perfect Dark reboot that was in development at The Initiative (with the help of Crystal Dynamics), but an agreement could not be reached with IP holder Microsoft about the future of the franchise.</p>



<p>Now, Schreier has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3m7izaecnvc2j?ref_src=embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">followed up</a>, adding that Take-Two has nonetheless hired two key developers from the Perfect Dark team to found a new 2K studio. They are Darrell Gallagher, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-tomb-raider-david-gallaggher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Studio Head at the Initiative</a> (and formerly Studio Head at Crystal Dynamics), and Brian Horton. The latter worked at Crystal Dynamics with Gallagher on 2013's Tomb Raider and 2015's Rise of the Tomb Raider before moving to Insomniac, where he contributed to many games, including Marvel's Spider-Man, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and the upcoming Marvel's Wolverine. He had <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-gets-ex-marvels-wolverine-lead-as-new-creative-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joined The Initiative in late 2024 as the new Creative Director</a>, but the project, as we all know, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially canceled in July 2025</a> by Microsoft, which also shut down the studio.</p>



<p>It's not the first time Take-Two scoops up an industry veteran to found a new studio within 2K. It <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-new-studio-michael-condrey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already happened a few years ago with Michael Condrey</a>, the former studio head of Sledgehammer Games and, before that, co-creator of Dead Space (alongside Glen Schofield) at Visceral Games. That team, based in Silicon Valley, is known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/31st-union-michael-condrey-2k-ambitious-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">31st Union</a>, though Condrey himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/2k-removes-31st-union-president-michael-condrey-insists-project-ethos-is-still-being-worked-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was fired earlier this year</a> following the tepid response to the studio's free-to-play roguelike hero third-person shooter game Project ETHOS, which is, however, reportedly still in development.</p>



<p>Given the average time of triple-A game development in 2025, we may not hear about this new Take-Two studio for another three or four years. Still, we'll keep you updated on any further rumors and leaks.</p>

		<p>Digital Sun has shared a little look at what’s coming down the line for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/moonlighter-2">Moonlighter 2</a> roadmap as it goes through Early Access, the team keen to emphasise that this game is being built in collaboration and around the feedback of its players.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault | Developer Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pqFQnNp_wDU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s two content updates planned between now and the 1.0 release, which will have a further batch of things to do and the ending to the story.</p>
<p>The first content update will include a fifth challenge, a new skill tree at Eris, a balance patch for perks and relics, and general balancing and quality of life improvements. The second content up date will add a sixth challenge, a fourth shop level with more space, showcases and decorations, new patches, and a pet seller with new bonus-granting bloblets.</p>


<p>This is not set in stone, however, as Digital Sun explain that “additional mechanics, features, and improvements are planned, but we’re not sharing those just yet, as we want to hear more from you beforehand!”</p>
<p>Jason delved back into Moonlighter 2 for its early access, having <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/28/moonlighter-review/">enjoyed the original game</a>. In his first impressions he said, “On the whole, I’m enjoying Moonlighter 2’s Early Access release. It’s a decent mechanical upgrade over the original game in the majority of areas, but it’s also fair to say that it’s losing a little something in the transition, and I find it a bit less whimsical. If you want more stuff to do and love a meta-grind though, then this game should satisfy that nicely.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Journalist Stephen Totilo has <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/kotor-ii-restored-content-mod-dlc-switch-killed-disney?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=4mhhpq&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the current developer of the Star Wars KOTOR Remake. It's Mad Head Games, the Serbian studio behind defunct hack 'n' slash action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/pagan-online-revealed-debut-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pagan Online</a> and sci-fi action/adventure game Scars Above (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/scars-above-the-definition-of-one-and-done/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which we reviewed here</a>). They're also working on Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival, <a href="https://wccftech.com/clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival-gamescom-hands-on-preview-pleasure-and-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which we previewed at Gamescom 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Mad Head Games is a subsidiary of Saber Interactive, following the split from the Embracer Group. We knew that a team at Saber was working on the game. A year and a half ago, their CEO <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well-promises-saber-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that the development was progressing well.</p>



<p>Let's rewind the long and problematic development story of the Star Wars KOTOR Remake. The first rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-might-be-getting-a-reimagining/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started circulating in January 2020</a>, before the world was even fully aware of COVID-19. The game was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> during the September 2021 PlayStation Showcase as an exclusive for PC and PlayStation 5. Back then, Aspyr Media was working on it, but their project <a href="https://wccftech.com/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was paused in mid-2022</a> following an unsuccessful demo presentation to Sony and Lucasfilm. Shortly afterward, we learned that the developer had changed, but we never knew the exact studio until now.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Totilo revealed that Disney and Lucasfilm Games have been planning a Star Wars KOTOR II remake (codenamed Juliet) as well, as recently as March 2025, which would also include the content cut from the original version. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1phogew/comment/nt0ij6e/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a Reddit post</a>, he then explained that the info comes from a legal deposition:</p>



<p><em>Yes, this is more than a rumor because the person who talked about it during their legal deposition was Douglas Reilly, the longtime VP of Lucasfilm Games. The reason for the March cut-off on this is because that's when the deposition was. At that time, he said it "is still technically on the road map” and that “we’re starting with the remake of KOTOR I." I don't know about the status of either KOTOR remake since then.</em></p>



<p>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was originally developed by BioWare. Launched in July 2003, it is considered to be one of the best RPGs of all time, although its combat system would feel pretty dated nowadays and must certainly be among the most significant changes in the KOTOR Remake, just like with Final Fantasy VII. Its sequel, KOTOR II: The Sith Lords, was developed by Obsidian and launched in December 2004. It was also well received, although not quite to the extent of the first franchise entry.</p>



<p>As a separate rumor from Totilo's reveal, leaker Kurakasis <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1997385253795590237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that a major Star Wars game announcement, whose title ends with "The Old Republic," is coming soon, presumably hinting at a reveal during The Game Awards 2025. That said, take this piece of info with a grain of salt.</p>

            <p>Two former lead developers from Perfect Dark's The Initiative have joined 2K to launch a new studio under Rockstar owner Take-Two.</p>
<p>Darrell Gallagher, who previously served as The Initiative's studio head and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">working on the Perfect Dark reboot before it was cancelled by Microsoft</a>, announced the news last night.</p>

<p>"I'm excited to share that I will be joining 2K as SVP, Studio Head, where I'll be building a new studio and leading an ambitious opportunity unlike anything I've taken on before," Gallagher <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7403902973464014848/?originTrackingId=x%2FyCRM50FXYKNFel5poliA%3D%3D">wrote on LinkedIn</a>. "I've spent my career believing in what's possible when great people come together with a bold vision. I can't wait to get started with the exceptional team at 2K!"</p>
<p>Gallagher also previously worked at Crystal Dynamics on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>, to name just one.</p>
<p>Joining Gallagher at 2K's new studio is Brian Horton, who was the creative director in charge of Perfect Dark's creative vision and execution at The Initiative. Horton's other work includes as creative director on Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man.</p>
<p>"Happy to announce I joined 2K as VP, head of creative at a new studio with Darrell Gallagher," Horton <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7403908881246318592/?originTrackingId=FDZjmkOp3OMe7yfwvoD13Q%3D%3D">wrote on LinkedIn</a> last night.</p>
<p>Neither developer revealed exactly what they will be working on at 2K, though many are hoping to see a revival of the Perfect Dark reboot. Back in September, it was reported the reboot could have been saved from cancellation by Take-Two.</p>

<p>Allegedly, the publishing giant was in talks with Embracer - which owns Perfect Dark co-development studio Crystal Dynamics - and was willing to acquire the project from Microsoft. Had this deal gone through, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot-almost-saved-by-rockstar-owner-take-two">plan would have been for Take-Two to then fund and publish Perfect Dark itself</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-announced">Perfect Dark reboot was initially announced back in 2020</a>, with The Initiative set to lead development. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-perfect-dark-reboot-will-be-co-developed-by-crystal-dynamics">Crystal Dynamics was then brought in to support</a> in 2021.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#912)—Clues and Answers for Tuesday, December 9]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-december-9-912/</link>
            <guid>1376824</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re pushing fast through December, and before you know it, the festive window will be in full swing. How are you preparing for this year’s celebrations? Hopefully, you’re planning to kickstart today with a fresh run around the latest NYT Connections puzzle, because I’m here with the hints and solutions you need.</p>



<p>Read on to dominate today’s NYT Connections challenge! The latest hints are just below.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-9">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 9)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #912:</p>



<ul>
<li>CONSIDER</li>



<li>CLOWNFISH</li>



<li>COUNT</li>



<li>HONEYBEE</li>



<li>FACTOR</li>



<li>TIGER</li>



<li>INCLUDE</li>



<li>ZEBRA</li>



<li>FIEVEL</li>



<li>DOROTHY GALE</li>



<li>FOREHEAD</li>



<li>LEPRECHAUN</li>



<li>TOUCAN</li>



<li>PRIDE</li>



<li>WONDER</li>



<li>UNICORN</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think about actions you take when weighing options or doing calculations.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>All of these creatures are known for their distinctive stripes or bold patterns.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These all connect to rainbows — either literally or symbolically.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These words start with a misspelled number.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 9:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-december-9-912">NYT Connections Answers for Today, December 9 (#912)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CONSIDER, COUNT, FACTOR, INCLUDE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CLOWNFISH, HONEYBEE, TIGER, ZEBRA</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – DOROTHY GALE, LEPRECHAUN, PRIDE, UNICORN</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – FIEVEL, FOREHEAD, TOUCAN, WONDER</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>As highlighted by the show's <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1998093056692895923">creator and host Geoff Keighley</a> and the official Tomb Raider social media account, fans of Lara will be able to tune into the event to find out about the "future" of this iconic video game character. No other details have been shared just yet, but Geoff says it's a reveal "you won't want to miss".</p>
<p>This news was originally revealed in The Game Awards Vote in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> map portal.

<p>As our <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/new-tomb-raider-reveal-confirmed-for-the-game-awards">colleagues at Push Square note</a>, the "next Tomb Raider game is expected to be a completely original entry that's its own standalone thing, and isn't tied to any of the previous storylines".</p>
<p>This teaser follows the recent shadow drop of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a> on the Switch and Switch 2 in November. Lara's classic outings <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomb_raider_iv-vi_remastered">Tomb Raider IV-VI</a> also got the remastered treatment on the Switch earlier this year.</p>

<p>The StarLadder Budapest Major 2025 playoffs will commence soon, running from December 11 to 14. It’s the portion of the tournament that will crown the victor in Hungary, and they’ll secure a $500,000 grand prize for their efforts. Eight teams are set to enter the MVM Dome, but only one can walk away with the trophy.</p>



<p>In this breakdown, we’re taking a closer look at the StarLadder Budapest Major playoffs betting predictions to determine which team has the best odds of winning.</p>

<h2 id="h-top-budapest-major-playoffs-predictions">Top Budapest Major Playoffs Predictions</h2>



<p>It’s almost too close to call, as this event has been electrifying thus far. We’ve seen huge upsets, underdog streaks, and new records set during this tournament, which has proven to be one of the best Counter-Strike 2 events of 2025.</p>



<p>FURIA remains the safest bet, which reflects the team’s dominant run through the early stages and consistent form throughout the year thus far. With outright odds of 2.9 to win the tournament, FURIA won’t offer the biggest returns, but should be the safest play.</p>



<p>Vitality has slightly longer odds (around 4.0), which promises better bang for your buck, and the team remains a fantastic choice for a middle-of-the-road option. Everyone knows that Vitality had the best year imaginable in 2025, but things have cooled off a little in recent weeks for ZywOo and Co.</p>



<p>By far the biggest outsider in terms of Counter-Strike betting odds is FaZe Clan. The Brazilian squad enters the Budapest Major playoffs with odds of 20.0 to take the trophy, but they’re a resilient side that has had a decent run thus far, so it might be worth a flutter to play the longest odds in the tournament.</p>



<p>If you want the safe pick, aim for FURIA. There’s value in wagering on Falcons or Spirit, but if you want larger returns, MongolZ still has a phenomenal shot at the trophy, and FaZe Clan <strong>could </strong>produce a masterful victory in the bracket.</p>

<p>Nintendo's been busy getting in its final updates of 2025, and alongside a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-1-0-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">system update for the Switch 2 and Switch</a> this week, it's also put out a new update for its online battle royale racer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/f-zero_99">F-Zero 99</a>.</p>
<p>According to the official patch notes, this includes "new additions", various adjustments and changes, as well as the usual fixes. Some of the new content includes "new secret tracks" and a music player has also been added to the title, which can be accessed from the Workshop menu.</p>

<p>Here's the full rundown of this latest update, courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h3>F-Zero 99 - Version 1.7.0 (8th December 2025)</h3>
<p><strong>New Additions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Frozen Tour Event will be held this year. All tracks in the game will be covered in snow and appear as frozen tracks. By collecting Gem Sparks that appear on the frozen tracks, players can get event-exclusive rewards.
<ul>
<li>The Frozen World Tour will also return during the event period. Earn points and aim for a high score in a series of nine three-lap races across various F-ZERO worlds.</li>
<li>Frozen World Tour high-score rankings will be added to the weekly leaderboard. This ranking will be reset every Sunday at 4:00 p.m. PST (00:00 UTC).</li>
<li>A player ranking in 999th place or higher in the Frozen World Tour’s weekly high-score ranking will get a special badge. (This badge features the same design as last year’s badge, and players who have already earned it are not eligible to earn another.)</li>
<li>The Frozen Tour Event and Frozen World Tour will be held from December 15, 2025, to January 19, 2026.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added Elite leaderboard. S20+ pilots will now appear on the Elite leaderboard and be globally ranked. You can select Leaderboard from the Main Menu and then toggle between the weekly leaderboard and Elite leaderboard.
<ul>
<li>The Elite leaderboard will be reset every three months (Feb. 1, May 1, Aug. 1, Nov. 1).</li>
<li>Once the Elite leaderboard is reset, you must complete at least one race to be placed on the Elite leaderboard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added S50 Elite status for pilots who achieve S50. During the game, this status will be displayed as a Falcon emblem.
<ul>
<li>Global rankings for the S50 Elite can be viewed on the Elite leaderboard. The S50 Elite global rankings will also be displayed at the top of your Pilot Card and will be visible to other players at the start of races and to players spectating.</li>
<li>S50 Elite players compete for the top world rankings based on Elite points. Elite points are calculated based on the outcome of races against S50 Elite Rivals, and the S50 Elite world rankings will be determined based on these points.</li>
<li>Winning or losing races against Rivals at S49 or below or in Classic races will not affect Elite points.</li>
<li>When the Elite leaderboard is reset, S50 Elite and S49 players will be reset to their initial S49 skill ratings. S50 Elite players’ Elite points will also be reset.</li>
<li>If you reach S50 Elite again in a new season, you will be awarded 1,000 Elite points and placed on the Elite leaderboard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added Lucky Tokens. Each Lucky Token allows you to play Lucky Ranks one time.
<ul>
<li>You'll earn one token per day, and up to six can be held for later use.</li>
<li>You can also unlock additional tokens from leveling up or when you didn’t match with tokens.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added three new Secret Tracks. They will occasionally appear in F-ZERO 99 and Mini Prix modes.
<ul>
<li>Increased the frequency with which Secret Tracks will appear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a music player.
<ul>
<li>Select Music Player from the Workshop menu to access it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added backdrops that can be used to customize Pilot Cards and emotes that can be sent at specific points during races. After specified conditions are met, these can be used for customization.
<ul>
<li>Added 20 backdrops that can be obtained via Lucky Ranks.</li>
<li>Added eight emotes that can be acquired during the limited-time challenge.</li>
<li>To customize your Pilot Card or set emotes—or to see what conditions are required to obtain these items—select WORKSHOP from the Main Menu and then select PILOT CARDS or EMOTES.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Adjustments and Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted the balance of skill rating gains and losses to help players reach higher ratings more quickly.
<ul>
<li>Increased points earned from defeating a Rival and decreased points lost from losing to all four Rivals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a World Tour tab to Records in the Workshop.</li>
<li>The Mystery Rank in Lucky Ranks may now contain one Bounty Chip.
<ul>
<li>This gives players a chance to earn two Bounty Chips at once as a Lucky Ranks reward.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issues to make for a more pleasant gaming experience.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight will be jumping into action during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>. The game is set to release sometime in 2026 and has been highly anticipated by fans.</p>



<p>Revealed at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-revealed-at-gamescom-onl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025</a>, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is bringing back the Caped Crusader in all his blocky glory. Set to be an original story taking from the series’ most iconic moments, it looks like the perfect love letter to the DC franchise. While it won’t have many playable characters, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-open-world-arkham-knight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its open-world Gotham City</a> and Arkham-inspired combat will tide fans over. It’s been a bit quiet from TT Games about the title, especially with the 2026 release approaching. Now, it seems fans will get a new look at it on December 11th.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-look-at-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-premiering-on-december-11th-at-the-game-awards">New Look at LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Premiering on December 11th at The Game Awards</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/LEGODCGame/status/1998211049951047851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweet from the game’s official account</a>, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight will appear at The Game Awards. The post, seen above, shows Lego Batman guarding a poster for the Geoff Keighley-hosted show, which’ll take place at Peacock Theater. It’s unclear what exactly will be shown at the event, scheduled for December 11th. However, it does seem likely fans will get a release window/date, given it’s due to come out in 2026. Even still, gameplay of the title is most certainly going to appear, so there’s that to look forward to. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got its hands</a> on LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight at Gamescom 2025 over the summer. The writer found the gameplay fun and engaging, calling the overall experience one with massive potential.

<p>According to the official Nintendo support page, this latest update includes some general system stability improvements. If we hear about anything going on behind the scenes here, such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/another-switch-game-has-been-updated-for-switch-2-more-compatibility-issues-identified">compatibility updates for existing Switch titles</a>, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>
<h3>Nintendo Switch 2 Update - Version 21.1.0 (8th December 2025)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wmxnph&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>Once again, this same update has been rolled out for the original Switch as well. The <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525#current">same patch notes</a> for the original system have also been shared on the support page. If you're not prompted to update, you can manually perform this update by navigating to the System Settings from the HOME Menu, selecting System Update, and the update will begin.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 has now been available for six months. During this time, Nintendo has released nine firmware updates for the system (and almost every single update has contained a note about stability improvements). It's also updated Switch game compatibility and even released game upgrades for select titles.</p>
<p>In some <em>other</em> update news, Nintendo has also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/f-zero-99-update-version-1-7-0-now-live-new-secret-tracks-music-player-and-much-more">released a new patch</a> for its battle royale racer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/f-zero_99">F-Zero 99</a> today. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> has also received a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/04/random_heres_the_evolution_of_the_yoshi_series_over_nearly_30_years">new album today</a>.</p>

Should Saber continue development, it seems the plan is for a reimagined version of the entire experience, even the RCM content, to be included in the final build.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many other details on the supposed KOTOR 2 remake remain a mystery, but the good news is that Reilly says “we’re starting with the remake of KOTOR 1,” clarifying that “Aspyr isn’t working on those games.” Instead, the KOTOR remake is said to now be in the hands of the team behind Hellraiser: Revival at Mad Head Games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s yet another update on a remake of a classic Star Wars video game that was first <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kotor-aspyr-remaster-playstation-showcase-announcement-news"><u>announced all the way back in 2021</u></a>.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-6-rockstar-fired-workers-protest-nyc/</link>
            <guid>1376704</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Last Friday evening, despite the bitter cold, around 50 people gathered outside <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> developer Rockstar’s office in Manhattan to protest <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-union-protest-rockstar/"><u>the October firing of 34 workers in the UK and Scotland</u></a> who had engaged in union organizing activity. Chants like “Steal lambos, not wages” were accompanied by signs that read “No workers, no <em>GTA</em>” and “Bad boss = bad game.”&nbsp;</p><p>The protest was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/techworkerscoalition.org/post/3m7bkgt7d5s2w?ref=aftermath.site"><u>put on by the Tech Workers Coalition</u></a>, a labor rights group with chapters around the US. Gershom (who declined to share his last name), a developer with the Tech Workers Coalition, told Aftermath that the goal of the protest was to keep pressure on Rockstar and show support for fired workers as they head into a UK court hearing this week.</p><p>"We're connected with the Rockstar workers in the UK who were fired, and they asked us to help organize international solidarity actions to show Rockstar that it can't hide attacks on workers in one country anywhere else,” Gershom said. “We want to take it to the New York offices and show [the bosses] that no matter where they are, we're gonna be here letting people know what they're doing to their workers and letting their customers know what they're doing to their workers."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The crowd was largely made up of members from supportive organizations like the Democratic Socialists Of America (DSA) and unions like Industrial Workers Of The World (IWW), United Auto Workers (UAW), and Communications Workers Of America (CWA), the latter of which has played a pivotal role in <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-unions-microsoft-layoffs-mmo-elder-scrolls/"><u>unionizing thousands of workers across Microsoft</u></a>. Independent Workers’ Union Of Great Britain (IWGB) – which is helping Rockstar workers organize and, now, <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-union-protest-rockstar/"><u>pursue legal action against Rockstar</u></a> – did not have a presence, as it is predominantly based in the UK.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>"It's important that we stand against all of those threats as a single workers' movement."</blockquote><p>"I was available, so I came," Marcin, a member of IWW, told Aftermath. "I always knew that Rockstar was not a very good company in terms of treating their workers [well], but goddamn. The whole gaming industry, the working conditions are very toxic. Crunch culture ... is in my opinion inhumane and quite abusive. I don't think anybody should be treated that way."</p><p>Tech workers from companies like Google and Meta marched alongside grad workers from Columbia University.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"Employers across industries right now are firing people without cause, whether that's due to manufactured austerity crises or in response to organizing – or some combination,” Johanna, a member of Student Workers Of Columbia-UAW who said she was fired for organizing earlier this year, told Aftermath. “And it's important that we stand against all of those threats as a single workers' movement. … It's a cliche, but what happens to one of us happens to all of us."</p><p>Others in attendance could attest to the effectiveness of unions banding together. Dannel Jurado, a member, steward, and collective bargaining committee member of Kickstarter United – which just <a href="https://www.opeiulocal153.org/news/kickstarter-united-nyc-opeiu-153-declares-victory-and-ends-40-day-strike?ref=aftermath.site"><u>ended a 42-day strike</u></a> after securing an escalating minimum salary floor tied to cost of living and a codified 32-hour, 4-day workweek, among other things – told Aftermath that a “pay it forward” mentality informed his decision to join the Rockstar protest.</p><p>"It was really heartening to see folks come out from Starbucks – who are clearly on strike – and CODE-CWA, especially the Google folks and the <a href="https://aftermath.site/times-tech-guild-strike-wordle/"><u>New York Times Tech Guild</u></a> folks,” Jurado said of Kickstarter’s strike. “We saw people come out from RA unions; we have in our local a bunch of RA unions who really came out in support of us. Student groups as well. We saw teamsters come out. Amazon labor folks."</p><p>"Today's the day we ratified our second contract we went on strike for,” he continued. “In a discussion during that meeting, we told each other 'We can't shut up about this. We can't shut up about our contract, about how union solidarity gets the goods.' It's a big deal for us to be out here because we saw that when we were trying to organize strike rallies across the country – which we did successfully in Boston, New York, and Seattle – we saw folks who came out just to support us. Every single person counts, whether they knew what our message was or not."</p><p>Game developers, however, were few and far between at the protest, which according to Gershom came together at the last second and largely drew on established connections between tech workers and unions, as opposed to NYC’s local game dev scene.&nbsp;</p><p>“What we're all out here to do is help give those workers support,” said Gershom. “They asked us to do this earlier than we would have otherwise, because it's not just about bad publicity. They're gonna be walking into court there in Britain. They want to be able to know and see photos all around the world of people standing there with them.”</p><p>After the protest, organizers and others in attendance spoke of hypothetical links that had yet to be hammered into the chain: For example, major motion picture guilds like SAG-AFTRA and IATSE have every reason to support Rockstar workers considering how much Hollywood talent Rockstar’s games draw on. One SAG member was in attendance, Sarah Elmaleh – negotiating chair on <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-deal/"><u>the union’s recent, voice actor strike-ending interactive media agreement</u></a> – but of her own accord as opposed to in any official capacity.</p><p>"I was [in town] for the holidays, and I was like 'Oh shit, maybe I can go help,'" Elmaleh told Aftermath. "I know that some of [the fired Rockstar workers] have been at this company longer than I've been doing voiceover, and that's a long time. So it seems very clear to me that they know how to take care of their company's information, and they love what they do and they want to make this game. Every union that's not quite started up yet is vulnerable, and they deserve other folks who've enjoyed long-term benefits and protections from that right to stand up and support their right to do that."</p><blockquote>"It seems very clear to me that [Rockstar workers] know how to take care of their company's information, and they love what they do and they want to make this game."</blockquote><p>As evidenced by both the nascent state of unions in the video game industry and the relative lack of game worker presence at a demonstration ostensibly dedicated to game workers, organizing is a long, sometimes diffuse process. But even where a series about stealing cars and going really, really fast is concerned, slow and steady wins the race.</p><p>"There's a difference between developers and performers, but we're both game workers,” said Elmaleh. “We both work on games. Breaking down that boundary is really important to us understanding the conditions we both work under to support each other in light of that. … It can be scary when you're doing something like this, and bodies and support and voices make you feel less alone and make you less vulnerable to being picked off. It's really crucial that we do this together. That's time tested." </p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-union-protest-rockstar/"><div><p>Following Firings And Grand Theft Auto VI Delay, Union Plans To Keep Pressure On Rockstar</p><p>“When companies do something like this, you can’t just slink away and hide anymore”</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <p>
I am sure the words "new" and "Ace Attorney game" have functioned as a sleeper agent's activation words for some of you, and these are words that Capcom themselves have sort of put together, but let's slow down before we get carried away. As spotted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mega-man">Mega Man</a> fansite <a href="https://www.rockman-corner.com/2025/12/capcom-moves-to-revitalize-mega-man-ace.html?m=1">Rockman Corner</a>, Capcom have released their <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/annual/2025/annual_2025_01.pdf">integrated report for 2025</a>, which for the most part is boring, corporate nonsense. Here comes the but. But! It also appears to suggest that the developer is thinking about new ways it can further develop series like Ace Attorney, as well as Mega Man and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a>.
</p>
<p>
Apologies for the business speak here, but this is what Capcom had to say: "Capcom owns a wealth of globally popular brands, such as Mega Man, Devil May Cry, and Ace Attorney. We aim to expand our user base and improve our performance through new releases, remakes, and ports of titles in these series to new hardware. By enhancing brand power and cultivating loyal fan bases, we will grow these into core IPs." Just one second, need to wash off the stench of buzz words real quick.
</p>
<p>
Right, back! Now, that obviously doesn't 100% confirm a new game for the likes of any of the mentioned titles. However, at this point, as far as I'm aware, there's literally only the Professor Layton and Ace Attorney crossover game that's left to be ported, so perhaps there's hope for both this and something new too, you rabid Phoenix x Miles shippers.
</p>
<p>
In the case of Mega Man, there hasn't been a new mainline game since 2018's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mega-man-11">Mega Man 11</a>, leaving ample room for a reawakening. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry-5">Devil May Cry 5</a> came out in 2019, too, so it's not surprising Capcom is looking to breathe some life back into that one, even if it got a new mobile game last year. The developer has done quite well for itself with Resident Evil, Monster Hunter (well, not so much you, Wilds), and Street Fighter in recent years, so it isn't exactly a surprise that they're interested in a bigger slice of pie. Now all we need is a Dark Void reboot, the series everybody desperately wants a comeback for. Right? Right?

                <p>For a minute there, a full-on remake of Obsidian Entertainment's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith/" data-ref-id="5000-20453">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2</a> was apparently in development. However, the project appears to have been put on hold, according to a new report.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/kotor-ii-restored-content-mod-dlc-switch-killed-disney" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File's reporting</a>, new legal documents revealed that Aspyr and Lucasfilm Games were working on a full remake of KOTOR 2. Codenamed "Juliet" in the files, the project was a modern remake of the iconic 2004 RPG and was in development alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake/" data-ref-id="5000-537792">KOTOR remake</a>, which developer Saber Interactive said is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-is-still-coming-says-developer/1100-6526585/" data-ref-id="1100-6526585">still coming</a>. However, per Game File and unlike the KOTOR remake, development on the KOTOR II remake has ceased as recently as March 2025. Lucasfilm Games VP Douglas Reilly explained in depositions about the drama surrounding KOTOR II that, had the remake come to fruition, it would've contained the cut DLC that was teased when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-kotor-2-with-restored-content-launches-for-switch-june-8/1100-6503963/" data-ref-id="1100-6503963">the game was announced for Nintendo Switch in 2022</a>.</p><p>"'Juliet' was the codename for a project where we were going to do a full remake of KOTOR II," Reilly said. [It would have featured] modern art, modern gameplay, you know, keep the story and the characters and the general--the general content of KOTOR II, but remake it for modern hardware and modern machines with updated graphics and all those kinds of things. It was something we were discussing with Aspyr. ... The plan was that we would remake the content that was in the RCM as it relates to Star Wars in that Juliet project."</p><p>The DLC, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=485537937" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification</a> (or RCM), was originally a mod that filled in the narrative gaps while offering an alternate ending for KOTOR 2. As Aspyr officially revealed the restored content announcement, the studio confirmed that the official DLC would do the same thing: It would include new crew dialogue, an extra mission with HK-47, and a "new revamped ending." Unfortunately, when KOTOR 2 hit Nintendo Switch on June 8, 2022, the DLC never came out. Apparently, the reason why the DLC never dropped was that Disney's lawyers blocked it with what was apparently a sticking point surrounding who actually made the mod. And now, it appears a KOTOR 2 remake won't drop, either.</p>

            <guid>1376671</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>After months of meaning to get around to it, I finally pulled the plug on my Spotify subscription last week. There wasn't any one reason I wanted out, just an ever-growing collection of back-breaking straws:<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-12/spotify-boycott-daniel-ek-ai-music-military-tech-fenn-wilson/105765846?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>the CEO's support of genocide</u></a> was a big one, but you can throw in everything from its<a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/a-complete-guide-to-quitting-spotify?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>poor artist pay</u></a> to layoffs to, well,<a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ex-spotify-employee-exposes-wrapped-decay-2400-human-storytellers-replaced-cold-ai-logic-1760414?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>the fact the whole company just seems pretty terrible</u></a>.</p><p>A major factor in delaying the decision wasn't because none of that mattered to me--it all did!--but because having used various streaming services for almost 15 years now, changing them felt like work that I just didn't have time for. I had so many playlists and liked songs and albums to move, and the last time I'd done this--when I'd left Google Play Music for Spotify,<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/10/rip-google-play-music-2011-2020/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>after the former rebranded to YouTube Music and became a worse service in the process</u></a>--it had been a disaster, involving a ton of messing around and a ton of lost music.</p><figure><blockquote>

</blockquote>
</figure><p>But every man has his limits, and so last week–<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/03/spotify-wrapped-ai-create-your-own-playlists?ref=aftermath.site"><u>maybe it was just seeing everyone talking about their Spotify Wrapped, which sucks</u></a>--I finally pulled the pin, remembering it was just the latest in a succession of moves in my life where I've tried, however I can, to start putting my money where my mouth is. In the last couple of years I've installed solar on my roof, I've moved both my banking and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superannuation_in_Australia?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>superannuation</u></a><u> </u>(which is roughly an Australian 401K) to more<a href="https://www.bankaust.com.au/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>responsible</u></a><a href="https://www.australianethical.com.au/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>providers</u></a> and sold two gas-powered cars to buy a single electric vehicle. If I could do all <em>that</em>, I could move a fucking music service.</p><p>The act of cancelling my Spotify subscription itself was the easy part; the only speedbump ended up being the fact that, having been on an all-encompassing family plan, my daughter (who uses it as a kind of social media platform with her friends, exchanging playlists, etc) didn't want to budge. So we got her an individual membership and cut her loose from our plans; I'm not the kind of parent who is going to force my kids to go along with an ideological decision they can't fully grasp, so she can make the call on her own time as she gets older and, hopefully, a bit wiser.</p><blockquote>I found myself not looking for the best streaming platform, just trying to find the least worst. </blockquote><p>The hard part was choosing what to replace it with. Especially since I had some pretty stringent requirements. Spotify had worked for everyone, everywhere, so its successor needed to factor in that it was going to be providing music for me, my wife and my 12 year-old son, all of whom had different use cases. I have a Pixel, my wife has an iPhone, I listen to music on my desktop PC a lot, she prefers the kitchen speaker, I listen to a lot of music that might not be in every service's library and she doesn't, and our car runs on Google's Android Automotive, which has a limited selection of native music apps.</p><p>Given that last point, our first stop was YouTube Music. As YouTube Premium subscribers--you have to watch so many videos in this line of work that if I had to sit through ads I'd have lost years of my life--I already had access to YouTube Music, and it was also installed on my car. I quickly found that in the five years since I'd stopped using it little had changed: the app sucked shit, and the music quality was even worse, so it was almost instantly struck off the list.</p><p>Next was, uh, hrm.<a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/a-complete-guide-to-quitting-spotify?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>I'd read through Brian Merchant's excellent guide to cancelling Spotify earlier in the week</u></a>, and had also put out a call on social media for replacement suggestions, so had more than a few options to consider, but all of them seemed deeply compromised in some way. I just wasn't feeling Deezer, Amazon Music can go to hell and Tidal, while doing some things I liked (like paying artists more, and offering welcome sound quality options) had an app design and sharing features that just didn't sell me on it either.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:nhqvuggd6ebasluetrqfab6n/app.bsky.feed.post/3m74by6hv5s23" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreifrs32ex4jnxq4bm22bmjw5pyfsxdrht6pibrkl4djujh6r7pbqpe"><p lang="en">been shopping for a spotify alternative this week and this is grim stuff. its either volatile small guys who will be dead or bought out in 18 months or trying to decide which major tech platform you hate the least</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:nhqvuggd6ebasluetrqfab6n?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Luke Plunkett (@lukeplunkett.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:nhqvuggd6ebasluetrqfab6n/post/3m74by6hv5s23?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2025-12-03T20:23:29.531Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>It felt like every platform I was considering was either owned by the worst people on Earth, run by the worst people on Earth, looked like they weren't going to be around much longer or had huge holes in their offering that made them substantially less useful to me having just come off Spotify's ubiquity. Free of a contract and only now surveying the music streaming landscape in its entirety like this, it was bleak! This is what we've come to, this is the point these platforms and the economy driving them have led us to, a point where I found myself not looking for the best streaming platform, just trying to find the least worst.</p><p>Things seemed so bad that I considered making the next logical jump altogether, which was ditching streaming entirely. Maybe I could just start running a media server, put all my Bandcamp purchases and rips on there and go back to how I listened to music in 2007. If I was really worried about principles, I'd realise streaming as a concept is inherently fucked, that even in best-case scenarios it's all exploitative to artists, and that I needed to cut that cord completely.</p><p>But I am an imperfect man confronting a difficult situation: my whole family is now hooked on the convenience, on the recommendations and new release updates and playlist algorithms. Even if I could bring myself to make the break, there's little chance I'd be able to convince my wife and son to start screwing around with a media server and plugging a thumb drive into one of our car's USB slots.</p><p>So, streaming platforms it was.</p><p>Taking price, cross-platform compatibility, family plans, sound quality, artist pay, company ownership and user experience into account, and excluding the platforms I'd already dabbled in and struck off the list, I ended up with two services to pit against each other for my money: Apple Music and Qobuz.</p><p>Qobuz seemed great on paper! The folks there seem to genuinely care about music and artists in a way no other service (aside from maybe Tidal) do, and on average they paid artists <em>way </em>more than Spotify. But man, in AUD terms their pricing for their top tier (the one I was interested in) was <em>steep</em>. I realise the hypocrisy here of<a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025/"> <u>someone who regularly begs for money on the internet saying this</u></a>, someone who fully understands you can't pay other people properly unless you yourself are paid properly, but the AUD$37.49 per month Qobuz were asking for was just too much when I've already got that YouTube Premium subscription (and my daughter's Spotify) on the books. I also thought the mobile app, where I'd be using it a <em>lot</em>, wasn't great.</p><p>Which left me with one last option to try out: Apple Music. The cons here were enough to give me pause: my personal devices are almost all Google-based, there was no native car support (though there wasn't for Qobuz either), no podcast support within the same app and Apple, while not as genocide-friendly as Spotify, were still run by a guy who has<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/16/silicon-valley-ceo-trump-business-00564524?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>repeatedly embarrassed himself bending the knee</u></a>.</p><p>The pros were that Apple paid artists twice as much as Spotify, offered some lovely high-quality formats and the design of their app is lightyears ahead of the competition. So I took the plunge, installed it on a bunch of devices, kicked off a family plan and so far, so good.</p><p>The lossless audio sounds incredible on my car's sound system (even if I have to plug in my phone and use Android Auto to enjoy it). I love the desktop app, and the mobile app is beautiful. In a very Apple way everything is simple, clear and just <em>works</em>. Compared to YouTube Music's woes and Spotify's bloat, it's been a genuine pleasure opening up Apple Music and just...playing some music.</p><p>The best part though, and this would apply to anyone moving to or from any major platform these days, is that in the years since my last transition the process of transplanting your library has gotten a lot easier. I paid $5 for a one-month Soundiiz membership, hooked it up to both platforms and within 10 minutes I had copied my whole library over–albums, playlists, the works. My music collection in Apple Music now looks exactly like it did on Spotify without skipping a beat.</p><p>Actually that's not quite true; my library had been <em>improved </em>a little, with two of my favourite albums of all time now back in my collection (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/20/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-stu-mackenzie-interview-leaving-spotify-free-music?ref=aftermath.site"><u>King Gizzard had pulled both <em>Infest The Rat's Nest</em> and <em>PetroDragonic Apocalypse</em> in protest over Spotify's military investments</u></a>).</p><figure></figure><p>The whole experience ended up being much more painless on a technical level than I'd been expecting, but then, it had also wound up being more depressing than I'd bargained for. It feels like my move to Apple Music isn't the permanent one I'd been hoping for; it's more convenient at the moment, but it's far from a perfect situation. I know, in my heart, that I need to go back to just buying music off artists, ditching convenience for something that actually helps the people making the music I love so much.</p><p>The problem is that, like so many other things that are easy and ruinous in our lives at the moment--Netflix, Game Pass, etc--it's just too easy. I can't give up hours-long feeds of lo-fi electronic music while I work at my desk, or the luxury of being able to skip through entire artist catalogues in my car whenever the fancy takes me. Even though I've now made a slightly more palatable decision on where to spend my money, I am still part of the problem.</p><figure><a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/a-complete-guide-to-quitting-spotify?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>How to quit Spotify</p><p>This Black Friday, here’s a guide to finding the best Spotify alternative</p><p><span>Brian Merchant</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <title><![CDATA[The Battle Of The Translucent N64s Has Arrived]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/analogue-3d-color-n64-modretro-palmer-luckey-2000651467</link>
            <guid>1376659</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of the main things that’s distinguished Nintendo 64 clone the M64 from rival device the Analogue 3D, beyond being sold <a href="https://kotaku.com/m64-mario-kart-modretro-palmer-luckey-nintendo-64-1851786895">by an international arms dealer</a>, was its playful shape and colorful, translucent shell. But now Analogue has revealed its own translucent variants. There’s competition to see not just which device can run Nintendo 64 games the best but also which one looks the coolest. And not everyone’s happy about it.</p> <p>There are some other important differences between the M64 and Analogue 3D, however. Fully revealed over Black Friday weekend, ModRetro’s M64 is $200 compared to the $250 for the base Analogue 3D (matte black or white) and it features compatible controllers that are actually shaped like the old N64 ones (Analogue’s look like their existing 8Bitdo line-up). The other important difference, of course, is that the M64 isn’t shipping yet (there’s a <a href="https://modretro.com/pages/m64-green">waitlist you can sign-up for</a>). The Analogue 3D is already out.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The body is ready!  We can finally show the final design of the M64.  Three translucent colors are in manufacturing right now, more than a dozen on the way – goes on sale online and retail soon, we are releasing upcoming colors as easily swappable low-cost body kits! <a href="https://t.co/CnbTSKf7yd">https://t.co/CnbTSKf7yd</a></p> <p>— Palmer Luckey (@PalmerLuckey) <a href="https://twitter.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1994584120739950925?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But today, Analogue revealed the “Funtastic” variant of the 3D in “highly limited quantities.” This translucent version comes in eight different colors ranging from “Watermelon” magenta to see-through gold. Pre-orders go up on <a href="https://www.analogue.co/editions/3d-funtastic">December 10 at 11:00 a.m. ET,</a> and the Funtastic versions will cost $50 extra, rounding out the total price to $300. And that’s before adding on the new translucent controller variants which match the material and color of the consoles. These come separately at $45 each.</p>

 <p>Understandably, some people who’d already pre-ordered one of the existing Analogue 3D consoles in black or white are pissed off. “I just got mine, and now you drop these awesome colors?” wrote one owner. “Seriously? It feels like a slap in the face to early supporters. And yes, I’m reposting because your previous post disappeared.”</p>

 <p>Another wrote, “Why on earth didn’t you launch with this? instead, you announce it a few weeks after the 7 day return window for those who pre-ordered. what a convenient cash grab.” At least a few recent Analogue 3D purchasers say they’re going to try to get a refund anyway.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nah this is bs straight up. Delay console for nearly 2 years and pull a rug under us early adopters who waited patiently only to see you released funtastic colors nearly 2 weeks after everyone is getting their white and black units..</p> <p>— Kodaxx (@Kodaxx88) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kodaxx88/status/1998089537499881745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It is an odd move for a boutique retro gaming company that often skirts the line between fan hype and hyperbolic marketing. Analogue has a record of releasing alternative color schemes for its hardware. The company’s earlier Pockets eventually came out with all sorts of versions that channeled different aesthetic eras of the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance. Those didn’t get announced immediately after the initial launch, however.</p> <p>Part of the issue might be the Analogue 3D’s repeated delays this year. It was supposed to launch much earlier than it did, with mysterious manufacturing and shipping challenges, including likely hiccups around the president’s trade war with China, gumming up the original timeline. If so, however, it’s still unclear why the announcement of the “Funtastic” variants wasn’t pushed back to compensate.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[2K Games is Launching a New Studio Headed by ex-The Initiative Leadership]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Two former lead employees from The Initiative have launched a new studio for 2K Games. Previously, both members worked on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-and-xbox-no-longer-working-crystal-dynamics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the cancelled Perfect Dark title</a> for Xbox.</p>



<p>The Initiative was an ambitious new first-party studio for Microsoft/Xbox and led by former Crystal Dynamics head, Darrell Gallagher. It brought in many notable figures from studios like Rockstar, Santa Monica Studios, and Naughty Dog. The studio’s first title was announced to be a remake/reboot of Perfect Dark. Unfortunately, earlier this year, the game was cancelled and The Initiative was shut down. Now, two former employees, including Darrell himself, are heading up a new studio for 2K Games.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7403902973464014848/?originTrackingId=juNbzYzc45PM4zhZ2yaPjg%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a LinkedIn post</a>, former studio head of The Initiative, Darrell Gallagher, announced that he’ll be joining a new studio for 2K Games. He’ll join as SVP, Studio Head of the yet-to-be-named studio. His message can be found below:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>I’m excited to share that I will be joining 2K as SVP, Studio Head, where I’ll be building a new studio and leading an ambitious opportunity unlike anything I’ve taken on before</strong>,” says Gallagher. “<strong>I’ve spent my career believing in what’s possible when great people come together with a bold vision. I can’t wait to get started with the exceptional team at 2K!</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Furthermore, Brian Horton, former Creative Director at The Initiative for Perfect Dark, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7403908881246318592/?originTrackingId=CgNwdSlyrogNLDJN1Ms7OQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced on LinkedIn</a> that he will join Darrell as VP Head of Creative. Prior to The Initiative, Horton served as Creative Director for Marvel’s Spider-Man and the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-gta6-fall-2026-insomniac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s Wolverine</a>. No information was shared regarding any other talent joining or what the game may be. Either way, it is a pretty big snag and may give fans a peek as to what stories The Initiative would have told if not disbanded.</p>
