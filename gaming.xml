		<p>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land has been announced today by Koei Tecmo, during the Nintendo Direct. While it was shown on Nintendo’s show, Atelier Yumia is not a Switch exclusive, with Koei Tecmo confirming that the game will be released on PC, PS5, PS4, Switch, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. The Xbox versions mark the first time the series has been available on Microsoft’s consoles.</p>

<p>Outside of the teaser trailer, nothing has really been detailed about the game. But, the development team at Gust will be hosting a livestream on September 2nd that is going to go into detail about Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land. The stream will be happening at 13:00 BST, and it will be streamed in Japanese only.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/12/atelier-marie-remake-the-alchemist-of-salburg-review/">Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg Review</a></h2>
<p>The last Atelier game we reviewed was Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg, and in that review Miguel said,<em> “Atelier Marie Remake is simultaneously a return to form and a fresh step forward for the Atelier series. It’s incredible to experience the roots of this series, and as sad as I am about the barebones storytelling, the shifted focus to time-management and calendar events gives the game an addictive farm-simulator vibe that kept me glued to it for hours. I’m excited to see how ideas from this remake come forward to inspire whatever this series has in store for us next.”</em></p>

<p>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land is set to release in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-direct-2024-highlights-future-of-dd-and-showcases-project-sigil<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Only a few weeks away from the release of the 2024 Player Handbook Wizards of the Coast has put on Dungeons &amp; Dragons Direct 2024. The D&amp;D Direct 2024 offered us a final look on the 2024 PHB before it's release, where D&amp;D is looking to go for the immediate future, and it also provided us with more information on Project Sigil, the 3D VTT offering that is currently taking sign-ups for the Closed Beta period.</p>
<p>D&amp;D Direct began with a sizzle reel of fans and creators highlighting the memories that they've all had playing D&amp;D together whether it be playing the games, building relationships, or watching Actual Plays like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a9a9913f-42e9-4189-bbde-08061c01a7e8" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/matthew-mercer-interview">Critical Role</a>&nbsp;with footage as recent as Gencon from last month.</p>

<h2>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Player Handbook</h2>
<p>Starting off we get to see designers for the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Player Handbook talking about each of the changes that fans can expect when they get their hands on the new Player Handbook. Some highlighted changes are silly like the Cat finally having Darkvision, while others fundamentally reshape the way you build your character like with added Origins.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you're interested in learning what we think of the 2024 Player Handbook then you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong">check out our full review</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>D&amp;DBeyond integration was also discussed, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ddbeyond-details-changes-in-functionality-with-2024-core-rulebook-release-spells">something that recently came under fire before WOTC reversed the decision</a>.</p>
<p>Moving on from that the Dungeon Master Guide was discussed, such as the increased options in the Treasure section, and the Monster Manual with is going to be "packed with the most monsters."</p>
<p>The PHB will also be available in French, German, Italian, and Spanish to make sure globally players can hop into the game with as little barrier of entry needed.</p>

<p>To start off talking about the future of D&amp;D an adventure anthology based on Dragons was announced. Simple titles Dragon Anthology at this time, and releasing in early 2025 this collection will contain 10 adventures "all about dragons, in dungeons."</p>
<p>There will also be a new Starter Set releasing as a new way for groups who haven't played before to get into the game with the new ruleset. Set in the Borderlands players will go to the Keep, the Wilderness, and the Caves of Chaos.&nbsp;</p>

There are Secret Lair x Dungeons &amp; Dragons Magic The Gathering cards that are available now, and in a few short weeks a collection of LEGO Minifigures based on D&amp;D characters will also be released.</p>
<p>2025 will also feature two Setting books for Dungeons &amp; Dragons set in the Forgotten Realms. This will be broken into two books, the Forgotten Realms Player Guide that will go over player options including new sub-classes, Origins, Feats, and more. There will also be information about different known and currently unknown factions that players can join, two that were named were the Harpers and the Red Wizards of Thay.</p>
<p>The Forgotten Realms Dungeon Master Guide will cover the different parts of the realm, highlighting them by there theme. If you want to run an urban adventure or a horror adventure the guide will prompt you with ideas and tools to bring those ideas to life.</p>
<h2>Project Sigil</h2>
<p>For Project Sigil not too much more was revealed about the 3D VTT. This system is still token based, so you and your party will be rolling physics based dice and moving miniatures around a 3D space. You'll be able to build a world, but also fill it with props and even add sound and visual elements.</p>
<p>It was even shown off that a 2D map that you might use in the currently available D&amp;DBeyond map tool can be used in Sigil allowing you to place miniatures on the map like you would with a printed map.</p>

<p>Interestingly it was highlighted that while it's a tool being made by D&amp;D they are also opening it up to any platform as a place to create landscapes, populate it with tokens, and then roll dice. A brief glimpse of gameplay showed Drizzt facing off against Optimus Prime.</p>
<p>With an initial release planned for PC WOTC wants to allow this system to come to mobile and consoles. This will be free to try out, but no further word on what pricing could look like or what microtransactions couple be available other than to say&nbsp;DMs will get more advanced tools. The Closed Beta will be releasing this fall.</p>

Though it’s not a 1:1 recreation of the Dreamcast game, Keanu Reeves’ Shadow the Hedgehog is primed as the main villain this time around, with Jim Carrey’s Doctor Robotnik seemingly teaming up with the blue blur to take down a planet-wide threat. But this trailer has a lot to pick through, so we figured we’d break down the 3-minute video and see what else we can glean. Grab your rings and chili dogs and let’s dive in.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="660d202722a8c1af76ca3412aae8f892" data-recommend-id="image://660d202722a8c1af76ca3412aae8f892" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tom and Sonic look at a chalk drawing of Longclaw." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tom and Sonic look at a chalk drawing of Longclaw." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="660d202722a8c1af76ca3412aae8f892" data-recommend-id="image://660d202722a8c1af76ca3412aae8f892" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tom and Sonic look at a chalk drawing of Longclaw." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In the live-action movies, Sonic has a pretty sad backstory that surprisingly mirrors Shadow’s in the games. In the first film, we saw Sonic being chased away from his home and sent away by Longclaw, his owl caretaker, for his own safety. If <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-shadow-maria-death-actor-1851227374&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-shadow-maria-death-actor-1851227374">follows Shadow’s origin story from the games closely</a></span>, he has a pretty similar moment that turns him towards chaos and destruction. We can already see in the trailer that Sonic is reflecting on his past, including some chalk drawings of him and Longclaw together. James Marsden’s Tom Wachowski is seen talking to Sonic about how he never let that tragedy change him. Later in the trailer,Tom Butler’s Commander Walters makes the comparison between Sonic and Shadow more directly, though he points out that Sonic found friends and family, while Shadow has no one.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d96988d32d8e1e61461fe9fb73827f95" data-recommend-id="image://d96988d32d8e1e61461fe9fb73827f95" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow punches through his pod." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow punches through his pod." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d96988d32d8e1e61461fe9fb73827f95" data-recommend-id="image://d96988d32d8e1e61461fe9fb73827f95" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow punches through his pod." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Throughout the trailer, we see Shadow breaking out of a stasis pod and fighting his way through squads of G.U.N. agents. This is why Commander Walters asks Sonic and his friends for help. It’s clear conventional weapons aren’t enough to take down an immortal, superpowered hedgehog. This means we also get to watch Shadow beat the shit out of the institution that was likely the cause of his tragic backstory. We see the black-and-red hedgehog teleport around the group and lay them out as they fail to keep up with him. Shadow seems to be doing this right out of his pod, so it’s unclear if he’ll be using a Chaos Emerald to power these abilities as he does in the games.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="107770dc5473e144ead8aba722a042bb" data-recommend-id="image://107770dc5473e144ead8aba722a042bb" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow and Maria look at each other through glass." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow and Maria look at each other through glass." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="107770dc5473e144ead8aba722a042bb" data-recommend-id="image://107770dc5473e144ead8aba722a042bb" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow and Maria look at each other through glass." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Furiosa </em>actor Alyla Browne is joining the live-action cast as Maria Robotnik, Doctor Robotnik’s cousin and granddaughter of Doctor Gerald Robotnik, Shadow’s creator. In the games, Shadow was the result of an experiment to find the cure for a deadly illness Maria had that prevented her from living on Earth. The two bonded on a space colony that supported Maria’s life and was also home to Robotnik’s experiments searching for a cure. In the games, Maria was tragically killed by a raid on the space station, which imbues Shadow with a vengeful rage and a desire to destroy the world. The trailer paints a pretty explicit picture that this is probably what’s going on in the movie, though it’s unclear now how much of the extended lore the movie will get into beyond Shadow and Maria’s relationship.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9d7ee93741a029490c443de795bc4240" data-recommend-id="image://9d7ee93741a029490c443de795bc4240" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles race." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles race." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9d7ee93741a029490c443de795bc4240" data-recommend-id="image://9d7ee93741a029490c443de795bc4240" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles race." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To juxtapose the sad shit, we see Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles doing fun things with their human adult parents Tom and Maddie, like racing against one another in the forests of Green Hills, Montana.

Shadow needs a loving hand to reach out and show him there’s another way so he, too, can race them in a forest instead of doing terrorism.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="50e0689163e3368f097c6d1f47117dd3" data-recommend-id="image://50e0689163e3368f097c6d1f47117dd3" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tails flies over Tokyo in a helicopter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tails flies over Tokyo in a helicopter." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="50e0689163e3368f097c6d1f47117dd3" data-recommend-id="image://50e0689163e3368f097c6d1f47117dd3" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tails flies over Tokyo in a helicopter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Miles “Tails” Prower is a known pilot, and we saw him flying the Tornado plane in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em>.

We see Carrey also playing Gerald Robotnik. In the games, Gerald is long gone by the time Shadow reawakens and attempts to destroy the world. Here, we see both grandfather and grandson meet and hug it out. Gerald was the secret villain of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, who put things into motion before his death to destroy the world in an act of vengeance for Maria’s death. The whole big emotional turn of that game is that Shadow remembers Maria’s final wish to bring hope to humanity and saves the world rather than destroying it. So if Gerald is still alive, I’m curious to see how <em>Sonic 3 </em>handles this storyline. It’s also not out of the question that Robotnik could be talking to his grandfather through some magical mumbo jumbo, as the <em>Knuckles</em> show established that the dead can speak to the living. I’m not used to Gerald Robotnik being portrayed as anything other than a grieving mad scientist, so we’ll see where this is going.<br></p><hr><p>Sadly, it does look like <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>will be omitting Rouge the Bat and Amy Rose, two key players in the <em>Sonic Adventure 2 </em>story, unless they pull a <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home </em>and keep them out of the marketing. But I also wouldn’t be surprised if they wanted to streamline Shadow’s debut for the film given the shorter runtime, and that might mean that Rouge and the layers she brings to the story may have to be left on the cutting room floor.</p><p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>premieres on December 20. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-makes-playstation-splatoon-shooter-foamstars-free-to-play-8-months-after-launch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/foamstars">Foamstars</a>, Square Enix’s take on Nintendo's mega-hit Splatoon series, is set to go free-to-play just eight months after launch.</p><p>The four versus four online party shooter launched across PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 in February 2024 as a premium product (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-picks-up-splatoon-like-foamstars-as-a-month-long-playstation-plus-exclusive-on-ps4-and-ps5">and straight into PS Plus for a month</a>). IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/foamstars-review">Foamstars review</a> returned a 6/10. We said: "Foamstars' combat mechanics are unexpectedly engaging, but confounding time-gated modes and aggressive monetization make them harder to enjoy." It goes free-to-play starting October 4, 2024.</p><p>Currently, a PlayStation Plus subscription is required to play Foamstars, but after going free to play, all PS4 and PS5 owners can play for free. “Your continued support of Foamstars would be greatly appreciated,” Square Enix said in a post on its support site.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Foamstars Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Square Enix said it plans to give existing Foamstars owners a free “Legacy Gift” that includes these exclusive in-game items:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>12 exclusive color-variant Bubble Beastie skins</li><li>1 exclusive Slide Board design</li><li>1 title: “Legacy”</li></ul><p>Foamstars is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-final-fantasy-16-and-foamstars-all-failed-to-meet-square-enixs-expectations">one of three recently released Square Enix games to disappoint sales wise</a>. In May, Square Enix admitted <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi"><u>Final Fantasy 16</u></a>, and Foamstars all failed to meet its expectations for revenue and profit, resulting in an overall hit to operating income for the business. Square Enix has yet to announce a sales figure for Foamstars.</p><p>It did, however, announce a significant company reboot amid tumbling profits. Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth both launched as PlayStation 5 exclusives, and Foamstars launched on PS4 and PS5 only, but Square Enix said it will now “aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Overall, it’s a tough time for Square Enix, with a number of layoffs across its western business amid extensive restructuring. Dawntrail, the expansion for ongoing MMO Final Fantasy 14, launched in late June. Square Enix also has Kingdom Hearts 4, the third game in the Final Fantasy remake trilogy, and Dragon Quest 12 in the works. In January, Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida said it might be time for a younger generation to lead the franchise and helm Final Fantasy 17.</p><p>As for Foamstars, it seems unlikely a sequel will be developed any time soon.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Speleologist is a new Solar machine gun that makes a pretty decent alternative to Fixed Odds from the Duality dungeon, allowing you to dump a lot of damage on tough enemies or take out a lot of little ones very quickly. The rapid-fire frame machine gun offers a 900 RPM fire rate, which mean it'll fire a lot of ammo <em>very</em> fast--and it's great for clearing out enemies in a hurry, especially in high-end content. With some extremely useful Solar-specific perks, the Speleologist god roll can also complement the rest of your Echoes weapons and fit well with your Solar builds.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Get_Speleologist">How To Get Speleologist</a></li><li><a href="#Speleologist_God_Rolls">Speleologist God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#Speleologist_PvE_God_Roll">Speleologist PvE God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#Speleologist_PvP_God_Roll">Speleologist PvP God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Get_Speleologist">How To Get Speleologist</h2><p dir="ltr">As with the other Echoes weapons, Speleologist is part of the episode's loot pool, so it's most easily earned as a random drop from completing Echoes activities, including Battlegrounds, Enigma Protocol, and Breach Executable. You're also guaranteed one roll of the weapon for completing the Echoes weekly story missions, adding it to your collections. As with other Echoes guns, if you're looking to visit Failsafe and tune Echoes Engrams to get Speleologist drops, you'll need to first complete Act 3's new Nessus Sample missions to unlock that upgrade. Speleologist is craftable, like the other Echoes guns, so you can eventually build your own version of the gun with enhanced perks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4357860-destiny2speleologist.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4357860" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4357860-destiny2speleologist.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4357860"></a><figcaption>Speleologist</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4357860-destiny2speleologist.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Speleologist_God_Rolls">Speleologist God Rolls</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Speleologist_PvE_God_Roll">Speleologist PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Arrowhead Brake / Fluted Barrel  <ul><li dir="ltr">Arrowhead Brake: +30 Recoil, +10 Handling</li><li dir="ltr">Fluted Barrel: +5 Stability, +15 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Appended Mag / Tactical Mag  <ul><li dir="ltr">Appended Mag: +14 Magazine</li><li dir="ltr">Tactical Mag: +7 Magazine, +5 Stability, +10 Reload Speed</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Enlightened Action / Envious Assassin  <ul><li dir="ltr">Enlightened Action: Dealing damage significantly improves reload speed and handling.</li><li dir="ltr">Envious Assassin: Defeating targets with other weapons before drawing this one transfers additional ammo to the magazine from reserves.

While it's maybe not the best one you can get, it rolls perks that are reliably useful even if you're not speccing into a build that does a ton to synergize with them. In the barrel and magazine departments, you'll probably want to focus on the stability stat to make sure you can consistently land critical hits as you're dumping ammo. Choices that boost magazine size, handling, and reload speed are also useful so that you can swap to Speleologist quickly, shoot a lot of bullets, and get it back in the fight fast.</p><p dir="ltr">For perks, Enlightened Action is a strong option for boosting reload speed, making up for boosting the stat elsewhere. You can also go with Envious Assassin to get as many bullets into your first magazine as possible. Incandescent is your go-to here, as it's a great add-on to a weapon that's already phenomenal for clearing enemies in dangerous situations, and you don't need to run a Solar build to take advantage of the cascading Scorch explosions. Killing Tally can also be fun, boosting the gun's damage against tougher enemies once you use it to wipe out some smaller ones. Add either to Radiolaria Transposer, which causes enemies to explode into a pool of radiolaria when you get multiple kills, and Speleologist is a great option to wipe out armies.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Speleologist_PvP_God_Roll">Speleologist PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Polygonal Rifling / Hammer-Forged Rifling  <ul><li dir="ltr">Polygonal Rifling: +10 Stability</li><li dir="ltr">Hammer-Forged Rifling: +10 Range</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Accurized Rounds / Steady Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">Accurized Rounds: +10 Range</li><li dir="ltr">Steady Rounds: +15 Stability, -5 Range, +7 Airborne Effectiveness</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Slideways / Firmly Planted  <ul><li dir="ltr">Slideways: Sliding partially reloads this weapon's magazine and temporarily boosts handling and stability greatly.</li><li dir="ltr">Firmly Planted: Greatly increased accuracy, stability, and handling when firing while crouched.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Killing Tally  <ul><li dir="ltr">Killing Tally: Final blows increase this weapon's damage until it is stowed or reloaded. Improves magazine size.\</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Stability</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Speleologist shouldn't be your first choice for a PvP machine gun, but it's serviceable. Range is generally your primary point of focus on Crucible guns, but you'll also want to boost stability to keep your shots on target. Slideways and Firmly Planted will both boost stability and help you make quick kills, so pick the one that best fits your playstyle. For secondary perks, Killing Tally is good if you're able to take Speleologist on a multi-kill rampage, boosting your damage on multiple kills without you having to worry about it.</p>

			<p>Balatro is an indie game that took the world by storm when it was first released in February 2024. It is regarded as one of the most unique games out there. It combines Poker with roguelike elements, making for a time-consuming experience. Today, it was announced during Nintendo's Indie Direct that Balatro will be receiving its first collaboration with four hit games. The update is completely free and will be released today across all platforms, named Balatro: Friends of Jimbo.</p>
<p><iframe title="Balatro: Friends of Jimbo – Reveal Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8188WZxHSkU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This update</a> is entirely cosmetic; players won't need to worry about purchasing anything. The update includes collaborations with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-reputation-system-mod/">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, Dave the Diver, Vampire Survivors and Among Us. This update allows players to use themed decks from each of the collaborators if they find that they are bored of using the normal cards that come with Balatro, or they just want a change in aesthetic.</p>
<p>While the trailer does give Balatro players a glimpse into the decks available, the trailer was quite short, with a duration just over one minute. However, the trailer did showcase the key aesthetics from each collaboration, with players able to use cards in-game that have Geralt of Rivia, Yennefer of Vengerberg and Jaskier the Bard on them, for example.</p>
<p>While it's said to be purely cosmetic, it's possible that these new decks could feature some cards that bring new twists to the game and add a new level of variety to Balatro for those who have sunk a considerable amount of time into it. Even if it doesn't, it adds a cool extra level of customization for those who want to be able to pick and choose a deck to play with rather than just the standard base game one.</p>
<p>While the Balatro: Friends of Jimbo update is a small cosmetic update that is available today to everyone across all platforms, it's said that there is a major update coming in 2025 to the game, which will "bring new ideas and strategies to the game." What that could entail remains to be seen, but what we do know is that the first major update for this time-sink game is that it will be completely free as a "token of huge appreciation to the game's brilliant and passionate community."</p>
