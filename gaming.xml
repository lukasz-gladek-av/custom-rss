            <p>Another 136,000 ranked play accounts have been banned for cheating across both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone.</p>
<p>In a detailed update shared on social media, developer Treyarch said it recognised cheaters "are frustrating and severely impact the experience for our community" but insisted it was addressing the issue, and will continue to do so "throughout 2025".</p>

</div><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 and Mario Kart 9 have been revealed - but questions remain.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyPgPcxLlIk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Part of these efforts include "new layers of security and protections", as well as updated detection models for behavioural systems like aim botting, and "other data points", including "account trust and hardware identifiers to target serial cheaters".</p>
<p>Players can also expect new detection and warning systems for spam reporting and enhanced cross-examination tools to reduce the time it takes to review reports.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Ahead of Season 02’s launch, we’re here to discuss what the various dev teams and studios are doing right now to address what matters to our players today:</p><p>• Cheating and bans<br>• Ability to disable cross-play on consoles in Ranked<br>• Server issues<br>• Quality of life updates<br>•… <a href="https://t.co/O6traEfwwG">https://t.co/O6traEfwwG</a></p></div>— Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1880372557221884278?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>From Season 2, players can expect to see new and improved client and server-side detections and systems, too, as well as "major" kernel-level driver updates that not only improve driver security, but also reinforce the encryption process and introduce a new tampering detection system.</p><p>Treyarch stressed that "malicious reporting is against the security and enforcement policy", adding that when a user spams the report button in-game multiple times against a user – or someone uses an illegal cheat tool to spam 10,000 reports – its system "does not consider more than one single report from a player versus another (despite what cheat developers are telling players when they try to sell their illegal software)".</p>
<p>Interestingly, when a cheater is banned, the developer's system will also "detect other accounts it had regularly partied up with and raise flags for investigation to combat boosting and other cheater behaviour".</p>
<p>"We have seen community questions about detection methods, like IP-based banning," the studio explained. "We do not utilise IP-based bans for anti-cheat because they tend to take action against entire groups within a range that aren't problematic. For example, a college campus or internet café would be swept up in an IP-based ban wave when only a single machine was targeted."</p>
<p>ICYMI, as Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 readies for the release of Season 2 on 28th January, developer Treyarch has shared initial details of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-next-zombies-map-is-called-the-tomb-and-plunges-players-into-ancient-catacombs">Zombies mode's next map, The Tomb</a> - which plunges players deep beneath the earth, down into ancient catacombs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tiktok-is-already-starting-to-come-back-online-in-the-us/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>TikTok has stated that their services will return online following the services ban earlier today.</p>



<p>The statement came from the official X (formerly Twitter) account of TikTok, which reads:</p>



<p>“In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.”</p>



<p>They continued, “It’s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.”</p>



<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/us-tiktok-ban-statement-issued/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok was forced to limit its service</a> to US residents following the United States’ decision to ban the app due to “safety and security concerns.” Other countries, including the UK have said that they would not follow the US in banning the app, despite widespread reports that US allies may impose similar bans.</p>



<p>Darren Jones, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury in the UK said cats and dancing videos do not “seem like a national security threat.”</p>



<p>TikTok’s ban was said to impact some 170 million users who use the social media app, with tens of thousands of content creators and small business using it as a source of revenue.</p>



<p>The ban also meant that Marvel Snap, the competitive digital collectible card game developed by Second Dinner, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-snap-taken-down-in-u-s-due-to-governments-tiktok-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also banned in the US</a>. Second Dinner, who said they had no idea about the ban, is yet to comment on when Marvel Snap will return to US residents. </p>

			<p>2025 is going to see a lot of massive releases across a multitude of genres. Narrowing it down to the sports and racing games in particular, there are a fair few games that are going to be released this year that will be major hits for petrolheads and sports fans. If you want to know what games you should be putting on your calendar this year, make sure to keep reading for Wccftech's most anticipated sports and racing games of 2025.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPG</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2025-new-scares-inbound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a></em></p>

<h2>Assetto Corsa EVO (Out Now on PC via Steam)</h2>
<p>Assetto Corsa is a very popular racing game franchise, and the latest iteration has just been released, albeit on early access. There isn't a date set yet for when Assetto Corsa EVO is going to be on consoles just yet, so those on console will have to wait a little bit longer for this hyperrealistic racing game. What we do know is that Assetto Corsa EVO is set to have its full launch between September and December. The game will feature extensive modding support, as well as consistent updates to keep the game fresh once it has experienced its full launch, when it will include 100 cars and 15 officially licensed circuits (with 5 more tracks following afterward as free updates). Before that, KUNOS <a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-evo-to-get-open-world-map-in-summer-2025-early-access-begins-january-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will add an open world map sometime this Summer</a>.</p>
<p>If you jump in right now, though, you'll already find 20 cars from several classes and 5 circuits across the continents: Laguna Seca (America), Brands Hatch and Imola (Europe), Mount Panorama (Australia), and Suzuka (Japan). When it comes to modes, the early access launch build features Practice sessions, Quick Races, the brand new Driving Academy, and the Hotstint and Test Drive special events.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>WWE 2K25 (March 2025)</h2>
<p>WWE is a popular franchise that helps boost profits for both Take-Two Interactive. This game was mentioned during the earnings call, where they mentioned both the potential release of PGA Tour 2K25 and, of course, WWE 2K25. Since 2000, WWE has received a new game every year except for 2021, where there was no game released at all. Since then, it's gone back to regular scheduling, and it's likely that WWE 2K25 will be released this year. It doesn't have a set release date as of yet, but it was mentioned in the earnings call that the game will be released before March 31, 2025. This would make sense, as the past three WWE games (including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much-improved WWE 2K24</a>) were all released in early March.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>iRacing NASCAR 25 (Fall 2025 - PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>It's been a long time coming, but NASCAR fans are finally getting a new game in the franchise. It's been three years since the last iteration aside from NASCAR 21: Ignition, but most people don't count that as an actual game in the series. iRacing NASCAR 25 was first heard of in 2023, when iRacing purchased the NASCAR license from Motorsport Games. This game will be built in Unreal Engine alongside Monster Games and is currently planned to launch on consoles, while a PC release is still up in the air.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/maxresdefault-14-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds (TBA - All Platforms)</h2>
<p>This game was first showcased at The Game Awards 2024, where Sega released a trailer for this upcoming game. The release date is currently unknown, but it is set to debut "soon." All we know is that the developers have promised a distinct racing mechanic that will 'transport Sonic racing fans into a new dimension.'</p>
<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will be available across all platforms (including Nintendo's) and, like its predecessor <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/team-sonic-racing-better-together/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Team Sonic Racing</a>, could be the perfect game to get youngsters into gaming and engage in some friendly competition.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Wreckfest_2_Keyart-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Wreckfest 2 (TBA 2025 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>Throughout the whole sports and racing games genre, there isn't anything quite like Wreckfest. The spiritual successor to FlatOut <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckfest-2-announced-with-new-car-customization-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returns in 2025</a> after 2018's first installment. We don't know a lot about it yet, although Finnish developer Bugbear Entertainment has promised improved destruction thanks to the more accurate physics engine and better sounds, with the latter being boasted as among the best in a racing title. So far, the main new feature is the ability to customize your vehicle. More info will undoubtedly be shared ahead of the launch.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-snap-goes-offline-in-the-usa-as-part-of-the-bytedance-apps-ban.1086411/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/19/marvel-snap-goes-offline-in-the-usa-as-part-of-the-bytedance-apps-ban/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>From today, mobile users in the United States of America cannot access any apps that are owned by the Chinese company ByteDance Ltd. ByteDance Ltd has ceased operations following the upholding of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which bans any foreign adversary apps from essentially operating in the USA. The biggest app shutdown is TikTok, which was the primary target of the legislation. However, in the app US users will see that ByteDance is hoping the app will be back online, saying they hope President Trump will work with them.</p>
<p>One unexpected app shutdown is Marvel Snap, which developers Second Dinner and publisher Nuverse did not expect. Nuverse is a subsidiary of ByteDance Ltd, and falls under the ban brought in with the legislation. Ben Brode, co-founder of Second Dinner, released the following statement regarding the banning of Marvel Snap on social media, including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benbrode.bsky.social">BlueSky</a>.</p>


<p><em>“Unfortunately, MARVEL SNAP is temporarily unavailable in U.S. app stores and is unavailable to play in the U.S. This was a surprise to Second Dinner and our publisher Nuverse. We’re actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible and will update you once we have more to share.”</em></p>
<p>In a follow up post, Ben has said that US players using VPNs should be able to get around the ban and continue playing Marvel Snap. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121596">Apple</a> has also created a support page regarding the Bytedance apps ban, and listed the following apps as no longer available in the US.</p>

<ul>
<li>TikTok</li>
<li>TikTok Studio</li>
<li>TikTok Shop Seller Center</li>
<li>CapCut</li>
<li>Lemon8</li>
<li>Hypic</li>
<li>Lark – Team Collaboration</li>
<li>Lark – Rooms Display</li>
<li>Lark Rooms Controller</li>
<li>Gauth: AI Study Companion</li>
<li>MARVEL SNAP</li>
</ul>
<p>It is currently unknown if the ban will remain in place, with incoming President Trump stating he is likely to give TikTok, and by extension ByteDance, a 90 day reprieve when he takes office. That would overrule the Supreme Court’s ruling of upholding the ban. This is a change in the message from Trump’s previous term in office where he publicly stated opposition to TikTok and was in support of a ban, as reported by <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-tiktok-timeline-1.7432843">CBC</a>.</p>

This is the Switch successor I was hoping for.</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/95396-severance?language=en-US"><strong><em>Severance </em>season 2</strong></a><strong>. </strong>I just rewatched the first season and loved it even more the second time. One of my favorite shows in years, and by all accounts, the second season is worth the wait. I’d put the first season up against any season of anything, so that’s high praise.</li><li><a href="https://nokiadesignarchive.aalto.fi/"><strong>The Nokia Design Archive</strong></a><strong>. </strong>A bunch of researchers spent several years putting together a massive, interconnected history of Nokia’s design work —&nbsp;from its wacky phone concepts to its biggest ideas about the future of everything.

Often, it’ll be a writer’s first day on, like, the day of the iPhone launch, or they’ll be 15 minutes out of HR orientation and Elon Musk will suddenly buy Twitter. For <a href="https://www.threads.net/@todd.haselton"><strong>Todd Haselton</strong></a>, our new deputy editor for reviews and commerce, the chaos was CES. Todd started at the beginning of this year and was immediately inundated with 90,000 stories about weird gadgets nobody’s ever heard of. Welcome to the team!</p><p>I like to ask new <em>Verge</em> staffers to share their homescreen with us to see what we can learn about them by how they use their phone. You can fake it at work, but you can’t fake your phone, you know? Here’s Todd’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps he uses and why:</p><p><strong>The phone: </strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max. I’ve been using the biggest iPhone for years. I also have an old Galaxy Z Fold 3 that I’ve been thinking about upgrading to another folding phone.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The wallpaper: </strong>It’s a picture of me at my graduation from Lehigh University with my grandfather and my uncle, who also went to Lehigh. They’re my role models. It’s a reminder to myself to work hard and to be thankful for what I have. (My twin brother is cut off in this shot. Sorry, bro.)</p><p>My lockscreen background is a rotating picture of my family.</p><p><strong>The apps: </strong>Photos, Calendar, GroupMe, Xbox Cloud Gaming, ChatGPT, Gmail, The Verge, Messages, Phone, Safari, Camera.</p><p>David, are you sure you wanted me to do this? It might be the most boring homescreen you’ve ever published. It’s almost the default.</p><p><a href="https://groupme.com/"><strong>GroupMe</strong></a> is for staying in touch with my college friends and also where my town’s volunteer fire department keeps in touch. I haven’t been as active as I’d like to be since the summer. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fplay"><strong>Xbox Cloud Gaming</strong></a> is there because I always tell myself I’m going to have all this free time for gaming on the go. But I don’t.</p><p>The photo frame widget rotates pictures of trips I’ve taken and family members. This is a shot from my brother’s wedding in Santa Monica.</p><p>Just in case people think it’s rigged: the<em> Verge</em> icon was there before I started. I’ve been reading since the site was started, and I subscribed before I joined.</p><p><em>I also asked Todd to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he said:</em></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/172494/angle-of-repose-by-wallace-stegner/"><em><strong>Angle of Repose</strong></em></a><em> </em>by Wallace Stegner. I just started it so don’t ask me what it’s about. I spend most nights reading on a Kindle Paperwhite. If you’re looking for other recommendations, though, some other books I just finished and enjoyed: <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/678664/trust-pulitzer-prize-winner-by-hernan-diaz/"><em><strong>Trust</strong></em></a> by Hernan Diaz, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/191134/stoner-by-john-williams-introduction-by-john-mcgahern/"><em><strong>Stoner</strong></em></a> by John Williams, and <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/176616/the-little-friend-by-donna-tartt/"><em><strong>The Little Friend</strong></em></a> by Donna Tartt.</li><li>I mostly game on Friday nights with my college friends from about 9PM to 11PM. (We’re all dads now, so… early bedtimes.) It’s a ritual we started during the pandemic, and it’s a good and totally mindless way for us to stay in touch. Gamers are gonna hate, but right now, it’s <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blackops6/pc"><em><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</strong></em></a><em> </em>with the Nuketown map on repeat. Just a classic map.</li><li>I’ve been really into the McDonald’s two-cheeseburger meal. It’s a little restaurant nearby with good prices, and the burgers are solid. I <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.doordash.com%2Fbusiness%2Fmcdonalds-5579%2F"><strong>get it DoorDashed</strong></a>.

<p>According to developer Second Dinner, the ban was every bit as much a "surprise" to the team as it was to players, too.</p>

			<p>The extremely popular collectible card game Marvel Snap suddenly became inaccessible to United States users <a href="https://wccftech.com/tiktok-officially-banned-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the TikTok ban</a> due to the implementation of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA). Here's the message that greets anyone who tries to log in (also available <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880861537981944300" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on social channels</a>):</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, MARVEL SNAP is temporarily unavailable on U.S. stores and is unavailable to play in the U.S. In a surprise to Second Dinner and our publisher Nuverse, MARVEL SNAP was affected by the takedown of TikTok late on Saturday, January 18th.</em></p>
<p><em>MARVEL SNAP isn't going anywhere. We're actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible and will update you once we have more to share.</em></p>
<p>The reason is pretty straightforward: TikTok creator ByteDance owns Nuverse, the publisher of the game. All apps owned by ByteDance were banned, including Marvel Snap. However, since the game itself isn't related to TikTok at all, there may be enough wiggle room for them to restore service.</p>
<p>Developed by Second Dinner, the free-to-play game launched in October 2022 for Windows PC, Android, and iOS devices. It featured over 170 Marvel characters on release, and the roster has greatly increased over time due to weekly additions.</p>
<p>Gameplay in Marvel Snap isn't too complicated. Each player has a deck of 12 cards, each one representing a Marvel character with a cost, power level, and possibly a special ability. At the beginning of each round, players simultaneously place one or more cards face down in one of three locations. The locations are randomly assigned for each game, and each location has a unique associated effect. At the end of each round, the cards are revealed and their special abilities are triggered. Whoever has the highest power in a given location wins that location; the goal is to win two of the three locations.</p>
<p>Its relative simplicity won over many fans. Last we heard, Marvel Snap had over 22 million players and has earned more than $200 million in revenue since launch.</p>

<p>Genshin Impact’s publisher has met the long arm of the law in the courts against the Federal Trade Commission. Following a recent legal battle, the FTC has ordered Cognosphere (HoYoverse) to pay a $20 million settlement for ‘selling lootboxes to teens’. Also, the developer and publisher will be banned from selling such content to anyone under the age of 16.</p>



<p>Get the full results from this justice journey below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-genshin-impact-deceived-children">‘Genshin Impact Deceived Children’</h2>



<p>The FTC has ordered Genshin Impact’s publisher to pay a whopping $20 million in damages after a complaint was filed by the Department of Justice against the game’s lootbox mechanics.</p>



<p>In a statement issued by Samuel Levine, the Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, it was explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Genshin Impact deceived children, teens, and other players into spending hundreds of dollars on prizes they stood little chance of winning.</p>



<p>Companies that deploy these dark-pattern tactics will be held accountable if they deceive players, particularly kids and teens, about the true costs of in-game transactions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>HoYoverse was never bashful about microtransactions and lootbox mechanics, making them a relatively integral part of the Genshin Impact experience. The game is inherently free-to-play, but this is how the publisher and developers make their money – by encouraging users of all ages to chase those five-star prizes.</p>



<p>In a follow-up statement, Cognosphere (HoYoverse) said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Animation-style games and shows are well-received by global audiences and players across various ages. Genshin Impact is a popular free-to-play, anime-style game designed for older teens and adults. While we believe many of the FTC’s allegations are inaccurate, we agreed to this settlement because we value the trust of our community and share a commitment to transparency for our players. </p>



<p>Under the agreement, we will introduce new age-gate and parental consent protections for children and young teens and increase our in-game disclosures around virtual currency and rewards for players in the U.S. in the coming months.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition to the dubious lootbox activities, HoYoverse was hit with COPPA violations after failing to comply with some of the key rules. For instance, the requirement for online services ‘directed to children under 13’ to notify their parents about the personal information they collect was flouted by the developer and publisher.</p>



<p>Going forward, the terms set out by the FTC are that Cognosphere is:</p>



<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Prohibited from allowing children under 16 to purchase loot boxes in their video games without a parent’s affirmative express consent;</li>



<li>Prohibited from selling loot boxes using virtual currency without providing an option for consumers to purchase them directly with real money;</li>



<li>Prohibited from misrepresenting loot box odds, prices and features;</li>



<li>Required to disclose loot box odds and exchange rates for multi-tiered virtual currency;</li>



<li>Required to delete any personal information previously collected from children under 13 unless they obtain parental consent to retain such data; and</li>



<li>Required to comply with COPPA including its notice and consent requirements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, which is one of the biggest mobile games in the world, is one of several games banned in the United States following the TikTok takedown that hit ByteDance. ByeDance boasts ownership over the likes of Nuverse and MOONTON Games, which impacts ML:BB, Marvel Snap, and Land of Empires, among others.</p>



<p>This ban impacts the esports industry, as ML:BB is one of the key drivers of the mobile competitive gaming market. In data from Esports Charts, it’s revealed that ML:BB is one of the most-viewed games in history, boasting a peak concurrent viewer count of more than <strong>five million users</strong>, secured during 2023’s M5 World Championship.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-hit">Another Hit</h2>



<p>The TikTok ban is live now in the United States, and when you try to access the application from the region, you’ll be met with a prompt saying that… Well, that you <strong>can’t</strong>.</p>



<p>The ByteDance ban has impacted a few games, too – <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-snap-taken-down-in-u-s-due-to-governments-tiktok-ban/">including Marvel Snap</a>, which is published by Nuverse, a ByteDance-owned brand.</p>



<p>Many esports fans are concerned about the ban that has impacted Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, arguably the most popular mobile esports game in the world, alongside the likes of PUBG Mobile. </p>



<p>This action has also hit Mobile Legends: Adventure. When you try to access that game, you’ll be met with a message that reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Mobile Legends: Adventure is currently unavailable.</p>



<p>Due to circumstances beyond our control, Mobile Legends: Adventure is currently unavailable to players in the US.</p>



<p>We deeply value our vibrant player community and are actively exploring possibilities to bring the game back in the future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Trying to access ML:BB and TikTok will reward you with similar message prompts.</p>



<p>According <a href="https://escharts.com/top-games?order=peak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to Esports Charts</a>, ML:BB was the eighth most valuable esports game in 2024, awarding players almost $8 million across 163 tournaments. It closely beat PUBG and trailed just behind VALORANT. Behind League of Legends, ML:BB was the most-viewed esports game of the year, beating Counter-Strike, Dota 2, and Fortnite.</p>



<p>While North America isn’t the most populous region where ML:BB is concerned, this is still a blow.</p>

<p>Marvel Snap, the competitive digital collectable card game developed by Second Dinner, is currently unavailable in the United States. This is due to the U.S. government’s ban on Chinese social media application TikTok, as the company that developed the app also owns Marvel Snap publisher Nuverse.</p>



<p>The sudden downing of the popular card game without warning from the developer has left players based in the United States baffled.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-oh-snap">Oh Snap</h2>



<p>On the evening of January 18, 2025, TikTok officially went dark in the United States due to the enactment of a law banning the social media application. As a consequence of this ban, the availability of apps from ByteDance, the company that developed TikTok, has been restricted on mobile app stores. This unfortunately includes Marvel Snap.</p>



<p>Players in the U.S. who attempt to sign in to the game are greeted with a message very similar to the one TikTok users are seeing:</p>



<figure></figure>







<blockquote>
<p>Sorry, Marvel Snap isn’t available right now. A law banning Marvel Snap has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use Marvel Snap for now. Rest assured, we’re working to restore our service in the U.S. Please stay tuned!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Players who attempt to sign in either on mobile or PC are either greeted with the above message or are unable to sign in entirely. The game’s website is also unavailable to access in the U.S.</p>



<p>The game does not appear in a search of the Google Play store, and a notification there states that downloads for ByteDance applications are “paused due to current U.S. legal requirements.”</p>



<p>Marvel Snap developer Second Dinner has stated that both it and publisher ByteDance were surprised by the TikTok ban affecting their game. “Marvel Snap isn’t going anywhere,” the developer <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880850204095811821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> on X. “We’re actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible and will update you once we have more to share.”</p>



<p>What other impacts will the TikTok ban have on gaming? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

For players on PC, the game is still listed in Steam at the moment, but <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1997040/discussions/0/510696076432380503/">many players</a> are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelSnap/comments/1i4pmgy/comment/m7xogf3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reporting</a> they were signed out and can’t sign back in.</p><p>An in-game message now tells players:</p><div><blockquote><p>Sorry, Marvel Snap isn’t available right now</p><p>A law banning Marvel Snap has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use Marvel Snap for now.

The effect on other ByteDance-linked apps is mixed; however, it may take time to remove them. The <a href="https://www.larksuite.com/">Lark app</a> that offers a Slack-like collaboration platform was available initially but has now been removed, while other Nuverse-published games, like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9-%E3%83%AA%E3%83%90%E3%82%A4%E3%83%90%E3%83%AB-%E5%9C%B0%E4%B8%AD%E6%B7%B1%E3%81%8F%E3%81%B8/id1665908849"><em>Earth: Revival - Deep Underground</em></a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/ragnarok-x-3rd-anniversary/id1545808948?mt=8"><em>Ragnarok X: 3rd Anniversary</em></a><em>,</em> are still available in the App Store as of this writing, just after midnight ET on the 19th.</p><p><em><strong>Update, January 19th: </strong>Noted reports that Marvel Snap PC players can’t log in and added </em><a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880850204095811821"><em>a statement</em></a><em> from game developer Second Dinner.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I don't think we've ever written about Intravenous 2, but the topdown shooter has been on my radar since its release last year. It's a blend of tactical stealth and frenetic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hotline-miami">Hotline Miami</a> spraying, and it just got a major update to add Steam Workshop support and a map editor.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Workshop will let players download and share maps, campaigns, new weapons and gadgets that they've added to the game, although ambitious modders will need to know the Lua scripting language to implement their changes. It looks like the map editor is pretty friendly, however, given the 2D tile-based levels.
</p>
<p>There are plenty of topdown games that aim to walk in Hotline Miami's bloody footprints, but Intravenous 2 differs by going deep on tactical elements. You can stealth through the levels if you choose: enemies of vision cones, you can hide in shadows, and you can manipulate the environment by turning off lights, lockpicking doors, or using items to distract or lure enemies.
</p>
<p>You can also tinker with your skills and weaponry. There are 29 weapons according to the Steam page - although whether that's been updated to reflect those added in updates such as this one, I don't know - and those weapons can be customised with suppressors, laser sights, ammo types and so on.
</p><p>Perhaps most ambitiously, Intravenous 2 brags that its storyline is dynamic and changes based on your style of play. I don't know how far it follows through with that, but I'm interested in giving it a go just because I love stealth games and tactical combat. I've had good experiences with topdown games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/door-kickers">Door Kickers</a>, and I'd be onboard with a less fiddly, more action-oriented take on a similar experience. Topdown <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a>, as opposed to topdown SWAT? I dare to dream.
</p>
<p>One day, one day I will find time to play it. For now: hey, it's cool that its got mod support. All games should have mod support. You can find more <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2608270/Intravenous_2/">on Steam</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sons-of-the-forest">Sons Of The Forest</a> is about being chased by fithy cannibals who cannot swim, so the latest update ought to be useful to players. Its major new feature is the addition of rafts, which players can construct and then float about on like a 2000s Tom Hanks. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Rafts come in three flavours ranging from small, slightly less small, to a full on houseboat with walls and ceilings. All three can be tied to the shore with a new mooring structure, and otherwise paddled about the lakes and waterways of the island.
</p>
<p>There are some other neat new features, too. Players can now draw plans for defensive walls around their base and leave Kelvin to do the hardwork of constructing them. Kelvin also now has a faster swim animation and both he and Virginia are able to pull themselves out of water at its edge, both of which seem useful when they inevitably fall off your raft.
</p>
<p>If you make the mistake of ever coming back to land, there are apparently impprovements to aiming with the crossbow, compound bow, crafted bow, shotgun and slingshot, all of which you'll see while scrabbling to survive against the cannibals.
</p>
<p>The full <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1326470/view/526458302147592280">patch notes are available over on Steam</a>. We already liked the game plenty when it hit 1.0 early last year, as Matt Cox (RPS in peace) explained in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sons-of-the-forest-review">Sons Of The Forest review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>'s developers have agreed to pay a $20 million (around £16.4m) fine to settle charges brought by the US Federal Trade Commission. The FTC allege that HoYoverse "unfairly marketed loot boxes to children that obscured real costs and misled all players about the odds of obtaining prizes." HoYoverse will also be banned from selling lootboxes to children under 16 without parental consent.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/cognosphere_complaint.pdf">complaint</a> (PDF) alleges that Genshin Impact's warren of different currencies is "challenging and confusing, particularly for children and teens.
</p>
<p>"Players must exchange real dollars for bundles of virtual currency that then have to be re-exchanged multiple times to open loot boxes, with exchange rates in unusual denominations. This complicated system, according to the complaint, misleads consumers about the amount of money that players spend on loot boxes on an ongoing basis, and the amount of money that players would likely need to spend to obtain certain prizes."
</p>
<p>The same complaint also alleges that HoYoverse collected personal information about children in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA). 
</p>
<p>The allegation that Genshin Impact misleads children about the odds of winning "Five-Star Prizes" in part relates to the Event Banners and "influencer campaigns", which the FTC says "give players the impression that they will have better odds of obtaining the five-star prize being promoted than they have in reality."
</p>
<p>The ruling which would see HoYoverse pay the fine, delete the data held about children aged under 13, and no longer sell lootbnoxes to children under 16, requires approval by a federal judge before it can go into effect.
</p>
<p>"Genshin Impact deceived children, teens, and other players into spending hundreds of dollars on prizes they stood little chance of winning," said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection in a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/genshin-impact-game-developer-will-be-banned-selling-lootboxes-teens-under-16-without-parental">press release</a>. "Companies that deploy these dark-pattern tactics will be held accountable if they deceive players, particularly kids and teens, about the true costs of in-game transactions."

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-red-hulk-mystery-skin/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-red-hulk-mystery-skin/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new mystery skin is going to be coming to Marvel Rivals for those who purchase tickets to watch Captain America: Brave New World.</p>



<p>The announcement was made by the <a href="https://x.com/RegalMovies/status/1880276448826581174?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1880276448826581174%7Ctwgr%5E0f18271dfee288d41369c312d0387dd4c9b35628%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fembedly.forbes.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3D3ce26dc7e3454db5820ba084d28b4935schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fx.com%2FRegalMovies%2Fstatus%2F1880276448826581174image%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Regal Crown Club</a>, which said that those who purchase theatre tickets to watch Captain America: Brave New World will receive three exclusive items for Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>The three items will be a spray, nameplate, and mystery costume.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-mystery-costume-in-marvel-rivals">What is the Mystery Costume in Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p>It’s currently unclear what the mystery costume will be to celebrate Captain America: Brave New World in Marvel Rivals, but the spray and nameplate will be Captain America-related. </p>



<p>However, given that Captain America: Brave New World will feature the Red Hulk for the first time ever (played by Harrison Ford), it will almost certainly be a skin for the Hulk. While it’s not yet confirmed, a Red Hulk skin in Marvel Rivals would be easy to implement without profound changes to the existing default Hulk skin (just a change of skin color, face, and probably shorts).</p>



<p>If the skin isn’t Red Hulk, Captain America is the likely next option.</p>



<p>Luckily though, speculation of what the skin will be won’t have to last long, as Captain America: Brave New World hits theatre on on February 14.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-mystery-skin">How to Get the Mystery Skin</h2>



<p>For those wanting to get the mystery skin, Regal Crown Club says that theatergoers must purchase their tickets by February 17 to collect the skin.</p>



<p>Presumably, ticket purchases will then receive a redemption code in their emails after purchasing the ticket.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals currently has a total of 37 playable heroes in the game, with developer NetEase Games confirming that the game will receive two new heroes a season moving forward. The Thing and the Human Torch are the next heroes to be released, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-thing-human-torch-release-dates-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can find out when here</a>.</p>
