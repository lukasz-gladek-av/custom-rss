            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Big changes are coming to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/overwatch">Overwatch 2</a> <em>very</em> soon, with a brand new season dropping on 10th February. But the biggest change comes in the form of a new name.</p>
<p>Announced <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24246206/overwatch-spotlight-the-reign-of-talon-begins/">today</a> during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Sgnn72e9Y">Overwatch 2026 spotlight</a>, the game's director Aaron Keller announced that Overwatch 2 is ditching the number, meaning it'll simply be known as <strong>Overwatch</strong> now.</p>
<p>But the 2 is still important, <em>because</em> Blizzard's hero shooter is in fact coming to Switch 2 later this year. We don't have a date just yet — <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-proper-switch-2-version-coming">Eurogamer</a> has reportedly been told around mid-April — but the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/overwatch">Switch 2 version</a> will be launching alongside Season 2.</p>
<p>Season 1, called <strong>The Reign of Talon</strong>, was unveiled today and arrives next week, and it aims to kick of a yearlong, multi-faceted story that'll last six seasons. Ten new heroes will be coming to the game in 2026, with five of them coming when Season 1 lands.</p>
<p>The first five heroes are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domina</strong>, a 'poke' tank who focuses on long-range attacks and zone play.</li>
<li><strong>Emre</strong>, a damage-dealer who focuses on fast run-and-gun gunplay</li>
<li><strong>Mizuki</strong>, a support unit who is mysterious and focuses on close-quarters gameplay</li>
<li><strong>Anran</strong>, a second damage-dealer who can manipulate fire with her fan-like weapons — you'll be able to test Anran out with a Hero Trial from 5th February.</li>
<li><strong>Jetpack Cat</strong>, a support-unit and maybe the best Overwatch character ever. Yes. (she's fast and reactive)</li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining five will be revealed later.</p>


<p>Other changes coming to the game include new sub-roles and passives for each class, a Conquest meta event that runs for five weeks, yearly competitive updates, an complete UI refresh, changes to Stadium, a Sanrio collaboration, and tons of new cinematics, in-game events, and comics to help flesh out the story.</p>
<p>We're really just picking out a few things here, and we can't overstate just how much the team seem to be changing things up, You can read about everything coming to Overwatch in more detail over on the <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24246206/overwatch-spotlight-the-reign-of-talon-begins/">official Overwatch website</a>.</p>

<p>So, while Season 1 drops next week, we'll have to wait a bit longer for a fully-fresh Overwatch experience on Switch 2. The Switch 1 version isn't exactly the ideal way to play the game, either, and like many others, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/overwatch-2">we were disappointed with it</a> when it launched in 2022.</p>
<p>These updates, though? They sound like a big step in the right direction</p>

            <p>Ashes Of Creation developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ashes-of-creation-director-quits-over-decisions-he-could-not-ethically-support-as-staff-report-mass-layoffs">laid off during the reported closure of Intrepid Studios</a> will not receive their final paychecks and other compensation they’re due, according to one of the departing team members.</p><!--more-->
<p>Posting on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/margaretkrohn_i-waited-until-today-to-share-this-because-activity-7424559850921279489-9q_T?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAANxzosB8Nu3u0E3e0D-T9TYAyXUCoJsByM">LinkedIn</a>, former director of communications Margaret Krohn has written a longer account of this week's job losses, beginning with the comment that “Intrepid Studios has shut down in a way that I did not expect.” </p>
<p>Krohn writes that she was informed by people up the ladder that Intrepid would lay off 100 people on 28th January. The next day, Krohn shared this info in secrecy with her Game Services team. “I told them that changes were coming, that I did not yet know who would be affected, and that I wished I had more certainty to offer," she recalls. "I could not live with myself if I did not give them advance notice - these are people who deserve to be treated like human beings.”</p>
<p>On January 30th, having gotten confirmation of who would be affected, Krohn spoke individually with members of her team. “Those who were staying began working on ways to move forward,” she continues. “Even those who knew they would be leaving offered their support”. </p><p>But then, on 31st January, “we were all informed via a confusing email that we would be laid off, along with a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification] notice.” Despite the WARN notice, Krohn says that “none of us are receiving our final paychecks, the 60 days notice and pay outlined under the WARN Act, PTO payouts, or other compensation owed”.</p>
<p>You can read about the WARN act <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/layoffs/warn">on the US government website</a>. According to an accompanying brochure, an employee who qualifies for protection under the act “must receive a written notice 60 days before the date of a mass layoff or plant closing” and is otherwise entitled “to seek damages for back pay and benefits for up to 60 days, depending on how many days’ notice you actually received”. </p>
<p>Krohn has a few words for players of Ashes Of Creation, writing that “the entire development team was working extremely hard, pulling long hours, and wishes with all our hearts that we could give you Ashes of Creation. There are no words that fully express how sorry we are that this journey ended this way. You should pursue a refund, you deserve it.”</p>
<p>There’s ambiguity about whether Ashes Of Creation players are in a position to seek refunds. According to the original 2017 Kickstarter pitch, backers were entitled to one if the game never made it to release. The game did come out in Steam early access this December, attracting mixed reactions. There’s a lot of speculation that Intrepid rushed out an unfinished version simply to avoid that Kickstarter refund provision. </p><p>Other players are suspicious of creative director Steven Sharif, who left the company shortly before the mass layoffs, after allegedly disagreeing with Intrepid’s board. It’s not clear who Intrepid’s board members are (I’ve made a few enquiries), and some players have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/1qsm3r2/the_board_composed_of_me_and_my_husband/">pounced on the fact</a> that only Sharif and his husband are listed as company officers in a California state filing from December 2025. Is Sharif blaming his own mishandling of Intrepid on a fantasy board? The counterargument there is that the document in question doesn’t require companies to list every board member.</p>
<p>Krohn has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/1qv4e9n/comment/o3f5n02/">addressed some of these claims on Reddit</a>, with the caveat that “I was just the person running marketing, communications, social, CS, etc. I had departments that I was focused on.  I was not privy to senior C-level leadership information.” Regarding Sharif, she <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/1qv4e9n/comment/o3fhhw6/?context=3">writes</a> that "[f]rom my experience, Steven was always kind, generous, and looked out for us. This has been heartbreaking.”</p>
<p>Following the layoff reports, Steam quietly removed Ashes Of Creation from sale. I’ll ask what remains of Intrepid for comment on Krohn’s allegations about final pay and notice periods. Best of luck to the devs affected.</p>

<figure data-uuid="fedc5e199fc43"><a title="&quot;Kids Don't Like Being Treated Like Kids&quot; - How 4PGP Is Harnessing The Power Of Sega Rally's Director To Challenge Mario Kart 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fedc5e199fc43/kids-dont-like-being-treated-like-kids-how-4pgp-is-harnessing-the-power-of-sega-rallys-director-to-challenge-mario-kart-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: 3goo</em></figcaption></figure><p>There are plenty of notable things about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/4pgp-nintendo-switch-2-edition">4PGP</a>, which launches on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/4pgp">Switch</a> and Switch 2 today – the iconic (but unlicensed) 1990s F1 cars, the 120Hz visuals (on Switch 2) and the four-player split-screen mode – but I have to admit that, as a seasoned arcade fan, the involvement of the legendary Kenji Sasaki (<a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/saturn/sega_rally_championship">Sega Rally</a>, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/sega_rally_2">Sega Rally 2</a>, <strong>Sega Touring Car Championship</strong>, <strong>Star Wars Racer Arcade</strong>) as an advisor on the project is what <em>really</em> made me sit up and take notice.</p>
<p>Keen to learn more about the origins of this title and Sasaki's influence on its final form, I was lucky enough to speak to <strong>Quanah Sugiyama</strong> (4PGP Project Manager at publisher <a href="https://3goo.co.jp/company-profile-eng/">3goo</a>), <strong>Jonathan Marolle</strong> (Game Director at developer <a href="http://www.visionreelle.fr/">Vision Reelle</a>) and even the great man himself, <strong>Kenji Sasaki</strong> (Project Advisor).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: Can you give us some background on your team's racing game pedigree? What notable titles have the core team worked on previously?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quanah Sugiyama:</strong> As a publisher, 3goo brings extensive experience in marketing and releasing racing games in Japan, including acclaimed franchises such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/gear_club_unlimited">Gear.Club Unlimited</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/wrc_10_the_official_game">WRC</a>. Our portfolio spans a wide range of racing genres—from hardcore simulation titles like <strong>Rennsport</strong> to open-world experiences such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/test_drive_unlimited_solar_crown">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, our director, Jonathan, is a veteran developer with over 20 years of experience in racing game development, having worked on major franchises including Test Drive Unlimited, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/crew">The Crew</a>, and Gear.Club Unlimited. With this combined expertise in development, publishing, and global racing franchises, we are highly confident in our ability to both create and successfully bring racing games to market.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: F1-based racers come in all shapes and sizes, with some going for intense realism while others are more arcade-like. Where does 4PGP sit on this scale, and what titles have inspired it directly?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quanah Sugiyama:</strong> From a gameplay standpoint, 4PGP firmly embraces its arcade roots. The controls are simple and intuitive, complemented by a turbo system for instant bursts of speed. At the same time, it is designed to deliver a true formula racing experience, where success depends on well-timed braking, precise steering, and learning the optimal racing line.</p>

<p>Visually, we aimed for a careful balance. The game captures the sleek, high-speed look of real formula cars while adding a colourful, approachable style. We made sure not to lean too far into a cartoonish look, as to keep the “coolness” factor of formula racing intact.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: You're clearly aiming at offering an accessible, family-friendly experience with 4PGP, but how are you making sure it will be challenging enough to tempt genre veterans?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quanah Sugiyama:</strong> Just like our favourite classic arcade racers, 4PGP follows the timeless philosophy of “easy to pick up and play, yet challenging to master.” Players begin on lower difficulty settings, where top speeds are reduced, and the handling is more forgiving, allowing anyone to jump in and have fun immediately.</p>
<p>At higher difficulty levels, though, the game becomes far more demanding: cars are significantly faster, rivals more aggressive, and even a small mistake can cost you the entire race. Truly mastering the game requires learning each track inside and out, maintaining focus throughout intense twists and turns, and skillfully managing both tyre wear and the turbo gauge.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: You've gone for classic '90s liveries for many of the included cars. What made you pick this era of F1 in particular?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Marolle:</strong> In the world of motorsports, some cars are truly timeless. Across generations, they are instantly recognisable—even to those who aren’t racing fans or lifelong petrolheads—thanks to their legendary liveries and unmistakable silhouettes. The drivers who piloted these machines became icons in their own right, known around the world by people of all ages, similar to Hollywood actors or pop stars.</p>
<p>This golden era fits the game perfectly. It captures the spirit of 1990s arcade racing, celebrating iconic cars that everyone knows and remembers. On a personal level, these machines hold a special place for me—I genuinely love them, and that passion is woven directly into the game.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: For players raised on, say, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, what would you say 4PGP offers that makes it worth a look?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Marolle</strong><strong>:</strong> Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart World are incredible games. I play them every week with my sons, and they’re always a blast. But when you’re looking for intense racing with real cars, there’s simply nothing quite like that available today. 4PGP aims to fill that gap. It delivers the instant fun, accessibility, and competitive challenge of a kart racer, but set in the world of motorsport, designed from the ground up for four players.</p>
<figure data-uuid="643eba7337025"><a title="&quot;Kids Don't Like Being Treated Like Kids&quot; - How 4PGP Is Harnessing The Power Of Sega Rally's Director To Challenge Mario Kart 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/643eba7337025/kids-dont-like-being-treated-like-kids-how-4pgp-is-harnessing-the-power-of-sega-rallys-director-to-challenge-mario-kart-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Securing the official licencing for several famous 1990s F1 teams – some of which are no longer with us – was clearly beyond the scope of a project such as this, but the 'recreations' are close enough — <em><span></span> Image: 3goo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Also, speaking as someone who was once a child himself, I know that kids don’t like being treated like kids. So, giving them the option to race cool, semi-realistic cars, rather than go-kart-type vehicles geared towards a younger demographic, is something I think younger generations will really appreciate.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: What has it been like working with a genre legend like Kenji Sasaki, and how deep has his involvement been with the game? Did Sasaki-san demand any sweeping changes to the game at any point during its development period, for example, and was he involved from the very beginning?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quanah Sugiyama:</strong> Sasaki-san has been on board with us since the project formally kicked off, providing invaluable insight across a wide range of areas, including UX, graphics, controls, game balance, and music, which helped make the game feel like an authentic 1990s arcade racer. While we had prototypes prior to his involvement with the racing mechanics, tracks and vehicles fleshed out, the UI, HUD, and overall colour scheme underwent major reworking under his supervision.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: How did Tomoyuki Kawamura become involved, and what has it been like working with him on the game's music? Did he simply offer compositions of his own, or did you make suggestions based on his previous work in titles like Sega Rally and Virtua Racing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quanah Sugiyama:</strong> Kawamura-san was introduced to us by Sasaki-san. The two have worked together with on many projects, and Sasaki-san felt he would be the perfect composer for the aforementioned authenticity we were trying to capture. While we didn’t intend to directly imitate the soundtrack of any specific past title, Sasaki-san did advise us that Kawamura-san had previously worked on Sega’s INDY 500, which had a tone similar to what we were looking for, and encouraged him to draw on his memories from that period for composition.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: What aspect of 4PGP has been the hardest to get right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Marolle</strong><strong>:</strong> Frame rate was the biggest technical challenge on Nintendo Switch. Maintaining a smooth 60 fps with four players, in both handheld and docked modes, was essential to support the fast-paced gameplay that defines arcade racing games of this era. At the same time, a great deal of effort went into making 4PGP feel technically authentic, particularly in areas such as the physics engine and graphics. In the 1990s, hardware limitations forced developers to rely on clever tricks and simplified physics to convey the motion of cars, while early 3D arcade boards were unable to render large numbers of textured polygons. I intentionally embraced the same approach to capture the essence of what made those games so fun and accessible, adopting similar constraints—low-poly models, a limited number of low-resolution textures, and the absence of filtering or advanced post-processing—to recreate that distinctive look and feel.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: What element of the game do you think players are going to be most surprised by?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Marolle</strong><strong>:</strong> I think players will be most surprised by just how smooth and immediate the game feels. Like a classic arcade experience, you can jump in and be racing within seconds—we’ve reduced loading time to basically nothing, and there is hardly any downtime between races; the pace is relentless.</p>

<p>On top of that, the performance is rock solid. The game runs flawlessly at 60 fps on both Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, even with four players, with no frame-rate drops. The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition pushes things even further, offering 120 fps/Full HD and 60 fps/4K settings. The combination of instant access, smooth performance, and high visual fidelity makes the game feel incredibly responsive—and that’s something players won’t expect until they experience it firsthand.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: What are the key differences between the Switch and Switch 2 versions of the game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quanah Sugiyama:</strong> As Jonathan mentioned in the aforementioned question, the frame rate and resolution have improved dramatically. The other major feature is support for the Switch 2’s GameShare feature. With this, up to four players can play locally or online on their own devices, using only one copy of the game. It’s a great way to share the fun with friends near and far.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: What has it been like factoring in Switch 2 features, like 120fps and GameChat?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quanah Sugiyama:</strong> GameShare, being a brand-new feature on the Nintendo Switch 2, was quite the challenge to develop for.</p>
<p>As one Nintendo Switch 2 system would have to render up to four screens at once, we had to strike the perfect balance in optimisation, where the game can run at a decent speed without sacrificing the fps and resolution too much.</p>
<p>Audio was another challenge we faced, as the game had to generate different sound effects (acceleration, braking, crashing, etc.) for each player’s vehicle on separate devices when streaming. With a traditional setup, all of the sound effects would be playing on all of the players’ devices at once, so finding a workaround was crucial.</p>
<p>For 120 fps, the implementation was quite simple, as the Switch version was already very well-optimised, running at a constant 60 fps despite the technical limitations of the system.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: <strong>Sasaki</strong>-san, what did you think when you were first approached about contributing to 4PGP?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kenji Sasaki:</strong> To offer some background, I first met Nicolas, the CEO of 3goo, nearly 30 years ago when he was a correspondent for <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/yes-it-was-elitist-and-no-that-wasnt-a-bad-thing-edge-alumni-on-why-the-mag-is-still-going-strong-over-30-years-on">EDGE magazine</a> and interviewing me during the development of Sega Rally. I still remember being caught off guard by his sharp questions and very specific requests regarding racing and driving games—I even found myself at a loss for words at times.</p>
<p>After that, we would meet occasionally every few years, and I followed his career as he went on to found 3goo and publish numerous racing titles, so I had always hoped that we might have the opportunity to work together someday. When he eventually approached me about serving as a special advisor on 4PGP, I was genuinely delighted to receive the offer.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: How have your previous games influenced your input into 4PGP? What lessons would you say your career has taught you when it comes to offering advice and input on this style of game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kenji Sasaki:</strong> Since 4PGP’s goal was to [recreate] the kind of fun found in 1990s arcade racing games on modern hardware, I took time to break down what made the games I’ve worked on so enjoyable and identify the elements that really stood out.</p>
<figure data-uuid="39802e30990ad"><a title="&quot;Kids Don't Like Being Treated Like Kids&quot; - How 4PGP Is Harnessing The Power Of Sega Rally's Director To Challenge Mario Kart 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/39802e30990ad/kids-dont-like-being-treated-like-kids-how-4pgp-is-harnessing-the-power-of-sega-rallys-director-to-challenge-mario-kart-8.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: 3goo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the development schedule limited what could be achieved in a short time, my goal was to bring as much of that “era-specific atmosphere” into 4PGP as possible. With that in mind, I provided advice and direction on visual creation and selection, as well as the overall construction of elements like the background music, to help the game capture the feel of those classic arcade racers.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: What aspects did you have the most influence over during 4PGP's development?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kenji Sasaki:</strong> The key elements I focused on were the sense of pacing, the background music, and the overall visual atmosphere that evokes 1990s arcade games. Including things like menu and game flow design, we focused on making the experience easy to understand and ensuring the game progressed at a fast, satisfying tempo. I also tried to keep my advice tightly focused on the most important points, with the goal of improving the feel of the game when played and giving players a stronger sense of responsiveness and satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: What was it like working with Tomoyuki Kawamura again?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kenji Sasaki:</strong> Kawamura and I have collaborated on game development many times over the past 30-plus years, and I consider him a true brother-in-arms from our days in the trenches of arcade game development. Because of that shared history, he understands my intentions instinctively, which made our collaboration extremely smooth and effortless.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: Many modern racing games aim for realism over accessibility. What advantage do you feel arcade-style racers offer over 'serious' simulations?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kenji Sasaki:</strong> I think the clear advantage is being able to enjoy the game casually and intuitively in a typical home play environment. With racing simulators, standard consoles and devices often can’t convey enough information, which can make them feel difficult or intimidating for general players. Using large, immersive displays, motion-based cabinets, or VR can make the experience extremely realistic and intuitive to control, but realistically speaking, not many players have access to that kind of setup yet.</p>
<figure data-uuid="bd7b04034287a"><a title="&quot;Kids Don't Like Being Treated Like Kids&quot; - How 4PGP Is Harnessing The Power Of Sega Rally's Director To Challenge Mario Kart 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bd7b04034287a/kids-dont-like-being-treated-like-kids-how-4pgp-is-harnessing-the-power-of-sega-rallys-director-to-challenge-mario-kart-9.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: 3goo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: 4PGP's feature set appears to place it in competition with family-friendly racers like Mario Kart and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sonic Racing</a>. What does the game offer that those titles lack?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kenji Sasaki:</strong> I think there are people who have trouble connecting with the cute, highly stylised characters and overtly comical presentation often found in those titles. For players who want a more serious racing atmosphere but feel that full-fledged racing simulators are a bit too demanding or inaccessible, I think there’s room for a game like 4PGP to fill that gap and meet that demand.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: 4PGP is an original title. Would you like to see studios like 3goo given the chance to work with some of the famous arcade properties you helped create during the '90s?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kenji Sasaki:</strong> I don’t place much importance on specific IPs or brands. As long as we can create a game we truly want to make—and one that players are looking for—I’m open to any style or approach. I would love to make another rally game, though.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: Do you see yourself contributing to more games in the future?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kenji Sasaki:</strong> Of course, I’d like to remain actively involved. If there is demand, I would love to work on commercial titles, but there are also more personal projects and ideas that I would like to challenge myself with developing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Most live-service games don’t get as many chances as </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>has gotten, but most of them aren’t made by Blizzard, which can afford to fumble, refocus, and rise from the ashes. The problem any game that’s gone on for 10 years faces is that different versions of it exist in the minds of everyone who’s ever played it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If you stopped pushing payloads during the height of the game’s domination, you may have a rosy image in your mind of a game that doesn’t really exist anymore. Those of us who came in later have only really known </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>as a fallen titan struggling to get back on its feet. When the sequel came out and never actually delivered the cooperative campaign Blizzard had promised, plenty of people dismissed </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>as a failed experiment and a fumbled bag. Even I, a person who has put over 1000 hours into Blizzard’s hero shooter, fell off for a brief period, though I kept my Soldier: 76 keychain on my ring even when I wasn’t playing.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000002089" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000002089"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000002089">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-perks-stadium-season-15-spotlight-preview-1851761919"><span>But last year, something shifted</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>may not have become the story-driven sequel I wanted, but Blizzard showed that even if its original plan had fallen through, it wasn’t going to leave the game as a skin-driven cash cow doing nothing more than giving Mercy fans another one hundred outfits in which to dress up their favorite medic. The introduction of Perks, or character-specific tweaks that change or lean into different playstyles on typically one-note heroes, and the build-driven Stadium mode, showed that all that work on skill trees and buildcrafting hadn’t been a complete waste of time.</span></p> <p><span>Now, in 2026, Blizzard is integrating the story in a way that’s probably more sustainable than a PvE campaign microtransactioned out over the course of years would have been. It’s taking its seasonal rollout and completely restructuring it to accommodate a linear story, rather than just leaning on character-setting lore drops with no forward momentum. It’s not the game we were pitched in 2019, but the Blizzard team that was leading the charge on that has been desecrated over the past few years.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Game director Jeff Kaplan </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-director-jeff-kaplan-leaves-blizzard-1846723205"><span>left Blizzard before </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>launched</span></a><span>, the narrative and events teams were </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-activision-blizzard-zenimax-1851196192"><span>subjected to layoffs</span></a><span> that left the story in limbo </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720"><span>until the campaign was canceled</span></a><span>, and for a while, it felt like </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>was back on life support similar to how it was during the years-long content drought leading up to </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s launch.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000005813" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000005813"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000005813">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>For some, it doesn’t matter that </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>has grown, changed, and gotten more than simply better, instead reaching a level of greatness some thought lost. For those people, that moment of disappointment when they stopped playing it remains too vivid, that betrayal too great, for them to so much as reinstall the game. People love a </span><i><span>No Man’s Sky </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Final Fantasy XIV</span></i><span> moment in which games that stumble in the beginning get their shit together. Those are becoming less common, however, in an industry that invests millions of dollars into service games it’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-review-sci-fi-hero-shooter-ps5-overwatch-1851630481"><span>unwilling to support longterm.</span></a><span> Players, meanwhile, are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><span>growing tired of live games</span></a><span> that feel like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-final-hours-videos-clips-stream-2000659367"><span>obvious ploys for their time and money</span></a><span> at a time when both of those things are becoming more scarce and precious.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In our modern, post-patch world in which games sometimes launch broken and get fixed later, people are becoming more jaded to the notion of bad or just lackluster games becoming good ones months or years down the line. There are too many games to play to waste time on one that isn’t giving you what you want right out of the gate. Most live-service games are sent out to die, Blizzard just has the institutional resources and stubbornness to not let a game like </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> slip through the cracks. In the past decade, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>has become a symbol of both the potential live games have to reach and even surpass their former glory, and the fact that only the biggest companies can afford to fail now.</span></p>

 <p><span>I talk to friends who stopped playing </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>years ago and feel like I’m running up against versions of the game that haven’t existed in years. Age-old complaints that were long patched out or reworked still linger in their minds, or major overhauls merely exist as passing headlines they read once but never actually played for themselves.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000665015" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665015"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665015">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Live games are kind of like the friend you had growing up that let you down in one way or another, and if you’ve gone no contact, you might not know they’ve turned their life around. But the people who left for slights from years ago are often defining the narrative about the state of the game just as much as the people who are still playing and know what the game is like now.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Whether it’s because actual competition in the form of </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span> showed up kicking Blizzard in the ass or because the </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>team has finally been able to rebuild itself after years of strife, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>is in the best state it’s been in the past decade, and finally has a pipeline that is letting the team take massive swings like releasing ten heroes in one year and giving the story the momentum and direction it’s desperately needed, even if it’s not what we once thought we were getting. There will always be skin imbalances to complain about, “what ifs” to ponder, and potential it feels like Blizzard failed to live up to. But the game we have now is the best version Blizzard’s ever given us. I guess we’ll see if it’s enough to correct the narrative in the months and years to come.</span></p>

              <p><span>Debates about who gets <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-kiriko-mercy-venture-reaper-season-12-skins-1851626893">the most cosmetics in </a></span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> are as old as the game itself, but these arguments have only gotten worse as the hero shooter has implemented <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-collaborations-survey-pokemon-star-wars-1851787277">collaborations with other brands</a>. It feels like a crossover can’t come and go without Kiriko, Mercy, or Juno getting some love while some heroes like Baptiste, Lúcio, and many, many others go without. Why? Well, many </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>fans hypothesize that it’s because Kiriko and Mercy mains are always willing to pony up cash, but according to Blizzard, it’s a bit more complicated than that.</span></p> <p><span>During a group interview with the art team on Blizzard’s Irvine campus, art director Dion Rogers explained that some of the characters who have historically been spoiled in </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s many collaborations are just easier to conceptualize in different outfits and accessories than others, but as the team has gotten more experienced at adapting outside looks for its heroes, they hope to better serve some of the neglected characters, like Lúcio.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Our team, we draw a bunch of stuff and it just works better with some heroes than others,” Rogers said. “It’s just the nature of the hero itself. I know Lúcio mains are hungry. We’ve got some stuff coming for Lúcio as you just saw with </span><i><span>Hello Kitty</span></i><span>. There’s even more coming for him. So as we become better at the work and more efficient, we’re nearing 50 heroes, also, so it’s really hard to get to certain guys. It is the nature of there are some characters that are easier to do things for than others.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“There’s some guys, you do it, and you see it, and you’re like, ‘that looks cursed. That’s not gonna work.’ Some of them actually slip out and make it out into the game. So that’s been a lot of the conversations we have sometimes. It’s more of, ‘does a fantasy truly work for a character or not, or are we making some sort of cursed thing?’ But now, 2026, you’re going to see the kind of fruits of our labor over the past two years of building a better pipeline, building more efficiency. We’ll be able to hit more heroes than before with broader concepting and stuff for the guys that feel a little underserved. We’ll get to them.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Character artist Melissa Kelly added that, as a Zarya fan, she sympathizes with the plight of those who play underserved heroes. That said, while Lúcio is getting some love in the Sanrio crossover, Kiriko, Juno, and Mercy are also in the line-up. So some old habits die hard.</span></p>

Overwatch 2, which Blizzard is officially renaming to Overwatch alongside the update, finally feels fresh again thanks to the five new heroes launching alongside Season 1. Additionally, the first-person shooter’s new sub-roles help to further distinguish its Tank, Damage, and Support heroes with new passive buffs that better align with their specific playstyle and class identity.</p><p>The team is getting better and faster at creating heroes, multiple developers told me, enabling them to commit to launching 10 heroes in 2026.

            <p>You wouldn't know it to hear it, but decorated video game actor Jennifer Hale - famously the voice of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>'s Commander Shepard - is the person providing the meows of new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> hero Jetpack Cat.</p>
<p>Blizzard confirmed this at its headquarters last week while detailing Jetpack Cat and the four other heroes coming to Overwatch (formerly known as "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>") next week. "The voice actor is Jennifer Hale," audio and technical director Scott Lawson told a group of press that I was in, "and she did an incredible job, and working with it was so much fun."</p>
<p>Note that Hale already voices another Overwatch hero, gunslinger Ashe, who was added to the game in November 2018.</p>
<p>Jetpack Cat has been a rumoured hero for Overwatch for a long time, and she finally arrives alongside four other new heroes on 10th February with the game-changing ability to tow other characters through the air. She can do this to both allies and enemies, though doing it to enemies requires using her Ultimate.</p>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>I've played her; she's great fun. Very manoeuvrable, very fast, and with some useful healing abilities for supporting diving or flanking characters, not to mention the ability to pick up slower heroes from base or airlift Bastion in chaingunning form over groups of enemies. She also has lots of voice lines, although they're all variations of "meow", amusingly.</p><p>Jetpack Cat has been around as a concept nearly as long as Overwatch itself. "Jetpack Cat in particular, as a concept, is something the team has wanted to do since, man, we launched Overwatch 1," lead hero producer Kenny Hudson told me. "We've had early concept art for Jetpack Cat on the wall in our hallway for like eight years now." But the idea never got any further. "You'd walk by it like every day, like, 'Maybe we should...'," added associate game director Alec Dawson.</p>
<p>The reason why Blizzard can do Jetpack Cat now is because it's releasing so many new heroes at once - five on 10th February and a further five over the course of the year. "Going all out on making five Heroes at a time gave us some cover to explore new things, try new things," Hudson said. "When we said okay who are the five going to be...? It's funny because Jetpack Cat was always in the conversation from day one."</p>

<p>"It just felt like it's time for the cat," art director Dion Rogers said in a separate interview.</p>
<p>Jetpack Cat may seem silly but she's not the first animal character in the game. Winston, a gorilla, has been at the heart of Overwatch since it launched, and a hamster was added in the shape of Wrecking Ball in 2018. And, as Rogers told me, there are ideas for more.</p><p>"We actually have a random idea we joke about," Rogers said, "this character called the Oranga-tank. It's an orangutan that's a tank and he's a villain. Because most of our animal characters are good guys, we were like how do we make villain animals? And Oranga-tank is an idea that's been floating around for a while. I don't know if he'll show up in the game. It's a funny drawing; there's a bunch of funny drawings everywhere."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">Overwatch is currently experiencing an exciting moment</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-unveils-major-overwatch-2-revamp-expansion-plan">Blizzard announced an ambitious new yearly expansion plan</a> for the game and it will release the first of these, The Reign of Talon, next week. It also announced it would be removing the tainted "2" from the game's name to make it, simply, "Overwatch" again. </p>

    <div id="main-content">
        

        <p>We're getting 10 new heroes, total, in 2026.</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>
  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> will henceforth be known as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, Blizzard has announced, as it outlines a major new plan that will revolve around free, annual, expansion-like releases for the game. The first of these - The Reign of Talon - arrives next week, on Tuesday, 10th February.</p>
<p>The undeniable headline feature is adding <em>five</em> new heroes at once, which is the largest new-hero-drop Overwatch has ever had - two more than Overwatch 2 launched with. Then, a further five heroes will be added throughout 2026, one in each Reign of Talon season (from season 2-6), taking the total new-hero count this year to 10. For Overwatch, that release-pace is unprecedented.</p>
<p>The new five new heroes are spread across all character roles. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domina, a tank who's a little like Zarya,</li>
<li>Emre, a damage dealer who's a lot like Soldier 76,</li>
<li>Mizuki, a support who has a magical healing hat he throws,</li>
<li>Anran, a damage dealer who sets people on fire and then literally fans the flames to deal damage to them, and</li>
<li>Jetpack Cat, a long-rumoured support who permanently flies and can tow team-mates and enemies through the air.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">I have played all of these heroes and shared my thoughts on them in a longer Overwatch revamp article</a>.</p>
<p>The switch to a yearly focus has had a major knock-on effect for story, allowing Blizzard to move from a smaller piecemeal storytelling formula to one shaped over the course of a year, affording a much more ambitious and dramatic scope. Six 'season' releases are planned for Reign of Talon, and the game's season-count will be reset to one (from 20) to coincide with it.</p><p>The story will be told in familiar ways to Overwatch, through a mix of cinematic videos and animated comics, but you'll now be able to see and track this inside of the game, and to feel the effects of it as you play. Characters will refer to story events in voice lines, and some maps will be altered to reflect what's been going on. Watchpoint: Gibraltar will be the first of these, and it will change structurally following an invasion by Talon's evil forces when The Reign of Talon begins.</p>

<p>Showcasing all of this will be a five-week story event called Conquest, which will allow players to side with either Overwatch or Talon in a faction war. You pick a side and carry out objectives for them, earning points for the faction and rewards for yourself.</p>
<p>There's still more: Overwatch is getting a full-on user interface overhaul for Reign of Talon to better organise the information the game presents to you, and to enable a 3D hero lobby, which will expand to a full party lobby in Season 4.</p><p>There are sub-roles being added to the hero roster as well, which not only help break-up the rapidly expanding roster visually, but give gameplay perks depending on the sub-role you choose. A Flanker like Tracer gets more health from health packs, for example, whereas a Medic like Moira heals themselves while healing others.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Stadium - the recently added MOBA-like 'develop your character as you play' mode - is getting an icon overhaul, and a build helper for newer players.</p>
<p>Blizzard has also said we should also expect two new core maps during the Reign of Talon year, as well as the reintroduction of post-match accolades and reworks for existing heroes (Blizzard wouldn't tell me which ones). <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-proper-switch-2-version-coming">There's a dedicated Switch 2 release that will launch with Season 2</a>, which hasn't been dated, but I expect will arrive sometime in April.</p>
<p>It's a bold and headline-grabbing change for Overwatch 2, which struggled to convince players a few years ago when it launched. More importantly, it makes Overwatch 2 exciting again.</p>

            <p>It sounds as though Blizzard is open to exploring generative AI during the development of its games.</p>
<p>Answering a question I asked during an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> press conference at Blizzard campus last week, Blizzard president Johanna Faries said: "I like when we are dev-led in our approach. We want our dev teams to be able to utilise or explore whatever new technology is out there, to the extent that they're comfortable doing with it what we believe is responsible, and a lot of those principles that are communicated are really around rooting in responsible choices."</p>
<p>The principles she's referring to were outlined internally to staff at Blizzard, I was later told. I wasn't told what they were.</p>
<p>Faries went on to say: "We do actually, at Blizzard, have a centralised governance team specifically focused on AI and the role it can or should play in our development cycles.</p>
<p>"What's great about that is it's very cross functional, so you're going to have voices from around the horn thinking about not just what's hot-topic now, but where do we want to be five, 10 years from now? What's the implication on our teams? What's the implication on our values? How do we make sure that we don't stymie the opportunity for devs, artists, whomever, to want to play with new tools and play in the sandbox, if it unlocks creativity or gets rid of drudgery or what have you? We want happy devs, right?</p><p>"But to the extent that it can be an accelerant in our creative process, we also want to make sure that it's a responsible tool and aligned with how we want to show up as a company," she said. "So I feel very good in terms of the process we have in terms of vetting: is it secure, is it safe, is it values led? But I keep coming back to: I want the teams to feel safe, to explore to the extent that it drives joy in the work. And I think we have a good process, all up, in terms of making sure we're doing it in a responsible manner."</p>
<blockquote><em>"But to the extent that it can be an accelerant in our creative process, we also want to make sure that it's a responsible tool" -Johanna Faries</em></blockquote>
<p>Faries' remarks come a few months after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-about-incredibly-talented-people-not-doing-incredibly-boring-stuff-blizzard-devs-say-its-possible-to-use-ai-tools-while-still-feeling-handcrafted">a lead World of Warcraft artist talked about using AI to remove some of the "boring" tasks</a> of game development, such as tweaking helmets to fit the heads of different-sized races in the game. "Things like AI help a lot with that," Gabriel Gonzalez explained. "I would say the philosophy is always how we free up more time for our team to be creative, and take away the menial." Gonzalez balanced his comment by emphasising the strength of Blizzard's handcrafted approach to art and making games. "That is, and always will be, a big part of it," he said.</p>
<p>Overwatch director Aaron Keller echoed that sentiment in the same interview, seemingly ruling out AI-use in the development of his game. "Right now, we don't use AI to create characters or gameplay," he said. "I think Blizzard as a whole is known for handcrafted games and handcrafted worlds. So, we try to pour all of our creative energy and all of our passion into doing that.</p><p>"For us, it is more important to get the details right, and to make sure that the gameplay is as impeccable as it can be and withholds the Blizzard standard, rather than trying to make something as quick as we possibly can."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-hops-on-controversial-ai-train-with-concept-art-tool">Blizzard has been linked with generative AI-use before</a>. In 2023, Blizzard reportedly told staff about a generative-AI concept art tool it had developed, called Stable Diffusion, that had been trained on the company's artwork. "We are on the brink of a major evolution in how we build and manage our games," read an email from Allen Adham, one of the co-founders of Blizzard, who once led the company. He left and rejoined the company a couple of times since those earlier days, leaving again in 2024. The email also mentioned "voice cloning", "game coding", "anti-toxicity", and "autonomous, intelligent in-game NPCs" among other potential uses for the generative AI tool. It's not clear whether this still exists in any form.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, generative AI is, as Aaron Keller noted in the above interview, an increasingly prevalent technology, "So we are going to see more of it." Exactly how much we'll see of it in Blizzard games, however, remains the question.</p>
<p>But Blizzard isn't the only major game development studio exploring the use of generative AI. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian revealed in December that it was exploring some uses of gen-AI</a> during development - a decision it faced heated backlash for, causing it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">to walk back on some uses it had in mind</a>.</p><p>I visited Blizzard campus last week for three separate days devoted to Overwatch, Diablo and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a>. The coverage embargoes for these days are staggered, but the Overwatch restriction has now lifted, hence a barrage of Overwatch news hitting the site. And there's a lot to write about. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">Overwatch is getting a big push from Blizzard</a>, as it drops a giant expansion-like release and adopts an expansion-like approach, and drops the "2" from the name to make it "Overwatch" again.</p>

      <p>A financially successful, breakout indie hit can be transformative for its developers. That money can be used to pay salaries and bonuses, reinvested in the company, or parked in savings for a rainy day. But a few studios have been using their windfalls to try to unfuck the video game publishing industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Indie studios including Innersloth, Pocketpair, Bigmode, and most recently <em>Phasmophobia</em> developer Kinetic Games have leveraged the success and profitability of their games (or in Bigmode’s case, a successful YouTube career) to spin up publishing endeavors that put innovation and sustainability over broad appeal and profit.</p><p>One thing all these companies have in common is viral success. <em>Among Us</em> and <em>Phasmophobia</em>, released by Innersloth and Kinetic Games, were among the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/sep/29/among-us-the-ultimate-party-game-of-the-covid-era?ref=aftermath.site"><u>defining games of the covid-19 pandemic</u></a>. In January 2024, Pocketpair launched <em>Palworld</em>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-has-huge-weekend-sells-5-million-and-overtakes-cyberpunk-2077-in-steams-most-played-games-list?ref=aftermath.site"><u>selling over 5 million copies within the first three days</u></a>. As the only non-developer on the list, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/09/22/dunkey-youtube-bigmode-indie-publisher/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Bigmode was started by Jason Gastrow</u></a>, the content creator better known as videogamedunkey, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/videogamedunkey?ref=aftermath.site"><u>who has over 7 million YouTube subscribers</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Success enabled the creation of all of these unconventional publishers, but was not always the reason they were founded. For the developers at Innersloth, the desire to start a publishing company came well before <em>Among Us</em> made it possible. “It's just something that I always wanted to do,” Forest Willard, lead programmer at Innersloth, told me. Before co-founding Innersloth, he worked as an engineer at Microsoft. There, he said he took advantage of a company culture that educated employees about personal investing but was uninterested in traditional investment vehicles or companies.</p><p>“Multiple years before the virality of <em>Among Us</em>, I was like, ‘Man, I wish I could do something that was actually with games as opposed to stocks.’” In 2024, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/among-us-dev-innersloth-starts-new-indie-game-fund-outersloth?ref=aftermath.site"><u>he did</u></a>, founding indie game fund Outersloth.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/pocketpair-launches-publishing-arm-partners-with-surgent-studios-for-first-title?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Starting a publishing studio</u></a> so soon after the runaway success of <em>Palworld</em> wasn’t part of Pocketpair’s plan at all. According to publishing and communications director John Buckley, it happened because people kept asking them for money.&nbsp;</p><p>“I'm talking solo developers who have never made a game, all the way to some of the most established AAA companies on the planet,” he said. “Everyone's looking for funding these days, and <em>Palworld</em> certainly made a lot of money, so it seemed like a good place to connect.”</p><p>Intimate knowledge of the development process led <em>Phasmophobia</em> creator Daniel Knight to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/phasmophobia-developer-kinetic-games-launches-indie-publishing-label?ref=aftermath.site"><u>start Kinetic Publishing earlier this year</u></a>. “This really grew out of my own journey with <em>Phasmophobia</em>,” he said over email. “As [the game] grew, so did the team and our understanding of what it takes to build something sustainably.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;In talking with these publishers, I heard about sustainability a lot, alongside the simple desire to just offer help. Jason Gastrow’s thriving YouTube career making video game content brought him and his wife Leah, in close contact with a lot of developers, who often shared with them their struggles. “I was like, ‘Oh, I wonder if somehow we could partner with and help them with funding or whatever,’” Leah Gastrow, co-founder of Bigmode, told me. According to Gastrow, her husband responded with, “yeah, that’s what publishers do.”&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PyzCLCGDUX4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="ONE BTN BOSSES – Gameplay Explainer"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>One Btn Bosses is one of Outersloth's earliest releases.</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="terms-of-endearment">Terms of Endearment</h2><p>But how publishers traditionally fund games is one of the fundamental reasons why “sustainability” and “helping developers” came up in every conversation I had. Despite their differing origin stories, all these unconventional publishers are responding to the same problems embedded in the publishing side of games.&nbsp;</p><p>Finding a publishing partner in a healthy video game industry was already fraught. Before digital distribution channels made it easier for indie studios to self-publish, they often sought support from traditional publishers. But these huge companies with household names like Sony, Microsoft, and Activision, with their publicly traded stock and shareholder overlords, are notoriously risk averse. They typically fund established studios making trend-chasing games that are best positioned to ensure a return on their investment.</p><blockquote>A game could be profitable on day one of its release, but the studio could still close because the publisher gets its cut first.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>In the last decade, however, new publishers like Devolver Digital, Hooded Horse, Annapurna Interactive, Playstack, and more have cropped up, offering more opportunities to the smaller outfits making weirder games. But as the industry continues <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/industry-layoffs-are-seemingly-slowing-but-the-damage-has-already-been-done?ref=aftermath.site"><u>through this current period of destabilization</u></a> with rampant <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july/"><u>layoffs</u></a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-closed/"><u>studio closings</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/ubisoft-cancels-six-games-slashes-guidance-in-restructuring?ref=aftermath.site"><u>cancelled projects</u></a>, publishers of all stripes are <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/where-did-all-the-money-go-the-state-of-games-investment?ref=aftermath.site"><u>tightening their belts</u></a>. And even when a studio does manage to snag a publisher, that partnership may not guarantee the studio’s survival.&nbsp;</p><p>“One horrible thing that exists within the industry is the use of recoup terms in contracts between publishers and developers,” said Tim Bender, co-founder of Hooded Horse, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hooded-horse-co-founder-says-publishers-should-ditch-horrible-recoup-clauses-to-help-devs?ref=aftermath.site"><u>in an interview with </u></a><a href="http://gamedeveloper.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>gamedeveloper.com</u></a>. It’s expensive and time consuming to make a game, so in exchange for funding and development support, publishers get a cut of the revenue. But often, contracts between studio and publisher are designed such that until a publisher’s initial investment is recouped, it doesn’t merely get a portion of a game’s profit, but all of it. A game could be profitable on day one of its release, but the studio could still close because the publisher gets its cut first.&nbsp;</p><p>“We don’t do that,” said John Buckley at Pocketpair. “The moment the game goes on sale, the developers start earning revenue straight away.” He also says Pocketpair ensures revenue splits favor the developer. Outersloth’s terms are similarly favorable, to the point that prospective clients sometimes don’t believe they’re real. “More than twice, I've heard back from lawyers like, ‘This is a scam. [The terms] were too good,’” said Victoria Tran, communications director at Outersloth.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F5WqVejX3-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="CASSETTE BOY Launch Trailer - Pocketpair Publishing"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>Cassette Boy, published by Pocketpair Publishing, is a trippy, forced-perspective puzzle game.</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="shorter-games-with-worse-graphics">Shorter Games with Worse Graphics</h2><p>The success of <em>Fortnite</em> spawned many, many imitators with <a href="https://kotaku.com/foamstars-review-splatoon-ps5-is-it-good-square-enix-1851239389?ref=aftermath.site"><u>varying</u></a> <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/arc-raiders/consequential-and-worthwhile-multiplayer?ref=aftermath.site"><u>levels</u></a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skull-and-bones-is-getting-another-year-of-updates-and-im-just-as-surprised-as-you-are?ref=aftermath.site"><u>success</u></a>. Studios and publishers spent hundreds of millions of dollars on development of live-service games in hopes of recouping billions in revenue. But often that revenue didn’t appear, either because of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/this-really-doesnt-look-promising-concord-pc-players-are-having-a-hard-time-finding-matches-thanks-to-ridiculously-low-player-counts/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>poor quality</u></a> or “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/live-service-gaas-games-silent-generation/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>live service fatigue</u></a>” leading to cancelled projects and shuttered studios. In 2025, Sony published the live service shooter<em> Concord</em>, developed by Firewalk Studios. It took eight years and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concords-initial-development-deal-was-200-million-but-it-wound-up-costing-sony-much-more-report?ref=aftermath.site"><u>$200 million</u></a> to develop, but Sony shut down the game and Firewalk <a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-firewalk-studios-shutdown/"><u>barely a month post-launch</u></a>. Elsewhere in Sony’s publishing portfolio, the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/16/bungie-confirms-unauthorized-use-of-art-after-artist-claims-her-work-is-present?ref=aftermath.site"><u>developmentally</u></a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688479/bungie-marathon-delay-sony?ref=aftermath.site"><u>fraught</u></a> <em>Marathon</em> releases <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/864146/bungie-marathon-release-date-march-5th-price?ref=aftermath.site"><u>later this year</u></a>.</p><p>None of these new publishers are looking for the next <em>Fortnite</em>. And when I asked what they <em>were</em> looking for, sometimes even they didn’t know. “We’re open to so much,” said Forest Willard, co-founder of Outersloth. He eventually settled on novelty being the best way to describe what they’re looking for in a game. “It needs to hook us in some way,” he said. “It needs something that sells the vision to us.”</p><blockquote>"The sheer enthusiasm they have when they talk about their game. I mean, it's impossible for us not to just say, ‘Sure, take the money.’"</blockquote><p>They’re looking beyond the game too. Outersloth signed<em> </em><a href="https://aftermath.site/one-btn-bosses/"><em><u>One Btn Bosses</u></em></a> because of its developers. “They made me feel like, regardless of whether their game did well or not, they would continue to make games,” Willard said. “Their passion was behind it. And I just wanted to give them that chance.”</p><p>Developer passion was also why Pocketpair signed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/760213/dead-take-review-fmv-horror-game-ben-starr?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Dead Take</em>, an FMV horror game</u></a>, on the strength of the pitch alone. Buckley talked about how, in the pitches he receives, he can get the sense a developer is pitching a game because they think it’ll make money. “But then you sit down with people like [the developers of] <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3090810/Truckful/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Truckful</u></em></a>,” he said. “The sheer enthusiasm they have when they talk about their game. I mean, it's impossible for us not to just say, ‘Sure, take the money.’”</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PBPEWcrro3g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Dead Take - Release Trailer"></iframe><figcaption><p><span> Pocketpair Publishing's first title is Dead Take, an FMV horror game staring Ben Starr and Neil Newbon.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Bigmode had the firmest idea for what they want, preferring games in which gameplay is the central appeal. “Finding the depth in the gameplay is what really excites us the most,” Leah Gastrow said. Of all the publishers I spoke to, Bigmode is the one choosing games with similar mechanics and aesthetics. Both their releases, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152153/animal-well-review-switch-ps5-steam-videogamedunkey?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Animal Well</u></em></a> and <em>Star of Providence</em>, are action games with puzzle elements and very little dialogue. Gastrow explained that tailoring their releases to a more narrow lane of games sets expectations in players.&nbsp;</p><p>Hooded Horse, another indie publishing company, operates in a similar fashion, signing only tactical and strategy games. In publishing similar games, Bigmode can cut through the noise of saturated digital marketplaces to target players directly.</p><p>“Publishers, when they're done well, can really help consumers and point them in the direction of things they might like,” Gastrow said.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2><p>Favorable terms and games signed based on vibes sounds like corporate altruism, but it’s working out for these publishers. Profitability is of course a concern, but these companies are willing to wait longer to earn a smaller cut than what big publishers take. “We don't necessarily need to recoup our money ASAP,” Buckley said. “That's why we can have these more generous terms.”&nbsp;</p><p>Acquiring profit slowly limits how many games these publishers can sustainably sign. Rather than pumping out games assembly-line style, they have more time to spend with each release.</p><p>“We only have two releases right now,” Gastrow said. “We're trying to give things enough breathing room where they get the focus that they need.”&nbsp;</p><p>That extra time has led to profit. Victoria Tran said that <em>Mars First Logistics</em>, one of Outersloth’s first games, launched to immediate success. Bigmode is doing well too.</p><p>“The goal for any business is to operate above the red and so far we're totally succeeding at that goal,” said Gastrow.</p><p>They’re also measuring success beyond profitability. Forest Willard at Outersloth explained that enabling a developer’s second chance by giving them a first is as worthy a goal as money. “Sometimes having a game be made is the success,” he said.</p><p>No publisher shared the details of just how much their games have been profitable. In my conversations, all of them acknowledged that every game they sign won’t be. How these companies manage risk and failure will be the key to their survival, and funding smaller, cheaper games based on a vision and not profitability projections seems to be working.&nbsp;</p><p>The publishers I spoke to know they can’t “save” the games industry from its current troubles, but they can try.&nbsp;</p><p>“What we can do is contribute in small, positive ways,” said Asim Tanvir, director of marketing and partnerships at Kinetic Publishing. “Encouraging sustainable practices, supporting creative risks where possible, and helping teams build for the long term.”</p>
