            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Despite the convoluted journey between concept and finished product, despite all the many things that change between initial prototype and whatever ends up in players’ hands, something always remains of the initial feeling that inspired a video game. If you know what to listen for, it’s easy to hear the echo of that original idea. Pokémon was born from a fascination with creatures, Zelda from nostalgia for the freedoms of childhood. Animal Crossing, meanwhile, was born from loneliness.</p><p>Katsuya Eguchi left his home prefecture of Chiba, east of Tokyo, to join Nintendo in 1986. He found it hard to adjust to living in Kyoto. “When I moved . . . I left my family and friends behind,” he told <em>Edge </em>magazine in 2008. “In doing so, I realized that being close to them—being able to spend time with them, talk to them, play with them—was such a great, important thing. I wondered for a long time if there would be a way to re-create that feeling, and that was the impetus behind the original <em>Animal Crossing</em>.”</p><p>Eguchi had a long career at Nintendo—he was a level designer on <em>Super Mario Bros. 3 </em>and <em>Yoshi’s Story</em>, and director on <em>Star Fox </em>and <em>Wave Race 64</em>—before the opportunity to explore his idea of a “communication game” arrived in the late 1990s. Nintendo was working on a floppy disk drive add-on for the N64, called the 64DD. Its disks had a then-ample 64 Mb of rewritable storage, which would allow players to save things that they created. It had the ability to connect to the internet, to share those things. And, most important for the game that would become <em>Animal Crossing</em>, it had a real-time twenty- four-hour clock. This meant that a game could continue to operate on its own schedule, whether you were playing it or not. Something new could be happening whenever the player turned up.</p><p>This wasn’t the first time that Nintendo had released a disk-writing add-on for one of its consoles: the Famicom Disk System sold 4.4 million units in Japan between 1986 and 1990, and it is very fondly remembered there. You could bring a Famicom disk into a game shop and rewrite it for a fee on a charmingly retro-futuristic- looking kiosk machine, from which you could also fax high scores from the disks directly to Nintendo to participate in tournaments. You can still buy bright-yellow Disk System–themed holders for your metro or bank cards in Nintendo’s department stores, featuring its charming mascot, Diskun (Mr. Disk).</p><p>Nintendo made a big fuss about the 64DD when it was announced in 1996, showing a demo of a Zelda game that would become <em>Ocarina of Time</em>. But it was, in the end, one of Nintendo’s hardware failures. It was released in Japan only in December 1999 and discontinued in February 2001, having sold about 15,000 units. Almost all of the soft- ware that had been in development for it ended up being transmog- rified and released in some form on the N64 or the GameCube. This is what happened to Eguchi’s “communication game”: It appeared in 2001 on the N64 under the name <em>Doubutsu no Mori</em>, or <em>Animal Forest</em>, the last game ever released for that console. Unlike the hardware it was initially developed for, it did not become a footnote in Nintendo history. Instead, it became one of its slow-burn successes.</p><p><em>Animal Forest </em>is an odd game. Slightly eerie, even. You arrive as a vacant-eyed stranger in a strange place, the only human in a population of chattering animals, and immediately you are railroaded into purchasing a house from Tom Nook, an arch-capitalist tanuki landlord, whom you must then pay back bit by bit. Each player’s cartridge was home to a unique, individually generated town, with space for four people to build a home, decorate it, talk to the animals, send and receive letters, and go hunting for shells, insects, and fish around the rivers, trees, and beaches. That was it. You couldn’t finish <em>Animal Forest</em>; you couldn’t play it well or badly. You just kind of . . . existed within it, checking in every day to see what was happening in your virtual life, who was moving in and out of town, what special events were coming up on the calendar. It continued to exist whether you were there or not. Spend a long time away, and weeds would grow up around the village. Your neighbors would be shocked to see you upon your return.</p><p>It is astonishing how ahead of its time <em>Animal Forest </em>turned out to be. Technology took years to catch up with its ideas. That initial version of the game, later ported to the GameCube as <em>Animal Crossing</em>, sold just over two million units, but each time a new version of the game was released, it came into a world that was more suited to it. For a long time Animal Crossing was one of Nintendo’s lesser-known series, one of those deep cuts you could feel smug about importing. But by the time <em>Wild World </em>turned up on the Nintendo DS, in 2005, the idea of internet-enabled social gaming was becoming mainstream. That game sold almost twelve million. By 2012, when <em>New Leaf </em>came out on the 3DS, the concept of expressing yourself within a game and sharing your creations with others was, thanks to social media, also totally normal- ized. The result: thirteen million sales. And then, in March 2020, <em>New Horizons </em>was released the same month that much of the world went into lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. It offered community, creativity, relaxation, and connection to a world that was suddenly starved of all those things. It sold over forty-five million copies and became the dominant pop-cultural phenomenon of that dreadful time. Way back in 1986, Eguchi envisioned a game that might ease his loneliness. In 2020, <em>New Horizons </em>saved the whole world from loneliness. There are few more perfect illustrations of the power of video games.</p><p>By the late nineties, Katsuya Eguchi had settled in Kyoto. He had friends, colleagues, a wife and children. But now he had a new problem: He was often so busy at work that he didn’t have time to play video games together with his family. His wife played games, his children played games, but there was no way for them to play together if his children were already asleep by the time he got home from the office.</p><p>“I was sad that I couldn’t play games with my kids, even though I knew it would be fun,” Eguchi explained at a Nintendo company seminar in 2008. “From the beginning my idea was that, if this is the way it’s going to be, maybe there’s something we could do that would let someone in a similar situation to me come home late and play. And that would somehow overlap with what the kids had played.”</p><div><p>“I was sad that I couldn’t play games with my kids, even though I knew it would be fun.”</p></div><p>Working with the theme of “playing with others,” Eguchi teamed up with Hisashi Nogami and Takashi Tezuka, and got the green light to start putting a game together in around 1998. The prototype they developed was absolutely nothing like <em>Animal Crossing</em>. It was a multiplayer dungeon adventure game.</p><p>“The beginning of that design was that you’d have this role-playing- game-like world in this massive field, and multiple people would enter, and your play would affect the other players . . . For instance, say the kids were adventuring in a dungeon during the day and made it some of the way through, but then they reach a point they can’t get past. When dad came home at night, he could use the information the kids left as a hint and clear the dungeon, and proceed further. I wondered how that kind of relay-type play would be.”</p><p>The only connection to <em>Animal Crossing </em>in this prototype—apart from the idea of playing together—was that players could bring pets with them on their adventures. “There are lots of RPGs where you become the hero, but in the game that I was imagining, the player was powerless,” Eguchi explained. “So I thought, ok, what the player can’t do on their own, they could borrow the power of animals to overcome. That’s the first time the idea of animals came up for this project . . . There wasn’t even a hint of being able to have conversations with animals at the time.” You would have been able to get only so far with your own animal’s powers; at some point you’d need help from another player, hence the social side of the game.</p><p>It was the waning fortunes of the 64DD that forced the team to change tack. “During our original planning phase the field was incredibly large . . . There would be four different islands—one for each of the four seasons, and each island would have small dungeons that you would adventure in,” explained Nogami. “Of course, some- thing so large wouldn’t possibly fit [on a Nintendo 64 cartridge], so we thought fine—let’s make it one [island].”</p><p>“But then we asked ourselves, what could players enjoy doing in such a tiny village?” Eguchi interjected.</p><p>“We thought, well you can’t really have an adventure now, can you,” replied Nogami. “And so we said fine. Let’s get rid of the adventure.”</p><p>Adapted from: Super Nintendo by Keza MacDonald<br>Copyright © 2026 by Keza MacDonald. Published by arrangement with Alfred A.

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty Hit by WARDOGS Comment: ‘No Nikki Minaj Skins’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bulkhead-wardogs-call-of-duty-comment-nikki-minaj/</link>
            <guid>1429906</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Last week, Bulkhead revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wardogs/" id="3558">WARDOGS</a>, a developing first-person tactical shooter with an impressive amount of ambition. It has been in development for several years and shone brightly in the game’s first trailer, which offered a tasty lay of the land for what’s set to come.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, the team at Bulkhead was explaining how many aspects of WARDOGS will work, including monetization. In a thinly-veiled stab at Call of Duty, they stressed that there will be ‘No Nikki Minaj skins. No bullshit.’</p>







<h2 id="h-wardogs-is-all-about-realism">WARDOGS is All About Realism</h2>



<p>WARDOGS is bursting with potential and has already garnered a sizeable following since dropping its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wardogs-reveal-trailer-100-player-tactical-warfare/">inaugural trailer last week</a>. It’s a large-scale, wide conflict game with destruction elements, vehicles, a unique economy model, and above all else, <strong>realism</strong> running deep in its veins.</p>



<p>That’s why the team recently addressed the game’s monetization model and said that there won’t be any battle pass features or ‘Nikki Minaj skins’.</p>



<p>This is a reference to Call of Duty, which has spent the last few years promoting inane crossover cosmetics packs that have featured the likes of Nikki Minaj, Snoop Dogg, Family Guy, Beavis and Butthead, and Squid Game, to name a few. It has long since diluted the Call of Duty name and made it feel like something closer to Fortnite.</p>



<p>Here’s the full post from the team at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bulkhead/" id="3559">Bulkhead</a>, WARDOGS’ developer:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>// MONESTISATION?</p><p>No Battlepass. No Pay to Win.<br>No Nikki Minaj Skins. No Bullshit.</p><p>Earn cosmetics by playing.</p><p>WARDOGS is an immersive, Tactical All Out Warfare FPS that doesn't forget it's a game… <a href="https://t.co/Yp3d280XxQ">pic.twitter.com/Yp3d280XxQ</a></p></div>— WARDOGS (@WARDOGS) <a href="https://twitter.com/WARDOGS/status/2020591501785678082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>WARDOGS doesn’t have a release date yet, nor does it have a testing window arranged, but prospective fans are being invited to sign up to receive updates on that front as soon as they’re available.</p>



<p>In WARDOGS, players start a match with $10,000 in their pocket, and as they play, they earn more money. That money is then spent on weapons, vehicles, upgrades, and other items designed to turn the tide of battle. It’s a large-scale concept that can be scaled right down to the individual player, of which there are 100 in every match.</p>







<p>Does WARDOGS look like your kind of game? Let us know what you think on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Featuring over an hour of news and reveals.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation will stream a major State of Play broadcast this week, featuring over an hour of news and reveals, including the latest updates from its own teams within PlayStation Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The event will be held this Thursday, February 12 at 2pm Pacific / 5pm Eastern / 10pm UK time — and as ever, IGN will be reporting live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has said that the broadcast will run to "60+ minutes" — suggesting fans have a meaty show to look forward to. But what could PlayStation have up its sleeves?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-state-of-play-september-2025-everything-announced">Sony's last major State of Play broadcast, held back in September 2025</a>, finally treated fans to a good look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Marvel's Wolverine</a>, which is in development by the talented team behind the console's various Spider-Man titles: PlayStation studio Insomniac Games. Other games showcased included <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/saros">Saros</a>, the next project from Returnal studio Housemarque, as well as third-party titles such as Battlefield 6 and Nioh 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The company then held <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/state-of-play-japan-everything-announced-updating-live">a smaller-scale State of Play in November 2025 focused solely on Japanese titles</a>, and it was here we got a look at Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, Elden Ring Nightreign expansion The Forsaken Hollows, Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation fans will certainly be keen to see more of Wolverine and Saros, and potentially discover a release date for the former. We're also likely to see something of Bungie's long-delayed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, which will finally arrive on March 5 — less than a month away. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Saros September 2025 State of Play - Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Saros has already been dated for April 30, though currently all we know for certain of Wolverine's arrival is that he'll land in the second half of this year. (With GTA 6 due on November 16, it'll likely be earlier, and well clear of that.) Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/some-kind-of-fancy-lawyer-lingo-marvels-wolverine-developer-just-dropped-a-big-tease-for-another-hero-fans-believe">a tease from Insomniac Games hinted at Wolverine meeting Daredevil in the game</a>. And, of course, we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrillas-new-co-op-action-game-for-ps5-and-pc">just got a first look at multiplayer Horizon spin-off Hunters Gathering</a>. Perhaps we'll get more news on early play sessions?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Third-party games set for PS5 in the coming months include Capcom's Monster Hunter Stories 3 and Pragmata, which just got a showing in Nintendo's Partner Direct, Square Enix's climactic Life is Strange Reunion, Hitman developer IO Interactive's 007 First Light and Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight from Warner Bros. Games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The confirmation of a State of Play this week will mean that all three major platform holders will have held some form of announcement broadcast within the first six weeks of 2026 — though Nintendo fans still hope there is a dedicated first-party Nintendo Direct also waiting in the wings with more news on the company's own games (and perhaps a new 3D Mario). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, though, join us here on IGN for all of the news and reveals from this week's State of Play in just a few days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Over the course of 14 days, it "welcomes you into encounters that test your obedience, complicity, and restraint." The player experiences "the farm's unspeakable horrors through daily unique interactions," as they must "withstand 14 days of spiraling dread as the reality of the farm unfolds."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-horror-game-horses-banned-from-steam-leaving-studio-with-high-risk-of-closure"><u>Horses was first banned from Steam two years ago</u></a> after the team submitted an in-progress prototype. While some feedback was provided, Santa Ragione insists that no specifics were shared with the team at the time, nor was there an opportunity to appeal. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too"><u>It was banned again in December</u></a> due to its disturbing imagery, and while violent and sexual content is hardly new for either Steam or Epic, Santa Ragione took issue with what it deemed to be censorship, calling for "clearer rules, transparent processes, and meaningful accountability from near monopolistic distribution platforms and the systems they enforce."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast-forward to this past weekend, and Santa Ragione posted a statement refuting Epic VP Steve Allison's comment that said "we love [its] studio," blasting the firm for "refus[ing] to provide details supporting their claims," and accusing Epic of making "provably incorrect statements about the game's content."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Epic made provably incorrect statements about the game’s content, refused to provide details supporting their claims, and has not shared their claimed AO IARC certificate, which normally includes a link for the developer to appeal," the studio <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3mebdquhjts2k" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posted</u></a> in response to an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/epic-has-many-plans-for-its-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Game File</u></a>. "They do not ‘love that studio’, they have effectively ghosted us."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The fact that the game does not deserve an AO rating is apparent from the widely available full walkthroughs on YouTube and Twitch, as well as from its distribution on the Humble Store."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games, however, has remained adamant that the game violated the Epic Games Store’s Content Guidelines. In a statement to IGN, Epic Games' senior communications manager, Brian Sharon, said: "Our team played the game and found it violated the Epic Games Store’s Content Guidelines, specifically the 'Inappropriate Content' and 'Hateful or Abusive Content' policies. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Horses Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We did a secondary check by filling out the ratings questionnaire for the game ourselves and the content got an Adults Only (AO) rating — which we do not allow on the Store. Because this wasn’t an official submission, we do not have a certificate to share with the team. We did give the developers context around the policies they violated. When they appealed, we reviewed the content again, and let them know the decision was appropriately applied and will remain in place."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the distribution issues, Horses has managed to sell over 18,000 copies. Though that's not enough for the publisher to fund a new game, it says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-sells-over-18k-copies-pays-back-loans-and-royalties-despite-removal-from-steam-and-epic"><u>it has been able to generate $65,000 in net revenue</u></a> by mid-December, which was enough to pay off loans and settle royalties owned to creator Andrea Lucco Borlera. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-review">Our own reviewer</a> gave it a 7/10, calling it "an affecting first-person horror game that, despite some repetitive tasks and signposting issues, delivers a harrowing story you won’t forget in a hurry."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

"Having a project killed is a brutal experience. It's an aspect of the game industry that the public doesn't often see, but developers are all too familiar with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A cancelation so close to release can be particularly devastating for younger team members who don't have decades of past shipped titles on their resumé. It's tough to suddenly absorb that the past four years of hard work you were proud of, and looking forward to seeing out in the world as your new calling card, will now never see daylight. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Words like loss and grieving might seem exaggerated," he concluded, "but artists put their hearts into their work.

A swathe of other, unnamed games were also delayed — reportedly including Ubisoft's unconfirmed but widely-expected Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For its part, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-needed-more-time-and-investment-than-we-could-responsibly-commit-5-years-after-it-was-first-due-to-launch">Ubisoft told Prince of Persia fans that despite six years of work, its Sands of Time remake was still too far away from being ready</a> to fund any further — despite the suggestion from other reporting that the game had been nearing release.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/this-is-a-hill-worth-dying-on-overwatch-actor-supports-potential-redesign-of-criticized-character</link>
            <guid>1429891</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The actor behind the English language version of the newly revealed Overwatch hero, Anran, has responded to criticism of her visual design, supporting calls for her look to be changed, claiming, “this is a hill worth dying on.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-ditching-the-2-amid-launch-of-new-story-driven-era-with-10-new-heroes"><u>Overwatch spotlight saw the introduction of a new era</u></a> for Blizzard’s hero shooter, but, with it, came the reemergence of an issue that’s followed the design of its characters around for many years now: “Same Face Syndrome.” The look of Overwatch’s female heroes has long been a talking point among fans, some of whom have claimed that the characters all share remarkably similar facial features, no matter where that character is from in this universe. Indeed, fans have said this applies to Swedish shield-bearer Brigitte, Japanese healer Kiriko, and the Martian support, Juno. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, with five new heroes joining the team imminently, fans say Blizzard is adding another familiar face to that list, in the shape of Anran, a fiery damage dealer from China. Having played with Anran quite a bit over the weekend, I can confirm she’s very fun to play as, but there’s no getting away from the fact that you could swap her face with almost any other female member of the roster, and not instantly notice a difference.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This has led to many members of the Overwatch community raising their concerns about the lack of variety in how Blizzard designs its female characters, and whether unrealistic beauty standards are being portrayed in a game with an otherwise positive message. It’s even something that's led the English voice actor for Anran, Fareeha, to weigh in with her thoughts on the backlash.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'm the voice of Anran in Overwatch!!! 🧡</p><p>I held off on posting about this because I wanted to make sure I could do this discussion justice. Here's a shot at that! </p><p>Let's keep rooting for the version of her that could be. I hope you have so much fun playing her!! 🔥🪭 <a href="https://t.co/jbFbKHPVpb" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/jbFbKHPVpb</a></p></div>— Fareeha (@AskFareeha) <a href="https://twitter.com/AskFareeha/status/2020291256279089431?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 8, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m going to be so honest”, Fareeha said in a video posted on social media. “I’m nervous about this video, because I didn’t want to not address the elephant in the room, but I didn’t want to step on the devs’ toes or speak on their behalf because it’s a tightrope in my mind in trying to honor the community and everyone’s criticism, because I agree, and also give grace to the developers because they’re always trying their best in the situation they’re in.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anran had been teased as a playable hero in Overwatch for a short while before her release, after appearing in a comic and cinematic alongside her brother, Wuyang. But curiously, fans say she looked different in those earlier published looks, which begs the question why her face now appears to fit the more uniform Overwatch look in-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I got to mourn Anran, between the design that I had hoped for for her, and the design we ended up with," Fareeha continued. “Because I think in her comic and the cinematic, there was a precedent set by it. There was an unspoken promise that said ‘we’re going to challenge the beauty standards that are plaguing and ransacking media these days.’ Right? The Ozempic chic, the ‘contour your nose’, ‘you have no nose’, ‘the tiniest nose’. And I think because of that precedent, people feel understandably let down.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">rhinoplasty, eye lift, jaw shave, botox, cheek filler, facial bone surgery, gastric bypass surgery, face lift, lip filler, buccal fat removal <a href="https://t.co/f4OAgIquGg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/f4OAgIquGg</a></p>— Sasha 🔨 Torbjörn CEO (@torbillionare) <a href="https://twitter.com/torbillionare/status/2019165893243318438?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 4, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Overwatch is a trailblazer at challenging that, right? Of trying to break those molds, of trying to explore the bounds of what it means to be good, what it looks like to be heroic. And I think the result we got says something else. It says something that leaves a bad taste in our mouths. It’s not the bold, optimistic swing that we know Overwatch to make. It’s a look that isn’t congruent with her personality, right?. She looks like the younger sibling. She looks more docile, somehow, as a fire hero, she looks more docile than the most docile peacekeeping support in the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since this new look was revealed, fans of the game have been taking to social media to present their redesigns and suggestions as to how to give Anran a different look, which is something Fareeha said she had seen, appreciated and encouraged.</p><p>This is a hill worth dying on.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’ve been seeing everyone’s redesigns, and quietly bookmarking them, but I wanted you to hear that this concern is important," Fareeha stated. “This is a hill worth dying on. It's worth speaking on, because I believe the more we speak up about the things that truly matter to us, the more we’ll see ourselves reflected in the world around us. The more we’ll see our values in the world around us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I want you to know that I shared all of this with the dev team. Not only that, I was encouraged to be as open and honest as possible and to not hold anything back. And, it’s my hope that this isn’t for naught, right? That they see it, they hear it from you all, too. While it’s not my decision to decide what can be done and what gets done about this, I will keep championing for the version of her that we all wished for, and I want you to do the same, with boldness, with kindness, and with ‘hopium’. Because Overwatch is not an exploration of what the world is, it’s an exploration of what the world could be.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I got chills looking at this omg <br>GORGEOUS ❤️‍🔥 <a href="https://t.co/omwie4G8gV" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/omwie4G8gV</a></p>— Fareeha (@AskFareeha) <a href="https://twitter.com/AskFareeha/status/2020610824696701142?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 8, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Time will tell if Anran does receive an alteration to realign her look with what was originally conceived, or, indeed, if any future female heroes added to Overwatch’s roster manage to avoid the now-dreaded “same face syndrome”.

Each time you land you’ll be closer to the peak and one step closer to mastering the platforming, but your fall down the mountain will be even farther.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Swing to <a title="Games > Reach [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/reach">Reach</a> Distant Platforms</strong> – Bread and Fred are attached to each other.

Make sure one of you anchors down to the ground or you’ll both fall!</li><li><strong>Hold On to Walls As Long As You Can</strong> – The penguins’ little hands aren’t very good, but you can hang on a wall with your partner for a few seconds to swing them around and overcome the next obstacle. Be careful though. These penguins are chubby so you can’t hold on long. Act fast!</li><li><strong>Single-Player Mode</strong> – Can’t find your penguin buddy? Strap your rope to Jeff (a rock!) and use it instead! The climb will all be up to you and your skill, but that also means you have no one to blame when you fall…</li></ul><p>Legends say that with these skills, a few penguin heroes have managed to reach the top. Will you be one of them?</p><p>Each fall will hurt, but try to learn and laugh through it. Think carefully about each jump and master the penguin skills to reach the summit.</p><p>For the craziest climbers, <em>Bread &amp; Fred</em> includes a speedrun mode so you can compete and be crowned the best penguins on the planet.</p><p>The mountain awaits you. Complete your mission. Cooperate with each other and you will be able to go far up the mountain. Just try not to fall (too much).

<p>The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/09/state-of-play-returns-this-thursday-february-12/">State of Play</a> will stream on PlayStation's various YouTube and Twitch channels. As for what to expect, that's anybody's guess. On the first-party front, PlayStation's Housemarque studio is launching <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/saros">Saros</a> in <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/saros-gets-a-new-gameplay-trailer-and-a-delay-to-april-2026">April, after a delay from its original March date</a>; Insomniac Games is releasing <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/marvels-wolverine">Marvel's Wolverine</a>, which is <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2023/10/27/wolverine-game-set-in-the-same-universe-as-marvels-spider-man-insomniac-confirms">set in the same universe as the studio's Spider-Man games</a>, sometime this year as well, so there's a good chance we'll see both of these games on Thursday.&nbsp;</p><p>On the third-party front, nobody would be surprised to see more <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, which has been closely aligned with PlayStation on marketing, and given Capcom's history with its prior Resident Evil games, there's a chance we get a Requiem demo – both Biohazard and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/01/21/resident-evil-village-ps5-exclusive-demo-drops-today-alongside-new-video">Village received demos prior to launch</a>. Capcom could also appear with another look at <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/pragmata">Pragmata</a> before its <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/pragmata-comes-to-switch-2-and-other-platforms-next-april-and-a">April release</a>, and we also expect to see various other third-party and indie games as well.&nbsp;</p><p>With over an hour promised of news and updates, this will likely be one of PlayStation's biggest showcases of the year.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Let us know what you want to see at the PlayStation State of Play in the comments below!</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/psa/2026/02/09/state-of-play-announced-for-this-week-will-feature-over-an-hour-of-third-party-indie]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A demo of Sad Cat Studios' cyberpunk platformer Replaced has been announced.</p>
<p>Replaced is the rather wonderful looking 2.5D "retro-futuristic" sci-fi platformer, which is set in an alternate 1980s America that has been scarred by a nuclear catastrophe. It plops players into the shoes of Reach, an AI who becomes unexpectedly trapped inside a human's body.</p>
<p>Replaced's is set to release next month, but ahead of that, developer Sad Cat Studios' has revealed a demo, which will be available on PC (Steam and Windows store) from 11th February, 2pm UK time.</p>

<p>"Expose the sinister secrets of Phoenix Corporation as Reach, an AI trapped in a human body," reads Replaced's official blurb.  "Navigate a dark cyberpunk thriller in this narrative-driven 2.5D platformer blending cinematic exploration with fluid, free-flow action."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/belarusian-based-sat-cat-studio-delays-upcoming-game-due-to-russias-war-in-ukraine">After a few delays</a>, Replaced is set to release on 12th March, across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663850/REPLACED/">PC Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/replaced/9mz1c8d26b7h">Xbox Series X/S</a>, Xbox Game Pass, PC Epic, and PC GOG.</p>
<p>I recently got to go hands-on with Replaced. "I really think Replaced has the potential to be something special. I fully expect I will need tissues by the end of it, though, because I have theory about where things are going and well, yeah, emotions. And while emotions alone don't count for much, it's the brutality and relevance of its dystopian setting that makes such a human heart matter," I wrote in Eurogamer's Replaced preview.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ps5-showcase-sony-marvel-wolverine-release-date-2000666866</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s felt like it’s been a while since Sony’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-5-2025-ghost-yotei-sales-plus-price-hike-2000653527">last big gaming showcase</a>. We’ve had smaller ones but nothing that felt like a real preview of the PlayStation 5’s next chapter. That seems like it’s about to change. Sony confirmed there’s a new State of Play airing later this week and it’s a long one.</p> <p>It starts at 5:00 p.m. ET on February 12 and will run over an hour. “Tune in live this Thursday for 60+ minutes of news, gameplay updates, and announcements from game studios across the globe,” reads an announcement <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/09/state-of-play-returns-this-thursday-february-12/">on the PlayStation Blog</a>. “February’s State of Play will spotlight eye-catching third-party and indie games headed to PS5, along with the latest from teams at PlayStation Studios.”</p>

 <p>Unlike some State of Play showcases that focus on a specific game, third-party publishers, or PS VR (remember those?), this one looks like it has the potential to include everything. Does that mean we’ll finally hear about a rumored new<a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-2000618215"> <em>God of War</em> game</a> or get our first tease of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> part three? Possibly. News on this year’s already announced blockbusters, like Insomniac’s <em>Wolverine</em>, is a safer bet.</p> <p>Earlier today, the Latin America PlayStation Store briefly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qzjskk/the_latin_american_playstation_store_lists/">appeared to leak a third quarter release window</a> for the new Marvel action game, suggesting it’ll arrive sometime over the summer between July and September. Other upcoming Sony published games include Housemarque’s roguelike shooter<em> Saros</em> and Arc System Works’ fighting game <em>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</em>. The <em>Halo Combat Evolved</em> remake is also coming to PS5 in 2026. Will it be Microsoft’s debut at a Sony showcase? Stranger things have happened at this point.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Won’t Have ‘Fortnite Skins’ in a Bid to Protect Game’s Vision]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-wont-have-fortnite-skins-protect-game/</link>
            <guid>1429849</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone was concerned that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790">ARC Raiders</a>, the hyper-popular extraction adventure title from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embark-studios/" id="1161">Embark Studios</a>, would feed into the ‘skin hype’ kickstarted years ago by games like Fortnite. It has become something of a pandemic in recent years, with military shooters generating skins and cosmetics that can be, at times, quite bizarre and out of place.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, Patrick Söderlund, CEO at Embark Studios, confirmed that ARC Raiders <strong>will not </strong>be getting any inane crossovers or irrelevant skins, out of a fear of diluting the game’s vision and overall image or theme.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-will-not-get-fortnite-style-skins">ARC Raiders Will Not Get Fortnite-Style Skins</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders has a sublime post-apocalyptic vibe that shines through in every skin that Embark Studios has created, even in the skins that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-skin-makes-sense/">might not hit as well</a> with the audience. They’re authentic, grounded, and apply very nicely to the game’s aesthetic, so adding in a collaboration skin pack with another brand <strong>might not </strong>make sense, unless… Well, unless <em>it does</em>.</p>



<p>Patrick Söderlund recently spoke <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to IGN</a> and offered up his two cents on the skin debate, explaining that the game’s art director, Robert Sammelin, has the driving control over the game’s cosmetics, and wants things to keep making sense going forward.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I mean, there are other games, very successful games out there – The Finals being one of them – in which the IP is designed so it basically happens to be very elastic. You can do whatever the hell you want, and people are like, ‘That makes sense. It’s completely plausible.’ </p>



<p>I can be a pink banana, and you can be whatever, and everyone’s like, ‘That makes sense. It fits the universe. No problem.’ ARC Raiders has a more curated lore, curated world, so we have to stick within boundaries slightly to a different extent than maybe The Finals or Fortnite or another game in which Batman can shoot Bart Simpson.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He said simply, ‘That’s not the vision for our game.’ There are plans to deepen the lore of ARC Raiders, expanding it from what we already know and offering more meat to the post-apocalyptic bones, which fans are eager to soak up. At no point does a cash-grab crossover feed into that concept.</p>



<p>Söderlund explained how he uses ARC Raiders’ customization mechanics quite often, swapping out his gear as new items surface and keeping his appearance fresh, so this is important to <strong>him</strong> too:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That won’t change. I think that’s going to be very important. I personally never believed that I would care about what I was wearing in a video game. Listen, I’m just being very honest with you, but I’m like a child. Whenever something new comes out, I need to have it. I swap my gear. I swap my backpacks and things and charms.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>ARC Raiders continues to be one of the most consistent games to emerge in recent years. It dropped at the end of October and has remained strong since, keeping up a solid player count and deep impressions across all platforms.</p>

            <p>It's been a while since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-in-playstations-latest-state-of-play-showcase">the last State of Play</a>, which gave us our first proper look at Insomniac's brutal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvels-wolverine">Wolverine</a> game and started to nail down the final details on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/saros">Saros</a>, the new sci-fi roguelite from Housemarque. Now, we finally know when the next big stream from Sony is happening.</p>
<p>On 9th February, and following a bunch of rumours, 2026's first State of Play was locked for <strong>12th February, Thursday, at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm GMT / 11pm CEST</strong>. As always, you can watch via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PlayStation">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation">Twitch</a>, so set your alarms and start working on big theories and wishlists!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/09/state-of-play-returns-this-thursday-february-12/">official PlayStation Blog post</a> doesn't tease any of the titles we'll be seeing, but it makes it very clear it's a full-blown showcase featuring third-party and indie games as well as large projects from PlayStation Studios. It'll be over 60 minutes long and include "news, gameplay updates, and announcements."</p>
<p>Last week, Guerrilla Games surprised-dropped a reveal of the second long-rumoured online Horizon game: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-hunters-gathering-is-a-three-player-tactical-co-op-game-that-looks-a-bit-like-dauntless-with-a-closed-playtest-coming-soon">Hunters Gathering</a>. We might get an extra update on the upcoming playtests there, but otherwise, it's strange Sony got it out of the way so close to a big State of Play.</p><p>As we march into a year that should be mainly defined on the first-party front by Saros and Wolverine, many are wondering whether PlayStation Studios has more aces up its sleeve beyond the admittedly strong third-party support and Bungie's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marathon">Marathon</a> (coming March), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-soars-to-steams-top-sellers-after-release-date-reveal">which has been doing actually okay</a> following its rebooted marketing campaign.</p>
<p>In any case, it's exciting to be looking forward to another one of these streams again, and with no limits to what can be shown, anything is possible. What are you hoping for?</p>

            <p>Last year I covered the demo for Void War, robotically describing it as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ftl-meets-warhammer-40000-in-tactical-space-sim-void-war">FTL meets Warhammer 40,000</a>, because that is what it is, and sometimes, you have to call a Spade Marine a Spade Marine (I did enjoy the demo, as flagrantly combinatory as the game may be). </p>
<p>Void War's art direction has apparently proven a little too familiar in places for Games Workshop’s liking. Developers Tundra Interactive report that the Warhammer publisher issued a Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown notice earlier this year, which led to their game being <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2853590/Void_War/">temporarily removed from Steam</a>. </p>
<p>Initially, it was thought that the DMCA notice was a nonsense claim similar to that levelled at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/haunted-videogame-no-players-online-resurrected-on-steam-after-a-disgruntled-former-friend-had-it-exorcised-via-dmca">No Players Online</a>, the DMCA system <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/river-city-ransom-underground-pulled-from-sale-following-copyright-claims">being perilously easy to abuse</a>. It was issued by somebody called Mal Reynolds, and Mal Reynolds is also the name of Nathan Fillion’s character in Firefly. Suspicious indeed. Tundra have now spoken with Games Workshop, however, and confirmed the claim’s authenticity, though they've yet to clear up the implication here that interplanetary gunslinger Mal Reynolds is secretly a copyright lawyer.</p>
<figure>

<p>According to the developers, Games Workshop's inquisitors were particularly irked by the design of some shoulderpads in one of the featured trailers, referred to in correspondence as "oversized convex shoulder pads with a metallic rim". Find a screen of the armour at stake in the vicinity of this paragraph. Tundra insist that those convex shoulderpads are all their own work, but say they’ve removed the trailer anyway to avoid disruption.</p>
<p>"All of the artwork in the trailer is original work created by our artists,” reads <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-issued-ftl-in-a-warhammer-40000-skin-steam-game-with-a-dmca-takedown-because-of-oversized-convex-shoulder-pads-with-a-metallic-rim-dev-says">a statement to IGN</a>. “While we disagree with their assessment, the simplest way to get the game back up and avoid getting bogged down in DMCA process was to remove that trailer and move on. We may re-upload an updated version later after we find time to adjust that shot, but for now our priority is shipping content and finishing multi-language font support so we can finally deliver proper translations." </p>
<p>As ever with these things, it is possible to decry how companies with massive legal teams slice the ankles of smaller independent developers, while also acknowledging that the game in question is a screaming rip-off, however entertaining.</p>
<p>That aside, I could absolutely imagine Warhammer 40,000's Imperium launching a crusade in response to copyright infringement. Those Chaos Space Marines are naught but tepid plagiarists. You can’t just glue some novelty Halloween fingers and a rug to your Primarch armour and say you’ve invented the wheel, Horus! Nathon Fillion is on his way over with a subpoena.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Activision Paid xQc $1 Million to Stream Warzone for a Day]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/activision-paid-xqc-1-million-stream-warzone/</link>
            <guid>1429822</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s no big secret that xQc is a big-bucks streamer with plenty of cash behind him, but when the numbers start getting revealed, things start to get a little mind-blowing. Recently, the somewhat eccentric content creator revealed that he was paid a whopping $1 million, more money than some people will see in their entire lives, for <strong>streaming Call of Duty: Warzone for 12 hours</strong>.</p>



<p>What’s more amazing is that the sum was paid for a single stream <strong>despite </strong>the original ‘deal’ being for several streams over two weeks.</p>







<h2 id="h-chump-change-for-a-streamer-like-xqc">Chump Change for a Streamer Like xQc</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with Dexerto, xQc revealed he was paid a mighty sum of $1 million for streaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/warzone/" id="54">Warzone</a>, Activision’s battle royale, for just half a day. That wasn’t even his best day, as he also unveiled an eye-watering $15 million payday for <strong>gambling content</strong>.</p>



<p>The streamer, who often confuses viewers with his hyperactive cadence, has made an immense name for himself over the years, ever since dropping out of competitive Overwatch. He’s now a multi-faceted streamer who is often regarded as one of the biggest earners in the industry, and it’s obvious why.</p>



<p>The recent interview <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/xqc-reveals-he-was-paid-1-million-to-play-call-of-duty-for-12-hours-3315972/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with Dexerto</a> uncovered his insane payday for streaming a battle royale game for 12 hours:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When it comes down to a sponsor, I had a late sponsor kick in. It was Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>



<p>I hadn’t answered their request for their sponsors for like the whole season. At the end, they were like, ‘Yo, dude, we’ll give you like the rest of the budget or whatever.’</p>



<p>They’re like, ‘Well, you were supposed to play like once or like a couple times for 2 weeks, but you can do it all in one day if you want.’</p>



<p>I played for like 12 hours, I think. And it was like $1 mil flat. That was the biggest condensed sponsor I’ve ever taken.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It seems bizarre to think a streamer can make that much money for broadcasting a game for half a day, but that’s the world we live in. It’s a fact that content is king, and developers and publishers would rather stump up for a group of streamers to play their game than opt for traditional marketing approaches these days.</p>



<p>While that’s axiomatic, xQc is perhaps an exceptional circumstance, as not <strong>every </strong>big streamer out there will secure such a massive bag for a simple, single stream.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Delta Force is in the midst of a huge leap, spurred onwards by a massive update and a lucrative creator-backed content initiative. It has been such a roaring success that the game has <strong>breezed </strong>past similar shooters on Steam to land in the top five most-played games on the platform today.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, a whopping 138,120 people were playing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/delta-force/" id="878">Delta Force</a> on <strong>Steam alone</strong>, marking a huge overtaking of some of the biggest shooter franchises in the world.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-is-delta-force-soaring-on-steam">Why is Delta Force Soaring on Steam?</h2>



<p>Delta Force is revving up <strong>big time </strong>on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/steam/" id="173">Steam</a>, effortlessly overtaking games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" id="2795">Black Ops 7</a>, and it’s mostly because of the game’s eighth season – Morphosis. This supersized update has introduced incredible destruction, a new operator, and a fresh tweak on the game’s extraction mode, called Fiery Owl Hunt.</p>



<p>In the last few days, Delta Force viewers found themselves enjoying an enormous creator campaign backed by some of the biggest names in the business. The top-tier streaming community, represented by xQc, shroud, summit1g, TheBurntPeanut, NICKMERCS, and Nadeshot, all participated in the ‘Streamer Week’ initiative, backed by TiMi, the game’s developer.</p>



<p>This brought unreal eyes to the game, which was released in December 2024 but has recently seen a surge in players.</p>



<p>Going back a little, the new Fiery Owl Hunt mode introduced in Morphosis is a limited-time event that allows players to step into the shoes of an in-game <strong>boss character</strong>, Saeed. This was a hit with extraction fans, offering up a perspective <strong>never before seen </strong>in the space.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Delta Force occupied the fifth-place spot in Steam’s leaderboard, sitting above Rust and behind the likes of PUBG and Counter-Strike 2. By comparison, Battlefield 6 sat in 52nd place with 27,500 players, while Call of Duty was in the 45th spot, with 30,300 players.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Rainbow Six, Escape from Tarkov, Apex Legends, ARC Raiders… They all sat below Delta Force.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Helldivers 2’s Cyborg Legion is Back, New Trailer Reveals]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-cyborg-legion-return/</link>
            <guid>1429795</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Helldivers 2 countdown that was running recently has <strong>ended</strong>, resulting in the publishing of a super short trailer that has unveiled a revelation: the Cyborg Legion is <strong>back</strong>.</p>



<p>This means that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/helldivers-2/" id="850">Helldivers 2</a> players are about to come face to face with former citizens of Super Earth, once defeated and now rising back up with a threat. If Cyberstan is attacked, their retribution will be swiftly felt across the galaxy. This is a throwback to the original Helldivers game, and fans are here for every second of it.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-cyborg-legion-is-back-beware">The Cyborg Legion is Back – Beware!</h2>



<p>Cyberstan, for the uninitiated, is a hostile world in the Helldivers universe, populated by ‘former’ humans augmented with cybernetic abilities, used originally to withstand harsh working conditions. They foster a hatred for humans and have dubbed Cyberstan their homeworld, despite originally coming from Super Earth.</p>



<p>Here’s the short teaser trailer that dropped after the Helldivers 2 countdown ended recently:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="01001000 01000101 01001100 01001100 01001111 00100000 01010111 01001111 01010010 01001100 01000100" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mJSxy5uc0aQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The video’s description was written entirely in binary, but a simple translation tool uncovers the meaning behind it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>DET HÄR ÄR ER SISTA CHANS. ÅTERGÅ GENAST.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s Swedish, in case you don’t recognize the characters. The game’s developer, Arrowhead, is, of course, located in Sweden. Here’s the English translation of the message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE. RETURN IMMEDIATELY.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Helldivers 2 fans are now pondering the implications of this message. Will residents of Super Earth launch an attack on Cyberstan, or will the Cyborg Legion launch the first initiative and attack en masse with renewed, unseen strength?</p>







<p>What do you think will happen with the Cyborg Legion in Helldivers 2? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/gore-verbinskis-bioshock-movie-would-have-somehow-included-both-of-the-games-endings</link>
            <guid>1429792</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski has said that his scrapped <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/bioshock-the-movie">BioShock film adaptation</a> would have somehow included both of the original game's endings to mess with the audience's heads. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Verbinski was attached to make a movie version of the beloved game back in 2008 alongside Universal Studios, with a script in place from Gladiator and Skyfall scribe John Logan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, the project never materialized due to lengthy wrangling over its planned $200 million budget — deemed risky due to it also aiming for an adults-only R rating. Verbinski has previously said the movie came within eight weeks of shooting, before plans faltered. Work continued to try and get the film financed for several more years, though BioShock creator Ken Levine confirmed the project had been fully cancelled by 2013.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I loved this project when we were getting close to making it at Universal," Verbinski has said now, discussing the project in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1qwyvlg/hi_rmovies_im_gore_verbinski_director_of_good/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> Q&amp;A. "I was going to dive deeply into the Oedipal aspect and definitely keep it hard R with the Little Sisters, and the 'choices' the protagonist makes... and the consequences. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I had worked out a way with writer John Logan to have both endings and I was looking forward to bringing that to the big screen and really f***ing with people's heads," he continued. "[We] had some great designs for the Big Daddies and the entire underwater demented art-deco aesthetic. Every year I hear something about the project, but I'm not sure any studio is quite willing to go where I was headed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> has two endings, based on the player's choices to either rescue or sacrifice the game's Little Sisters — and the two very different outcomes you get based on your level of mercy. The game's 'happy' ending — seen if you rescue every Little Sister — rewards the hero with a long life and the surviving sisters present on his eventual deathbed. However, if you harvest any Little Sister, your character is shown instead having influenced Rapture's citizens to believe that power is all that matters. An ominous final cutscene then shows what looks to be a nuclear submarine being taken over in an attack.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Concept Art Offers a Glimpse at the BioShock Movie That Could’ve Been</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The two endings are pretty different, then — a long and happy life or potential nuclear apocalypse — and it's unclear exactly how Verbinski's movie would have shown both. Could one have been a dream sequence, showing what might have been the alternative outcome? Or would the movie have presented audiences with two possible futures, and left viewers unclear as to which actually played out?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The later BioShock Infinite played on the multiverse theory ("there's always a lighthouse"!) but it's worth pointing out that this was still years away at the point of Verbinski being involved. Still, it's fun to ponder how an adaptation might treat the game's two endings now. Especially as plans to adapt BioShock have since resumed — with Netflix now involved in a potential adaptation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Netflix announced plans for a fresh adaptation back in 2022, though recent years have seen the project stall again, as cuts changed the scope of the movie, necessitating changes to its script. In September 2025, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-movie-is-definitely-based-on-the-first-game-as-script-work-continues-following-netflix-budget-cut">producer Roy Lee confirmed the project is still in active development</a>, with director Francis Lawrence on board to direct after finishing his work on the forthcoming The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a tricky adaptation, so there's lots of things to figure out and to get right," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-director-says-were-in-a-pretty-good-place-with-netflixs-tricky-movie-adaption">Lawrence told IGN previously</a>. "There's regime changes at Netflix, and so things stall out and get re-energized and stall out and get re-energized, and I think we're in a pretty good place, honestly."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in the world of video games, 2K confirmed last summer that it had overhauled the similarly long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bioshock-next">BioShock 4</a>, which has been in development for the last decade. Amid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-studio-cloud-chamber-undergoes-layoffs-appoints-rod-fergusson-new-bioshock-head">layoffs and a further delay to the project's release</a>, former Gears of War head and Diablo franchise lead Rod Fergusson will now oversee the project. Fergusson will also head up the game's development studio Cloud Chamber, as it attempts to finally wrestle the project to release.

            <p>Today, in news no one could've predicted: Toyota has been quietly working on a game engine of its own, but the end goal isn't what you'd expect.</p>
<p>The shocker comes from <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/toyota-announces-open-source-console-grade-proprietary-game-engine/">Automaton</a> (with Japanese site <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2026/02/09/162541.html">Game*Spark</a> as the original source), who explains Toyota Connected North America, a subsidiary of the company known for its cars, recently revealed the <a href="https://fluorite.game/">Fluorite</a> engine. It "works closely with Flutter," which is the UI framework used by Google, and uses the Dart language to handle game logic as well as interface. "Its purpose is to yield high performance even on lower-end or embedded hardware, like running 3D graphics and interactive UI via in-vehicle systems."</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the official Fluorite site shared above is highlighting features like its high-performance Entity Component System (ECS) core, which is written in C++ and goes for "optimization for weaker hardware." Secondly, there are "model-defined trigger touch zones" that should allow artists to more easily set clickable areas inside Blender, making "building 3D interfaces a lot simpler."</p>
<p>The third highlight is "console-grade 3D rendering" powered by Google's Filament, which definitely ups its potential for game development even if Toyota's ambitions are limited to displays for its cars. Last but not least, Fluorite is also leaning on Flutter's 'Hot Reload' to allow quick updating of scenes.</p><p>So, why did Toyota work on this in the first place? Well, the original Game*Spark piece, translated by Automaton, explains Toyota Connected North America originally wanted to work with established game engines, but all of them were tied to high licensing fees or a resource-intensive nature. Thus, Fluorite was born.</p>
<p>The best part is that Fluorite is being marketed as a fully featured open-source engine, so even if Toyota won't be working on games, there might be potential there for independent developers.</p>

<p>Available now via <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TIME-Pokemon-Years-Ho-Oh-Lugia/dp/1547870605/ref=pd_bxgy_thbs_d_sccl_1/131-4666938-1825410?pd_rd_w=7fHUL&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.dcf559c6-d374-405e-a13e-133e852d81e1&amp;pf_rd_p=dcf559c6-d374-405e-a13e-133e852d81e1&amp;pf_rd_r=AP8AMRKNDRKRY917QMKJ&amp;pd_rd_wg=q9mNt&amp;pd_rd_r=f513e521-892a-42bd-b165-d6d792eeb218&amp;pd_rd_i=1547870605&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=nlife-20" rel="sponsored noopener">Amazon (US)</a>, the 96-page mag is available in three unique flavours, offering up covers featuring Lugia and Ho-Oh, Mega Charizard, and Rayquaza. We have to admit, it's quite interesting that none of them showcase any Pokémon from Red and Blue, but then we have to remind ourselves that it's a celebration of the entire media franchise, not just the original games.</p>
<p>Each magazine costs <strong>$14.99</strong>, and you can buy all three for a total of <strong>$44.97</strong> (which yes, is literally just $14.99 multiplied by 3... no discounts for bulk buying here, folks).</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fvouqzx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>As for what you can expect to find inside, it sounds like it's more or less a celebration of the franchise's impact after 30 years, with a few more bits and bobs thrown in for good measure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This special edition of TIME explores the power of the Pokémon franchise, discussing the history and influences behind the iconic video games. It documents the surge around Pokémon GO and highlights tips and tricks for mastering the game. Plus, learn about Pokémon trading cards and how to explore that lucrative market (and not get scammed)."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A brand-new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/jigglypuff-is-joined-by-up-and-comer-lady-gaga-in-pokemons-super-bowl-ad">Super Bowl ad</a> was also shown during the recent game, featuring the like of Lady Gaga, Jisoo, and Trevor Noah as they reveal their favourite creatures from the iconic franchise. We're expecting to see a lot more in the coming weeks and months as The Pokémon Company looks to capitalise on the milestone anniversary.</p>

            <p>Happy this week all! Peeling back the curtains, I discern traces of blue advancing through sallow clouds, a hint of stray sunshine gracing the soggy leaves in the drive. All signs point to the onset of spring, but I will not be fooled. This is a classic Maw stratagem to waylay vitamin D deficient news editors. The creature is trying to tempt me into the open so that it can shower me in digestive juices (what you in the normal world are pleased to call “rain”). </p>
<p>No, best pull the curtains closed, count the fuel drums under the table, and check that the shotgun is loaded. We will not be lured outside. We will play new PC games instead. Here they are.</p>
<h2>Monday 9th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3113030/The_Oily_Depths/">The Oily Depths</a>, you are a submarine driller trying to make quota. What do the levers and buttons scattered around your cockpit do? That’s for Them to know and you to find out to your cost.</li>
<li>If you thought being a submarine driller was rough, you may not appreciate the “stress inducing carpal tunnel gameplay” of rapidfire restaurateur sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3734290/Goblin_Sushi/">Goblin Sushi</a>.</li>
<li>I ain’t a rat, see! Jimmy the Snitch, he’s the rat. I saw him, Mickey the Judas and Turncoat Tony in the kitchen with the candlestick. Hang on, boss, I’ve forgotten what <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3725630/WISE_GUYS/">game</a> I’m playing.</li>
<li>More chokepoints await your armies in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3093020/Circle_Empires_2/">Circle Empires 2</a>, the RTS equivalent of bacteria colonies fighting over a platter of Petri dishes.</li></ul>
<h2>Tuesday 10th February</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255890/Relooted/">Relooted</a> is a side-scrolling heist game in which you pinch colonial artefacts back from private collectors and exhibits. It doesn’t belong in a museum, Indiana!</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/">Mewgenics</a> is a misanthropic turn-based tactics game featuring an army of mutant lab cats, created by the digital vivisectionists behind The Binding of Isaac.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1790930/Crisol_Theater_of_Idols/">Crisol: Theater of Idols</a> is an ornate and ponderous first-person survival shooter in which you try to navigate an island’s worth of claw-some carnival marionettes.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2506100/Shadows_of_the_Afterland/">Shadows of the Afterland</a> is a supernatural point-and-click detective game starring a lost soul with two warring identities who can also possess the living. Imagine if Holmes and Watson were one person with a million faces.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 11th February</h2>
<ul><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3937550/Yakuza_Kiwami_3__Dark_Ties/">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> is one part RPG beat ‘em up remake, another part brand new game. Special features include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-director-says-actor-accused-of-sexual-assault-was-cast-for-his-slimy-feel">a voice actor accused of sexual assault</a>.</li>
<li>Grasshopper Manufacture have yet to manufacture a single goddamn grasshopper but they <em>have</em> made a new third-person story-driven time cop actioner called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3050900/ROMEO_IS_A_DEAD_MAN/">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a> (pictured).</li>
<li>If the last two are too outwardly brutal for you, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966320/Starsand_Island/">Starsand Island</a> is an early access anime Stardew Valley. Come, bask in the exquisite penury of equatorial agriculture.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 12th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>I’m including ecology sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2452130/ANLIFE_MotionLearning_Life_Evolution/">ANLIFE: Motion-Learning Life Evolution</a> partly because I wonder if this could be the Good Kind of machine learning, i.e. a game built around such ideas, rather than deploying them for efficiencies, and also, because this is the game Hayao Miyazaki called “an insult to life itself”.</li>
<li>The folk behind Half-Life fan remake Black Mesa are back with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843840/Rogue_Point/">Rogue Point</a>, a four-player, merc-on-merc, early access FPS.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2488540/Crimson_Capes/">Crimson Capes</a> is <del>a lesser-known Marvel franchise</del> <del>a vampire bowling team</del> <del>a series of redstone promontories</del> a 2D pixel art fantasy sword-o-brawler that reminds me distantly of Blasphemous.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1396870/ENCHAIN/">Enchain</a> is a low-poly movement FPS featuring a swinging skeletal crossbowperson.</li></ul>
<h2>Friday 13th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tarsier are back with another helping of mutant ogres and unspeakable urchins in horror platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2129530/REANIMAL/">Reanimal</a>. This one’s got some royally mucky sheep.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2069250/High_On_Life_2/">High On Life 2</a> is more of the first game’s fast and flimsy Rick &amp; Morty-esque sci-fi shoot-comedy, with all-new kickflips to accompany the talking guns. </li>
</ul>
<p>What are we in the Treehouse doing this week, aside from listing new games and hiding from the ravenous sky? I missed the morning meeting, so I’ll have to speculate a bit based on conversations from Friday.</p>
<p>Mark is reviewing a videogame. Ollie has started a lingerie business (and not for the first time). James is reviewing a videogame. Julian was last spotted walking beside the M25 in the vicinity of Leatherhead – if seen do not approach, call 999. I am reviewing a videogame. Jeremy has discovered several new butterflies and is now being held hostage by a rival entomologist clan. Callum is counting to one trillion. Dion is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77QqWVz4iEE">the fountain of affection, the instrument of joy</a>, to keep the good time rolling he's the boy, he's the boy. How about you?</p>
