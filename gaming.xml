                <p>This week, Sifu developer Sloclap is releasing Rematch, a new futuristic soccer title that takes a fresh approach to the game known as football outside of the United States. However, fans who want to field challengers from all platforms will have to wait, because Sloclap has announced that cross-play won't be ready in time for Rematch's launch.</p><p>Sloclap shared the news on social media, but also assured players that adding cross-play in a future update remains a priority for the team. The dev didn't put a timetable on when cross-play features will be ready.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/PlayRematch/status/1934529603244028143" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Crossplay between Steam, PlayStation &amp; Xbox won't be available at launch, but it's one of our top priorities for upcoming updates! ⚽🎮<br>We'll share an ETA as soon as possible, stay tuned! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Rematch?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Rematch</a></p>  — Rematch (@PlayRematch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayRematch/status/1934529603244028143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Rematch embraces a semi-arcade style by cutting soccer teams down to five teammates on each side.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/gex-trilogy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Gex Trilogy Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156803/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p><em>Note. Gex Trilogy isn't playable on Switch 2 via backwards compatibility at the time of writing, although a patch has been submitted to Nintendo for review, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/clock-tower-rewind-to-receive-switch-2-exclusive-features-says-limited-run">according to Limited Run</a>. We'll update this note when we hear more.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Dimitris Giannakis’s Carbon Engine is back on behalf of Limited Run Games, and, despite some previously reported bugs, it fairly accurately brings vintage games to new hardware.</p>
<p>Speaking of bugs, Gex the gecko thrives on them. That and gnarly '90s flair. Combining all three titles released on Sony’s original PlayStation, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/gex_trilogy">Gex Trilogy</a> is a slice of a very colourful era, when <strong>Jackass</strong> was king, <strong>Beavis and Butthead</strong> were generational voices, britpop ruled the airwaves, and it seemed like people would do anything to get on TV. And, as it happens, TV is the theme when it comes to Gex, because, you know, like, <em>everyone</em> was watching TV in the '90s, man.</p>
<figure><a title="Gex Trilogy Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156805/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While the initial <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/3do/gex">Gex</a> was released for the 3DO in 1995, a pack-in system seller that often went hand-in-hand with the console’s marketing, it was on the PlayStation that Crystal Dynamics’ series found a groove. And, since this trilogy reworks the games into a widescreen format, the PlayStation version is the more practical choice.</p>
<p>Gex is a gecko chilling in his Maui mansion when, while looking for a good show on the tube, his telescopic tongue whips a roaming fly down his gullet. This fly is actually a miniature robotic spy sent by Rez, king of the Media Dimension, that sucks Gex into his TV set. Gex then needs to work his way through a hub world, entering themed zones and stages, to recover remote controls that allow him to enter subsequent stages and ultimately return home. It’s wacky, and that’s largely the idea.</p>
<p>A 2D side-scrolling platformer, the first <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/gex">Gex</a> is mostly ok. Its primary novelty is that you can scale walls as a gecko can, and this allows you to navigate stages in an alternative manner, often leading to bonus warps and those elusive TV remotes.</p>
<figure><a title="Gex Trilogy Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156801/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gex can swat enemies with his tail and use his tongue to lap up various power-ups, affording him different temporary properties or health increases. It’s neither aged considerably well nor poorly, but the patience of the gamer base may have moved on.</p>
<p>The graphics have a real pre-rendered multimedia 3DO smack, that, on the plus side, retroactively suit the game and its '90s-ness well, but are also kind of ugly in places. It gets more interesting in locales like Sumo City, which frankly looks and sounds totally like China but with Sumo enemies; and elsewhere you get to do stuff that breaks the mould like riding rockets and jungle swings.</p>
<p>The controls are a tad stiff and that makes certain clinches, especially boss battles, frustrating at times. There are points where you’re forced to make jumps into the unknown that could drown you (odd for a gecko), land you on a bed of spikes or down a bottomless pit. But the main test of patience is being forced to find those remotes.</p>
<figure><a title="Gex Trilogy Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156806/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Stages are non-linear and searching is required. Get killed and it’s back to the start or a checkpoint, meaning there’s some backtracking to be done, and you spend a lot of time searching and revisiting stages. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Mario World</a>, and much of its ilk, also had special coin collecting, but it was optional. Here, you won’t be able to access new stages until you’ve recovered enough remotes to do so, keeping you from progression. It can be frustrating, but if you're steeled for the fairly lengthy journey, there’s some enjoyment to be had.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/gex_enter_the_gecko">Gex 2: Enter the Gecko</a> (1998) goes full 3D, with the camera now forgivingly assigned to the second thumb stick as opposed to just the shoulder buttons. Again, Gex is whipped into the Media Dimension to defeat Rez, but here it’s all gloriously polygonal. And it holds up fairly well, considering, with stages that offer more engagement than its predecessor. Again, you need to find remotes to progress and expand the hub world, and now there are even more objects to collect, including gold remotes that can net you a special ending.</p>
<p>Gex 2 is a lot more interactive and the stage design is pretty clever in places, allowing you to spring from your tail to reach higher points. The vertical crawling is here, but it isn’t used as a main structural device as it was in the original, with only certain walls being climbable.</p>
<figure><a title="Gex Trilogy Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156799/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the whole, it’s a solid evolution for the series, and although the early PS1 3D can be visually confusing at times and difficult to control, it can be fun if you apply yourself to its fetch tasks and inherently wacky nature. For those who aren’t so into searching down numerous items, however, it can feel a bit of a slog by the halfway point.</p>
<p>The third and final game, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/gex_3_deep_cover_gecko">Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko</a> (1999), capped the series after plans for a PlayStation 2 sequel were abandoned. It’s a big technological step up from the previous entry despite only appearing a year later, and incorporates many of Crystal Dynamic's previously unrealised ideas.</p>
<p>Gex starts here in a Wayne Manor-like hub world, with a tortoise butler. Seeing his love interest Agent Xtra (Playmate of the month and <strong>Baywatch</strong>'s Marliece Andrada) kidnapped by Rez, Gex finds himself back in the wacky media land of TV, where the camera is much improved and the scale is altogether broader. Stages are more open and freeform, encompassing tons of interactive objects, swimming, and platforms that work around weight and inertia.</p>
<figure><a title="Gex Trilogy Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156800/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Your tail whipping action, too, is complemented by costume changes and power-ups that transform you into Egyptian Pharoes and mecha robots. Traversing the playfields is varied, incorporating snowboarding, giant enemies, and a fair few layout puzzles to solve. The music remains great, and the whole thing feels smoother and more accomplished. Objectively and not sentimentally, it’s the superior of the three.</p>
<p>While the control and visual improvements are welcome, as are all the little bonuses like art galleries, music players, rewind and save functions, the main appeal with Gex Trilogy is just how '90s it is. In some ways, this makes it more enjoyable to return to than it would be if it wasn’t so undeniably a product of its time. Dana Gould, who appears in interviews in the bonus features, is an American comedian who voiced the intrepid Gecko. He did a great job of stuffing the game full of one-liners that now recall the exuberant decade and its all-pervasive, kid-appealing, gross-out edginess.</p>
<figure><a title="Gex Trilogy Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156802/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>One major downside is that this trilogy doesn’t offer alternate soundtracks, since Gould was actually replaced by different comics in the PAL market, including Leslie Phillips and <strong>Red Dwarf</strong>’s Danny John-Jules for the third game. It would have been nice to have had the regional options in this respect. And, since the original games had a single file that contained each region's audio files — meaning it's easily flipped between — we're not sure why the accuracy of the Carbon Engine didn't rise to the occasion.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Gex Trilogy is a happy throwback. The first game is a little clunky and occasionally laborious, but its sequels do better in their 3D expansion of its themes and idea. The main point of appeal is its connection to the period in which they were made. It’s full of comic quirks, zinging dialogue, and visual gags that scream MTV Generation. Across all three entries, the media hook and its tropes — from horror to Christmas to 1930s prohibition gangsters — work well to keep things fresh, fun and engaging.</p>
<p>That said, while there's a simplicity to the games themselves, the yesteryear technology and the sensibilities of many gamers may have moved on, making their baked-in fetch quests trying at times. Gex Trilogy’s value is bumped up by its invention and still very playable design aspects, but whether or not you can pit yourself through them really comes down to how much your nostalgic mileage varies, dude.</p></section>

<figure><a title="Pik-Sen Lim death" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/03392d0c0bc67/pik-sen-lim-death.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure><p>Pik-Sen Lim, the Penang-born British actress who most of us gamers will know immediately as the legendary narrator of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a> series, has passed away at the age of 80.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.malaymail.com/news/showbiz/2025/06/13/malaysian-born-actress-pik-sen-lim-known-for-roles-in-mind-your-language-doctor-who-and-johnny-english-reborn-dies-at-80/180215#google_vignette">the Malay Mail</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/dark-souls/dark-souls-narrator-and-prolific-actor-pik-sen-lim-has-died/">PC Gamer</a>), the actress, who moved to the UK to pursue a hugely successful stage and screen acting career in 1961, passed away on Monday 9th June. Lim was a big star during the '70s and '80s on both British and Malaysian TV, with her credits including <strong>Dr Who</strong>, <strong>Coronation Street</strong>, <strong>The Bill</strong>, and her most prominent role in the sitcom <strong>Mind Your Language</strong>, which aired in the UK during the late 1970s.</p><p><figure data-videoid="A1xI46KxTIU" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A1xI46KxTIU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1xI46KxTIU"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>822k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1xI46KxTIU">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Of course, without Lim, the Souls games just wouldn't feel the same, would they? The opening narration to Dark Souls, in particular, is just one of those video game moments that sticks in your brain forever after. It's delivered with such artistry that it immediately signals a game you're about to get lost in big time. And oh boy, did we.</p>
<p>As a first sample of FromSoftware's world, and the vibe the developer wished to convey, it's hard to imagine anyone could have rocked it as hard as Pik-Sen Lim did. In fact, let's check it out more more time in her honour...</p>

<p>What a performance. Rest in peace.</p>

			<p>Nintendo has announced a new Direct presentation for this week, a Donkey Kong Bananza Direct that'll premiere this&nbsp;<strong>Wednesday, June 18, at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BT</strong>. It'll be a 15-minute-long presentation and will likely feature a bunch of new gameplay clips we've not seen before, ahead of the game's<a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-launches-this-july-on-nintendo-switch-2/"> July 17, 2025</a>, release date.</p>
<p>The news first came through the Nintendo Today app, and is the latest sign that Nintendo will be using the app to deliver its big announcements before turning to <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1934596827900178721">its social media accounts</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza Direct 6.18.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVUidGTR8xg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"<em><span>Tune in at 6 a.m. PT on June 18 for a livestreamed</span> Donkey Kong Bananza <span>Direct presentation, featuring roughly 15 minutes of information about the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game</span></em><span>," Nintendo said in its announcement.</span></p>
<p>It'll be good to see more of Donkey Kong Bananza on Wednesday, since there's still plenty about this game we don't yet know. <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech's Nathan Birch was able to preview the game</a> more than two months ago now, and at the time, while he didn't love everything about it, the game's core mechanic of being able to destroy the environment and how malleable the world is, makes for strong potential.</p>
<p>"<em>I spent most of my time with Donkey Kong Bananza thinking about the possibilities presented by its mechanics. The tools are certainly there for puzzles that would require you to, say, mould the terrain in specific ways using your fists, explosives, and other tools to reach a goal. There’s a lot of potential here, and it seems likely the demo I played only showed a portion of DK’s full bunch of abilities.</em>"</p>
<p>Hopefully, on Wednesday, we'll see a little more of what's to come in Donkey Kong Bananza.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/two-killer-soulslikes-we-saw-at-summer-game-fest-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Very few Soulslikes land for me, outside of ones developed by FromSoftware themselves. Still, there's always potential for a hit, as was the case with last year's <em>Black Myth: Wukong. </em>For 2025 and beyond, I'm actually optimistic about the future of the genre, especially after seeing a few potential bangers at&nbsp;Summer Game Fest 2025.</p>

<p>I'm talking about&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers.&nbsp;</em>In the case of&nbsp;the latter, I had a chance to play through the opening hour, though it didn't feel nearly enough to fully grasp what it had to offer.&nbsp;For&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>, we were given a presentation that left me optimistic about this exciting sequel.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Code Vein II</em> - Bigger, and With a Motorcycle!</h2>

<p>Darn, this is one I really wanted to get my hands on. Unfortunately, I only have words and hands-<em>off </em>gameplay to go off of here, but let me tell you why I'm so excited for&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The first&nbsp;<em>Code Vein</em>&nbsp;was probably the first Soulslike -- again, outside of FromSoftware's own games -- to click with me. The slick anime aesthetic and faster pace of combat resonated with me, and when I was speculating what game this might be based on my SGF appointment's vague description, I hoped it was&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II.</em></p>

<p>And here we are, a sequel! Well, kind of. It's a sequel in name, but Bandai Namco also describes it as a reimagining. Expect some familiar elements, but&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II&nbsp;</em>is very much its own game. The lore behind this sequel is actually quite exciting, too.</p>



<p>Essentially, we'll be traveling between past and present timelines with the help of our player's companion, Lou MagMell. Hopping between timelines, 100 years to the past and then back to the present, is a daunting narrative challenge but one I am excited to see the developer tackle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Players can befriend various legendary Revenants -- essentially, the vampire-like beings from&nbsp;<em>Code Vein --&nbsp;</em>in both past and present. You are, of course, the hero of your own story. <em>Code Vein</em> was known&nbsp;for its robust character creator, so you'll be happy to know it's expanded to be better than ever.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We only got a taste of actual combat in&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>. Footage is fast-paced and more akin to a traditional hack-and-slash action game than a Souls-like, at least at first glance. I doubt it will deviate much from its Soulsy roots, but there's potential for&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>&nbsp;to grow more into its own thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One returning mechanic are blood codes, which essentially dictate the class of the player and the weight of its stats. As this is a sequel, no doubt we'll see new Blood Codes in this one. We have some new mechanics called Jails and Formae, both of which essentially boil down to providing more abilities and techniques to utilize during combat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's also a motorcycle. This seems to be a focal point in&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>, because the Bandai Namco booth at SGF had a prop motorcycle that was&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;cool. This is used to traverse the world, which will be much bigger this time around. I'm not going to say it's on&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s scale, but having to use a mount in a Soulslike game has me thinking big.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> - Wuxia Souls</h2>

<p>I also had an hour to play&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, but darn it all, I wish I had more. One, because it's a mechanically rich Soulslike game, but also because it was quite enjoyable!&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>&nbsp;is, no doubt, one of the least clunky games I've played in the genre, which is a pitfall far too many fall into.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This demo takes place right at the start of&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers.&nbsp;</em>There's some emphasis on story here, and essentially, you're afflicted with an ailment called Feathering. It looks exactly as it sounds, but Wuchang, the eponymous protagonist of this game, uses it to her advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wuchang is extremely capable with all form of weapons, and there were various styles I could try out in this demo. I landed on using the base longsword, as it felt like it catered to my playstyle of slightly heavier, longer weapons wielded with two hands. There are faster and slower styles players can use, of course.</p>

<p>The core mechanic to&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>&nbsp;revolves around Skyborn Might. As I understand it, perfectly dodging attacks and other actions grant you more power, so combat puts an emphasis on player skill. If you like to cheese your bosses, it's probably possible, but I feel like it's not quite that simple in this one.</p>



<p>Our character, Wuchang, has plenty of abilities at her disposal. Charging up your heavy attack and hitting the back of certain enemies stuns them and allows you to pull off a powerful attack. We can also cast spells, so if an enemy is pressuring you, take a step back, cast a spell, and do some decent damage on them.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other mechanics that are at play here, but I was still in the midst of getting these explained to me by the time my demo ended. Still, I made it to the first boss of the demo and defeating them in a thrilling battle. Combat left me very satisfied, so I'm eager to see how far&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>&nbsp;can go.&nbsp;</p>

As such, the amount of time spent exploring this version of Hyrule will vary from person to person based on how much of the game’s optional content they wish to see.

Doing so can <strong>stretch the game’s length to a staggering 150-200 hours</strong>. Yeah, it’s a lot. But there’s more.</p><p>If you want to complete literally everything in <strong><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, you can reach beyond 300 hours of total playtime</strong>. This is obviously a task best reserved for the franchise’s most dedicated fans, as it requires an immense amount of work. But for those looking to truly absorb every morsel of <em>Zelda </em>goodness, there are months of fun to be had here.</p><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> is available now for Nintendo Switch. A Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade for the game is also available at an additional cost, providing upgraded visuals and performance.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Following the reveal of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-4/">The Witcher 4</a> tech demo earlier this month, CD Projekt Red has shared why it has decided to focus on developing the game for consoles first, rather than for PC.</p><p>In case you missed it, the State of Unreal showcase offered us the first in-engine look at The Witcher 4 by highlighting the new, explorable region of Kovir, a brand-new look at the game's protagonist, Ciri, while also showing off the many features of Unreal Engine 5, which the game will utilize rather than the studio's proprietary engine.</p><p>It looked beautiful, but what's more impressive is the fact that the tech demo was captured entirely on the base PlayStation 5 at 60fps, with ray tracing.</p><p>Now, in a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OplYN2MMI4Q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-cd-projekt-is-taking-a-console-first-development-approach-but-with-good-reason" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), CDPR’s VP of technology, Charles Tremblay, has explained that the studio is aiming for a "console-first" development with The Witcher 4 after learning from its mistakes with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OplYN2MMI4Q" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OplYN2MMI4Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"We always do PC and we push and then we try to scale down," Tremblay said. "But then we had so many problems in the past that we tried to say, 'This time around we really want to be more console-first development.'"</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077's launch in 2020 was a disaster, particularly for PlayStation and Xbox. While the PS5 and Xbox Series X versions did have their issues, it was the PS4 and Xbox One versions that suffered most. Performance was so bad on the last-gen consoles that, at one point, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-has-been-removed-from-playstation-store-refunds-will-be-issued/1100-6485659/" data-ref-id="1100-6485659">the game was taken down from the PS Store</a> altogether, and refunds were issued.</p><p>Almost five years and a bunch of updates later, Cyberpunk 2077 is now one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-rpgs/2900-5272/" data-ref-id="2900-5272">best RPGs</a> you can play right now, but CDPR has said it doesn't want to make the same mistakes again with The Witcher 4.</p><p>Jakub Knapik, VP and Global Art Director at CDPR, explained that by focusing on the game's development with consoles, it will make "scaling up" to PC easier, as opposed to scaling down for PlayStation and Xbox.</p><p>"We wanted to solve certain foundations," Knapik said. "It’s pretty logical when you think about it, because it’s easier to scale up than down. We knew that once we set up certain foundations both visually and technically, there’s room to scale up. Now, what that means is another question. We’re CDPR: We always like to push PCs to the limit. It’s just a creative process how to really use it."</p><p>However, Tremblay later admitted that releasing The Witcher 4 on Xbox Series S at 60fps "will definitely be extremely challenging" and that the studio is now actively trying to figure it out.</p><p>Despite the "console-first" approach, the VP of technology confirmed that PC players who invest in their hardware won't miss out.</p><p>"In the past, something that’s super important for the group is that if people pay good money for their hardware, then we want them to have what the game can provide for that, not like a simplified experience," he said.</p><p>"So this is something we will definitely explore. The company started as a PC company, and we’ll definitely want to have the best experience for the PC gamer for sure. But it’s too early to say what this will mean for The Witcher 4."</p><p>The Witcher 4 doesn't have a release date just yet, but it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-release-date-is-not-soon-as-dev-discusses-why-it-wont-use-genai/1100-6530369/" data-ref-id="1100-6530369">not expected to launch until 2027</a> at the earliest. The studio is also actively working on multiple other projects, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2</a> and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">Witcher remake</a>.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> direct for later this week.</p>
<p>It'll be taking place on <strong>Wednesday, 18th June at  6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm UK time</strong>. According to the official Nintendo App where it was announced, the Donkey Kong direct will last only 15 minutes.</p>
<p>We've seen little bits of Donkey Kong Bananza here and there over the past few months. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-getting-a-new-3d-donkey-kong-platformer">Back in April the game was officially revealed</a>, alongside some gameplay which shows everyone's favourite gorilla punching through the ground and barrelling through the open world.</p>

<p>He's got a new look too, with S<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-creator-shigeru-miyamoto-explains-donkey-kongs-recent-makeover">higeru Miyamoto stating that when going back to the drawing board with Donkey Kong the team developers wanted something "more expressive"</a>. Fans eager for the game also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananzas-secret-in-game-language-has-already-been-decoded-months-before-launch">cracked the banana-centric language</a> seen in small clips of the game, way ahead of its release.</p>
<p>It goes without saying, but don't expect any other Nintendo games to show up as part of this direct. It's a pure Kong affair. All monkey, all monkey business. But if you're looking for more info on a brand-new game created for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>, it sounds like an event worth tuning in for.</p></div>

		<p>The next Nintendo Direct is set to take place this week, Nintendo has announced, with a presentation dedicated to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> exclusive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> scheduled for Wednesday 18th June at 2PM UK time.</p>
<p>“Tune in on Wednesday, June 18, for a livestreamed Donkey Kong Bananza Direct presentation,” the simple announcement reads in the Nintendo Today app. Adding the event to the in-app calendar also reveals that it will take place at 2PM.</p>


<p>And that’s the full extent of the announcement.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/donkey-kong-bananza-revealed-for-nintendo-switch-2-coming-in-july/">Announced back in April for the Switch 2 game and gameplay reveal</a>, Donkey Kong Banaza is the first fully 3D platformer in the DK series since the N64’s Donkey Kong 64, and so the gameplay is understandably rather different to Rare’s 90s classic.&nbsp;There’s a big emphasis on DK’s massively strong, letting him just smash through enemies, smash through walls, and even smash down into the ground…. then use chunks of the ground to smash more stuff around him!</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza Hands On –&nbsp;3D Platforming with a punch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LJIOuYCS414?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We got to go hands on with the game at the Nintendo Switch 2 event in Paris a couple days later, find a game that’s as smash-happy as you would have expected. From my <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-preview-a-3d-platformer-with-a-lot-of-punch/">Donkey Kong Bananza hands on preview</a>, I said, “If your kids are fans of Hulk smashing his way through earlier Avengers movies, then they’ll probably go bananas for Donkey Kong Bananza. As Nintendo and their partners explore platformers in all their forms, there’s some neat ideas built around the frenzy of punching and adding deformable world to the genre. I look forward to seeing how this can be explored in different ways, to hopefully avoid DK becoming a one punch ape.”</p>

<p>This will be the first big game for the Nintendo Switch 2 following the console’s release at the start of this month. The Switch 2’s debut came alongside a must-have game in the form of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario Kart World</a>, but the lineup has been rather thin outside of this. DK will lead the way for what will hopefully be a strong second half to the year, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-confirmed-for-october/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/metroid-prime-4-beyond-switch-2-preview-worth-the-wait/">Metroid Prime 4</a> and more on the way.</p>

<p>We didn't start the fire</p>

<p>Those looking for something to relax and unwind to after a tough day of Knockout Tour might want to check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/into_the_emberlands">Into The Emberlands</a>, a "cosy roguelike" from developer Tiny Roar (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/xel">XEL</a>) and publisher Daedalic Entertainment that will be arriving on the Switch eShop on <strong>2nd July</strong>.</p>
<p>This one launched on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2856370/Into_the_Emberlands/">Steam</a> earlier this year and, to put it simply, it looks <em>super</em> cute. Into the Emberlands will see you play as a Lightbearer tasked with reuniting the titular world after it became swamped in a malicious miasma. To do so, you'll have to journey out into the fog with your Ember Lantern, collecting resources and rehoming the adorable little Knacks (the species you'll see in the above trailer) you'll encounter along the way.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>822k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>You only have a limited number of steps per day — room for a little more <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">Blue Prince</a>, anyone? — and the gameplay loop will restart if you run out, with your previous Lightbearer setting up camp to be found on a future run.</p>
<p>It's combat-free, all about helping others, and colourful enough that we can imagine it being an all-round wholesome experience — and we could all do with a little of that every now and then.</p>
<p>You'll find a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots below from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Into-The-Emberlands-2848916.html">eShop listing</a>:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/future-clair-obscur-expedition-33-updates-new-content<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sandfall Interactive, the studio behind the hugely successful turn-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, has confirmed it's actively considering "new content" for future updates, as well as various other improvements.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/expedition33.bsky.social/post/3lrpzry3pnk2f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Bluesky, Sandfall says it's "currently exploring a wide range of future improvements" for&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>updates, including "accessibility features", "new content", and "all sorts of bits and bobs".</p>

<p>One of the major improvements Sandfall says it's thinking about involves expanding localization options for the game, allowing folks to play it in more languages. However, the studio <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/expedition33.bsky.social/post/3lrpzry3ujs2f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">cautions</a> that it doesn't have "specific timelines or confirmed languages" yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-updates-new-content-lune.jpg?itok=8xZg97HD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-updates-new-content-lune.jpg?itok=Zd-eqjMq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>could be getting new content in future updates.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, it's a turn-based RPG that serves as the debut title from French studio Sandfall Interactive (and once you've played the game, you'll understand why its developer needed to be French).</p>

<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>takes place in a world ravaged by a monstrous figure known as the Paintress, who paints a new number each year. Everyone of that age dies at the conclusion of the year, so humanity sends out "expeditions" to try and defeat the Paintress before the next number is painted.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise, the game appears to take several cues from classic turn-based RPGs in franchises like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest</em>, although it has a much darker and more bleak tone than the latter.</p>

<p>It's also got a parry system, being a modern game, and so you'll have to factor in parrying or dodging enemies' attacks as well as strategizing during turn-based combat.</p>




<p>Since launch,&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has proven immensely popular. It <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-500k" rel="nofollow">sold 500,000 copies</a> within just 24 hours, going on to reach <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">two million in under two weeks</a>. At last count, it had hit the satisfying total of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3-3m-33-days" rel="nofollow">3.3 million sales in 33 days</a>.</p>

Whilst <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-where-to-buy-in-stock">MTG: Final Fantasy</a> has finally dropped, there's still plenty of buying options for sealed product from big box retailers and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-cards-to-buy-tcgplayer-mayhem-sale">TCG Player</a>. I've also found some cracking bargains on <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRRkq?object_uuid=dd8f7c62-50dd-458a-9254-ce965ea069b7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SSDs</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObbV2?object_uuid=dd8f7c62-50dd-458a-9254-ce965ea069b7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">portable storage</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OO7y?object_uuid=dd8f7c62-50dd-458a-9254-ce965ea069b7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DDR5 RAM</a>, games and more. Let's get into it:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Restock Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Checking these prices against TCG Player secondary market values, a lot of these products aren't far off the mark. Make no mistake, they're still way off MSRP, but finding Pokémon products on shelves that haven't been marked up past the point of anyone caring is a positive. Still refusing to pay over MSRP for new sets? Well played, I'm proud of you. Here's some single card highlights for you to shuffle through instead. Spoiler, there's plenty of deals to be had.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Destined Rivals Singles Are On The Rise (Again)</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard to stick a pin on Destined Rivals single card values right now, and the dips in value seem to match the little bits of stock distributors release to stores. Looking at the tracking charts for each of these cards, we can see mostly plummets from day one, then either upticks or cards for sale that exceed the original value at launch. It's crazy, but we now know how low these cards can go. Sure there's always attempts at market manipulation, but I wouldn't buy any cards on the rise right now.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Journey Together Singles Are Settling In Value</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having keeping an eye on the market since launch, Journey Together singles are now more affordable than ever. Many of these cards have stabilized, with the main chase card - Lillie's Clefairy ex SIR, settling at around $150. If you were planning on getting into Journey Together at some point to collect the illustration rares and SIRs, now is a great time to jump in.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Epic Primastic Evolutions Cards That Aren't Umbreon</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's so many great cards in this set that aren't Umbreon ex SIR, all of which are a damn sight more affordable right now. Because I hate anything popular (Yes, I know I'm a massive fan of the most popular IP on earth), my two favorite cards are Dragapult ex SIR and Roaring Moon ex SIR. The former is now down to a respectable $125, with the latter holding it's value well since launch, floating towards the $200 mark. These prices and below are great deals for these cards, so don't miss out.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Discounted MTG: Aetherdrift Boxes </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering discounts at a big box store like Amazon? Surely not! Aetherdrift turned the MTG meta on its head introducing vehicles and other unique mechanics. This is a great time to jump into it and rip open some packs, it's deffinately one of the most "out there"  twists on the ever popular trading card game.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where To Buy MTG: Final Fantasy</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's finally here, Magic the Gathering: Final Fantasy is out in the wild. If you got a preorder for MSRP, well played, but many TCG and Final Fantasy fans missed out.

But a recent social media post by YouTuber Ricky Berwick prompted concern that Martinet had been restricted by Nintendo in what he could perform — until Martinet himself spoke up to offer clarification.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following an appearance by Martinet earlier this month at the Phoenix Fan Fusion 2025 convention, held in Phoenix, Arizona, a social media post by Berwick — who has 6.25 million subscribers on YouTube and 14.1m subscribers on TikTok — claimed the voice acting legend "wasn't even allowed to do the voice of Mario or any of his iconic character's voices" while at the meetup. "It's a f**king shame," Berwick added.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The post caught the internet's attention, as it came just hours after it was revealed that Martinet's former Mushroom Kingdom colleague <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/princess-peach-and-toads-veteran-voice-actor-says-nintendo-told-her-shed-been-replaced-on-switch-2-launch-day-as-mario-kart-world-released-without-her-in-it">Samantha Kelly had been replaced as the voice of Princess Peach and Toad</a>, with the actress told of the change by Nintendo on the day <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/platform/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launch title <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> launched without her in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-charles-martinet-is-not-involved-in-super-mario-bros-wonder">Nintendo officially retired Martinet back in 2022</a>, though provided the actor with a notable send-off in the form of a farewell video featuring Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto and the promise that Martinet would continue to work with Nintendo as Mario Ambassador going forward. Martinet himself later stated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/charles-martinet-on-being-mario-ambassador-i-dont-know-what-that-is-yet">he wasn't really sure what that title bestowed</a>, but has maintained a busy schedule of convention appearances in the years since.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/16/gettyimages-598849994-1750074217094.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Charles Martinet. Photo by Isaiah Trickey/FilmMagic.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in response to Berwick's post, Martinet has <a href="https://x.com/CharlesMartinet/status/1932458680542474319" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">responded</a> to state that the issue in question here was that of him performing improvised dialogue as one of his former Nintendo characters (alongside Mario, Martinet also voiced Luigi, Wario, Waluigi, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi and others).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Oh Ricky, I do the voice for every fan I meet," Martinet wrote in response. "I just don't improvise non-Mario phrases or dialogue."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Martinet went on to state that this was his own decision, born out of his own desire not to have Nintendo's character say things that weren't already a part of the company's games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That's my choice to be sure," Martinet continued. "I always maintain the integrity of the character. But come and visit me at any Comic Con or fan expo and you'll hear super Mario for sure! #woohoo"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario's voice is now provided by Kevin Afghani in all Nintendo video games — or Hollywood's Chris Pratt in the Super Mario Bros. Movie, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unannounced-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-title-super-mario-world-published-then-pulled-from-nbcuniversal-press-release">which next year will get a sequel</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Isaiah Trickey/FilmMagic.</em>

		<p>Triumph and Paradox have revealed the next DLC for Age of Wonders 4. The fourth instalment in Expansion Pass 2, Archon Prophecy expansion is set to launch on 12th August for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p><iframe title="Archon Prophecy Expansion Release Date Announcement | Age of Wonders 4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UtIcPa9D_8I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Archon Prophecy will add a new culture, the Architects, allowing players to construct huge magical monuments within cities. There’s also new Forms, a new narrative path to follow, two new story realms, and more.</p>
<p>The Archon Prophecy expansion will arrive alongside a free update, dubbed the Griffon Update. This will have new features that include the Extra Faction data, the new Form trait Flaws, and&nbsp;Hero Class Updates.</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown of Archon Prophecy from Triumph:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>New Culture: </b>Build your empire with the help of the <b><i>Architects</i></b> – construct vast, magical <b><i>monuments</i></b> within your cities and dedicate them to the affinity of your choice to empower your economy and unlock powerful bonuses. Shape your domain and carve your ideology into the world.</li>
<li><b>Two New Forms</b>:<span>&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><b>Elysian<i> </i></b>– ascended, heavenly beings that bring a touch of the divine to your realm.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Ancient </b>– withered and bent beings from the depths of history – and other, more sinister places.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>New Narrative Content: </b>Forge your destiny with <b><i>Prophecy Traits </i></b>— new society traits that help you shape your empire. Early in your journey a vision will appear, challenging you to define your ruler’s purpose and ambitions. How you interpret it is up to you, but fulfilling the Prophecy will unlock powerful rewards.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Two New Story Realms: <span>&nbsp;</span></b>
<ul>
<li><b>Rings of Emnora</b> – Enter the hidden realm of Emnora, stronghold of the Archons, in a search for aid in the eternal war against Urrath.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Cliffs of Sordünn</b> – Land on the Coast of Sordünn and explore an ancient land that fell into the endless horrors of the Umbral Abyss. Reclaim the realm from Urrath’s clutches and fulfill a Prophecy that will shape the war between light and darkness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Four New Tomes:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Tome of Virtue</b>: Empower your armies with unwavering righteousness and bolster their fighting strength until the bitter end.</li>
<li><b>Tome of Prophecies</b>: Weave fate into every moment with prophetic spells and omens that shape the battlefield.</li>
<li><b>Tome of the Revenant</b>: Channel the power of the dead, and take vengeance against the living.</li>
<li><b>Tome of the Archon</b>: Summon celestial allies and ascend your units to the ranks of Archons.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>New Hero Class: </b>Answer the call of the divine with the power of the <b><i>Battlesaint</i></b>. Whether guiding the faithful as a sacred support unit or standing firm as a martyr-like tank, the Battlesaint turns virtue into strength and sacrifice into victory.</li>
<li><b>And</b> <b>So Much More</b>, including seven new wildlife units roaming the wilds, two new mounts, five new music tracks from composer Michiel van den Bos, several map updates, new interface skin and many other smaller things!</li>
</ul>
<p>Age of Wonders 4 came out in May 2023 and, while we unfortunately weren’t able to review the game at that time, it had a broadly positive reception. It saw the series return to the fantasy setting of the earlier games, after the sci-fi divergence of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/05/age-of-wonders-planetfall-review-ps4-xbox-pc/">Age of Wonders: Planetfall</a>, and brought some fun new ways to mix and match your wildly customisable empires and races.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/exoborne-is-a-tactical-open-world-extraction-shooter-in-development-at-sharkmob/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exoborne</a> has been one of those battle royales with a unique traversal hook that I’ve been curious about but never had the chance to go hands-on with until Summer Game Fest 2025’s Play Days. The concept of fighting off not just other players but the weather seemed like a concept that would keep fights feeling dynamic between sessions.</p>
<p>Sharkmob and Level Infinite let us jump into a quick three-player match after a brief bit of onboarding and watching a mission cutscene from one of their key NPC handlers. After that, we were permitted to look at and pick just one of the three Exo-rig’s they wanted to show off. My two teammates went with the more nimble Viper while I opted for the heavier Kodiak. Despite all of my ziplining around and attacking from above, I didn’t get to try out most of his kit and instead just stuck with sniping and machine-gunning as they were more than effective against the majority of AI grunts we encountered (there were other players in our match, but we extracted once we bumped into them without much of a drawn out firefight).</p>
<p>Exoborne's gunplay is fairly standard stuff, with various weapons having enough impact to feel like you're not just shooting Nerf pellets at the enemy troops while not having enough recoil to knock you out of your Exo-rig. With Exoborne being focused on being a faster-paced run-and-gun format, leaning into an arcade-style for gunplay lends itself to a more enjoyable experience over some of the more hardcore extraction shooters</p>
<p>In speaking with one of the developers from Sharkmob before my interview with Martin Holberg (co-founder at the studio and a narrative director on the game), it’s clear that they’ve done a large overhaul to the mechanics and progression for Exoborne throughout the various beta tests, from retaining your Exo-rig on death to supporting separate progression tracks to each rig. Extraction shooters are becoming a busier and busier market to compete with and it looks like Sharkmob is taking the closed beta feedback to heart in order to hit the ground running when Exoborne launches later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Exoborne - Gameplay Walkthrough" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5tqnPjrA29k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>For gamers that might be seeing Exoborne for the first time, can you give us a quick rundown on what this project is?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. Exoborne is a tactical extraction shooter. You play as an Exowarrior in the United States that's being torn apart by these apocalyptic forces of nature, and that happens as you play the game.</p>
<p>During a session, you scavenge and fight to stay alive. It's an extraction shooter. You fight your way in, you try to achieve an objective, you fight your way out, and hopefully, you survive long enough to extract yourself and get out of the session. You can prolong that experience by doing certain activities in the session.</p>
<p>There is something called a rebirth trace timer that keeps track of you as you move around. Eventually, that timer is going to identify you on the map for all other players to see. That's your hint that you should have gotten out already, because now you're kind of marked. You can extend that timer so it takes longer before you get marked on the map,</p>
<p><strong>How does extraction work in your game?</strong></p>
<p>The only way to get out is through the extraction ships. There are a number of extraction points on the map, and not all of them are active at any given time. The weather can affect which ones are active, and there's also a random dynamic to it. The first thing you really want to do when you drop in is kind of look at which of these zones are active for extraction, and then you plan your activity.</p>
<p><strong>Ok. It's probably one dropship per extraction point, so if a player team goes there and they extract, there won't be another ship called in right away, right?</strong></p>
<p>No, you're calling in one ship at a time and then there's a cooldown on that extraction point. If you're another team, you would have to wait a while to call in the next one. But you could also kill the ones trying to extract and take their extraction, or you could just go up, shake their hand, and all of you can get on board. But that rarely happens.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have an emote system in there for that sort of thing?</strong></p>
<p>We're actually looking at that now. I know it's on the design team's table. I haven't gotten the latest update on that, so I'm going to leave that as a maybe.</p>
<p><strong>In the PR materials for Exoborne, we saw highway signs for Albany. Does this mean that the game will be set in the northeastern reaches of the US?</strong></p>
<p>The game takes place in a fictional place that we call Colton County. It's a place we made up just because we wanted to be able to create our own sandbox to play in, right? And we always imagined Colton County located somewhere in the southeastern USA. We're still keeping it a bit vague, but it's not an accurate portrayal of any specific location. But yeah, there are traffic signs to real locations.</p>
<p><strong>We got to see three of the different Exorigs that players will have access to. Roughly how many are you planning to have at launch for Exoborne?</strong></p>
<p>At launch, there will be the three rigs you saw today, plus one we use for tutorial and onboarding. It's a much simpler thing. We just use it to teach you the basic power. The three you saw here are the three we're shipping with.</p>
<p><strong>And what sort of upgrades will players get as they dedicate time to each of the rigs?</strong></p>
<p>Each of these has some bespoke modules that are unique to each model. Then there are a number of shared modules that you can apply to every one of them. It can be different stuff, like, it can affect your movement speed, it can affect your grappling hook's speed. It can be lightning resistance or fire resistance, that type of stuff. You try to configure your exorig to fit your optimal playstyle or&nbsp;preference in combat.</p>
<p><strong>Are they more like static modifications, or will there be some that add in new abilities or change how an ability works?</strong></p>
<p>We have both direct abilities and stats that change based on the mods. You can call in an air strike, you can cloak, you can put down a cloak field, you can put down a minefield. There's a bunch of offensive capabilities and also some defensive capabilities. The other ones are more along what I mentioned previously, affecting your run speed or like grappler, cooldowns, and stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>What's the length of the grapple, roughly?</strong></p>
<p>That's a very good design question. I'm going to have to get back to you with an answer on that because I don't know it. It's also quite different depending on how you modify it, but we can get you an exact answer if you want to.</p>
<p><strong>I was experimenting right around the 15 to 20 m range when I got it to be really reliable.</strong></p>
<p>I would say it's around 20 m, but I can't give you an exact number.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Exoborne-1-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>How many different weapon types are available in Exoborne?</strong></p>
<p>I will have to count them in my head because I don't know the exact number. We have sniper rifles,&nbsp;shotguns, assault rifles, submachine guns, pistols, light machine guns. I'm sure I forgot one or two, so I would say 6 or 7 different types, and then many variants of those. None of them is limited to a specific rig.</p>
<p><strong>How large are each of the maps?</strong></p>
<p>Maynard is the biggest one. I'm struggling to remember exactly the size of it, but Maynard is quite big. It's a very big open. You can use cars to drive across it. The other one, the mid-size one we call Agnesville, and that's an urban area, so it is smaller in terms of the size, but it has way more vertical space because you've got more rooftops, you've got indoors. It plays very differently.</p>
<p>The smaller one is essentially quite a large sinkhole that's about 1 kilometer big, and it's like a big hole where you need to go down and do certain things, so it's a very intense area.</p>
<p><strong>When you're moving into a much denser area, like you mentioned,&nbsp;that limits a lot of the mobility options there.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. The Exorigs are made for traversal. That's one of the key components. That works absolutely best when you're outside, when you can either move freely on the wind, grappling up on cliffs or on buildings. When you go inside, it becomes more of a traditional tactical shooter because now you're locked in a hallway or locked into a room. That changes pacing, the tactics you apply, and to a certain degree, it also changes what you can use your Exorig for. But we still have some fairly large indoors as well where you can use some of these things to your advantage, like grappling hooks to get up on catwalks.</p>
<p><strong>Are any of these levels modular, where you might see them play out a little bit differently, or is every map bespoke?</strong></p>
<p>The layout is the same, it's static, but the weather patterns are always different, so that's dynamic.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any building destruction in Exoborne?</strong></p>
<p>We have destructible objects. The buildings themselves are not destructible, but many of the props and objects out in the world are. For example, fences and low walls and stuff like that can be either crushed if you run too fast with your Exorig. You can drive through them with cars, or you can shoot them or blow them up.</p>
<p><strong>We saw tornadoes. We did see firenados and others. Can players throw like a Molotov or an incendiary grenade and turn a tornado into a firenado?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. You can either use a Molotov to do that, or you can shoot an exploding barrel and cause a fire and the tornado becomes a firenado. You can do similar things with toxic substances. If you shoot a container with gas in it, then it carries the gas with it.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any plans to have a weather forecast? It wouldn't have to be exact, just to get a rough idea of the conditions before starting a map.</strong></p>
<p>We've thought a lot about that. I know design has been struggling a bit with that. We want you to be able to have some degree of anticipation so you can load your equipment, because otherwise it doesn't really make sense, right? You want to prepare for a certain set of conditions. At the same time, we do want it to change on the map.&nbsp;I'm just going to have to say we're going to get back to you on that with more details.</p>
<p><strong>This isn't your first multiplayer title, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt-qa-devs-talk-early-access-feedback-and-partnering-with-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt</a> being the previous one from Sharkmob. What sort of lessons did you learn about what players enjoy most about a multiplayer game?</strong></p>
<p>Many of the seniors at our studio had worked together before on other multiplayer games. Just like you said, Bloodhunt is the first one that Sharkmob did, but we have some experience prior to that as well. A lot of the learnings we took from Bloodhunt were related to how to operate and how to run a live game. Bloodhunt was free to play. It's very different. We are now making a premium game, so there are certain factors that are quite different, but there were a lot of good lessons in Blood hunt on everything from the vertical movement. It might have been a bit too hardcore in Bloodhunt, where it was quite easy to get away from a fight by jumping down a house or breaking a line of sight, meaning that you would often lose your prey and you wouldn't get to finish the fight.</p>
<p>In Exoborne, we've spaced out the verticality a bit more, so it's harder to quickly break those lines of sight. You're going to have to commit to the fight more than you did in that game. Besides gameplay stuff like that, there's also learnings around cheating, how to plan live content, and at the same time provide updates and bug fixes, and all of that stuff. It's way more complicated than you'd think initially to be able to both proactively produce content and, at the same time, maintain what's running live right in front of you. So a lot of good lessons on the simple practical stuff of running a game like that.</p>
<p><strong>What anti-cheat solution are you using?</strong></p>
<p>We've got to get back to you on that one. The only thing I can say is that we've invested a lot of thought and time into it, but we're also quite wary about releasing too many details about it for the obvious reasons of maybe not wanting to spill the beans on it.</p>
<p><strong>Is PC the only platform or just the primary platform for Exoborne?</strong></p>
<p>It's more like the first platform for us. We will do PC and console, but we will do PC first and then consoles will follow.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Exoborne-2-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Battle Pass?</strong></p>
<p>There will be a Battle Pass, we can say that. The game is full of cosmetics, vanity, and customizing your character. Not just how it plays, but also how it looks is very important to us. That's another one of those things we kind of fell in love with Bloodhunt, where we had a lot of customization options. You will definitely be able to have a lot of diversity in how you set up a character.</p>
<p><strong>One thing that's unique about Exoborne is that, rather than picking upper and bottom layers, you're picking the entire outfit. Will players be able to have different colors for a given outfit?</strong></p>
<p>I don't think we have different colors on the outfits. We have different variants of the same. We have different uniform patterns, for example. It's the same basic uniform, but with different patterns. On the Exorigs, we have more color options.</p>
<p>Because you have the vanity on your outfit, which is like your clothing, and then you have your Exorig where you have another set of vanity on top of that, like the skin for the actual Exorig and you have Helmets, you have facewear, and then your facial customization.</p>
<p><strong>Will players be able to acquire the outfits in the game itself? Can they find a rare loot that might have an outfit?</strong></p>
<p>I am pretty sure we have a reward system that rewards vanity.</p>
<p><strong>Alright. Is there any sort of mastery system that incentivizes players to pick up one specific Exorig and specialize with it?</strong></p>
<p>There's a progression system tied to the Exorig, so it's going to take time to max it out. Ideally, I think you would probably want to be able to use all of them because there's a synergy between them, and you play in a team. So, if the entire team goes in with the same Exorig, that might not be optimal. Depending on who you play with, you might want to swap it out.</p>
<p><strong>Going into the mission, we saw a loadout or gear score. What risks are there for players if they die in the world? What will they lose?</strong></p>
<p>When you die, you lose everything except your Exorig, so you lose your guns and all. Well, you don't lose the vanity either, so the Exorig and the vanity are safe. You lose your weapon, you lose your mods, you lose your inventory, you lose your armor. That's what you lose when you die.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any insurance system at play here where players might insure their primary weapons, so if they die and lose everything, they might be able to retain them?</strong></p>
<p>We're running a lot of tests and each of these tests have generated feedback that we have taken and addressed in the game. For example, we did a progression overhaul, an inventory overhaul, we did a significant UX pass. The handler character that you probably saw when you played is Styx, who holds together much of the missions and we're constantly looking for that feedback.</p>
<p>When it comes to the insurance thing, it's one of those things where I'm saying currently we don't have it. If we think we need, it we might add it, but right now, it's not in the game. It's one of those things where some players love it, some players hate it because they want every match to be incredibly high stakes. But sometimes it helps draw in players that might be a little risk-averse to go out there with those higher ranked weapons rather than just keeping them in your stash for another day.</p>
<p>That is the big challenge, right? If you have a very powerful weapon, the risk is that you're too afraid to use it. I definitely get that desire, but there might be other ways to handle that and make sure you still feel like you can use your toy and not be afraid to lose it.</p>
<p><strong>How will players be able to communicate in the world of Exoborne?</strong></p>
<p>We have the ping system. We also have VoIP for both team and proximity chat, so you can communicate with other teams if you want to when you're close to each other. Those are the main ways of doing it.</p>
<p><strong>Will players be able to link multiple squads together if they want to ally towards the end of the match?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, there is no system that allows that to happen mechanically, but there's nothing that stops you from doing it on a gentleman's agreement.</p>
<p><strong>When will players be able to get their hands on Exoborne?</strong></p>
<p>We recently had that public test. We are preparing to do more tests, and a date will be released in the&nbsp;not-so-distant future, but we're not releasing that date yet.</p>
<p><strong>What are your thoughts on collaborating with other brands or other games to create new content or cosmetics for Exoborne?</strong></p>
<p>I think we're always open to collaborations, and you can obviously do them in many different ways, right? We have a world that is very close to our own, so there are some brands that fit perfectly as a part of the universe, and those brand collaborations are very easy if they show up. Then there are collaborations which might be a bit more on the edge of, does that fit in our world? Then we'd have to take that discussion, but typically even in that case, you could have a temporary event where you do that kind of stuff. We're always hoping for collaborations. It's always fun.</p>
<p><strong>Exoborne is so much about the gunplay, but would you consider having melee weapons in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Each of the Exorigs today has a melee move, which you can use for different things. Personally, I mostly use it against NPCs. I'm not sure I would dare to go and try to get a player doing that as long as they have a gun, but I would absolutely say that I would not completely rule out melee weapons as a thing that could be added in the future. It's how we work: we watch how people play and what they enjoy to do, and then we try to create more of that content, but there will definitely be no melee weapons at launch. It's one attack per unit and that's it.</p>
<p><strong>Any other closing remarks you'd like to leave with our readers, Martin?</strong></p>
<p>Like I said, we already made major improvements to this game based on feedback from people like your readers. I would be very happy to keep seeing their feedback and just to have them comment on stuff, participate in our play tests, and let us know what works and what doesn't work. Often, what can be really helpful is why they think it doesn't work. It's one thing to say, oh, that thing is shit, but please elaborate and explain why you think it's shit or why you think it's awesome because that really helps us when we read the comments.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you so much for your time.</strong></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-direct-scheduled-for-this-week.1219368/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-direct-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that it will be airing a&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>-themed Direct presentation later this week, so we'll finally get to learn more about the iconic ape's upcoming platformer.</p>

<p>As revealed on the Nintendo Today news app, the&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>Direct airs on June 18th (that's this Wednesday at time of writing). It'll last around 15 minutes and will (quite obviously) focus entirely on&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, so put your&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>hopes away.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">back in April</a> as part of the Nintendo Switch 2's big reveal,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>will serve as DK's first 3D platformer in 26 years. Naturally, I'm not counting the newer&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country&nbsp;</em>games; their models might be 3D, but they're 2D platformers at heart.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-announced-dk.jpg?itok=FoXmj90V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-announced-dk.jpg?itok=Rpz_cQ8B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Direct airs in two days, DK. I'd go find something else to do in the meantime.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will see you playing as the titular ape as he attempts to recover priceless golden banana-shaped jewels from the nefarious VoidCo, for if Donkey Kong is involved, then it must be the rescue of bananas that motivates him.</p>

<p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>will take the form of a 3D platformer with all the good stuff you've come to expect from the genre: collectibles, bad guys to fight, and, of course, plenty of chasms to jump across.</p>

<p>The game will also feature destructible environments, with initial trailers showing off the ability to smash up elements of the stage to get underground or to collect more stuff. That's the kind of thing the original Switch probably wouldn't have been able to handle.</p>

<p>You can remind yourself of how fun&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>looks (very, in case you need a refresher) by checking out the debut trailer from back in April below.</p>
