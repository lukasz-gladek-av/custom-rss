              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/titan-quest-2-early-access-out-now-2000614459"><em>Titan Quest II</em> snuck up out of nowhere</a> and surprised us all. The sequel to the 2006 classic may have nothing to do with the original developers, nor even the original publishers, but after spending a few hours with the game I’m left in no doubt that it understands the spirit of what it’s trying to recreate. It’s just that this Early Access release isn’t close to optimized, and lacks some incredibly obvious quality-of-life features.</p> <p>The original&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em> was released midway through the twelve-year gap between&nbsp;<em>Diablo II </em>and&nbsp;<em>Diablo III</em>, and even three years before the release of&nbsp;<em>Torchlight</em>. While hardcore action-RPG players had just been given 2005’s&nbsp;<em>Fate</em>, the market was so very open for a more immediately approachable&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>-like, and Iron Lore Entertainment’s Greek (and Egyptian) mythology game perfectly fit the bill. It’s super-low-key approach to the genre meant you weren’t worrying about min-maxing your intricate build, but were far more likely to just be methodically click-click-clicking your way through its luscious lands. Not quite an idle game (those were years from being a thing), <em>Titan Quest</em> allowed a nonchalance in its delivery of constant dopamine hits as you incessantly progressed, whether geographically or in the quality of your equipment. And this, from my admittedly brief time so far with <em>Titan Quest II</em>, seems to be entirely understood. In a lot of ways–and ways that leave me optimistic despite my laundry list of complaints–it’s the sequel you would want.</p> <p>Then, on the other hand, the game is causing my GPU to be transformed into a thermo-nuclear bomb, forcing me to turn it off lest I blow up my entire town.</p>

 <p>A lack of optimization is perhaps typical for an Early Access game, but&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II</em>‘s crappy framerates and attempts at arson via my PC feel a bit too much. More frustrating to me are the obvious quality-of-life features that you just expect any game in this genre to already have in place, like, I dunno, being able to rebind controller buttons, or not have to hold down a key to be able to compare inventory items. It’s also not great that trying to use a ladder can see you endlessly spinning on the spot with no choice but to reload.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614551" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614551"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614551">©THQ Nordic / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Titan Quest II</em> starts exactly right. The opening of the original&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em> was so idyllic, such a perfect bucolic setting, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-seem-to-be-having-trouble-starting-titan-quest">that I didn’t want to leave it</a>. This sequel 19 years on seems to have fully understood this, and offers something that evokes the very same sense of serenity and safety. You stand atop a cliff, looking out over the gorgeous blue sea on the coast, a ruined building below, a shipwreck to your right, but it’s all so peaceful and pretty. However, you’re quickly urged on by another character to hurry and help, as a gryphon is attacking the nearby town, so off you go.</p> <p>After this, there’s definitely nothing that’ll especially surprise you if you’re familiar with action-RPGs.&nbsp;You left click to move, right click to attack, and enemies and items will drop you new equipment. After some inventory <em>Tetris</em>, you compare what you’ve picked up with what you’ve already got, swap it out, and then find a merchant on whom to dump the rest. And repeat. And that’s enough! That’s the joy of this genre, just enough to keep you distracted, ideally accompanied by a favorite podcast. However, for min-maxxers,&nbsp;<em>TQ2</em> does go the extra mile, with intricate information about your current build, allowing far more in-depth development should that be your thing; for everyone else, you can just make sure numbers go up, and when you gain a new level, add the abilities that sound the most interesting to you.</p>

 <p>Like in the original, there are various Masteries to choose from, although at this point in the sequel’s Early Access they number just four, all familiar. There’s Earth, Lightning, Warfare, and Rogue, and alongside these there’s Core, which lets you boost your main attack in various ways. Then there’s the usual stats to push upward as you go. However, this time out it’s all far more complicated than it should be, with each Mastery filled with a squillion different skills, and each of those skills then upgraded themselves with micro-skills, and given the result is just hitting something harder, or making lightning zap the enemies, it doesn’t need to be anywhere this muddled. The tutorials aren’t great at explaining it all at this point either, although I just sort of guessed and things seemed fine.</p> <p>There are a couple of more significant changes. Firstly, there’s now a dash, which makes for more interesting moments in combat when you’re being targeted by an attack that’s focused on a particular spot on the ground. And perhaps slightly controversially, the game has done away with proper potions, instead having sort of magic ones that refill as a result of your combat. Fight more, and you can heal more. It’s odd. I think I preferred just being able to buy a hundred health potions and not having to think about it. Along with these, there are little details that felt very positive; I was especially pleased with how arrows pierce enemies and can be used to take down groups charging in a line. Or the way a portal spawns nearby where you die, so you don’t have the misery of trudging all the way back to where you fell.</p>

 <p>I was happy! I found ranged attacks far more viable here than they were in the original, which is lovely, and I was happily switching between bow and club depending upon the circumstances, walloping everything and scooping up loot. But, the more I played, the more something felt off. And it’s not just the shitty framerates. But it is also the shitty framerates.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614553" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614553"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614553">©THQ Nordic / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Let’s get the tech stuff out of the way, as this aspect is likely to be fixed the most quickly. The game ran for me at around 40FPS, even when I’d lowered the settings from its recommendations, and even running it in a too-small window. Worse, that fluctuated, sometimes 55, sometimes 35, and all that jarring change made it feel clumsy. And remember, this is a fixed-camera isometric RPG. It’s also pretty astonishing that a PC game from a big-name publisher released in 2025 wouldn’t have sensible graphics settings, but <em>TQ2</em>‘s are a mess. I have an ultra-wide monitor, and was only able to choose between 3440×1440 in fullscreen (which I wouldn’t expect to be optimized for just yet) or the deeply obscure 2048×1152 in a window, which is tiny on this screen. There was no option for a bog-standard 2560×1440, which is pretty dreadful, especially since it clearly&nbsp;<em>can</em> run in those higher resolutions. This feels pretty amateurish.</p>

 <p>That leaden feeling to movement, likely caused by framerate issues, is I think the most off-putting aspect at the moment. But there’s more insidious stuff, like the weird way loot drops from all the wrong places. A real joy of <em>Titan Quest</em> is that enemies dropped what they had. If you killed a boar, the best you’d get is a boar hide. But if your enemy was equipped with a shield and axe, there was a strong chance of finding those on the floor after it was dead. But here, I watched the intense silliness of a giant eagle dropping a pair of shoes as it died. I also saw snakes flinging out gloves as they flopped to the ground. I’m not a fully qualified herpetologist, but I’m pretty sure they have little use for gloves. No, it doesn’t <em>matter</em>, but it’s kind of crap.</p> <p>Then there’s just inexplicable choices, like needing to hold down Alt to compare items in your inventory with those that are equipped. There’s no circumstance ever where you don’t want the comparison to pop up, which is why all games like this do it by default (or offer a toggle for the mad people). Here, when you’re trying to sort through your junk to sell to a merchant, you have to tie your fingers in knots holding down Alt to compare, the Shift to sell, and it’s all far more of a fiddle than could possibly be needed. Why no toggle? Who lives like that? Then there’s the inability to rebind controller inputs, and the astonishingly hard boss fights, and maybe most of all, the lack of a sense of place.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000614560" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614560"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614560">©THQ Nordic / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It says it’s set in ancient Greece, but if that’s true, why are there ruins everywhere? The developers know they didn’t start out that way, right? There’s a lovely intro video which explains how Nemesis is out of control, and the threads of Fate have been corrupted, and someone has to stop her, but then absolutely no sense of how that links to who you are and why you’re there. Everyone else seems to know who you are, but you don’t! You just start off with someone shouting about a gryphon and you just get on with it, but with no grounding. At least in <em>Titan Quest</em>, this blank slate start was understood by your having just arrived on a boat, with NPCs frantically getting you up to date.</p> <p>I dunno. I think I’m perhaps being overly fussy, and will likely get over all of this as soon as I can run the game at a steady framerate and a sensible scale without personally accelerating global climate change. I actually really like a lot about this, and think that with a few patches, it’ll be an Early Access game worth investing in. Sure, more Masteries would be good, but they’ve put in the most popular here, so you’ve plenty to get on with.</p> <p>It’s also worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em> isn’t&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>, and was never trying to be. This isn’t about rushing through the actual game in order to reach end-game sicko content–it’s about enjoying the journey. And it’s incredibly refreshing to pick up an ARPG that <em>isn’t</em> bloated with live-service faff of the sort that makes games like <em>Path of Exile 2</em> feel so incredibly inaccessible to me. I feel like&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em> might be exactly the game I’ve been wanting ever since the last time <em>Torchlight&nbsp;</em>was any good, and it just needs a little bit of work before it can deliver it.</p> <p>For now, you may want to hold off a couple of weeks while it gets its shit together. That it’s only $24 really does make a massive difference, it should be said, and once that sluggish feel is gone, I’ll likely be mainlining the game.</p>

But don’t hold your breath for a reveal: Vincke called on fans to be patient as Larian "need a bit of time to make it all work."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game Baldur’s Gate 3 was a breakout hit in 2023, dominating online conversation and setting sales records. Its wild success was a game-changer for Larian, and it has continued to perform strongly in the two years since launch, with mods helping to fuel seemingly never-ending interest in the RPG, especially on Steam.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke told IGN in September 2024 that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-one-year-later-larian-interview"><u>the success of Baldur’s Gate 3 meant Larian was now in a “luxurious position,”</u></a> and could “pick our own destiny and our own path.” The developer shocked the video game world when it announced plans to make brand new games outside the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe, rather than follow Baldur’s Gate 3 with DLC or a sequel. It is now hard at work realizing that vision, Vincke said in a tweet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Crazy to think it’s only been two years,” he said. “It’s truly been life changing. Probably worth writing about one day. But I can spoil the biggest takeaway. BG3 was what allowed us to do our next crazy thing. How that will pan out is anyone’s guess but I can assure you we’re working hard to ensure you’ll have plenty of fun. Like really — loads of it. In a surprising way. And I can’t wait to show you. But you’ll need to be patient / we’ll need a bit of time to make it all work.

Its release sparked a player surge as fans flocked to test out the new subclasses as well as the brand new photo mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1914637297946931379" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted</u></a> to say he expected Baldur’s Gate 3 to “continue to do well for quite some time,” not just because of the Patch 8 player boost, but because of “thriving” mod support.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/538860954058754131" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post on Steam</a> issued today, August 4, Larian said that since the introduction of mod support in September 2024, players have uploaded over 8,500 mods to mod.io and hit 265 million mod downloads ("of which, over 250,000 of all downloads are Withers Big Naturals by the way - we just thought you’d like to know"). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This ongoing success in turn gives Larian “room to focus on making our next big thing as good as we can,” Vincke continued. “We’ve got big shoes to fill.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN 10 of 2023</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian is done with Baldur's Gate, but D&amp;D owner Hasbro has teased plans to continue with the series.

                <p>Blizzard's dark fantasy ARPG series Diablo is getting the tabletop RPG treatment, and it promises to have players geared up and ready to hack and slash through armies of demons from "session zero."</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glasscannonunplugged/706666020?ref=36816m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kickstarter campaign</a> page for Diablo: The Roleplaying Game recently went live, and while the campaign won't officially begin until this fall, it does provide some details on what players can expect from the TTRPG adaptation. The game comes from Glass Cannon, which has made board game versions of plenty of video games in the past, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-the-board-game-is-planned-for-later-this-year/1100-6511682/" data-ref-id="1100-6511682">Apex Legends</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">As for how the TTRPG will try to capture the spirit of the Diablo video games, Glass Cannon name drops a few Diablo classes players will be able to play as, including Barbarian, Druid, Necromancer, Rogue, and Sorcerer (the same classes available at launch in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a>). More importantly, it gives a glimpse of how it is looking to adapt Diablo's fast-and-frenetic ARPG action into a tabletop format.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4542744-diabloroleplayinggamekickstarter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542744" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4542744-diabloroleplayinggamekickstarter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542744"></a><figcaption>A look at some of the miniatures included as part of Diablo: The Roleplaying Game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4542744-diabloroleplayinggamekickstarter.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For starters, Glass Cannon promises there won't be "inexperienced and squishy first-level characters." Instead, player characters will begin their adventure "fully equipped as a seasoned hero ready to live the epic-level dream of TTRPGs from session zero." Battles will see players fighting through "endless mobs in fast paced, tactical combat where story, stats, and synergies hold sway." There will additionally be a "push-your-luck" mechanic inspired by the Diablo universe's Eternal Conflict between the forces of heaven and hell.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo: The Roleplaying Game will sport a 300-page core rulebook that will provide game rules, lore, and artwork. It will be accompanied by a number of one-shot adventures for players to experience from writers like Graham McNeill, known for their work in the Warhammer universe, and MJ Newman of Arkham Horror fame. The game's rules will use a custom d6 dice-pool system and will also come with detailed miniatures, previews of which can be seen on the Kickstarter page.</p><p dir="ltr">As for when in the Diablo timeline the Diablo TTRPG will be set, it looks to take place around the time of Diablo 4, with marketing material showing Lilith and featuring taglines like "be beautiful in sin." The Kickstarter page states that players will be able to "explore Sanctuary's diverse lands and history spanning the entire franchise."</p><p dir="ltr">That's about all the details known so far, but those interested in learning more can sign up to be notified about the Kickstarter campaign's upcoming launch.</p><p dir="ltr">In Diablo video game news, various content creators were treated to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">secret glimpse at Diablo 4's future</a>, even as Blizzard itself states that there <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/those-hoping-for-major-diablo-4-update-news-may-have-to-keep-waiting/1100-6533522/" data-ref-id="1100-6533522">won't be any major Diablo 4 news</a> ahead of Season 10 in September. Diablo 4 was also recently cleared to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-will-release-in-a-new-massive-market-soon/1100-6533422/" data-ref-id="1100-6533422">release in China</a> after receiving governmental approval.</p>

<figure><a title="Super Mario Bros. 40th Anniversary" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f1c019541f4a5/super-mario-bros-40th-anniversary.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Five years ago, Nintendo made an appropriately big thing of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a>' 35th anniversary, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/09/nintendo_announces_super_mario_remasters_and_much_more_in_super_mario_bros_35th_anniversary_direct">a bespoke Direct</a> broadcast featuring a bunch of new games and, naturally, merch celebrating the Famicom release of video gaming's most famous platformer on 13th September 1985.</p>
<p>Half a decade on and the 40th anniversary is just over a month away. With Switch 2 out in the wild and a Mario platformer-shaped gap in Nintendo's announced lineup, it feels natural that there would be similar celebrations planned for this year. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_bros_35">Super Mario Bros. <del>35</del> 40</a>, anyone?</p>
<p>There are some easy gimmes Nintendo could put out — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> updates, a new Lego set, a bunch of swag with 'Super Mario Bros. 40th Anniversary' plastered all over it — and with DK ably taking on 3D platformer duties in the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a>, the need for the brand new 3D Mario game we've all been waiting for since 2017's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a> isn't <em>quite</em> as desperate as it was at the start of the year. But still, the door is wide open for all sorts of plumber-related news.</p>
<p>Realistically, we're a few weeks away from any potential announcements, but let's take a look at what Team NL predicts Nintendo is cooking up for SMB's 40th...</p>
<h2>Super Mario Maker 2 - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Ludicrously Long Title Addendum That's Totally Impractical For Any Normal Person To Say Or Even Remem— (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Maker" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d48df7d5e3761/mario-maker.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it's coming up on four decades of SMB, it's also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/super_mario_maker">Super Mario Maker</a>'s 10th anniversary on 10th September. Seeing as it's already a celebration of the series, I've got my money on a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_maker_2">Mario Maker 2</a>, which adds in a Wonder theme and some Mouse Mode controls.</p>
<p>Sticking to anniversary-related releases (hey, where would games media be without a good old 'It's now been longer since X than it was between Y and Z', huh?), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island">Yoshi's Island</a> turns 30 on 5th August. Now, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/08/soapbox_25_years_on_i_still_cant_get_into_yoshis_island">I've never been a big fan</a> — beyond the stellar art — due to wailing baby anxiety, but can you imagine what a 4K sequel could look like?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, I know there have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/yoshis_island_ds">Island</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/yoshis_new_island">sequels</a> already, but let's not talk about those. I'm thinking something more along the lines of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/legend_of_zelda_a_link_between_worlds">Link Between Worlds</a> to the original's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past">Link to the Past</a>, not a wet fart to Yoshi's Island's...</p>
<p>Hmm, I've gotten myself in trouble with an analogy and a game I don't even like very much, Alana. Hilfe, bitte...</p>
<h2>Weird Mario, please (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="DDR: Mario Mix" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e555c6997d524/ddr-mario-mix.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hooo boy, I'm going to forgo all of the obvious things here; yes, it's time for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_golf">Mario Golf</a>. Yes, it's time for a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/mario_super_sluggers">Mario Sluggers</a>. But where the heck is a new version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/dance_dance_revolution_mario_mix">Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix</a>???</p>
<p>Okay, I'm not the target audience for a new DDR Mario game, but this gets to the core I want from Mario going forward — more <em>weird</em> Mario. The <strong>Mario RPG</strong>s and <strong>Paper Mario</strong> have been carrying the torch over the past few years, and with Nintendo's improved animations, I think it's time we got some of those unusual spin-offs on Nintendo Switch Online. Or a new game.</p>
<p>Realistically, we'll get a <strong>Mario Movie 2</strong> teaser, a 3D Mario tease... maybe a new Nintendo Switch 2 design? Let's be reasonable, folks!</p>

<h2>Space, Jam (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario 3-on-3 Hoops" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9b64dcb8587cf/mario-3-on-3-hoops.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can keep your Golf, Sluggers, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_strikers_battle_league">Strikers</a>, and Olympic Game crossovers; there's only one sporting event that I want to see back in action come September, and that's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mario_hoops_3_on_3">Mario Hoops 3 on 3</a>.</p>
<p>I mean, come on. Basketball seems to be bigger around the world today than ever before, and the death of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/nba_jam">NBA Jam</a> has left an arcade baller-shaped hole in all of our hearts. Give me a full-blown Mario Hoops revival, complete with high-flying dunks and silky smooth performance, and you've got yourself a winner.</p>
<p>If that's off the table, however, it seems only right that we get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> on Switch 2 in <em>some form</em>. At this point, I honestly don't care if it's a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">3D All-Stars</a> update or the announcement of a catchily-titled 'Super Mario 3D All-Stars + Super Mario Galaxy 2 - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition'. I'll do whatever it takes to play it on modern hardware.</p>

<h2>99 Marios and 1 Yoshi in a thong (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Yoshi's New Island" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/762268c5260f4/yoshis-new-island.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I reckon the smart money is on a remaster or upgrade of some sort for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Mario Wonder</a>, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy_2">Galaxy</a> games, or hey, I'd even take a full remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a> with fancy new Switch 2 controls and gimmicks. Shouting "Pump it!" into the mic for paint to come out of your gun or something. I'll let the boffins figure out the fine details.</p>
<p>However, seeing as there's been so little fanfare thus far, maybe it's gonna be something totally different, something small-scale. Or maybe we'll get a brand new game, a whole new-ass Mario stealthing onto the scene, they could even call it New-Ass Mario, they can have that for free.</p>
<p>If I had my choice, I'd like to see where Nintendo would go with some sort of Mario 99 game, something challenging and unique. You know, jumping along a route and when you fall, you're out. Or, since we've just had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> drop on NSO, maybe they're testing the waters for a brand new version of that. I'd also like to see Mario Beach Volleyball. Come on, Nintendo, you know you want to put Yoshi in bikini bottoms.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Those are a few of our hopes, but what do you think Nintendo might roll out as Super Mario Bros. enters its fifth decade? Does <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_mario_3d_land">Super Mario Land 3D</a> get a Deluxe port? Do we get a 1:1 of 1-1 in Lego form? Is it time for Mario's Broadway debut as we discover Miyamoto's been on a Gilbert and Sullivan binge?</em> <em>Let us know below.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Swen Vincke, the director of the massively popular and <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491">successful RPG</a><em> Baldur’s Gate 3,</em> recently teased Larian Studios’ next big game on social media while celebrating the fact that it has been two years since the team’s <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-themed game left early access and became a global phenomenon.</p> <p>On August 3, a content creator on Twitter shared the news that it had now been exactly two years since <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> left early access on Steam and was fully released to the world. The turn-based RPG quickly became one of the biggest games of 2023 thanks to its incredible depth, wonderful writing, and its numerous, memorable romance options.<em> Baldur’s Gate 3</em> ended up winning so many awards after its launch that it <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-too-many-awards-winning-larian-goty-1851593323">started causing problems for developer Larian Studios</a>. Now, two years later, Vincke shared that tweet announcing the anniversary and <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1952106606864253253?t=6umojy2gp7HUKigWoKWTU">called <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 “</em>life changing”</a> while teasing the studio’s next big project, which he claims is only possible thanks to<em> BG3</em>‘s success.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Crazy to think it’s only been two years. It’s truly been life changing. Probably worth writing about one day. But I can spoil the biggest takeaway.  BG3 was what allowed us to do our next crazy thing. How that will pan out is anyone’s guess but I can assure you we’re working hard… <a href="https://t.co/bGBYZoSXGZ">https://t.co/bGBYZoSXGZ</a></p> <p>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/1952106606864253253?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Crazy to think it’s only been two years. It’s truly been life changing,” said Vincke on Twitter. “Probably worth writing about one day. But I can spoil the biggest takeaway. <em>BG3</em> was what allowed us to do our next crazy thing. How that will pan out is anyone’s guess, but I can assure you we’re working hard to ensure you’ll have plenty of fun. Like really – loads of it. In a surprising way. And I can’t wait to show you. But you’ll need to be patient.”</p>

 <p>This isn’t the first time Vincke has teased a big, new, ambitious game that isn’t<em> Baldur’s Gate 4</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-sequel-expansion-larian-studios-1851356964">In March 2024</a>, while talking at GDC, Vincke confirmed that Larian wasn’t working on an expansion for <em>BG3</em>, nor was the studio developing a sequel. Instead, he confirmed that it was working on two new games based on original IP. At the time, the CEO and <em>BG3</em> director claimed both games were still in the very early stages of development. <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-larian-new-next-game-ip-divinity-rpg-1851419091">The next month</a>, Vincke once again teased the studio’s next game, this time as a part of a blog about a <em>BG3</em> update on Steam.</p> <p>“I don’t know if we’re going to pull it off, but looking at our narrative, visual, and gameplay plans, I think what we’re working on now will be our best work ever,” Vincke said in the 2024 post. “I get excited like a kid watching the key imagery, want to show it to everyone now, and grumble in frustration at having to wait until it’s actually all working. Yes, it’s hype, but it’s hype because it really looks and feels good.”</p> <p>So yeah, whatever Larian Studios is working on right now sounds massive and impressive, and is likely years away. In Vincke’s post on Monday, he ended it with: “We’ll need a bit of time to make it all work. It’ll be worth it though.”</p>

            <p>The new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock">Bioshock</a> game in development at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cloud-chamber">Cloud Chamber</a> Games is in difficulties, according to sources of the multiple and anonymous persuasion. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-bioshock-announced">Announced in 2019</a>, the game has reportedly failed a recent internal progress review, with its narrative found to be in particular need of revamping. </p>
<p>Publishers 2K Games aren't talking about any of this, naturally, but they <em>have</em> confirmed that they've treated Cloud Chamber to a not-at-all punitive studio reshuffle, with Kelley Gilmore losing her position as studio head, while former creative director Hogarth de la Plante has been reassigned to a publishing role.</p>
<p>The report comes care of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil">Bloomberg</a> (paywall), who cite "people familiar with the situation". Gilmore and de la Plante's reassignments may not be the worst of the fallout. According to Bloomberg, staff were told at a recent all-hands meeting that they had to become "more agile and efficient" - a phrase equivalent in balefulness to "would you kindly", and a possible indication that layoffs are on the way.</p>
<p>2K Games ain't talking about that either. Here's what they've said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-reportedly-getting-a-narrative-overhaul-amid-development-struggles">IGN</a>:</p>
<blockquote>We are working hard to set BioShock up for the best possible future. Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path.</blockquote>
<p>Little is known about the new Bioshock, which may not be titled Bioshock 4 inasmuch as reverting to numbered sequels feels a bit ridiculous after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock-infinite">Bioshock Infinite</a>. I used to win a lot of playground arguments by dint of the formula "timesed by infinity... <em>plus one</em>", but I can't see a major games publisher adopting that particular rhetorical gambit as a naming strategy. Ehhh, maybe Square Enix.</p>
<p>The little we know about the new Bioshock includes the fact that original series figurehead and videogame thespian Ken Levine isn't working on it. He's off making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judas">Judas</a> at Ghost Story Games. Beyond that, we can only speculate based on previous instalments. There will, presumably, be a man, a city and a lighthouse. It'll be an FPS with a sprinkling of imsim and some arch literary ambitions, and there will be a false utopia of some kind. You will be able to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioshock-4-should-let-you-fire-an-albatross-from-your-hand">shoot animals out of your hands</a>.</p>
<p>The Bloomberg report also alleges that 2K Games cancelled a Bioshock 1 remake earlier this year. I think I can probably do without a Bioshock remake, but I'm sorry for any developers potentially affected. Best of luck to all at Cloud Chamber bringing Nushock home.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2k-comment-on-reports-bioshock-4-is-in-trouble-we-have-a-good-game-but-we-are-committed-to-delivering-a-great-one]]></content:encoded>

The <em>VF5 </em>remaster <em><span>Virtua Fighter</span> 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage</em>, meanwhile, arrives on October 30.</p>

She’ll have her own level as well. Some <a href="https://x.com/TheCartelDel/status/1952275304774508728?t=GTrscs-QIQA1T8PwgO2HOg&amp;s=19">fans are already debating</a> whether they like the final version more or less than the original concept art, which shows her with a darker complexion.</p> <h2><em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</em> comes to <em>Guilty Gear</em></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE- Season Pass 4 Playable Character #4 [Lucy] Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hi76aA61PQQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The <em>Guilty Gear -Strive-</em> Season Pass 4 includes Lucy from the <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> Netflix anime <em>Edgerunners</em>. The introverted protagonist will be available starting August 21, while season 2 of the show isn’t expected to become available until late next year or early 2027. Producer Ken Miyauchi <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/guilty-gear-strive-producer-speaks-out-on-rumors-of-canceled-follow-up-game-3233422/">shot down recent rumors</a> that a new <em>Guilty Gear</em> game had been canceled and suggested <em>Strive</em> still has a long road ahead, including the new 2.0 update coming later this month.</p> <h2><em>Street Fighter</em>‘s Ken joins the new <em>Fatal Fury</em></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="FATAL FURY: CotW × STREET FIGHTER｜KEN" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6byynkBnQOM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>He isn’t<em> Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em>‘ first cameo character but he’s by far the most exciting. Ken is available now, with Chun-Li joining sometime over the winter. It’s the follow-up to a crossover exchange that began with Terry Bogard and Mai Shiranui coming to <em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>last year. The game itself has some strong fundamentals but is extremely content-light and hard to recommend with so much stronger competition around.</p>

Rochkind is joined by Roger Kurtz, the former head of production at Private Division, and a team of games publishing veterans with “decades” of experience across companies like <a title="Companies > Devolver Digital [414 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a>, <a title="Companies > Humble Games [144 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/humble-games">Humble Games</a>, Microsoft, and more. </p><p>According to the press release, Lyrical Games will support “imaginative and high-caliber games that live between the extremes of smaller indies and massive AAA productions.”</p><p>“From the very beginning of Lyrical Media, we set out to be a premier home for amazing storytelling regardless of medium,” said Lyrical Media founder and CEO Alexander Black in the press release. “We want to empower fiercely passionate game creators by bridging the gap between their art and the players who stand to be moved by it. Lyrical Games has the experience to know that we are nothing without our partners and their vision.”</p><p>Lyrical Games head Blake Rochkind adde,d “At Lyrical Games, we firmly believe developers are often the best stewards of their own game. In today’s landscape, there has never been more noise, and not every developer necessarily needs a publisher. We built Lyrical Games to be the kind of publisher they want to work with. In this new normal, it’s never been more important for both developers and their publishing partners to share a clear, holistic vision at the outset—not just for the game itself, but who that audience is and how they can and should be reached.”</p><p>Rochkind continued, “In the high end indie or ‘triple-i’ space, we believe we can offer among the best, if not the best, deal terms available right now. We’re not just looking for developers, but for partners who want a meaningful say in all the ways their game will be shown to the world. Developers we work with will always have ownership of their IP, and our partnerships will always value collaboration and transparency above all else.”</p><!-- AD: content -->

<p>"Game wont load now," said one player on the game's Steam forum. "Maybe it's just me, but I was playing 20 minutes before the update and now it wont launch."</p><p>Another player said, "I downloaded the 1.3.0 patch and ran the game, but it suddenly stopped working. I reinstalled it and ran it again, but it still won't work.

"Please try completely removing these files and seeing if the issue persists."

You can check out the full patch notes below, along with the PS5 patch notes.</p><h3><strong>Stellar Blade PC Version 1.3.0 and PS5 Version 1.013 - Patch Notes</strong></h3><p><strong>PS5 &amp; PC Shared update details</strong></p><ul><li>Improved Photo Mode so that when selecting a logo, the logo control indicator is now displayed</li><li>Fixed an issue where players were unable to exit the shop after purchasing the 'Polarized Sunglasses' from Clyde’s shop</li><li>Fixed an issue where Eve’s hair would not appear during the final Elder Naytiba cutscene when wearing the 'Fluffy Bear' or 'Pink Bear' outfits</li><li>Fixed an issue where Eve's final Korean voice-over line was cut off during the 'Lost Items from Heaven' conversation with Clyde in the Great Desert</li><li>Fixed an issue where Eve’s arm would occasionally appear unnatural in Photo Mode when wearing the 'Black Pearl' or 'Red Pearl' outfits</li></ul><p><strong>PS5</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where entering the 'Demogorgon' battle with 'Ranged Auto Aim' turned OFF would cause the camera to shift away from its intended position, making it impossible to aim</li></ul><p><strong>PC</strong></p><ul><li>When using FSR upscaler, restarting the game is now required to enable frame generation</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Fusion Weapon was not visible when beginning the fight against the Airborne Squad after defeating Providence</li><li>Fixed an issue where using the numpad on the keyboard to trigger skills in the Training Room caused the training system to become unresponsive</li><li>Fixed an issue where, when fishing for the 'Betta' fish with mouse and keyboard, the gray striped pattern of the progress bar would obscure the reel-in progress bar</li><li>Fixed an issue where, when using the 'Stinger', target lock-on would not function correctly under specific input conditions</li><li>Fixed an issue where the zoom function in the Hair Salon menu would not respond to controller or keyboard input</li><li>Fixed an issue where dialogue would occasionally not display after interacting with Adam in the Eidos 9 Atelier</li><li>Fixed an issue where Dororong would occasionally not appear during their introduction scene in Xion</li><li>Fixed an issue where newly unlocked items would not immediately appear after increasing shop affinity level</li><li>Improved the save timestamp system so that time since last save is now accurately displayed based on successful saves, rather than attempted saves</li><li>Enhanced the save failure message by changing it to yellow for better visibility</li><li>Various other bug fixes</li></ul>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> has just turned two, which doesn't make any sense because there is no way that I am two years older than I was when it first came out, so I think Larian is lying.</p>
<p>But even so, the studio has released a few surprising stats about its critically acclaimed party-based RPG to mark the occasion.</p>

<p>So, it turns out that 2.07 percent of Baldur's Gate 3 players managed to defeat twenty opponents while drunk. Fair to say this will be in-game intoxication, because I am sure there have been plenty of wines and beers consumed while playing, and far more than 2.07 percent of us will have been a little tipsy while negotiating the world with Shadowheart and co (don't lie, it is not just me who does that).</p>
<p>Additionally, 3.87 percent of players managed to defeat Gortash in Wyrm's Rock without activating any traps. The developer noted those on Steam are a bit more canny with their footwork than those of us playing on Xbox or PlayStation, with 4.37 percent of players on Valve's platform successfully avoiding triggering traps (I am not one of them).</p>

<p>Also, 1.1 million players have completed Baldur's Gate 3 in Tactician Mode, one of the game's highest difficulty settings. Following that, almost half a million players "thought it would be fun" to complete Baldur's Gate 3 in Honour Mode, which builds on Tactician Mode by adding things like tougher bosses, stricter rules and a single save slot.</p>
<p>Of those half a mil, 4,647 players managed to beat Honour Mode with a Level 1 character. Meanwhile, 31,180 players beat Honour Mode as a Jack of All Trades.</p>

<p>Now, I play as a Barbarian in my own real world D&amp;D campaign, so I like this next stat because it speaks to my character (she's called Quinn). Larian has revealed 8.21 percent of players thought to use an enemy as an improvised weapon against another. These are my people!</p>
<p>350 players also respecced Minsc into a Death Domain Cleric, to which Larian asked: "Are you folks doing okay?"</p>
<p>Now, this stat is quite heartwarming. Apparently 598 players adopted a child with Wyll, which is cute.</p>

<p>"Crazy to think it's only been two years. It's truly been life changing," <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1952106606864253253">studio founder Swen Vincke wrote on social media yesterday</a>, celebrating Baldur's Gate 3's anniversary. "Probably worth writing about one day. But I can spoil the biggest takeaway. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">BG3 was what allowed us to do our next crazy thing</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-next-xbox-amd-zen-6-magnus-apu-11-cores-384-bit-memory-bus/">Magnus APU</a> rumored to be powering the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-codename-3nm-rdna-5-magnus-apu/">Xbox next-generation system </a>will provide, with its unique design, a lot of flexibility that will allow Microsoft to scale an entire stack of systems that are more likely to compete with pre-built PCs rather than the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-playstation-handheld-specs-leaked-rasterization-performance/">PlayStation 6</a> and other traditional consoles.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry went over the recently leaked Magnus APU said to power the next-generation Xbox, highlighting how different it is from the APUs powering the past and current generation PlayStation and Xbox consoles, not only in terms of size, but also in terms of design. Not only does this design, featuring separate CPU and GPU dies, steps away from the traditional monolithic design that balances power with costs, it will also be more powerful than anything we have seen so far, and supports a potential iterative approach to console design, giving Microsoft the ability to mix dies for more frequent upgrades than in traditional console cycles. This design could also be carried across multiple generations, falling in line with a "phases" approach, as opposed to the current "generations" approach, that Microsoft seems to be aiming for, considering recent developments.</p>



<p>Although the Xbox next-generation system's Magnus APU looks expensive, its flexibility will potentially also impact the gaming PC market, Digital Fundry speculates. From AMD's point of view, being able to ship an entire Xbox PC with this condensed, likely cheaper design could be huge, allowing them to gain a bigger share in the market and provide a cheaper alternative to pre-built PCs, which are far from being affordable. As such, there's a real possibility that the concept of the "console war" between Sony and Microsoft will change forever, as the Xbox next-generation systems will likely compete with pre-built gaming PCs, rather than the PlayStation 6.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>With Microsoft's current approach of turning everything into an Xbox, a design like that of the Magnus APU seems to fall almost perfectly in line with the company's current strategy. As the Xbox next-generation system is reportedly launching sooner than the PlayStation 6, it will likely not take much longer to know how the flexibility afforded by the APU will change the future of gaming systems.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Larian Studios is celebrating&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s second anniversary, and as part of those celebrations, the developer has released some fun statistics about the celebrated CRPG, including which of the game's cast is the most-respecced character and more.</p>

<p>As part of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s Community Update 35 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/538860954058754131" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Steam</a>, Larian reveals that the cleric Shadowheart is the game's most-respecced character, which, if you're new to CRPGs, means she's the one whose class or subclass players have changed the most.</p>

<p>According to Larian, Shadowheart was most often switched to either the Life Domain or Death Domain subclasses, so while players aren't changing her overall class, they're clearly split on which cleric path Shadowheart should follow. That makes sense, given her personal storyline.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-most-respecced-character-party.jpg?itok=l6VTBt82 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-most-respecced-character-party.jpg?itok=mx03uKYn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Shadowheart is&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s most-respecced character.</figcaption></figure><p>Wyll and Gael are in second and third place respectively, which, again, makes sense; I never quite found a place for Wyll in my party, so I turned him into a paladin, although that might fly in the face of the predicament in which he finds himself in the game.</p>

<p>Some other fun&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>stats include the 4,647 players who managed to beat the game's Honour Mode at level one, as well as the 350 players who decided that returning character Minsc would be better served as a Death Domain cleric. Hmm.</p>

<p>You can also see a bunch of fun photo mode creations that players have put together in the Steam post, as well as some info about what Larian is up to over the next few months (although that probably doesn't involve the studio announcing its next game, unfortunately).</p>




<p>The final major&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>update <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-major-baldurs-gate-3-update-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">was released back in April</a>, bringing features like a photo mode, crossplay between platforms, and cross-platform progression to allow you to continue your save across PC and console.</p>

An anti-reflective coating on the display also improves its contrast.

                <p>Epic has revealed a new Halo-inspired Fortnite collaboration. Only this time, the focus isn’t centered solely on Master Chief but on UNSC Spartans as a whole; players will be able to gain access to these colorful skins via Fortnite’s upcoming battle pass when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-battle-pass-theme-and-everything-else-we-know/1100-6533459/" data-ref-id="1100-6533459">Season 4</a> goes live on August 7.</p><p>Epic broke the news through the Fortnite X/Twitter page. There, the company informed fans of the upcoming battle pass as well as hint at a possible Power Ranger sighting; a fan asked if the rangers were making their debut, to which the account responded with a <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1951729012071338345?t=UfRgdXu5YSJwaWbO6gFNzQ&amp;s=19" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">few promising emojis</a>.</p><p>Of course, this isn’t the first time we’ve seen a Halo x Fortnite event. Master Chief joined Fortnite’s legacy series back in 2020--he was added to the shop during Chapter 2, Season 5 as a standalone or bundled purchase. Players could don his armor in two different colors, wield his gravity hammer pickaxe, float with the UNSC Pelican Glider, and even ride a mini warthog via a special emote.</p><p>This would be the first time players will get to play as the Power Rangers though. If the rumors/leaks are true--as suggested by popular Fortnite leaker <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1951721905293242855" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shiina</a>--we’d expect them to show up as a bonus that’s unlocked through specific quests or maybe as a high-tier achievement on the battle pass. Whatever the case, Fortnite fans seem to be in for an out-of-this-world treat come August 7.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As far as I can tell, the <em>Moby Dick</em> marathon is a thing simply for being a thing. There are a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/dec/08/moby-dick-reading-tradition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surprising number of gatherings</a> dedicated to getting through Herman Melville’s dense 1851 whaling classic in one uninterrupted go. You’re probably familiar with the outline of the book–“Call me Ishmael,” Ahab, the white whale<em>–</em>but might not know that the plot is actually the minority of its roughly 600 pages and 135 chapters, plus epilogue. If you know about the <em>rest</em> of it, you’re probably asking what my friends asked me when I told them I was going to a two-day <em>Moby Dick</em> marathon in Mystic, Connecticut: <em>why</em>?</p><p>My “why” is because I’m a sucker for anything that requires endurance. It’s because I used to go to the <a href="https://mysticseaport.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mystic Seaport Museum</a> as a kid and couldn’t pass up the chance to spend a night in its recreated historic village. It’s because Mystic’s marathon takes place on a tall ship called the <a href="https://mysticseaport.org/explore/morgan/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=13694668477&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACttEkICtto7sjYTgjSw1Wv0aboi_&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw7rbEBhB5EiwA1V49nT23UPgPqn9cQ5nrnsSYTEX12DlPTpCW96e66ynoCh_6a0xxCBJXQRoCp4EQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles W. Morgan</a>, America’s oldest still-floating commercial vessel and the last survivor of a 19th century American whaling fleet. I also went because, for much the same reasons Ishmael says he goes to sea in the book’s opening lines–"whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet"--the marathon sounded like the opposite of the way I spend most of my days camped out in front of my computer, pinned between the despairing onslaught of the news and the relentless pressure of running a business. I wanted to be with strangers I didn’t know from online, with a paper book before me; I wanted ropes and wood and water; I wanted to do something weird and silly and most likely miserable that was about as far from my daily life as I could get.</p><p>The 2025 marathon, which ran from July 31st to August 1st, was the Seaport’s 40th, making it the longest-running such event, though not as well-known as the most famous iteration in <a href="https://slate.com/life/2024/01/moby-dick-whale-book-ship-massachusetts-captain-ahab.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Bedford</a>. I imagined huge crowds, a ton of pomp and circumstance, an abundance of rules to keep attendees from wandering off into the museum grounds at night or falling into the river. I kept worrying at the Seaport’s ticket page in the week before, wondering if I should buy general entry in advance in case the museum’s sizable grounds sold out. But instead it was a small group, numbering less than 30 overnight with more during the day. Besides asking us to not eat onboard the Morgan, Seaport staff seemed to trust that anyone who showed up could take care of themselves and their temporary home. One regular participant said she felt like the Seaport doesn’t even really advertise the event; I’m not sure if that’s to keep it small since there’s only so much room, though the overnight reservations were capped at 100, or just how the Seaport operates.&nbsp;</p><p>After the event, organizer and Melville scholar <a href="https://english.uconn.edu/person/mary-k-bercaw-edwards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mary K. Bercaw Edwards</a> told me that when things started in <a href="https://myweb.uiowa.edu/ddowling/images/Dowling_CWW_intro.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1986</a>, they basically decided to do it in honor of Melville’s birthday and because Mystic had a whaling ship, eventually whittling the event down from a week (they were done with the book after three days, she said) to 25 hours. Organizer Jan Larson, inspired by <em>Ulysses</em> marathons, told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/08/02/thar-she-prose-a-moby-marathon/d0a2b733-cb39-4684-9d06-63f8c9bb06d9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Washington Post</a> in 1991 that she’d initially had trouble selling the event to the museum’s board: “a <em>Moby Dick</em> reading is not exactly something that's going to pull Mom and Pop and the kids off I-95. They thought it might actually turn people away."&nbsp;</p><hr><p>I spent a few years in my 20s living on a WW2 rescue boat turned ferry turned home for various queer punks and art weirdos. During the marathon I told several Seaport employees about the summer I called the Seaport’s <a href="https://mysticseaport.org/explore/henry-b-du-pont-preservation-shipyard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shipyard</a> for help when our boat sprung a leak, recreating the consternation on the other end of the line as I explained that no, I wasn’t in Mystic and no, the boat had no hope of getting there, ultimately admitting that I just needed to talk to anyone who wouldn’t hang up when I told them my boat was old and made of wood.&nbsp;</p><p>The employees I told this story to reacted with the same polite bafflement as those folks at the shipyard did back then, but it at least let me start a conversation with them about their own “why”s: what brought them to the Seaport, why they could recite maritime history or had strong opinions on sea shanties or knew how to row a whaleboat. Niche interests or careers in museums had brought them there, or they’d grown up going there like I had, or they just knew boats. Through the event, I admired the way employees were on hand to keep things running but also seemed happy to be part of it, maintaining the boundary between worker and attendee with professionalism without making me feel like it was my fault they were stuck so late at work, something I felt worried about because I’m me. At one point an employee showed us a spot where we could come and go from the event after hours, and they seemed unruffled when I joked that they shouldn’t give me the knowledge to basically sneak into one of my favorite childhood haunts at will.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>I was stunned by how many people at the marathon read to me as trans or queer. A trans guy <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kylelukoff.bsky.social/post/3lvdvuwn6p22f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">friend</a> attended the beginning with me, and we kept nudging each other to point out this or that person while hoping we didn’t seem like we were gawking. We wondered if they could tell we were trans too, joking that while two short bearded bald guys seemed like an unmissable indicator, especially when we opened our mouths to read from the book, maybe that doesn’t scream “trans” to younger people these days, when you don’t often see trans guys as deep into their transitions as us in media. At one point I awkwardly pressed myself into conversation with someone and, when they brought up their transition, eagerly revealed “I’m trans too,” only for them to nod and keep talking as if I’d interrupted to tell them the sky is blue. When I asked them “why are there so many trans people here?” in my most high-gossip tone, they just said that <em>Moby Dick</em> is a pretty gay book.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I was desperate to talk to anyone who looked the least bit trans or queer, but I felt like they weren’t as surprised to see me here the way I was surprised to see them. Over the course of the marathon I reflected on how maybe, for my friend and me, seeing so many trans people out in the everyday world is still a marvel and a rarity, where for folks decades younger, it might just be normal. Growing up in Connecticut, I didn’t know any queer people outside of the nascent internet; I was bullied by my peers and left to that bullying by teachers. (After I graduated high school, many of them wrote me to acknowledge my experience and explain how they could have been fired for their own identities, something I’m only slightly more sympathetic to today.) When I worked at a camp in my hometown the summer before I started testosterone, one little kid who clearly had gender stuff of their own once, when kids started arguing about whether I was a boy or a girl, solved the argument by brilliantly announcing “Duh, she’s a boy!” Through that summer I went out of my way to praise them to their mom, all while ignoring other parents who would look at me with disdain or call me “it” when they thought I couldn’t hear. Seeing so many trans people at the Seaport, I wondered what it would have been like to see them there when I was little, what would have told me there was a place for me in the world the way I hoped I had for that kid at camp.&nbsp;</p><p>It felt movingly full circle to spend time in a place that figured so big into my childhood with people who shared my identity, and it gave the event a communal feel that would come to sustain me from noon on Thursday to 1pm on Friday, when I hunkered down with all these folks to carry Melville’s entire wandering book from its start to its finish. When I’d forget my way around the museum in the dark, or couldn’t find a spot to get out of the rain, or when I’d get lost in a journeying sentence and needed someone to tell me where we were, it was beautiful to look up and have another trans person to guide me.</p><hr><p>The marathon began with a shockingly tall actor, later performing a play about Melville, reading the famed opening chapter on the deck of the Morgan. Attendees arranged ourselves wherever we could, from sheltered benches to the floor to against the masts. A sign-up sheet went around to pick a chapter to read yourself, and a large board with a magnet kept track of what chapter the group was on. Our read-aloud skills ran the gamut. I rushed and mumbled my way through Chapter 15, where Ishmael and Queequeg eat at the Try Pots. My friend, a kids’ book author and ex-librarian, loudly and legibly dispatched Chapter 18, where the pair sign up aboard the Pequod. One woman who read was utterly inaudible and had unfortunately picked a long chapter, which at least let us bond with some of our fellow attendees as we struggled politely to follow along. Someone who would read many times over the night did brilliant voices for inn-keeper Mrs. Hussey and paused to go “yikes” at one of the book’s many troubling, dated lines. I overheard some people jockeying and bargaining for their favorite chapters, while others, like me, just grabbed whatever was available.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>Since it was still museum hours, my friend and I took breaks to explore the Seaport. We missed a good chunk of the early reading, though I told myself it was OK because I’d read maybe a third of the book before. I ducked into one of the food shops minutes before it closed to cram down a sandwich; attendees were encouraged to bring their own food but had to keep it in their cars until the museum closed, and since I’d taken the train I’d come armed only with nuts and beef jerky in plastic bags.</p><p>Back on the Morgan, we alternated between reading along, listening, and getting to know the people around us. We fell in with two folks whom I later learned had just met that day by sitting next to each other; one of them was here for the fourth time and had stayed overnight twice in the past, though was spending the night in her bed in Mystic for this one. She and her husband, I learned later, had both been editors at a prominent running magazine (she told me I “looked like a marathoner” when I turned the subject to running, a thrilling compliment) who’d retired to the town. Along with some friends she’d adapted short versions of classic books, including <em>Moby Dick</em>, a copy of which she presented to the organizers at the end. During a break for people to get things from their cars, she told me, with what I read as the love of suffering of a distance runner, that there had never been breaks in the past. But I could understand the desire for it; it felt rude to wander in and out while people were reading, but it was also hard to sit quietly for that long, reading Melville’s winding prose, and the hard deck of the Morgan and the muggy weather didn’t make it much easier.&nbsp;</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>After my friend went home, with no excuse to leave the ship, I started to feel the gravity of the hours before me. I worried that my attention was too burned from the frenzy of social media to actually sit through the book; I call myself a reader but I struggle with books these days, and even sometimes have to watch something on my computer in the background to keep myself engaged. I put my phone on airplane mode, as much to keep myself from checking my email as to preserve its battery. I chastised myself when my mind wandered, though I also reminded myself that surely no one was going to spend the next 25 hours doing nothing but reading every word.</p><p>Here’s where the challenge of <em>Moby Dick</em> comes in: The actual plot is probably the thing the book spends the least pages on, with the majority of it taken up by basically whatever came into Melville’s head. When we got to the first of these parts, Chapter 32’s “Cetology” and its scientific efforts to catalogue different whales, a groaning cheer went up for the person who’d chosen to read. <a href="https://defector.com/a-year-in-pursuit-of-moby-dick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Defector</a> worries these chapters are “filler” and “pretentious,” though also writes that “what Melville achieves, what many of the best books achieve, is a consuming rhythm, an internal logic that makes it so almost any digression feels motivated, interesting, even important. Here is a novel that follows men trapped within the groove of a destructive and dying industry, one whose violence and cruelty is held up as one of the few remaining paths to glory.” The book is full of random-feeling plays and songs; there are long explanations of whales and parts of boats; there are stories about the Pequod’s crew or from passing ships that meander and circle and obscurely reference until if someone offered me a million dollars to say what was going on in them, I don’t think I could. Back in the spring I’d gone to an <a href="https://newyorkclassicalreview.com/2025/03/slow-to-get-under-sail-moby-dick-builds-to-powerful-impact-in-met-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opera</a> of <em>Moby Dick</em>, and during the reading I was glad I had; when I’d start to despair that we were lost on an ocean of meaninglessness, I could remind myself that no, really, there’s a novel in here somewhere.</p><p>It was, frankly, frequently boring. But that’s what I’d wanted; beyond the absurdity of the adventure of a book-reading marathon on a boat, I wanted to disconnect from all the noise in my head, wanted to see if I could just be here and do this, to look at what was in front of me. It felt not dissimilar to a whaling voyage; as Melville writes,</p><blockquote><p>In this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling accounts of common-places never delude you into unnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner–for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><hr><p>The museum closed at six, and with just marathon overnighters left, I realized I was <em>in it</em> now. I chatted with a Seaport employee I’d previously seen performing sea shanties, a <a href="https://anayiswright.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lifelong passion</a> of theirs. When I asked them if 2021’s sea shanty <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/music/features/sea-shanties-tiktok-history-the-longest-johns-b1789952.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boom</a> had been good for their career, they told me that actually the biggest effect they’d seen was from the soundtrack to Assassin’s Creed games, from which kids visiting the museum regularly make surprisingly obscure requests.</p><p>Night fell. Employees built little pockets of light from LED ship lanterns and lit a path to the bathroom building across the museum grounds. The cloudy skies turned to drizzles of cold rain, and I rued my last-minute choice to swap out my warm hoodie for a lighter one. I wrapped myself in my raincoat and the camping quilt I’d brought along, worried about the rest of the night if I was already chilly and damp. Meanwhile, the reading went on and on, people holding flashlights for each other and lighting up their books with their phones. I regretted not swapping out the batteries on the pocket flashlight I’d grabbed off the shelves of the hardware store before leaving town. As Ahab introduced his quest against Moby Dick in Chapter 36–“I’d strike the sun if it insulted me”--a hard wind rocked the Morgan in a moment that felt scripted.&nbsp;</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>But dramatic punctuations were few and far between–basically, it was just a little group of people reading an often-boring book in a growing rain. I started, legitimately, to panic. A flipside of the rut that drove me to the reading is that I’m pretty settled in my solitary ways, and I suddenly wondered if spending all night with strangers in what was basically some folks’ workplace wasn’t as up my alley as I’d thought. I became aware of the darker side of what had been my light-hearted quip about how I was basically stuck in the Seaport until 5pm the next day: There was nothing to be done if I got too hungry or too cold or needed a smoke or just didn’t want to be there anymore. I silently railed at Melville for writing such a long, boring book; I cursed all the weather apps for giving me <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/05/trump-administration-cuts-noaa-national-weather-service-forecasts-forecasting-less-accurate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conflicting forecasts</a>. I didn’t even <em>know</em> any of these people, and for a moment, even surrounded by other queer and trans folks, I felt stupidly alone.&nbsp;</p><p>I turned my internet back on to look up late night trains (none) or hotels (too expensive). I took an unnecessarily long walk to the bathroom. On the return I stood for a while looking down the deserted street of historic buildings that lined the water, trying to encourage myself with the fantasy of telling my childhood self they got to <em>sleep</em> here before remembering that I wouldn’t even be sleeping. I ducked into the shadows to take a couple surreptitious pulls on my vape, hating myself for breaking the rules against smoking on museum grounds but feeling both desperate and pathetic about needing to pull myself together.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>The rain started falling colder and more frequent; I anxiously counted the hours of how long it would be until I’d be back in New York in dry clothes. I was disappointed in myself for how quickly my big adventure felt like it had turned into the bad idea that caused my friends to react with horror when I first told them about it.&nbsp;</p><p>Around 10:30pm the reading paused for a performance of sea shanties by the employee I’d talked to before. I huddled close under a sheltered part of the Morgan, trying to take advantage of the reprieve in what was starting to feel like some racist dead cis guy's oppressive, self-indulgent book that I’ve never had strong feelings about anyway, trying to convince myself I hadn’t made some horrible mistake. I kept having to remind myself to <em>listen</em>. I prided myself on recognizing some of the songs they sang, accompanied by concertina and bones, and was excited to learn some new versions. I reminded myself again of what I’d come here for, pushing myself to just be in the moment instead of endlessly narrating the ways I felt somehow deficient for whatever task was ahead of me. I reminded myself that what I love about going on <a href="https://aftermath.site/failing-on-a-bike-trip-taught-me-too-much-about-myself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">big</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/high-wheel-bike-race-frederick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adventures</a> out in the world is the chance to meet other people and learn about their lives, to be in worlds different from my own. That’s happening <em>right now</em>, I growled, forcing my attention back to the music when my brain would start to gallop with some worry.</p><p>I was relieved when the organizers announced we were moving the reading inside the Morgan to get out of the weather. I navigated the narrow stairs down to the ship’s <a href="http://www.girlonawhaleship.org/jernapp/refCard.do?shortName=blubber_room" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blubber room</a>, a long squat compartment in which most everyone would bang their heads on the ceiling beams during the night, even me who was too short to reach them. It was warm down here, and well-lit, and knowing I wouldn’t be too cold or my flashlight wouldn’t die helped me chill out. I staked out a corner among some barrels, shamefully <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lvcos2ua4h23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> about it despite my vow to keep off the internet, and tried to arrange myself away from the rain burbling through the ceiling.&nbsp;</p><p>Once everyone was situated, the reading went on. I read Chapter 57, “Of Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in Stone; in Mountains; in Stars” (that’s what kind of book this is!). The chapter calls people "savages" with such frequency that I regretted not reading it through before picking it, though I got some sympathetic sounds when I groaned "good lord, Melville" at yet-another instance. Once my chapter was done, already tired though the clock was just reaching midnight, I settled down on my quilt for the middle watch.</p><hr><p>An email about the event details read that “For those who stay through the ‘middle watch’ (midnight to 4:00 a.m.) there will be a special whaling logbook stamp to commemorate the event.” I was curious what a logbook stamp was, and was also not above being bribed with goodies at this point. As an employee later said to me, this is the worst part of the night for a <em>Moby Dick</em> marathon. Beyond the fact that it’s far later than anyone should be awake <em>still </em>reading a dense classic, you’re what the employee called “deep in the book” now, hundreds of pages from the early chapters of meeting memorable characters and setting sail, but still hundreds and hundreds of pages from the Pequod’s crew finally spotting the white whale. There’s nothing before you but an open sea of what more often than not feels like bullshit, digressions into anything and everything and even stories that start with strong hooks wandering off into Melville’s ramblings. I have no doubt all of this is very rewarding to pore over and really come to grips with, but trying to digest it all for the first time when I was already exhausted from my early morning travels was a challenge.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>I built my stuff into a little nest among the barrels, using my raincoat as a levee against a growing puddle, and laid down to follow along. Eventually, I decided to nap for a chapter until the applause for a finished reader woke me, read along for a chapter, and then nap for another. These arrhythmic gulps of sleep were less restful than I expected, still believing I could stay up all night like I used to before I hit my 40s. I had to keep contorting myself into a narrowing strip of dry floor as the rain found new gaps in the ceiling. Meanwhile, <em>Moby Dick</em> just kept <em>going</em>, the pace of different people reading aloud far slower than my own reading speed and making me feel like we’d be trapped in it forever.</p><p>But through the course of the middle watch my experience changed. I’d later talk to attendees who also admitted they weren’t really able to <em>read</em> the book during the marathon and planned to read it again at home, but I eventually gave up on the idea of being studious and just let the night unfold. There became something lovely about waking up from a doze to find the book still going on without me, a handful of the most intrepid late-night readers calling out their chapters from wherever they were in the room, occasionally buoyed by staff taking a turn. I’d lift my open book from my stomach and slowly but inevitably figure out where we were from some unique phrase, then read along until the book would tip toward my face. I’d surface from sleep into someone murmuring about whales’ eyes or tails or spouts, into Pip falling overboard, into the endlessness of the Pequod’s crew processing blubber and meat and oil and spermaceti, into Ahab getting a new leg made for reasons I missed. Melville writes that “we account the whale immortal in his species, however perishable in his individuality,” and that’s how <em>Moby Dick</em> came to feel, knocking out chapters without even making a dent in the book. But it didn’t feel bad the way it did in my panic up on deck. It felt comforting, like I didn’t have to worry I’d miss anything or let anyone down. It felt like we were moving the book forward as a group, strangers carrying the moment for each other so we could all see it through together. It’s not a feeling I have often in my life these days, and it felt magical to find it in such weird circumstances, though I’m sure sleep deprivation gave it some of its weight.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>At 4am an employee announced we’d made it through the middle watch, to tired claps and cheers. They invited us to come get our stamp, and I tiptoed through sprawled bodies to find them. They pressed a little inked image of a whale adorned with the words “middle watch” onto the title page of my book. As I navigated back to my spot, the next reader began.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><hr><p>Around 5:30am I climbed above deck to find the sun starting to haze through the clouds. Despite the fact that water coming down on me inside had made any more sleep impossible, the air was hard and rainless, like the Morgan was making its own weather. I took a little walk through the crunching puddles of the shell-covered wharf, marvelling again at how it felt to be near the big ship at such an unusual hour. Below deck, the reading soldiered on, and I signed up to read another chapter. Around 7 I heard people sweeping the deck and preparing the Morgan for its regular day at the museum; at 8 we took a break for people to stow their stuff back in their cars and to move the rest of the reading to the Seaport’s <a href="https://mysticseaport.org/explore/village-old/meeting-house/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meeting house</a> so the ship could have visitors. Employees brought some coffee, a welcome alternative to my plan to make cold instant in my water bottle.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>Before the reading started again we had the opportunity to take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whaleboat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whaleboats</a> out on the water. I tend to think I’m too cool for such novelties or worry that I’m inconveniencing the people providing them, but I told myself to get over it because this was too special a chance to pass up. The sea-grizzled older man organizing things asked if anyone knew how to row, and when no one else in my group raised their hands I admitted I’d rowed some crew in college. I regretted this (I was, in the words of my coach, a “team builder,” though a shit rower) when the man put me in a key position at the front of the boat and told everyone to watch how I handled its nearly 20-foot wooden oar. But it came back to me quickly, and I did my best to follow our captain’s instructions and lead everyone in a row past the front of the Morgan into the river, where he proudly told us few people get to see the boat from this angle. He told us facts about whaleboats and how to handle them, then instructed us on how to turn around and row back. I peppered him with questions as we went–how did he know all of this, where had the Morgan sailed, what was it like to sail with it, why didn’t it sail anymore–that he politely but briskly answered. As it was surely intended to, the small boat against the size of the Morgan drove home the picture Melville paints, how frightening and flimsy whaling must have felt, with nothing but wood and metal and ropes between whalers, their quarry, and the sea.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><hr><p>Inside the meeting house, with people who hadn’t spent the night bringing new energy to the reading, the book moved along through the morning. I read Chapter 117, “The Whale Watch,” where Ahab is given prophecies about his death in such a casual way that I didn’t even realize that’s what they were until they came up again in later chapters. The back parts of the book finally return to having a plot, with the bulk of what most people know of <em>Moby Dick</em>–chasing the whale, the Pequod sinking, Ishmael becoming the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/it-repels-the-reader-tech-glitches-led-i-moby-dick-i-s-first-critics-to-pan-it/281499/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lone survivor</a>–happening in the last 50 or so pages. The writing becomes more focused and easier to follow, and everything rushes–as much as Melville can rush, anyway–to its conclusion.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pequod meets the Rachel, another whaling ship whose captain is searching for a missing crew that includes his own son; Ahab cruelly rejects the Rachel’s plea for help because its crew has seen Moby Dick. In Chapter 132, the person reading aloud cried as he recited Ahab’s speech realizing the consequences of his lifelong pursuit of the white whale:</p><blockquote><p>Forty years of continual whaling! forty years of privation, and peril, and storm-time! forty years on the pitiless sea! for forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land, for forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not spent three ashore. When I think of this life I have led; the desolation of solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a captain’s exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the green country without…</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Ahab and Starbuck have a conversation I remembered from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd244dHFjgQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opera</a>, in which Ahab movingly tells Starbuck “lower not when I do; when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick. That hazard shall not be thine. No, no! not with the faraway home I see in that eye!” Starbuck tries to convince Ahab to give up the chase and turn toward home, where they can both see their wives and children again. It’s a beautiful, tugging moment, especially when you know what’s coming. Reflecting on the sea weather, Starbuck nudges, “I think, sir, they have some such mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket,” to which Ahab replies</p><blockquote><p>They have, they have. I have seen them–some summer days in the morning. About this time–yes, it is [my son’s] noon nap now–the boy vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of cannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come back to dance him again.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>But just as soon as Ahab seems convinced, he falls back into feeling fated to hunt the whale,&nbsp;asking “Is Ahab, Ahab?” to a Starbuck who has already walked away in disgust or despair. Shortly after, the crew finally spots Moby Dick.</p><p>They chase the whale over three days. (“Ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them,” Melville writes.) Whaleboats are wrecked in the clash (“the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch”) and eventually the Pequod is irreparably damaged. In the final fight, Ahab is tangled in the ropes and is dragged off by Moby Dick, shouting his famous lines</p><blockquote><p>Toward thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit my last breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool! and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! <em>Thus</em>, I give up the spear!</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>The Pequod goes down beneath the waves, and the final line of the story chillingly reads that, after all the great drama of the Pequod’s journey and for all we’ve learned about its crew, “the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.” Together, all of us read the last line of Ishmael’s rescue, floating on a coffin in the abandoned sea, from the epilogue: ”It was the devious-cruising ‘Rachel,’ that in her retracing search after her missing children, only found another orphan.” The meeting house erupted in cheers and a standing ovation. The way the book swings back to plot felt incongruous with the cerebral, meandering journey we’d been on since yesterday, but the rush of emotion felt earned. Ahab might not have defeated Moby Dick, but we’d defeated the book.</p><hr><p>We took a celebratory group picture, and museum staff brought out a sheet cake for Melville’s birthday. Most people swiftly went home to go to sleep, but I was stuck at the Seaport for a few more hours before my train. I ate multiple pieces of cake, hoping the sugar would keep me awake. I asked museum staff more pestering questions that they answered before tactfully excusing themselves to go about their work days. I explored some exhibits I hadn’t visited yet before finally leaving the Seaport for good. In downtown Mystic, I wandered among crowds of vacationing tourists worried I was terrifying them with my dirty clothes and sleepless eyes, realized I was haunting creepily behind them at restaurant menus when I found myself too tired to navigate deciding whether to go inside for my first real food since the afternoon before. I’m not above admitting I had to hold back exhausted sobs when I found out my train was delayed, then running slowly, and it took hours longer than it should have to get back to my apartment in New York.&nbsp;</p><p>But after getting home and forcing myself to shower and (finally!) brush my teeth before crashing, I woke up Saturday morning to find myself drifting back to my copy of <em>Moby Dick</em>, now bristling with specially-made <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMNiUiEKIMq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bookmarks</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1109052117776911" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">placards</a> commemorating the event. Despite how long I’d just spent with the book, despite how much it had tormented and confused me, I didn’t feel done with it. I still wanted to be in its world, to read what I’d missed and understand what it is about <em>Moby Dick</em> that makes so many people decide to throw marathons for it. I opened it up to those familiar first pages, already knowing both the tortures and pleasures that awaited me, ready to take it all on again. &nbsp;</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-chris-plante-sandwich-post-games"><h3>You Have To Hear Chris Plante’s Sandwich Story</h3></a><p>"It’s somehow getting on us, but we’re so happy that we’re not gonna die"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-covid-lockdown-hideo-kojima"><h3>Death Stranding 2 Is A Joyful, Absurd Response To COVID</h3></a><p>Goofy, lighthearted, constantly mugging: Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is an exercise in spectacle, a rumination on lockdown, and one of the most human games Kojima has made in years</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-user-experience-ux-research"><h3>‘Dopamine Simply Doesn’t Work Like That’: An Interview With A User Experience Researcher</h3></a><p>'Part of the reason I have worked in games UXR and not, say, microwave UX, is that games can be designed to be hard'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/steam-itch-porn-censorship-collective-shout-visa-mastercard-paypal"><h3>Inside The Mass Call Campaign To Stop Video Game Censorship [Update]</h3></a><p>"This is a marathon, not a race," say organizers who plan to keep calling payment processors for months, if need be</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/moby-dick-marathon-mystic]]></content:encoded>
