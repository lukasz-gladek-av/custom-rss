            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are laptops you dream about but never actually buy because they sit in that untouchable price bracket reserved for professionals with corporate budgets. Normally retailing for $3,399, this Dell Inspiron 16″ laptop, 32 GB of DDR5 RAM, and a full terabyte of storage, is just that kind of aspirational machine.</p>
<p>But here’s where things take a very interesting turn for early Black Friday shoppers: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5179/">Amazon just dropped this powerhouse to $999, representing a staggering 71% discount</a> and marking an <strong>all-time low price</strong> for this configuration. This isn’t some refurbished model or a stripped-down version: you’re looking at a full-spec business laptop with Windows 11 Pro, and at this price point, it won’t last long before inventory disappears.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5179/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Dell built this “Inspiron 16” around an Intel Core 7 150U processor which <strong>packs in 10 cores and 12 threads that can smartly scale up to as high as 5.4 GHz</strong> based on your workload. That means this laptop changes its performance dynamically and give you serious processing power for video editing or data crunching while staying efficient for lighter tasks such as browsing or working on documents.</p>
<p>The accompanying <strong>32 GB of DDR5 RAM easily allows multiple demanding applications</strong> to run simultaneously without that frustrating lag in switching between Chrome tabs, Photoshop projects and Excel spreadsheets. That 1 TB PCIe NVMe SSD doesn’t just provide enormous storage capacity but also transfers at blazing speeds and allows your system to boot in just seconds and large files to move in near-instant timing.</p>



<h2>A Display That Improves Your Workday</h2>
<p>The <strong>16-inch FHD+ touchscreen deserves its own spotlight</strong> because Dell has made some smart choices here. The 1920×1200 resolution adopts a 16:10 aspect ratio instead of the traditional 16:9 and translates to more vertical screen real estate while navigating documents and web pages without needing to scroll so much. This display stays clearly visible even in well-lit offices or by the window with a brightness of 300 nits.</p>
<p>Dell has also integrated <em>ComfortView Plus</em> technology which reduces hazardous blue light emission without that weird yellow tint you get with cheaper filters; it makes those long sessions easier on your eyes. The <strong>touchscreen adds another layer of interaction</strong> that becomes surprisingly useful as soon as you get used to it, specifically when doing quick edits or getting through the touch-optimized interface of Windows 11.</p>



<p>The practical features extend to everyday usability, ways that make this much more than just another laptop but a real productivity machine. The full-size backlit keyboard includes a dedicated numeric keypad that anyone who works with numbers regularly will immediately appreciate. That ice blue backlighting isn’t for looks; it makes typing in dim environments or during evening work sessions significantly easier without eye strain. <strong>Windows 11 Pro brings enterprise-grade security features</strong>&nbsp;while the integrated fingerprint reader adds biometric protection that’s much safer and far more convenient than continuously punching in passwords.</p>
<p>Right now, you can essentially get flagship specifications at mid-range pricing since this is a laptop that usually sells for over three grand. Dell clearly priced it to move inventory fast ahead of Black Friday, and those kinds of early deals rarely stick around once word starts getting out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Have a participation trophy.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon Legends: Z-A is getting an update that will make rewards from Ranked Battles, specifically a desirable set of Mega Stones, much easier to obtain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an <a href="https://plza-news.pokemon-home.com/en/page/10.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official news post</a>, The Pokemon Company revealed that at the start of Season 2 of its online Ranked Battle mode, players will be able to receive Greninjite at Rank Y, and Delphoxite at Rank S. Previously, in Season 1, players had to achieve Rank K to receive Greninjite (Delphoxite was not yet available).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a pretty big deal, as the difficulty of obtaining these Mega Stones has been a point of criticism from the community ever since they were first announced as rewards. The trio of original Kalos starter Pokemon: Fennekin, Froakie, and Chespin, are available fairly early on in Pokemon Legends: Z-A, and all three of them have new Mega Evolutions. However, those Mega Evolutions can only be unlocked via the items obtained as rewards from online Ranked Battles, and aren't available in the story campaign at all. This was frustrating for many players, as plenty of people don't touch online play at all and would rather just play through the story only.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This update doesn't make it possible to obtain the rewards without engaging in the online component of Z-A, but it does make them much easier to obtain. With Season 2, you'll basically be able to get a Greninjite with a single Ranked Battle, even if you lose, as you can get rank points for actions taken in battle as well as actually winning. And you can move up multiple ranks in one go if you play well enough, making it pretty fast to go from Z to S for that Delphoxite. <em>And</em> it looks like Game Freak is updating how points are distributed to make it even easier to gain ranks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, if trends continue this way, it sounds like the Season 3 update will introduce Chesnaughtite at a similar rank to Rank S, and lower the rank requirement for Delphoxite to something even easier as well. Per the announcement, "Mega Stones will continue to be reissued frequently in future seasons."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, this is a pretty good change for folks wanting to collect all the Mega Stones. A couple of Ranked Battles in Season 2 and 3 will net you all three stones with very little effort, and then if you prefer you never have to play Ranked again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon Legends: Z-A's Season 2 starts on Wednesday, November 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">reviewed Pokemon Legends: Z-A and gave it an 8/10</a>, saying that it "finally feels like Game Freak hitting its stride in Pokemon’s 3D era, with a fun setting to explore, a well-written story, and a total battle system overhaul that works surprisingly well." The game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-legends-z-a-sells-58-million-in-launch-week-half-were-bought-for-nintendo-switch-2">sold almost six million copies</a> in its opening week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in 2020, Blaze Entertainment made a splash in the retro gaming market with the introduction of the cartridge-based<a href="https://evercade.co.uk/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <u>Evercade platform</u></a>. Ever since, the platform has grown to include a variety of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/evercade-exp-review"><u>handhelds</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/evercade-vs-review"><u>consoles</u></a>, and<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/evercade-alpha-bartop-arcade-review"> <u>bartop arcades</u></a>, along with more than 650 games across 78 – and counting – cartridges. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In late 2023, the company created the new brand<a href="https://www.hypermegatech.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <u>HyperMegaTech</u></a> to release a series of simpler GameBoy-like handhelds with built-in games, which also happen to accept Evercade cartridges. As with the growing number of other Evercade-compatible devices and cartridges, the Super Pocket series is already up to a half-dozen variations. Although the Super Pocket series may not have the best screen size and resolution, or the most ideal controls for every game, it's still a value-packed portable companion, filling a completely different market than a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-handheld-gaming-pc"><u>handheld gaming PC</u></a>. However, depending upon your gaming preferences, certain models may prove better values than others.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">HyperMegaTech Super Pocket Editions – Photos</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">HyperMegaTech Super Pocket – Design and Features</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Other than aesthetic themes and associated colorways, every Super Pocket edition features exactly the same hardware. The only other differentiator between models is the types and number of built-in games, which are themed to a specific publisher like Taito, Capcom, Atari, Technos, NeoGeo (SNK), or Data East. Sometimes limited editions will feature an additional cosmetic variation, like with the Atari Edition or NeoGeo Edition, with a woodgrain look for the former and MVS styling for the latter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a plug-and-play device, each Super Pocket package comes with the handheld, USB-C to USB-A charging cable, and quick start guide. You just need to charge, then power on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When first powering on, you are prompted to answer a few questions, including your language and preferred difficulty (Easy or Normal) across all included games. Naturally, these and other settings are available to change after the fact by pressing the Game Menu button and choosing Settings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At 3.07 x 4.92 x 0.98 inches and 0.36lbs, the Super Pocket is slightly smaller and lighter than the original Game Boy that clocked in at 3.5 x 5.8 x 1.3 inches. The sleeker body does support a slightly larger display at 2.8 inches (2cm larger than the Game Boy’s), although that's still rather small for modern handhelds.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/16-2025-08-08-18-23-54-1761686192508.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Super Pocket CapCom Edition</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The IPS screen has a resolution of 320x240, a 4:3 aspect ratio. Overall, the display is colorful with good brightness and viewing angles, although the small screen size and low resolution do mean loss of detail in some places, particularly with text or games that don't have a native 4:3 aspect ratio. While good close-up vision always helps when it comes to handheld displays, just keep in mind that certain games on the Super Pocket will not have an optimized viewing experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Display options include Original, Pixel Perfect, or Full Screen aspect ratios, as well as Shaders/Scanlines. Original aspect ratio ensures the original game's graphics are not stretched or distorted, but may result in black bars on the sides or top of the screen. Pixel Perfect aspect ratio maps the original pixels to a "perfect" square of pixels, but may result in an even smaller active display than Original. Full Screen aspect ratio stretches a game's image to fit the entire screen, which eliminates any black bars or dead space on the display, but also stretches or distorts in-game objects. Shaders/Scanlines include None, Subtle, or Strong, the latter two of which are meant to mimic how classic CRT displays processed pixel graphics. Subtle adds thin scanlines with minimal screen darkening, while Strong adds thick scanlines with more prominent screen darkening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Below the display is the Game Menu button, direction pad, front speaker, Select/Insert Credit button, Start Game button, and the A, B, X, and Y face buttons. Both the direction pad and face buttons use standard membranes, so they have a softer feel and no real click but are still responsive enough for most games.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/05-2025-07-28-16-40-17-1761686134420.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Super Pocket NeoGeo Edition</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Each Super Pocket comes with a blank dummy cartridge to protect the rear slot. Also on the rear of the unit is a volume control, and R1, L1, R2, and L2 buttons, the latter two of which are used to fast scroll in menus. Below the buttons is a rear speaker, which provides clear, distortion-free sound output even at maximum volume when combined with the front speaker, although you'll still want to use a good pair of wired headphones for the best possible audio. (Like other Evercade-compatible hardware, Bluetooth audio isn't supported.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the bottom of the Super Pocket is the USB-C charging port, power switch next to an indicator light that's blue when on, and 3.5mm headphone jack. Between the power switch and charging port is a charging indicator light, which shows red when charging and green when fully charged.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With its modest 3000mAh battery, you'll only get up to four hours or so of run time depending on play volume and game type. On the plus side, the battery does a tremendous job of holding a charge. I've gone many months without using some of my charged Super Pockets and they're still ready to play with 100% capacity when I do grab them again.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">HyperMegaTech Super Pocket – Built-in Game Options</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Blaze has a history of working around certain licensing restrictions on how certain games can be sold by building them into both their Evercade and HyperMegaTech hardware. While some of these restrictions have loosened of late – meaning, you're starting to see some previously built-in only games coming to cartridge – a product like the Super Pocket is still one of the more reliable ways to guarantee access to games not yet, or may never be, on an Evercade cartridge. You can read the full lineup that comes preloaded on each edition <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ctMo55yqSEHAIQYLdvQsK8iUXBtR5ck6ph6kzBxj_ak/edit?gid=0#gid=0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>in this sheet</u></a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/17-2025-08-03-22-30-50-1761686200301.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Super Pocket Data East Edition</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Each Super Pocket features the original games from their original platforms, so they're not scaled to or optimized for the display. This is not an issue for many of the games, but for some – especially arcade games with a vertical/portrait (aka TATE) display – the active area can be quite small unless you choose to purposely distort the image with the Full Screen aspect ratio option. Examples of portrait display arcade games include Kiki Kaikai on the Taito Edition Super Pocket and BurgerTime on the Data East Edition Super Pocket, the latter of which highlights how difficult it can also sometimes be to make out text. In general, though, there are always enough games, even on the 12-game Capcom Edition, that work just fine within the display's constraints. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/13-2025-08-03-21-20-06-1761686183151.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Super Pocket Taito Edition</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You also have to consider that the direction pad and four face buttons are not the best way to control every game. For example, Operation Wolf included on the Taito Edition is a light gun game in the arcade, so using the direction pad to drag the targeting cursor across the screen is less than ideal. Similarly, a game like Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting on the Capcom Edition is controlled with six buttons. Normally, this wouldn't be an issue, but the rear buttons on the Super Pocket are not ideally positioned to both hold the handheld and easily and consistently press those buttons, particularly in the heat of battle. Games that need four or fewer buttons, which is admittedly most of what's included, are not a problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the plus side, when you're in any game, you can press the Game Menu button to Save or Load your place in one of six slots, as well as reference the controls. You can also change the Display settings, reset the game, or quit back to the main menu.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/15-2025-08-03-21-23-56-1761686187712.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Super Pocket Atari Edition</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Between the six current editions, the Atari Edition features the most games at 50, and also the most games from (five!) different platforms. While some of the arcade games like Super Breakout or Crystal Castles<em> </em>have portrait displays or native controls that don't map well to a digital direction pad, for the most part, the other games work quite well on the Super Pocket thanks to the modest controls and resolutions of the original consoles and handheld. Of course, older arcade and 8-bit console games may have less appeal to some people than what's featured on something like the Capcom Edition Super Pocket, even with just 12 games. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/11-2025-08-03-21-18-39-1761686166675.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Super Pocket Technos Edition</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want a slightly newer mix of arcade and console games, the Technos Edition might be more for you, though it only features 15 games with a good amount of overlap. For a little better variety, the 18-game Data East Edition might be more desirable, although that also features a few games not particularly optimized for the display. Finally, there's the NeoGeo Edition with 14 games, but each are well-optimized for both the controls and display as the Super Pocket's setup closely matches what the MVS arcade machine offered, making it arguably the best choice if you can choose only one.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">HyperMegaTech Super Pocket – Cartridge Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The HyperMegaTech Super Pocket's ace in the hole is its cartridge slot, which provides access to hundreds of<a href="https://evercade.co.uk/cartridges/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <u>additional games from nearly every genre</u></a> across dozens of cartridges. There's some overlap, like with<a href="https://evercade.co.uk/cartridges/taito-arcade-1/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <u>Taito Arcade 1</u></a>, but in general, these games are only found outside of what's built into any of Blaze's hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every cartridge is compatible, but not every game included on them is optimized for the Super Pocket’s display or controls. They are, however, tuned or tunable for the mainline Evercade hardware; the<a href="https://evercade.co.uk/exp-r/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <u>Evercade EXP-R</u></a> handheld, for example, has an 800x400 resolution 4.3-inch IPS screen, and can also enter TATE mode to better display portrait-oriented arcade titles. The two pairs of shoulder buttons are also far easier to reach and press in the heat of action.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/18-2025-08-03-22-32-51-1761686202891.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Super Pocket NeoGeo Edition</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other functionality missing from the Super Pocket that the mainline Evercade hardware gets is online connectivity. That means that the Super Pockets don't get access to firmware updates or free games of the month, nor can they apply any updates to cartridges. On the rare chance a cartridge needs an update to run properly, it needs to be done on a mainline Evercade console, handheld, or bartop before it can be used in a Super Pocket.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In general, if you want the full Evercade experience, you're better off with the EXP-R handheld, the<a href="https://evercade.co.uk/vs-r/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <u>VS-R console</u></a>, or the Alpha bartop. Fortunately, this is not a zero-sum game as the Evercade platform is designed to expand as your wants and needs evolve. To put it another way, investing in one or more cartridges (and one or more pieces of hardware) allows you to play a particular game or games however you want. The Super Pocket, in mimicking the general Game Boy design, certainly has its appeal, as does its ability to simultaneously host both its internal games and a cartridge that can nearly double its available content on the go.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/hypermegatech-super-pocket-editions-review]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/garmin-clears-out-forerunner-255-now-selling-for-peanuts-in-early-black-friday-sale-2000640217</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/garmin-clears-out-forerunner-255-now-selling-for-peanuts-in-early-black-friday-sale.1339921/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Running requires commitment and you need a watch that keeps up with your training goals without draining your wallet or dying mid-marathon, and the <strong>Garmin Forerunner 255 delivers</strong> exactly that combo of reliability and performance. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5133/">dropped the price to just $279, down from the usual $349,</a> which makes this one of those rare moments where a premium running watch becomes accessible. The Forerunner 255 brings serious training tools that adapt to your performance, recover alongside you, and guide you through race preparation with the kind of intelligence previously reserved for much pricier models.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5133/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The battery life alone distinguishes this watch from the sea of devices that require charging every other day: You <strong>get 14 days of smartwatch use in between charges</strong>, which means you can spend more time training and less time looking for cables. That goes up to <strong>30 hours of continuous GPS tracking</strong> in GPS mode so ultra-runners and adventurers can take on the longest events without battery anxiety setting in.</p>
<h2>Your Body Knows When It Needs Rest</h2>
<p>Recovery drives performance just as much as hard training does, and the Forerunner 255 tracks that balance through HRV Status monitoring. Heart rate variability measurements happen automatically during sleep, analyzing how your body responds to training stress and daily life. The morning report consolidates everything into one snapshot when you wake up – your sleep quality, recovery status, and a personalized workout suggestion based on where you stand.</p>



<p>The fourth-generation Elevate optical heart rate sensor is more accurate than its predecessors, and reads directly from your wrist with fewer random spikes or dropouts. Multi-band GPS technology uses signals from multiple satellite frequencies to calculate your position with much better precision, particularly in demanding environments such as dense city blocks or forested trails. Tests showed this dual-frequency approach corrects signal bounce issues that plague standard GPS watches, keeping route maps accurate even when buildings or trees surround you. At <strong>49 grams for the 46mm version</strong> (39 grams for the smaller 41mm model), it’s light enough during a run that you tend to forget you’re even wearing it but with enough heft to feel durable.</p>
<p>Training plans change according to your real performance and do not follow a rigid schedule without considering how you feel: The Forerunner 255 offers personalized <strong>daily workout suggestions that adjust after each run</strong> based on your completion times, effort levels and recovery needs. Race predictions estimate your finish time for 5K, 10K, half-marathon and marathon distances by looking at your current fitness level, typical training paces and even weather conditions on race day.</p>



<p>The multisport profiles transform this from a running-only device to a triathlon companion. <strong>Swimming metrics include stroke detection and SWOLF scores for pool sessions</strong> while open water swimming tracks your path across lakes or ocean. Cycling profiles record power data when paired with compatible meters, and the watch automatically detects when you transition between sports during brick workouts or races. Water resistance extends to 5 ATM (50 meters) so showers, pool sessions, and rainy runs pose no threat to the electronics.</p>
<p>This is our favorite early Black Friday deal on a smartwatch, it might run out of stock very soon.</p>

If I have a chase card I'm after and I don't have packs to rip off-hand, I usually check out TCGPlayer for the best price and sort myself out that way. Considering booster boxes for any set are going near or over $200 right now, you'd be suprised at how much money you'll save over opening booster packs.

                <p>If you've decided to play <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> on PC, then you'll have access to a couple of menus in the settings that console players won't have. From the first time you launch the game, you can find and alter the keybinds and mouse settings menus, which, of course, both have a massive impact on your gameplay.</p><p>While you could leave the default options as they are and not customize any of the settings, that might put you at a disadvantage against other PC players with dialed-in settings. To ensure you're using the best keybinds and mouse settings in Arc Raiders, take a look at the guide below, which is just one of several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-tips-15-things-to-know-before-you-play/1100-6535635/" data-ref-id="1100-6535635">Arc Raiders tips</a> we recommend.</p><h2>Best keybinds in Arc Raiders</h2><p>Let's start with the keybinds, as this is one of the first menus you'll see after heading into the settings (it's labeled "Controls"). Unlike some other extraction games or multiplayer shooters, Arc Raiders keeps things fairly straightforward when it comes to your keybinds. There are only a few crucial keybinds that you'll want to change, but these can play a huge role in whether you live or die during a gunfight with an enemy.</p><p>Below, you can see all of the keybinds and our recommended settings for each one in Arc Raiders:</p><ul><li><strong>Move Forward</strong>: W</li><li><strong>Move Backward</strong>: S</li><li><strong>Move Left</strong>: A</li><li><strong>Move Right</strong>: D</li><li><strong>Fire / Throw / Display</strong>: Left Mouse Button</li><li><strong>Aim</strong>: Right Mouse Button</li><li><strong>Jump</strong>: Space Bar</li><li><strong>Sprint (Hold)</strong>: Left Shift</li><li><strong>Crouch (Hold)</strong>: Left Ctrl or C</li><li><strong>Crouch (Toggle)</strong>: Left Ctrl or C</li><li><strong>Dodge Roll</strong>: Mouse Button 4/5 or Left Alt if you have no mouse buttons</li><li><strong>Walk (Toggle)</strong>: V</li><li><strong>Interact</strong>: E or F (depending on preference)</li><li><strong>Reload Weapon</strong>: R</li><li><strong>Shoulder Swap</strong>: X</li><li><strong>Weapon 1</strong>: 1</li><li><strong>Weapon 2</strong>: 2</li><li><strong>Melee Weapon</strong>: 3</li><li><strong>Unarmed/Holster Weapon</strong>: 4</li><li><strong>Next Weapon</strong>: Mouse Wheel Up</li><li><strong>Previous Weapon</strong>: Mouse Wheel Down</li><li><strong>Items</strong>: Q</li><li><strong>Flashlight</strong>: E or F (depending on your Interact keybind)</li><li><strong>Access Inventory</strong>: Tab</li><li><strong>Map</strong>: M or Caps Lock</li><li><strong>Ping</strong>: Middle Mouse Button</li><li><strong>Emote</strong>: G</li><li><strong>Push to Talk</strong>: T</li><li><strong>Push to Talk (Proximity Chat)</strong>: B</li><li><strong>Ping Heard By/Emote Loudness</strong>: H</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594104-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.32.43.99.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594104" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594104-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.32.43.99.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594104"></a><figcaption>The keybinds menu in Arc Raiders</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594104-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.32.43.99.png"></figure><p>We didn't alter too many of the default keybinds in Arc Raiders, but we did offer you some choices with a few of those we did change. For example, the dodge roll mechanic works great if you have a mouse button on the side of your mouse, but Left Alt also works perfectly well. We also swapped the "unarmed" keybind to "4," as that's easier to remember given that you can bring out your other weapons with the previous three number keybinds.</p><h2>Best mouse settings in Arc Raiders</h2><p>Now, let's cover your mouse settings in Arc Raiders, which boil down to your sensitivity options. If you want to customize your mouse and sensitivity further, you should head into whatever mouse software you have installed on your PC. This allows you to fine-tune your DPI, disable mouse smoothing/acceleration, and set up hotkeys if you wish.</p><p>Below, you can see our recommended mouse settings in Arc Raiders:</p><ul><li><strong>Invert Vertical Look Input</strong>: Off</li><li><strong>Horizontal Sensitivity</strong>: 65-70</li><li><strong>Vertical Sensitivity</strong>: 50</li><li><strong>Zoom Sensitivity Multiplier</strong>: 75%</li><li><strong>Scoped Zoom Sensitivity Multiplier</strong>: 85%</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594103-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.36.29.43.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594103" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594103-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.36.29.43.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594103"></a><figcaption>The mouse settings in Arc Raiders</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594103-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.36.29.43.png"></figure><p>We decided to scale the horizontal sensitivity up by 15-20 from the default value. Having a higher horizontal sensitivity allows you to spin around faster if you're being shot by an enemy behind you, or maybe to catch the spider hurdling at you before your quick and sudden death.</p><p>Moving on, the Zoom Sensitivity Multiplier has been reduced by 25% to allow for more precise aiming, while the Scoped Zoom Sensitivity Multiplier has also been reduced, but not as drastically. You still want to be able to move relatively quickly while using a large scope, but you also don't want your sensitivity too fast so that you skip right over a target when aiming down sights.</p><p>Of course, these sensitivity values will likely need to be changed depending on your mouse's core DPI. You'll want to make sure you dial that in before trying to mess around with the mouse settings in Arc Raiders. If you already have your mouse DPI in a good spot, then try to use our sensitivity values as a baseline and work your way up or down from there.</p>

On November 11, some WoW players will be able to dive into the Midnight beta test.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a> is in its self-care era. At least, that was the major takeaway from a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2s-latest-update-had-too-many-issues-developer-admits/1100-6535407/">frank Q&amp;A</a> with the game's director Mikael Eriksson, where he discusses, among other things, a new schedule for patches that the team hopes will lighten Helldivers 2's technical debt.</p><p dir="ltr">The critically acclaimed live-service shooter, which tasks players with grouping up and tackling hordes of alien foes in overwhelmingly hostile environments, has fallen on especially hard times lately. Frequent updates to the game since its launch in February of 2024--including fixes, balancing patches, and content drops--has caused Helldivers 2 to suffer from balance and performance issues and settle into an unsteady ebb and flow.</p><p dir="ltr">This instability has only hurt the game's diehard playerbase, who have spent months now fighting against crashes, increasingly untenable performance issues, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-explains-why-the-game-takes-up-so-much-space-on-pc/1100-6535217/">growing file sizes</a> (at least, on PC) and more wonkiness than is generally acceptable of Helldivers 2's sometimes slapstick action.</p><p dir="ltr">As a result, Arrowhead Studios, the developer working on Helldivers 2, recently announced that it would be pumping the brakes on content updates and the game's planned roadmap for a while. The goal of the temporary hiatus is to give the team the ability to diagnose and work on Helldivers 2's multiple issues, which stem from the game's hazardous live environment, its developers nonstop cadence of content drops, and years of technical debt adding up.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAzmBlEFhYw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dAzmBlEFhYw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">To that end, Eriksson revealed that Arrowhead's plan moving forward is to deploy patches every two weeks for the next few months in order to reduce the number of critical bugs impeding players' ability to enjoy Helldivers 2. In the latest Q&amp;A, Eriksson cited the game's most recent patch as an example of what it intends, claiming that it fixed about 200 of Helldivers 2's bugs. Arrowhead hopes to keep hitting these patches before resuming with Helldivers 2's content roadmap around December.</p><p dir="ltr">Elsewhere, Eriksson was also probed about the game's tremendous file size on PC, where it sits above 140 GB. He claims that the team is aware of how "unacceptably large" this is and that the issue stems from the team optimizing for hardware that uses mechanical HDDs, mentioning that they introduce hurdles that the team overcomes by duplicating files.</p><p dir="ltr">Per Eriksson's comments, Arrowhead is working on ways to cut down the file size, including potentially finding ways to push updates to PCs that use one of these drives over the other, but it is currently still looking for the best possible answer to this problem.</p><p dir="ltr">The rest of the interview dives into more of Helldivers 2's issues including the potential causes of crashes, whether the game's anit-cheat could be responsible for bricking PCs, and justification for the studio's usage of the Stingray engine. It's a meaty and honest interview, even if Eriksson does sidestep some of the game's more pressing problems, like weapon balance.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>People online seem tired of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-crossover-skins-rick-morty-call-of-duty-1851786919">crossover skins and silly cosmetics</a> in games like <em>Call of Duty </em>and <em>Battlefield.</em> And now one of the lead devs behind online shooter <em>Arc Raiders</em> has promised that you won’t see Santa Claus or dinosaur outfits in the newly released live-service game.</p> <p>The latest big hit on Steam is multiplayer extraction shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879"><em>Arc Raiders</em></a>. It launched on October 30 on consoles and PC and <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-steam-ai-server-connection-error-launch-2000640110">quickly racked up over 200k concurrent players on Steam</a>. And being an online game in 2025 means offering up cosmetics for players to earn or purchase. <em>Arc Raiders</em> is no exception, selling players skins if they so desire. But this year has also marked a turning point online in regard to in-game cosmetics. Players seem less willing to put up with silly crossover skins and goofy cosmetics. This has led to a whole ongoing skin saga involving <em>Battlefield 6</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-goofy-skins-call-of-duty-nicki-minaj-2000614447">which has promised not to include those kinds of items</a>, and <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-skins-black-ops-7-blops-6-carry-over-battlefield-6-2000620379">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>,</em> which arguably <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912">started the backlash</a> we are seeing and has backpedaled on allowing silly skins from <em>BLOPS6</em> to move forward into the upcoming FPS. And now the design director for <em>Arc Raiders</em> has weighed in on the topic and claimed the team is “protective” of the shooter’s visual identity.</p>

 <p>“What I believe to be true is that we will maintain the current aesthetic that we have,” <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/skins-cosmetics-interview"><em>Arc Raiders</em> design director Virgil Watkins told <em>PCgamesN</em></a> when asked about silly skins. “[Cosmetics] will fit within our sensibilities of how these things look and fit within the world and inside the fiction.” And while the devs and artists at Embark want to provide players with “as much freedom as possible” to express themselves, there are limits.</p>

 <p>“I think it was said a little while ago in a meeting [that] we would never, say, make a Santa Claus outfit,” explained Watkins.</p> <p>“But we may make something that is of our own tone and our own aesthetic that evokes Santa Claus. That’s not even a statement that we will have a Santa Claus outfit, but I think that’s kind of the line you can draw. We’re pretty protective of making sure that anything that goes into the game fits within the visual identity, fits within the tone, fits within the setting. I think because so much of our game is strong around that element, it would be really unfortunate to upset that by injecting, I don’t know, a T-Rex costume running around suddenly – I don’t think the novelty is worth the trade.”</p>

  <p>Watkins’ answer highlights the problem of trying to walk the line between not disrupting your game’s visual identity while also still offering skins people are willing to buy. This is a problem <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-season-one-small-map-battle-royale-reactions-negative-review-ea-2000639948"><em>Battlefield 6</em> is facing right now as it enters its first season.</a> While many of the skins added to the game in the recent update look pretty realistic to me, many other players online are furious about all the colors. One skin even had its neon green toned down after players complained enough. While that might be seen as a victory for some, it leads to a strange situation where other players might not want to buy the game’s battle pass or spend money on new skins because they’re too boring or plain.</p> <p>Threading that needle is proving tricky for EA, will likely be challenging for <em>Black Ops 7</em>, and I suspect it will be a problem for<em> Arc Raiders,</em> too. <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-battlefield-6-skin-is-causing-community-meltdown-grounded-ea-2000638294">All it takes is one skin to be a bit too silly</a> or colorful, and suddenly, the community might turn on you and use your own words against you. Good luck to all devs working on live-service games in 2025. It sounds like a nightmare.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> can be played solo, but its unforgiving post-apocalyptic landscapes can be even more challenging when you're by yourself. Not only can the game's dangerous enemies put an end to you quickly, but groups of other raiders can be roaming the wasteland, ready to take you down and steal all of your loot. Having a good team can help ensure that you extract safely. But what if your friends don't play on the same hardware as you? Let's take a look at whether ARC Raiders offers cross-play and cross-progression.</p><h2>Does Arc Raiders have cross-play?</h2><p>If you're looking to play with friends on other platforms, you're in luck. <strong>Arc Raiders offers cross-play with every platform</strong>, allowing you to team up with your pals even when they're in a different ecosystem. To play together, simply add your friend's Embark ID in the Friends menu by selecting Add Friend. This ID will include four unique numbers at the end, so be sure to include those, too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4593137-arcraiders_16-9_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593137" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4593137-arcraiders_16-9_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593137"></a><figcaption>You can brave the conditions together using Arc Raiders cross-play.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4593137-arcraiders_16-9_04.jpg"></figure><p>Cross-play is enabled by default, meaning you won't need to turn on any additional settings when you're ready to team up. To disable crossplay, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Gameplay &gt; Cross-play</strong> and toggle it off. This will ensure you only play with players that are within your ecosystem. As such, you'll need to turn this back on again if you decide to play with friends on another platform.</p><p>Once you're ready to go on with your pals by your side, don't forget to take our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-tips-15-things-to-know-before-you-play/1100-6535635/" data-ref-id="1100-6535635">Arc Raiders tips</a>, too.</p><h2>Does Arc Raiders have cross-progression?</h2><p>There's more good news for those setting out into a post-apocalyptic Earth: <strong>ARC Raiders has full cross-progression support</strong>. This means that you can carry your progress across every platform. If you start on PS5, for instance, you'll be able to use the same save on PC or Xbox so long as you're signed into the same <a href="https://careers.embark-studios.com/connect/login" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Embark account</a>.</p><p>However, it's important to note that playing across different platforms will require you to purchase the game multiple times.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new set of campaign boxes is coming to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/conquest-last-argument-of-kings-core-box-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Conquest: The Last Argument of Kings</em></a>. Para Bellum Games' upcoming <em>Conquest Nepenthe Campaign</em> boxes will bring miniatures, new lore, and unique models for two major named characters.</p>

<h2>The Conquest Nepenthe Campaign Box Pre-Order Announcement</h2>

<p>The <em>Conquest Nepenthe Campaign</em> box set is made up of two packs. The first, according to a report <a href="https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/60906/new-conquest-campaign-box-two-player-set" rel="nofollow">by ICV2</a>, is a campaign box titled&nbsp;<span><i>Lore Campaign Pack – Crucible of Wills: Nepenthe Remembers.&nbsp;</i>This pack contains narrative campaign rules and alternate models for Frederik of Brandengrad and The Alchemist. The narrative centers around The Hundred Kingdoms against The Spire.</span></p>

The Nepenthe Campaign Two Player Deluxe Set contains parts of the campaign box and everything you need to start playing <em>Conquest</em>. This set contains the following:</span></p>

<ul><li><span>1 Special Fredrik Miniature</span></li>
	<li><span>1 Special Alchemist Miniature</span></li>
	<li><span>1 Nepenthe Collection Lore Booklet</span></li>
	<li><span>1 Nepenthe Remembers Campaign Rules Booklet</span></li>
	<li><span>1 Spires Hight Clone Executor</span></li>
	<li><span>24 Dual Kit Bound Clones</span></li>

	<li><span>1 Nepenthe Mini Poster</span></li>
	<li><span>1 Paper Map of the Land of Ea</span></li>
	<li><span>Welcome Guides and Quickstart Guides</span></li>
</ul><p>Both of the <em>Conquest Nepenthe Campaign</em> packs will release within one month of each other. The Campaign Pack is set to release in November 2025 and will be sold at an MSRP of $59.99. The Two-Player Deluxe set will be available in December 2025 at an MSRP of $299.99.</p>

<p>The latter, while pricier, is a cheaper alternative to buying and assembling an army piecemeal. The going price for everything included is more than $600. In that context, plus it coming out around the holiday season, might just bring curious minds into this game.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolutions-x-y-shaped-tahk0-2000640231</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/so-almost-all-of-pok%C3%A9mon%E2%80%99s-mega-evolutions-are-x-and-y-shaped-right.1339831/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Did you know that several of the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>Mega Evolutions in </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a> <span>have some element of the letters “X” or “Y” in their designs? It’s true! While they don’t literally look like the letters in most cases, some aspects of their designs resemble the names of the 3DS </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games they originally debuted in back in 2013. When one </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>pixel artist and commentator called TAHK0 pointed this out on </span><a href="https://x.com/TAHK0/status/1892649080213422279"><span>X</span></a><span>, he was bombarded with hateful responses. Where some people would retreat and try to ignore the harassment, TAHK0 instead made a two-and-a-half-hour-long video breaking down how almost every one of these superpowered transformations has some part of their design that is based on “X” and “Y.” If that’s not commitment, then I don’t know what is.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">it has been over 15 years and pokemon fans and fakemon artists have yet to catch on that pretty much all mega pokemon up to this point have been shaped like an x or a y</p> <p>will this continue to go unnoticed when new mega pokemon start becoming z shaped stay tuned</p> <p>— TAHK0 ☕️ (@TAHK0) <a href="https://twitter.com/TAHK0/status/1892649080213422279?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>In an interview with </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, TAHK0 says he didn’t expect this observation to be as controversial as it was, and that by the time he realized people were mad about it, he’d already spent some time joking with detractors.</span></p>

 <p><span>“It was just like any other throwaway half-joking over-exaggerated tweet I wrote after waking up, and I only realized things were going wrong after about an hour afterward when things started taking off,” he says. “I had thought after pointing it out, it would be clear to everyone, so I was originally replying with jokey answers since I thought they’d be in on it like an upside-down Mega Camerupt— But everyone was taking it very seriously and were very angry. That’s when I knew it was out of control.”</span></p> <div> <p>Welcome to Exp. Share, <em>Kotaku</em> ’s <em>Pokémon</em> column in which we dive deep to explore notable characters, urban legends, communities, and just plain weird quirks from throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> franchise.</p></div> <p><span>Several of the arguments, as TAHK0 points out in his video, seem to be rooted in the assumption that this design motif means that Pokémon must literally be shaped like an X or Y–think a letter puppet from </span><i><span>Sesame Street</span></i><span>–while others pointed to specific images of the Pokémon</span> <span>in question in which this quality is de-emphasized in an effort to “debunk” the theory, rather than looking at the Pokemon’s design as a whole. But TAHK0 is correct. Sometimes it’s best seen when viewing a Pokémon from the front, rather than the side as some artwork depicts them. In the video, TAHK0 points to the </span><a href="https://creativerevolution.io/aphantasia-a-blind-minds-eye/"><span>Aphantasia Test</span></a><span>, which illustrates how people’s abilities to imagine objects in their mind vary, and for some, looking at a piece of art which, out of necessity, depicts an object (or, in this case, a Pokémon) from a particular angle can make it difficult to envision how it looks from all angles, resulting in some of the disagreements people have had with this theory online. The key to a complete takedown is anticipating all the bad-faith arguments someone is going to make, as well as the honest misunderstandings some may have, and as someone who has less patience than he used to for people willfully misinterpreting the things I say, I gotta hand it to TAHK0 for addressing just about every argument in good spirits.</span></p>

 <p><span>The video goes through all the Mega Evolutions that were revealed prior to </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s launch, and also breaks down lore elements like how Mega Evolution originates from </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span> mascots Xerneas and Yveltal, who are distinctly and intentionally shaped like their respective letters. Some monsters, like Metagross with its four arms or Absol with the wings on its back, are very obviously shaped like an X or Y, while others, like Sableye, have a hidden element of their character design that references letters. Watching the video was fascinating for me, as someone who was largely willing to buy the theory, but hadn’t stopped to look at every Mega Evolution to verify. Some I hadn’t even considered caught me off guard.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>TAHK0 says he felt “discouraged” after the initial pushback, but as new Megas from the then-unreleased </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span> were revealed, like Mega Dragonite and Mega Malamar, which both have pretty noticeable Y silhouettes, he felt more emboldened that it wasn’t all, as some detractors said, a “giant coincidence.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“After the tweet left my audience, I remember addressing most arguments pretty early on, but it got such a viral reaction that I couldn’t keep up with answering everyone, and not everyone would see my responses to others, so then their responses started being about how I wasn’t responding to anything,” he says. “My own initial jokes were being taken seriously, so being light-hearted wasn’t the play, and any disagreement on my part was taken as me having my head up my own butt. So responding to every possible argument I could, while being light-hearted to make sure this time it was clear it’s not that serious, seemed like the only way I could ‘get out alive,’ so to speak. People were originally way more quick to believe a confident argument against me than anything I could respond with, which unfortunately is how the internet has worked for a long time now.”</span></p>

 <p><span>While TAHK0 was working on his feature-length response for his YouTube channel, perhaps the biggest piece of evidence in the Pokedex was revealed: Mega Raichu X and Y. These long-overdue Mega forms for the final stage of Pikachu’s evolutionary line are set to join </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>in the RPG’s </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC, and their very obvious “X” and “Y” silhouettes have essentially been the silver bullet for the whole discussion, and TAHK0 notes that the onslaught of jokes at his expense on unrelated posts and content have “vanished” overnight.</span></p>

  <p><span>“When Mega Raichu X and Y were announced, I remember being so excited while simultaneously so relieved with how obvious and clear they made [the X and Y shapes],” TAHK0 says. “If you go back and watch my reaction, I actually couldn’t form a sentence. It was a lot all at once after dealing with a not-so-good time for eight months. Also, Pikachu is my favorite Pokémon, so it was pretty fitting.”</span></p> <p><span>TAHK0 says his breakdown of every individual Mega Evolution has changed some minds, and that he sometimes gets a nice comment from randos saying they’re now “a believer.” Now that </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> is out and brought with it several new Mega Evolutions, it looks like Game Freak isn’t holding as tightly to the design motif, though Dragonite, Raichu, and others do keep that spirit alive. The game even goes out of its way to show that Mega Zygarde, one of the last Mega forms the player receives in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, has a distinct X, Y, and Z on the cannon it holds after it transforms. So if </span><i><span>X</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Y </span></i><span>set the stage for this design motif, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> is driving it home. Will these obvious examples be enough for those who are still digging their heels into the ground over it? Maybe not. But in the meantime, TAHK0 says he’s open to “non-threatening” discussion and disagreements. Especially with at least a few more Mega Evolutions still on the way when </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>launches.</span></p> <p><span>“Obviously, now I would prefer they stick to the letter theming, but I’m pretty indifferent,” he says. “I’m a big fan of creator’s intent, so [new Megas] could be whatever-themed and I would still be excited. Learning about their design and lore decisions is the fun part for me.”</span></p>

<p>- English voices have been added to some event scenes.<br>
- More Traveller's Tips (i.e. tutorials) have been added.<br>
- The Anti-Freeze Earrings and Asbestos Earrings have been added to the obtainable accessories in DRAGON QUEST I.<br>
- Some adjustments have been made to the "Tactics" AI and enemy behaviour AI.<br>
- Miscellaneous changes, minor bug fixes and stat adjustments, and performance optimisation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yeah, a little light, but some crucial additions — those accessories will likely come in handy in DQI. And we're happy that there's more English voice work too, as the dub here is excellent.</p>
<p>As a bit of a refresher, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_i_and_ii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> <em>is</em> available on Switch 1 and Switch 2, <em>but</em> there's no upgrade path. So if you buy the Switch 1 version, you're stuck with it. So, if you want the Switch 2 version (the physical of which is a Game-Key Card), make sure you buy the correct one.</p>
<p>That's been made a bit more complicated thanks to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dragon_quest_-_hd-2d_erdrick_trilogy_collection">DRAGON QUEST - HD-2D Erdrick Trilogy Collection</a>, also available on both consoles. This bundle includes the newly released I &amp; II Remake along with 2024's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">III HD-2D Remake</a>. Now, Dragon Quest III <em>doesn't</em> have a Switch 2 version, <em>but</em> it does have a free Switch 2 patch which adds some extra visual and performance options.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b21108a95d37b"><a title="Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake messages" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b21108a95d37b/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake-messages.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Messages from Yuji Horii and Masaaki Hayasaka celebrating the game's release. — <em>Image: <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1983549559948329272">Square Enix</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, basically, the Switch 1 bundle contains the Erdrick Trilogy all as their Switch 1 editions, and the Switch 2 bundle contains the Switch 1 version of Dragon Quest III and the Switch 2 version of Dragon Quest I &amp; II.</p>
<p>Oh, and one last warning: If you're planning on streaming the new duology, <a href="https://www.dragonquest.jp/guideline/dq1-2/hd2d/">Square Enix has advised</a> players to refrain from showing anything after rolling credits. At least for the first month.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-gamecube-nes-switch-online-2000640223</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/retro-games-are-coming-to-animal-crossing-new-horizons-but-you-have-to-pay-to-play-them.1339762/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo randomly announced a ton of new content coming <a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-update-free-2000640118">to <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> in a couple of months</a>. That includes new Nintendo crossover items you can purchase from Nook’s Cranny. These will apparently let you play some classic games like <em>Ice Climber</em>. It’s a neat nod to one of the coolest parts of the 2002 <em>Animal Crossing</em> on GameCube, except that this time around it’ll require a paid subscription to access. Boo!</p> <p>It was a neat surprise going about your business in <em>Animal Crossing</em> and randomly discovering a game like<em> Excitebike</em> for the NES. No, it wasn’t just for decoration. You could actually activate it and play Shigeru Miyamoto’s original 1984 racer <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gamecube+animal+crossing+emulator+kotaku&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;oq=gamecube+animal+crossing+emulator+kotaku&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQABiABDIICAIQABgWGB4yCAgDEAAYFhgeMggIBBAAGBYYHjIICAUQABgWGB4yCAgGEAAYFhgeMgoIBxAAGAoYFhgeMggICBAAGBYYHjIICAkQABgWGB7SAQg1OTk2ajBqNKgCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">via a fully-functioning in-game NES emulator</a>. A bunch of other classics were available to collect as well. Some, like <em>Punch-Out!!!</em>, were only available through special codes. Others, like <em>Ice Climber</em>, required special e-reader cards.</p>

 <p>Imagine winning a random raffle or shaking a tree and being blessed with a free copy of the original <em>Donkey Kong.</em>&nbsp;Back in 2002 there was both the novelty of playing one game within another game and the appetite for older games that weren’t otherwise backwards compatible on modern hardware. Maybe your mom buried the NES up in the attic or sold it to help buy the SNES. Maybe <em>Balloon Fight</em> got lost when the kid down the street never gave it back.</p>

 <p>I booted up <em>Animal Crossing</em> so many times&nbsp;<em>just</em> to go back and play <em>Punch-Out!!</em>, which even at the time felt strangely nostalgic (and also a pain on the GameCube controller).</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We can see the playable Super NES and Super Famicom games will be F-Zero and Panel de Pon, respectively <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AnimalCrossing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AnimalCrossing</a> <a href="https://t.co/mpmH0wQjsL">https://t.co/mpmH0wQjsL</a> <a href="https://t.co/vGBmTDbKcR">pic.twitter.com/vGBmTDbKcR</a></p> <p>— André (@AndreSegers) <a href="https://twitter.com/AndreSegers/status/1983926022752874971?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So it’s a rad idea to bring that feature back for <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, but a huge bummer that these games will only work with Switch Online where…you’ve already been able to go and play them for years. It doesn’t even sound like the full suite of NES classics will be injected into <em>Animal Crossing</em> when its free update arrives on January 15.</p>

 <p>Nintendo stresses you’ll only be able to play a “select classic game on each system,” and for the purposes of the trailer at least, it only confirms Famicom, NES, and Game Boy furniture pieces. So you’ll have access to the handheld version of <em>Dr. Mario</em>, but no word on if something like <em>Super Metroid</em> will be available with a possible SNES your Villager can buy from the Nook kids (some eagle-eyed fans <a href="https://x.com/AndreSegers/status/1983926022752874971">have spotted <em>F-Zero</em></a> in one brief moment from the trailer).</p> <p>Why not just make these games free for people who own <em>New Horizons</em>? I have no idea. Got to protect the value proposition of titles that came out over three decades ago and which Nintendo has sold multiple times before across half a dozen different platforms, I guess. Here’s to whichever poor kid accidentally buys <em>Ice Climber</em> in <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> next year and gets instructed to input their parents’ credit card information when they try to play it without a subscription.</p>

Both pretty big drops from those mammoth numbers last week, but as a reminder, these are only physical sales, and the Switch 2 version comes in a bundle too. So all things considered, It's doing solid.</p>
<p>There was simply no catching Pokémon this week, seeing as both versions sold a combined 267,840 units. But <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has remained steady in third place, with a further 35,176 copies sold this week. That means the Switch 2's launch title is just 35,000 copies shy of reaching the 2 million mark, at least in terms of physical sales in Japan. That's pretty darn good.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59gosukq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>In terms of other new releases on Nintendo consoles, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/once_upon_a_katamari">Once Upon a Katamari</a> has shifted a solid 17,289 units on Switch (and a further 4,596 on PS5) in its first week, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> comes in at seventh with 6,778 sales. Donkey Kong Bananza, however, has slipped out of the top ten for the first time since its release.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough of us for now — here's the top ten physical sales in Japan for the week of 20th to 26th October 2025.</p>

<hr>
<p>Obviously, with a drop in Pokémon sales comes a drop in Switch 2 sales — but it's still way out in front, selling 65,434 units to get ever closer to that 2.5 million figure. That attach rate for Mario Kart World is <em>nuts</em>.</p>
<p>The three Switch 1 SKUs shifted 25,109, with the OG model actually being outsold by all three PS5 models, though cumulative sales for Sony's current console sit much lower at 10,503 this week.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> out now, it'll be interesting to see those sales in next week's charts and see how that release affects things.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The third anniversary of Goddess of Victory: Nikke arrives in November, and today it launched its biggest in-game event yet that includes the culmination of the main “Rapture Queen” storyline and the largest-scale battles the game has seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don’t know about Goddess of Victory: Nikke, it’s a free-to-play third-person idle shooter from Korean developer Shift Up that’s available on Android, iOS, and PC. Downloaded more than 45 million times since its launch in November 2022, it has a roster of more than 160 “Nikke,” android soldiers who you take into battle in an effort to reclaim the overworld from a vicious race of aliens called Raptures who forced humanity to flee underground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That conflict comes to a head in this new story event, which will see players face off in a final battle against the evil Rapture Queen. But that’s just scratching the surface of what’s coming in the anniversary update. The other big addition is the new Surface Beta mode, which features large-scale simulation-style battles where you assemble Nikke squads, fight Raptures, collect resources, and capture strongholds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And, of course, it wouldn’t be a major update without new recruitable characters. New SSR characters Nayuta and Liberalio will be recruitable through the normal gacha system, while SSR Chime will be a free anniversary event character. Nayuta and Liberalio will take center stage in the new story content, with Nayuta rallying her Pioneer Squad against the Rapture Queen, who Liberalio reveres as a mother figure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The anniversary event adds a new gacha costume for Red Hood and pass costumes for Crown and Siren. Plus, it’s bringing back a re-run of the powerful Pilgrim characters, letting you choose one of Modernia, Dorothy, or Red Hood as your exclusive event pull. And there will be limited-time challenges like new boss fights, a new Union Raid, Solo Raid, and multiple minigames and events.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With the third anniversary fast approaching, we chatted with game director Yoo HyungSuk. He’s a 15-year veteran of the Korean gaming industry who started his career as a combat planner on MMORPGs. His previous work also includes being the director/planning director for games like Overhit and Lost Ark. He joined Shift Up in 2020, when he was named game director of Goddess of Victory: Nikke. We talked to him about the game’s successful three-year run, how the dev team approached the new anniversary content, their plans for the future, and more.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>According to your livestream, the new anniversary story content leads to what is a "final battle." Could you explain why such a storyline is being launched at this point?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Since launch, Nikke has had a considerable number of stories that are spread in all directions. We realized the need to slowly gather the stories that have branched out over the past three years into a single storyline, and the third anniversary is the starting point of this plan.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Nayuta, the featured character for the third anniversary update, is unique compared to previous Nikke characters. Can you talk about the concept behind the development of this character and the different abilities they have?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> All members of the Pioneer squad are based on classic JRPG parties. Snow White is the heavily armored knight and tanker. Scarlet is the agile swordswoman and DPS. Rapunzel is the priest who heals. That's how it works. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nayuta is the fourth member, so she was designated as the monk who supports. We didn't want her to be stronger than the other three members in combat, so we developed her to focus on utility, which led to the abilities she has now. Her main ability is using her clones to learn massive amounts of information. As a former D.E.E.P. member, she's also familiar with over-technology.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/29/nayuta-1761773266918.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>You’re also introducing a new gameplay mode called Surface Beta to launch alongside the third anniversary. Can you tell us more about it?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> As its name suggests, the Surface Beta content allows players to explore the biggest world in Nikke. To make the experience more immersive, we decided to adopt a simulation-style battle system instead of the existing shooting battle format. We incorporated fun elements across the expansive field, such as uncovering hidden areas and solving puzzles. Mainly, we want players to experience the battles against Lord-class Raptures. As Raptures have basic gimmick patterns based on the surface, it is important to choose the squads' locations wisely. We will also introduce even stronger bosses in the future, so stay tuned for more!</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Your dev team has consistently created new minigames throughout Nikke’s three-year run. What factors are usually considered when deciding what type of minigame to develop?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> In major events like this anniversary, minigames are not mini. Given how important this update is, we put more effort into the game mode, with this one featuring a never-before-seen genre with unique visuals and an impressive scale. It's a management simulation-style game where you restore Eden, which was destroyed for a mysterious reason.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/29/surface-beta-1-1761773387145.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Just the fact that we’re here celebrating the three-year anniversary shows how successful the game has been and how it’s maintained a connection with the community. What do you think are the reasons for that success?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> We think our Commanders enjoy unique content and stories that are different from other games. In this age of content overload, providing gameplay, visuals, and stories similar to other titles would be nothing short of boring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of our game have a deep understanding of our content and stories. Since we have to keep delivering excellent content and narratives without disappointing them, we really try to emphasize to the whole development team that they should truly love the game and then it's not just work. We will continue keeping this in mind and work harder to make our game better, so please stay tuned.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Since Nikke first launched, what have been the biggest difficulties you’ve run into and how did you overcome them?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> In the past three years, our biggest problem has been figuring out how to adapt to this fast-changing era and deciding what content and stories we should deliver to bring players for maximum fun. This issue has persisted for three years and will continue into the future. We are game developers, and fun is the core value of any game, so it's only right that we face this challenge and keep bringing more fun and new content to our players. So it's both a joyful and difficult journey.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>That’s an interesting perspective. Do you think needing to adapt to that change has helped keep the dev team engaged? I imagine it can sometimes be difficult working on the same game for years even after release, dealing with complacency or burnout. But do you think having those consistent challenges to overcome helps with that?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Yes, when we set endless goals it's indeed possible to encounter problems like job burnout. Like boxers, we need to constantly compete, prove our ability, and have strong mental resilience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is why, from the very beginning, we've emphasized to the development team that, rather than aiming for zero mistakes, what matters more is learning from the mistakes and growing. After adopting this mindset, we noticed that continuously setting goals actually helps improve the team's focus.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/29/queen-1761773303922.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>You’ve been able to collaborate with some big franchises, from Evangelion to Stellar Blade to Nier: Automata to the recent Resident Evil. What’s the process in deciding who to collaborate with?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Collaborations are decided through various discussions, but recently, we've focused on finding IPs that players who like Nikke will enjoy, even if they're not familiar with it. We designed the Resident Evil minigame with this perspective in mind, and we hope players are having fun with it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Nikke has also shown up at some surprising real-life events, like the San Diego Padres baseball game and on the Hudson River in New York. Will we see Nikke at other real-world events in the future?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Of course! Bringing multifaceted enjoyment that goes beyond the game to our Commanders makes us happy. In particular, seeing Rapi throw the first pitch at Petco Park in San Diego was especially an honor for us. We'll continue to do our best, so please keep watching us.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Speaking of the future, what does Shift Up have planned for Goddess of Victory: Nikke in 2026?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> In 2026, we will continue to work hard to give you fun experiences, both in-game and beyond. We're preparing various events and updates to surprise you, and we're ready to bring more special surprises for the 3.5 and fourth anniversaries. I'm already excited now. In 2026, we also plan to improve the quality of our operations to provide a more stable experience. Hope you all enjoy the game.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Since the third anniversary’s story is centered around the “final battle” theme, could you give us a hint about what comes next?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> We hope in 2026 our story could move on to the next stage. We plan to gather the countless stories we've told so far, converge them into one culminating point, and then move forward.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Nikke has built up quite a following of passionate fans around the world in its three years. As we celebrate the anniversary, is there anything you want to say to the players who’ve been on this journey with you?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> This year, we participated in the LA Anime Expo with Cosmograph and had the opportunity to talk to American players in person. Many of them expressed their gratitude, and some even shed tears of excitement upon meeting us. This left a lasting memory in my heart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"> For those of us who spend all day in the office, this opportunity to meet players in person is extremely invaluable. Being able to personally feel the love from fans is truly blissful. Although developing the game and providing live service is sometimes hard and exhausting, the support from players pushes us to overcome difficulties and pick ourselves back up over and over again, and come up with more exciting and fun events.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Goddess of Victory: Nikke is available to download for free on the game’s <a href="https://nikke-en.com/?pid=MKT&amp;af_click_lookback=517d&amp;c=NA2thANNI&amp;af_adset=PR&amp;af_ad=IGNarticle" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>official website</u></a>, or on the App Store or Google Play.
