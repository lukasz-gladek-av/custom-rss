            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-10-to-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s top ten time… kind of. We’ve got one final group of five, from ten down to six in our list, before we break things out and tackle the final bunch individually. But what games are going to be in this little group? Well, there’s a AAA selection here (if only through alliteration), and potentially a “quadruple-A” game that actually means it. But first, in at number 10…</p>
<h2>10 – Citizen Sleeper 2 Starward Vector</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW, PC – 31st January 2025</em></p>
<p>Sequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/04/citizen-sleeper-episode-purge-review/">one of the most acclaimed indie games of 2022</a>, Citizen Sleeper 2 looks to take the same approach to its tabletop RPG narrative stylings, giving you a set of tools with which to navigate its rich narrative. There’s an overhauled dice system, new skills and, most significantly, a ship and a crew that you can customise for each Cycle as you take on jobs within the star system.</p>
<p><iframe title="Citizen Sleeper 2 - Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3DdETwG_eyo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Still set in the Helion system, Citizen Sleeper 2 lets you hop into your ship, recruit a crew of characters to go with you and head out to explore the Belt, do jobs and get paid. You’re trying to escape your past, in which you fell under the control of a local criminal gang, rewriting your body’s code to do so, but introducing malfunctions to your system and having to run with a price on your head and no memories.</p>

<h2>9 – Avowed</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – 18th February 2025</em></p>
<p>Will you save the world or doom it? That’s the choice that runs through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avowed">Avowed</a>, as you gain more and more power on your journey as an envoy of the Aedyr Empire, tasked with investigating a spiritual plague that threatens the whole world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AYvTNAaXMUA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Avowed takes us back to the Living Lands, a mysterious islands in the fantasy world of Eora, which it shares with Obsidian’s previous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/29/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review/">Pillars of Eternity</a> games. However, where those games were both top-down CRPGs and part of the genre’s revival over the past decade, Avowed is shifting back to one of Obsidian’s areas of expertise: first person action RPG adventuring. Avowed is not a fully open world game, but has several large open areas that you can explore and, in that regard, it might be comparable to one of Obsidian’s other acclaimed hits, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/22/the-outer-worlds-review/">The Outer Worlds</a>.</p>
<p>Originally set for release at the end of 2024, Xbox decided to hold off on Avowed’s launch in a busy release window to try and find a little bit of breathing room in early 2025. That…. hasn’t necessarily worked out, but with more time to polish and the promise of a first party Xbox game, this is certainly one to watch.</p>
<h2>8 – Atomfall</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, PC – 27th March 2025</em></p>
<p>Oh sure, Chornobyl and Three Mile might the most infamous nuclear plant accidents in history, but we can do good old fashioned meltdown with the best of them in old Blighty. OK, so the Windscale Fire wasn’t a meltdown, but as it burned for several days, sprinkled nuclear material across the UK and to the continent, and was part of a government cover up, it’s pretty up there.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Atomfall - Release Date Trailer | Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_07x5LvQiA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But what were they covering up, <em>really</em>? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/atomfall">Atomfall</a> spins us off into an alternate version of events where the surrounding area was rapidly locked down, the locals kept in line and monitored by the military group Protocol, and advanced retro-futuristic technology the order of the day. Can you unpick the mystery?</p>
<p>It might look like a very English Fallout, but this is a rather different style of game, where scarcity of resources plays a big factor in pushing you to melee – you get to fight roving bands of bandits dressed like Morris dancers – and investigating the story will be a bigger part of the experience.</p>
<h2>7 – Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/09/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-20th-march-2025/">20th March 2025</a></em></p>
<p>Fans have been demanding an Assassin’s Creed set in Japan pretty much since 2007, and they’re finally going to get what they want with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> – even if it’s been embroiled in a disappointingly inevitable amount of internet discourse, thanks in no small part to featuring a black immigrant samurai as one of the two playable characters. That’s something that Ubisoft has at times struggled to communicate well with fans and gamers around the world.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: World Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zKua34QXhMA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes us back to 16th century Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama era, featuring a female ninja and a male samurai for its lead characters. That man is a historical character based off Yasuke, a man of African origin who was one of the rare immigrants to Japan and who served Oda Nobunaga. The female ninja is named Naoe from Iga Province, who is inducted into the local Assassin’s order to battle all those persky Templars. Their stories will be intertwined, letting you master complimentary playstyles as both characters have contrasting abilities – Naoe for stealth, Yasuke for direct combat. This will be a fresh take on the twin protagonists that we’ve seen on occasion through the Assassin’s Creed series.</p>
<h2>6 – GTA 6</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – Late 2025</em></p>
<p>It might almost seem sacrilegious for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">GTA 6</a> not to be topping our most wanted chart, and yet here we are. We’ve no doubt that, for the global gaming population, GTA 6 is set to be another defining cultural event, much like GTA 5 was back in 2013, but it’s not quite got our juices flowing the same way as the games that have made it into the top 5. Still, we’re as keen as anyone to see that second trailer…</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QdBZY2fkU-0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI takes us all back to Vice City for another crime story, featuring Lucia as the first female protagonist in the series, getting out of prison at the start of the game after a bit of “bad luck”. Revisiting Vice City, this is a modern day setting in the fictionalised state of Leonida, deeply influenced by the&nbsp;breadth of American culture in the South East of the country and Florida in particular.</p>
<p>Take Two has targeted the back end of 2025 for release, though given the scale and ambition of these games, we wouldn’t be surprised to see this slip to early 2026, sneaking into the same financial year.</p>
<p><em>We’ve rattled through out Most Wanted 2025 lists so far, but it’s time for a little break, I think. We’ll see you on Monday for #5 and round this out through next week.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencent-fights-against-its-designation-as-a-chinese-military-company-by-the-us-department-of-defense.1078824/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tencent-fights-against-its-designation-as-a-chinese-military-company-by-the-us-department-of-defense/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Chinese corporation Tencent has <a href="https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2025/01/07/ed277c23e9fe0fc870fb9f02350e7658.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it will fight its inclusion in the list of Chinese military companies <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-00070.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided by the US Department of Defense</a>. Earlier this week, the news caused a significant drop (around 10%) in the company's stock.</p>
<p>Tencent is seeking a negotiation with the US Department of Defense but may also initiate a lawsuit if it cannot reach an agreement. Here's the full official statement:</p>
<p><em>As the Company is neither a Chinese military company nor a military-civil fusion contributor to the Chinese defense industrial base, it believes that its inclusion in the CMC List is a mistake. Unlike other lists maintained by the U.S. Government for sanctions or export control measures, inclusion in the CMC List relates only to U.S. defense procurement, which does not affect the business of the Group.</em></p>
<p><em>The CMC List is also distinct from the Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex List (NS-CMIC List) maintained by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, and inclusion in the CMC List will not prohibit any persons (other than the Department of Defense) from business dealings with the Company, including transacting in the securities of the Company.</em></p>
<p><em>The Company intends to initiate a Reconsideration Process to correct this mistake. During the process, it will engage in discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense to resolve any misunderstanding, and if necessary, will undertake legal proceedings to remove the Company from the CMC List.</em></p>
<p>Tencent offers various online products and services in China, like the messaging apps Tencent QQ and WeChat, though it is perhaps best known in the Western world for its gaming division. For a while now, it's been the largest gaming publisher in the world by revenue, well ahead of Sony and Microsoft, although the latter has reduced the gap following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p>
<p>Tencent also invested heavily in game studios located outside China. It owns Riot Games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-offers-to-fully-acquire-funcom-scope-of-dune-survival-game-to-be-increased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Funcom</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-the-division-devs-create-sharkmob/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharkmob</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-to-buy-sumo-digital-for-919-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sumo Group</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-majority-grinding-gear-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grinding Gear Games</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-imminent-acquisition-leyou-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leyou</a> (owner of Athlon Games, Splash Damage, and Digital Extremes). It also holds majority stakes in <a href="https://wccftech.com/turtle-rock-studios-is-the-latest-studio-acquisition-made-by-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turtle Rock Studios</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-acquired-techland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Techland</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-becomes-a-majority-shareholder-at-rime-developer-tequila-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tequila Works</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dont-starve-mark-of-the-ninja-klei-entertainment-acquired-by-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Klei Entertainment</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-acquires-1c-entertainment-polish-group-to-be-rebranded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fulqrum Publishing</a> (previously known as 1C Entertainment), <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-acquires-wake-up-interactive-teases-new-multiplayer-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wake Up Interactive</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nightingale-inflexion-games-bought-tencent-spatialos-not-being-used/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inflexion Games</a>, 10 Chambers Collective, <a href="https://wccftech.com/yager-spec-ops-the-line-gets-strategic-minority-investment-by-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yager Development</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-purchased-36-percent-fatshark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fatshark</a>, Miniclip and Supercell, as well as minority stakes in Don't Nod, Shift Up, Epic Games, Bloober Team, Marvelous, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-gets-new-investments-by-sony-and-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FromSoftware</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-is-getting-a-e15-million-loan-from-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remedy</a>, Krafton, Kakao, Paradox Interactive, Frontier Developments, and Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Rumors about the potential acquisition of the latter company have <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-planning-ubisoft-buyout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intensified</a> lately. Just yesterday, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appointed</a> advisors to review potential sale options. A couple of years ago, Tencent reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-is-reportedly-shifting-its-ma-strategy-to-majority-deals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifted</a> its M&amp;A (mergers and acquisitions) strategy to majority deals only.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks.1078821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>There has been a flurry of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>-related news in recent days, but not from Nintendo itself. Now, the Mario maker has broken its silence on the week's reports.</p>
<p>During this week's CES trades show in Las Vegas, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">reportedly-accurate models of Nintendo's under-wraps Switch 2 were shown off</a> by accessories manufacturer Genki. Several images and videos of this model were subsequently shared across social media (as you can see below). At this time, it was also claimed that those who were willing to cough up the cash could also get access to an actual Switch 2 unit via the black market.</p>
<p>Nintendo has now issued a statement to Japanese newspaper <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250110-XHI3U6QWZ5CZ7IFGTGUGJUVH4A/">The Sankei Shimbun</a>, telling the world that those images and videos making the rounds are "not official".</p>

</figure>
<p>Here's the very to the point, translated statement from the article: "The images and videos, they are not official."</p>
<p>While this statement is fairly innocuous in a lot of ways, and not exactly surprising given we already knew it was not Nintendo itself showcasing the hardware, this marks the first acknowledgement by the company that these leaks are even happening at all.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nintendo has not actually said anything about the accuracy of the third-party Switch 2 model which has been shown.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>In addition to that mock Switch 2 model, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-switch-2-leaks-suggest-microsd-express-support-lack-of-switch-1-dock-compatibility">yesterday we had some further console leaks</a>. Purported retail listings for Switch 2 MicroSD Express cards started showing up. Meanwhile, another report suggested Nintendo's upcoming console won't be compatible with the Switch 1 dock. There were also some new murmurings over the Switch 2's optical sensor.</p><p>Nintendo will be sharing something official on its Switch successor soon enough, though. It previously confirmed we would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">receive a proper announcement before the close of the fiscal year</a>, which ends 31st March. What we do know for sure is that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">new console will be backwards compatible with Switch 1 games</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Bald headed assassin simulator Hitman: World of Assassination has amassed an impressive body count of 75 million players.
</p>
<p>
World of Assassination was originally launched in 2021 for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S under the name of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-3">Hitman 3</a>, and was then retitled two years later when content from the trilogy's other games was added in. 
</p>
<p>
Today, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> is celebrating the game's continued success. A million players logged on in December alone, the studio said, lured in by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitmans-next-elusive-target-is-jean-claude-the-splitter-van-damme">fresh mission starring 90s action hero Jean-Claude Van Damme</a>.

<p>
Many of those players will likely be people sampling the game via its Free Starter Pack option, which also currently lets you take down Van Damme as one of the game's limited-time Elusive Targets. 
</p>
<p>
Amusingly, IO says that only 40 percent of players who attempted to take down Van Damme have been successful at doing so. (The developer tracked the longest successful attempt at seven hours, with the shortest just 21 seconds.)
</p>
<p>
Van Damme disappears from the game as an Elusive Target at the end of this weekend, on Sunday 12th January, but you can buy permanent access to a mission featuring the star in a £4 DLC mission pack.
</p>
<p>
Behind the scenes, IO says it is working on more content for Hitman to release later this year - though there's no details yet on what. 
</p>
<p>
IO is also working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">its under-wraps James Bond 007 game</a> and a mysterious fantasy game project. Additionally, the company is now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-to-publish-former-rockstar-and-gta-producers-mysterious-blockbuster-mindseye">handling publishing duties for MindsEye</a>, the AAA game from former GTA producer Leslie Benzies.

            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sleeping-dogs">Sleeping Dogs</a> film adaptation, set to star Star Wars actor Donnie Yen, has been canned.</p>
<p>That's according to Yen himself, who confirmed the cancellation to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/action/506279/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-release-update">Polygon</a>.</p>
<p>"I spent a lot of time and did a lot of work with these producers, and I even invested some of my own money into obtaining the drafts and some of the rights," he said. "I waited for years. Years. And I really want to do it. I have all these visions in my head, and unfortunately... I don't know, you know how Hollywood goes, right? I spent many, many years on it. It was an unfortunate thing.</p>
<p>"Well, on to better things."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-donnie-yen-says-sleeping-dogs-movie-in-production">Yen confirmed the film was in development in February 2018</a>, but little has been heard since and no release date was given, so it's not particularly surprising to discover its cancellation.</p>
<p>Sleeping Dogs was a 2012-released open world game published by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, which was something of a GTA-style game set in Hong Kong but with martial arts combat and parkour.</p>
<p>Though received well by critics, it criminally remains a cult classic.</p>
<p>Still, a film starring and directed by Hong Kong filmmaker Yen would've been a natural fit. And the live-action reveal trailer above certainly hints at what we're missing.</p>
<p>Plenty of other film adaptations have been revealed recently. Sony confirmed earlier this week both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">Horizon Zero Dawn and Helldivers will be adapted to film</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-ghost-of-tsushima-gets-groundbreaking-anime-adaptation-on-crunchyroll">Ghost of Tsushima is also set to be adapted to an anime series</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-pc-require-psn-account/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been confirmed that The Last of Us Part II Remastered, scheduled to be released on PC in April, will require a PSN account to function, despite having no online features. This follows the trend established by many PlayStation-centric games that found their way to PC platforms in the last year or so, but it doesn’t make it any less irritating for players.</p>



<p>This disruptive inclusion means that The Last of Us Part II on PC won’t launch in the several countries where the PlayStation Network doesn’t operate, which is one of the chief issues at play.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-backlash-continued">Backlash Continued</h2>



<p>Last year, a sudden change brought this requirement into the Helldivers 2 universe, with players being prompted to link a PSN account to continue playing the game. It caused a monumental downfall for the game, with tens of thousands of negative reviews being cast against the title.</p>



<p>That situation was rectified, but Sony would go on to make it a base requirement for further ports, such as God of War Ragnarok and Horizon: Forbidden West.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-on-pc-will-require-a-psn-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> discovered the requirement after wishlists went live. The Last of Us Part II Remastered will hit PC platforms – such as Steam and Epic Games Stores – on April 3. Instead of a Last of Us Part III, players are once again being forced to satisfy themselves with the iterations that have been re-released so many times over the years.</p>



<p>The game will arrive just as the second season of the popular HBO live-action adaption is set to drop. It was recently confirmed – along with a new trailer – that The Last of Us season two will hit screens worldwide in April. While a date wasn’t stressed, it’s expected to coincide with the PC release of The Last of Us Part II.</p>



<p>Tactics.</p>

<p>Recently, a job listing surfaced for a ‘Project Senior Producer’ in Los Angeles, working at a new PlayStation studio in Los Angeles. In the listing, it’s explained that the office is part of a ‘newly established AAA studio based in Los Angeles, driven by a team of seasoned industry leaders’.</p>



<p>It’s expected that this is Jason Blundell’s studio, the legendary developer who departed Deviation Games in September 2022. It was mentioned in December 2023 that Blundell was set to lead a PlayStation studio, and later rumours suggested that he would be partnering with Bungie to produce a new action game in a sci-fi universe.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-rumours-galore">Rumours Galore</h2>



<p>In the job listing discovered on the PlayStation site and shared by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-has-a-new-studio-in-los-angeles-working-on-a-new-ip.1078485/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">users on Restera</a>, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are a newly established AAA studio based in Los Angeles, driven by a team of seasoned industry leaders and experienced game developers. </p>



<p>Our mission is to create the next groundbreaking AAA original IP while reimagining the development process with a lean and highly efficient approach.&nbsp;We’re&nbsp;seeking talented individuals who share our vision and are eager to join us on this journey.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/sonyinteractiveentertainmentglobal/jobs/5413216004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The listing</a> is all business and doesn’t mention anything to identify the game, nor does it confirm the name of the studio or who is leading it, but the strongest possibility is that it’s Jason Blundell’s studio.</p>



<p>Blundell boasts a stunning career that saw him march through high-profile roles at Treyarch during Call of Duty’s peak. He was instrumental in the success and popularity of the franchise’s Zombies ecosystem, but in February 2020, he departed the company to found Deviation Games.</p>



<p>Deviation would later be shut down before it could ship a single game.</p>



<p>It was <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-linkedin-ex-deviation-games-employees-set-up-a-new-studio-with-sony-led-by-jason-blundel-new-ip.868227/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rumoured a while ago</a> that former Deviation Games employees would be funnelled into a new Sony-backed studio with Jason Blundell at the helm, and this could be that claim brought to fruition.</p>



<p>What do you think about this? Do you have high hopes for Jason Blundell’s next project? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>It was just announced that HITMAN: World of Assassination has passed a unique threshold, securing 75 million players worldwide in just under a decade. In the words of IO Interactive, this has increased ‘its status as the most successful Hitman game of all time’. </p>



<p>In December 2024 alone, one million active players were recorded assuming control of Agent 47 and hunting down all manner of targets across a range of maps, missions, and modes. On December 12, Jean-Claude Van Damme was added to HITMAN: World of Assassination as a new and challenging elusive target.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-huge-numbers">Huge Numbers</h2>



<p>HITMAN: World of Assassination is a live-service title firmly rooted in the universe that debuted way back in 2000 with Hitman: Codename 47.</p>



<p>This decades-old franchise has maintained a solid following over the years, transitioning through the various gaming generations and touching everything from mobile to VR. It’s an industry staple and features an instantly recognisable protagonist and concept.</p>



<p>In a recent press release, IO Interactive explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Since its release, HITMAN World of Assassination has continued to introduce a vast array of live content, including new locations, contracts, seasonal events, and collaborations, expanding HITMAN’s narrative. </p>



<p>With 1 million active players in December 2024, HITMAN World of Assassination remains as popular as ever thanks to its constant additions and a dedicated community. With more content planned to come to HITMAN World of Assassination in 2025, players can continue to look forward to more and more hours of HITMAN to enjoy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The report explained just how challenging the most recent update was, which is an element that most Hitman fans appreciate. In their attempt to hunt down Jean-Claude Van Damme’s character, only 40% of players have been successful, and it took one player a whopping seven hours to complete the mission.</p>



<p>Have you managed to eliminate the latest elusive target? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p>HITMAN: World of Assassination is available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-fans-desperate-for-half-life-3-news-say-they-have-evidence-its-hidden-in-steams-back-end</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-fans-desperate-for-half-life-3-news-say-they-have-evidence-its-hidden-in-steams-back-end.1078770/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-fans-desperate-for-half-life-3-news-say-they-have-evidence-its-hidden-in-steams-back-end<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
As expectation grows of a new Half-Life game announcement, fans believe they can now see evidence of the project on Steam.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, let's address the obvious. Yes, the decades-long wait for Half-Life 3 has become something of a meme and all suggestion of its existence is to be treated with caution. That said, there's strong evidence that Valve is once again working on a major new Half-Life project of some kind, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">a trustworthy report last summer detailing datamined assets and code snippets</a> backing up a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam">leak from an actor</a> likely involved.
</p>
<p>
All signs point to something being afoot, and now Steam seems to show Valve has a second unreleased game lurking behind the scenes (as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-admits-deadlock-exists">Deadlock</a>, which is still listed as an 'upcoming release' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-croaks-down-on-deadlock-cheaters-by-letting-you-turn-them-into-frogs">despite being in beta</a>). 
</p>
<p>
A thread on the Valve <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/valve/comments/1hw5kx6/i_could_be_onto_nothing_here_but_is_this_new">reddit</a> has highlighted the recent change that now lists two games from the developer as 'upcoming', with some sleuthing work by fans using the Wayback Machine pointing to this change occuring sometime within December 2024.
</p>
<p>
Searching for Valve on Steam and filtering via upcoming releases and then specifically games does indeed list two projects - with only Deadlock visible.
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>A screenshot of Valve's upcoming games list on Steam. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer / Steam</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
It's unlikely this project is In the Valley of the Gods - the next game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a> developer Campo Santo that was put on indefinite hold. For starters, its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/687440/In_The_Valley_of_Gods/">Steam page</a> is publicly visible, and its developer and publisher are both listed as Campo Santo still rather than Valve.
</p>
<p>
A warning on the search page suggests that search results may exclude some products based on content or language preferences, but even with all filters disabled, Valve's second upcoming project does not appear. So, what gives?
</p>
<p>
This year will mark the fifth anniversary of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a>, Valve's most recent entry in its legendary shooter series that was designed specifically for VR. But Half-Life has certainly been on Valve's mind more recently than that. 
</p>
<p>In November, Valve made a big deal out of celebrating <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a>'s 20th anniversary, with a big update that added a director's commentary, a documentary, and packed in the game's two episodes of DLC. We even learned a bit more about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-2-just-got-a-special-20th-anniversary-update-with-a-new-documentary-commentary-and-more">why Valve never made Half-Life 2: Episode 3</a>, as well.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Aaron Callaway decided to beat the game without any weapons by relying only on emotes, including the Hadoken fireball popularized by Street Fighter's Ryu and Ken.</p><p>Callaway posted a video on YouTube that demonstrated how an emote-only Monster Hunter: World run works. He notes that the other two emotes used were Street Fighter's Shoryuken and Devil May Cry's guns. However, the Shoryuken drained too much stamina and the DmC emote wasn't ideal either. That's why Callaway came to rely on the Hadoken, even though it's also comparatively weak and can only dish out 13 points in damage at most.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFHmXH1YPig" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zFHmXH1YPig" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's one thing to say you've done something and another to show it.

Instead, players will have to wait for the launch of Monster Hunter Wilds on February 28 to see what has changed.</p>

            <p>
It's probably not a huge surprise to hear at this point, but Sony has confirmed The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered will - like numerous other single-player PlayStation games before it - require a PSN account in order to play when it launches for PC this April.
</p>
<p>
Sony, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">faced a major backlash last May</a> when it announced it would be making PSN accounts mandatory for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> on PC - a move that meant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">players in the 177 countries where PSN is unavailable</a> would no longer be able to play the game they'd purchase. Ultimately, the outcry was significant enough that Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">relented</a>, but that hasn't stopped it from implementing PSN requirements for an increasing number of PC ports since then.
</p>
<p>
It's a decision that's continued to draw criticism given the requirement - which was originally justified as being necessary for the "safety and security" of online play - is now being implemented across both multiplayer and single-player games. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, for instance, <em>does</em> have a multiplayer component, despite being a predominantly single-player title, while other PC releases requiring PSN - such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>, and Until Dawn - are purely single-player experiences.

<p>
And now The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered (as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-on-pc-will-require-a-psn-account/">spotted by VGC</a>) has joined the steadily expanding list of predominantly single-player PlayStation titles - online leaderboards <em>are</em> supported in its roguelike No Return mode - requiring a PSN log-in on PC.
</p><p>
For most, that requirement is probably little more than a somewhat irritating inconvenience. But for others - namely, those based in one of the aforementioned 117 regions where PSN is unavailable - it means The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered simply won't be purchasable on PC. And given Sony previously confirmed this month's PC port of the single-player <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> also requires a PSN account, it appears this is a path it's now determine to follow.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered launches for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531310/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_Remastered/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">Epic Games Store</a> on 3rd April, the same month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-trailer-teases-two-of-the-games-most-impactful-scenes">season two of HBO's acclaimed The Last of Us television series begins airing</a>. Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-tech-analysis">called the remaster</a> - which includes the likes of increased texture resolution, increased level-of-detail distances, and improved shadow quality - the "best way to play a genuine classic" when it arrived on PlayStation 5 last year.

<p>The list of Counter-Strike Major winners is filled with some of the biggest names ever to grace the professional stage. Not every player gets to lift the trophy at one of the most illustrious esports tournaments, so doing so puts you in legendary company.</p>



<p>As of the start of 2025, 21 Majors have been held. Here’s the full list of all the winners.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-counter-strike-major-winners">All Counter-Strike Major Winners</h2>



<p>The reigning Major champions are Team Spirit. The primarily Russian roster, spearheaded by 17-year-old undeniable AWP prodigy Danil “donk” Kryshkovets, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won the Perfect World Shanghai Major</a> to close out the 2024 season. It was the first Major victory for the organization and all its players.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Here are all the teams and players that have won a Counter-Strike Major, starting with the most recent:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Team</strong></td><td><strong>Major</strong></td><td><strong>Roster</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Team Spirit</td><td>Perfect World Shanghai 2024</td><td>chopper, donk, magixx, sh1ro, zontix</td></tr><tr><td>Natus Vincere</td><td>PGL Copenhagen 2024</td><td>Aleksib, b1t, iM, jL, w0nderful</td></tr><tr><td>Team Vitality</td><td>BLAST Paris 2023</td><td>apEX, dupreeh, Magisk, Spinx, ZywOo</td></tr><tr><td>Outsiders</td><td>IEM Rio 2022</td><td>fame, FL1T, Jame, n0rb3r7, Qikert</td></tr><tr><td>FaZe Clan</td><td>PGL Antwerp 2022</td><td>broky, karrigan, rain, ropz, Twistzz</td></tr><tr><td>Natus Vincere</td><td>PGL Stockholm 2021</td><td>b1t, Boombl4, electroNic, Perfecto, s1mple</td></tr><tr><td>Astralis</td><td>StarLadder Berlin 2019</td><td>dev1ce, dupreeh, gla1ve, Magisk, Xyp9x</td></tr><tr><td>Astralis</td><td>IEM Katowice 2019</td><td>dev1ce, dupreeh, gla1ve, Magisk, Xyp9x</td></tr><tr><td>Astralis</td><td>FACEIT London 2018</td><td>dev1ce, dupreeh, gla1ve, Magisk, Xyp9x</td></tr><tr><td>Cloud9</td><td>ELEAGUE Boston 2018</td><td>autimatic, RUSH, tarik, Skadoodle, Stewie2K</td></tr><tr><td>Gambit</td><td>PGL Krakow 2017</td><td>AdreN, Dosia, HObbit, mou, Zeus</td></tr><tr><td>Astralis</td><td>ELEAGUE Atlanta 2017</td><td>dev1ce, dupreeh, gla1ve, Kjaerbye, Xyp9x</td></tr><tr><td>SK Gaming</td><td>ESL One Cologne 2016</td><td>coldzera, FalleN, fer, fnx, TACO</td></tr><tr><td>Luminosity</td><td>MLG Columbus 2016</td><td>coldzera, FalleN, fer, fnx, TACO</td></tr><tr><td>Envy</td><td>DreamHack Cluj-Napoca 2015</td><td>apEX, Happy, kennyS, kioShiMa, NBK</td></tr><tr><td>Fnatic</td><td>ESL One Cologne 2015</td><td>flusha, JW, KRIMZ, olofmeister, pronax</td></tr><tr><td>Fnatic</td><td>ESL One Katowice 2015</td><td>flusha, JW, KRIMZ, olofmeister, pronax</td></tr><tr><td>Team LDLC</td><td>DreamHack Winter 2014</td><td>Happy, kioShiMa, NBK, shox, SmithZz</td></tr><tr><td>Ninjas in Pyjamas</td><td>ESL One Cologne 2014</td><td>f0rest, Fifflaren, friberg, GeT_RiGhT, Xizt</td></tr><tr><td>Virtus.pro</td><td>EMS One Katowice 2014</td><td>byali, NEO, pashaBiceps, Snax, TaZ</td></tr><tr><td>Fnatic</td><td>DreamHack Winter 2013</td><td>Devilwalk, flusha, JW, pronax, schneider</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-counter-strike-major-records">Counter-Strike Major Records</h2>



<p>The Astralis organization holds the record for the most Major wins as an organization with four. Notably though, the organization has struggled in recent years, and has failed to qualify for the past four Majors. Astralis has not reached the playoffs of a Major since winning StarLadder Berlin 2019.</p>



<p>Peter “dupreeh” Rasmussen has won the most Majors as an individual with five, having won four with Astralis and one with Vitality. Dupreeh is tied with Dan “apEX” Madesclaire and Finn “karrigan” Andersen in total Major appearances with 19. However, dupreeh has the sole distinction of having attended all 19 of the CS:GO Majors.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, the ongoing saga of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-review/1900-6416758/" data-ref-id="1900-6416758">Destiny 2</a> reached a new turning point with the release of Revenant Act 3. But the conclusion of that chapter means that players are getting new weapons and other improvements going forward.</p><p>Bungie has shared <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-01-09-25" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the details about Destiny 2's latest updates</a>, including a pair of legendary weapons. The first is called Red Tape, and it's a stasis scout rifle; while the second is a stasis rocket launcher named Heretic's Fervor. You can see both weapons in action in the new trailer below, as well as a glimpse of the new exotic mission, Kell's Fall.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pVboiodni8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-pVboiodni8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Completing Kell's Fall will give players access to yet another weapon: A powerful exotic shotgun called Slayer’s Fang. Players can also replay Kell's Fall to upgrade Slayer's Fang with up to four catalysts. Starting with the next episode debut, Heresy, on February 4, Destiny 2 will also increase the caps for Strange Coins to 199, while Osirian Ciphers and Nightfall Ciphers will be bumped from 10 to 30. Bungie has also invited players <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/fotl2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">to begin voting</a> for next fall's Festival of the Lost Armor. </p><p>Earlier this month, the original Destiny <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-destiny-game-gets-strange-update-for-new-years/1100-6528649/" data-ref-id="1100-6528649">got a holiday-themed update</a>, which surprised players since the focus has been on Destiny 2 for years. Late last year, players also discovered an exploit that gave them the Dawning Event Card Upgrade for free. Bungie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/players-who-found-a-destiny-2-exploit-can-keep-their-free-loot-says-bungie/1100-6528364/" data-ref-id="1100-6528364">was pretty cool about that</a> and allowed players to keep the upgrade even though it ordinarily costs $10.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-expansion-claws-of-awaji/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows First Expansion ‘Claws of Awaji’ has been revealed to contain over 10 hours of additional content.</p>



<p>The new information comes courtesy of the Assassin’s Creed Shadows <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>, which was updated after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s recent delay</a>. </p>



<p>As a part of the update, the new description reads, “Pre-purchase now to get a bonus mission and the upcoming Claws of Awaji expansion. Travel to a new region, get over 10 hours of additional content, and unlock a new weapon type, new skills, gear, and abilities.”</p>



<p>In addition to the Claws of Awaji, Insider Gaming also exclusively reported in October 2024 that Ubisoft is planning to release a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-assassins-creed-shadows-co-op-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op mode for Shadows</a> and is currently under the codename ‘League’.</p>



<p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/analysis-ubisoft-faces-its-most-challenging-year-in-its-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ANALYSIS: Ubisoft Faces Its Most Challenging Year in its History</a></strong></p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is now set to release on March 20, 2025, after an announcement from Marc-Alexis Côté said that the game needs a few additional weeks to implement changes based on feedback.</p>



<p>Speaking with sources, Côté’s statements reflect what is being handled internally, with staff saying that the delay is to ensure that the game is as polished as possible. </p>



<p>Last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows had its first delay to February 14, 2025</a>, after it was announced that the game needed further polish, with sources behind the scenes also revealing that the team needed additional time to improve the authenticity of the game to its setting.</p>



<p>As for media previews, which were set to take place next week, it seems like we’ll have to wait a little longer for those, too, as Ubisoft is set to update on the dates.</p>

Director Timo Tjahjanto was also approached to <a href="https://x.com/Timobros/status/1837930312476885040" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">direct</a>, giving this project a real pedigree for anyone who loves hardcore Asian action films.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, since about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/05/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-confirms-its-still-in-production">2018 </a>almost any mention of this movie disappeared. And now <a href="https://www.polygon.com/action/506279/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-release-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon </a>confirmed with Yen that this movie is no longer in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I spent a lot of time and did a lot of work with these producers, and I even invested some of my own money into obtaining the drafts and some of the rights," Yen tells Polygon. "I waited for years. years. And I really wanted to do it... And unfortunately... I don't know, you know how Hollywood goes, right?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yen calls it an "unfortunate thing," but says he's ready to move "on to better things."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sleeping Dogs was released back in 2012 and was developed by the now defunct United Front Games and published by Square Enix. The open world action game was effectively Grand Theft Auto in Hong Kong, with plenty of influences from Hong Kong crime cinema like Infernal Affairs and Hard Boiled. Starring undercover cop Wei Shen as he infiltrated the local Triad, Sleeping Dogs became something of a cult hit thanks to its mix of action, world design, and star-studded voice cast (including Emma Stone and Lucy Liu). The Definitive Edition received an 8.5 in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/08/sleeping-dogs-definitive-edition-review">review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately a sequel and planned spinoff, Triad Wars, never entered into production before United Front shut down, and now the movie adaptation joins the dormant game series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Luckily for fans of Yen, he's been keeping himself quite busy both at home and abroad. Alongside the action movie The Prosecutor, Yen was last seen stateside as the blind assassin Caine in John Wick: Chapter 4, and according to <a href="https://collider.com/john-wick-spinoff-donnie-yen-directing-caine/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a>, is in talks to star and direct a<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/john-wick-spinoff-film-centered-on-donnie-yens-caine-officially-in-the-works"> Caine spinoff movie.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It's the start of a new year, and if you're looking to ring it in with discounts on several games, then you can check out <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fdiamond-collection-build-your-own-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-control-ultimate-edition-on-pc-for-just-5-in-fanaticals-latest-bundle-deal%2F1100-6528716%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fanatical's January 2025 edition of its Diamond Collection bundle</a>. Like previous versions of this build-your-own-bundle deal, you'll choose from a list of games to build your very own bundle, and pricing depends on how many games you pick, with the price per code dropping the more you add. The bundle starts at three games for $15 ($5 per game), and scales up to five or more games for $23 ($4.60 per game), and at seven or games you'll only pay $4.50 per game. If you add all 16 possible games to your bundle, you'll only pay $72 total.</p><p>There are some great titles here like Control: Ultimate Edition. This paranormal-themed action adventure game melds third-person shooting with Metroidvania-style level design. It comes from Remedy, the same studio behind the Alan Wake series, which happens to share the same fictional universe with Control. In fact, some of the bonus content included in Control: Ultimate Edition ties into the recent Allan Wake II.</p><p>Another strong recommendation is Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night. The game is a spiritual successor to the 2D Castlevania games and is even directed by Koji Igarashi, who popularized the "Igavania" style of Castlevania games that started with Symphony of the Night. </p><p>Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 is also on offer and is a great choice if you're looking to scratch your itch for a Smash Bros-style fighting game. This one features plenty of iconic cartoon characters like SpongeBob SquarePants, Danny Phantom, and Jimmy Neutron, and the Ultimate Edition comes with a ton of extra content.</p><p>Plenty of other games are available in Fanatical's Diamond Collection for this month, including the open-world crime sandbox Saints Row: Gold Edition, the satirical alien planet exploration FPS Journey to the Savage Planet, multiplayer brawler TMNT Arcade: Wrath of the Mutants, and many more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-warhammer-40000-astra-militarum-army-box-features-death-korps-of-krieg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has revealed its latest <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> Astra Militarum army box. However, this newest army box does not showcase the army's usual mascot, the Cadians. Instead, as part of the tenth edition, the Death Korps of Krieg has the spotlight.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/rlzyczbw/death-korps-of-krieg-whats-in-the-new-army-box/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop showcased the Death Korps of Krieg units in the upcoming <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Astra Militarum army box.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-astra-militarum-krieg-artillery.jpg?itok=cdbFS_u8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-astra-militarum-krieg-artillery.jpg?itok=GaH5dNq4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The post covers the new datasheets for the new Krieg units, their Command Squads, Heavy Weapons, and Troopers. The key focus on the post was on the named unit, Lord Marshal Dreir, and the new Artillery Units.</p>

<p>Lord Marshal Dreir maintains the Krieg's sci-fi trappings of German WWI frontline infantry. He charges into battle on a Krieg steed called ES819 with a sabre drawn. He is so attached to this horse it has been brought back from the brink of death several times.</p>

<p>Dreir shares this diehard nature. Dreir is Tough To Kill with six wounds, a 4+ save, and a 4+ Invulnerable Save. In addition, his Leading the Charge ability gives melee attacks Devastating Wounds.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-astra-militarum-lord-marshall-dreir.jpg?itok=Y3tlZI13 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-astra-militarum-lord-marshall-dreir.jpg?itok=qJu6FoO1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>These abilities pair well with his Death Rider bodyguards. Their Screening The Line ability allows them to reposition when a unit advances or falls back within 9 inches of them. When used effectively, this can set up devastating countercharges.</p>

<p>His men believe he is actually immortal, and given the grievous injuries he can shrug off and the units he has felled, can you blame them for that?</p>

<p>Of course the Death Korps of Krieg wouldn't be iconic if they didn't have artillery. The new <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Astra Militarum army box has that in spades. Each team mans four massive cannons. Siege Cannons lobs D6 Strength 12 Rend -2 shells, great for blasting enemy units and artillery. The Multiple Rocket Launcher fires D6+3 Anti-Infantry+3 explosives, perfect for shredding ground units.</p>

<p>The <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Astra Militarum Krieg army box will be available for pre-order this Saturday.</p>

Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - the swashbuckling new instalment in Sega's long-running crime saga - is getting a New Game Plus as part of a free post-launch update.
</p>
<p>
Sega shared the news during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viAEO_cMqfU">15-minute Like a Dragon Direct showcase</a> focusing on the imminent Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. It marks a notable shift in strategy for the publisher, after last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> caused controversy among fans by making New Game Plus exclusive to its pricier Deluxe and Ultimate Editions.
</p>
<p>
Sega hasn't said much else about Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii's newly announced New Game Plus mode just yet, only that it'll arrives as part of a "post release patch" at some unspecified point following the game's launch on 21st February.

Elsewhere in today's Like a Dragon stream, developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio dove a little deeper into some of Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii's systems, offering a closer look at the likes of land and sea combat, ship customisation, crew building, side activities, and more.
</p><p>
Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii  - which charts the swashbuckling adventures of fan-favourite series regular Goro Majima after he wakes up with amnesia on the remote Rich Island - will be available for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on 21st February.
</p>
<p>
Alongside the £54.99 standard edition, Sega's releasing a £64.99 Deluxe Edition featuring the Legendary Pirate Crew Pack, Legendary Outfit Pack, Ship Customisation Pack, and Extra Karaoke &amp; CD Pack. There's also a physical Collector's Edition containing a selection of real-world gubbins, and all pre-orders receive the Ichiban Pirate Crew Set and Ichiban Special Outfit Set.

			<p>After choosing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2024-gaming-delivers-another-solid-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best games of 2024</a>, it's finally time to look forward. Most major fighting game franchises are not set to receive new entries in 2025, so it could very well be a bit of an off-year for the genre. Having said that, there are still some interesting releases in the schedule. Not only will beloved franchises from CAPCOM and SNK finally make their return, but Riot will also make its debut in the fighting game space with its League of Legends fighting game, which has the chance to shake up the fighting game scene considerably, especially if its free-to-play approach proves to be successful.</p>
<h2>FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves&nbsp;(April 21st - PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Fatal-Fury-City-of-the-Wolves-key-art.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Fatal Fury series is one that should need no introduction for real fighting game aficionados, having been, for quite a few years, one of the top 2D fighting game series besides Street Fighter. Despite its popularity, however, the series has been left dormant since the release of 1999's Garou: Mark of the Wolves, but the series' absence from the fighting games' main stage, however, is about to end with the release of FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves this year.</p>
<p>The new entry in the series, which will feature a total of 22 characters for its first season, including both familiar faces and newcomers, will evolve the series' mechanics further with the introduction of the REV system that will offer unique offensive and defensive options. Following in the footsteps of the latest entries in other franchises like the Street Fighter and Tekken series, FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves will also feature a simplified Smart Style control scheme that will let players perform special moves and combos using only single button presses and directional inputs. With the help of this new accessibility feature in place, there's no doubt that FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves will stand out as one of the most popular fighting games of 2025.</p>
<h2>2XKO (TBA 2025 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2XKO.png"></a></figure>

<p>Originally announced in 2019 as Project L, Riot Games' fighting game set in the League of Legends universe has the potential to revolutionize the fighting game scene. With a proven track record of creating compelling multiplayer experiences with lasting appeal, Riot now has the chance to demonstrate its expertise in a genre that has historically been challenging to master.</p>
<p>Even if we don't take Riot Games' multiplayer games expertise into account, 2XKO will have plenty to offer to fans of traditional 2D fighters. Developed by Radiant Entertainment, the studio founded by Tom and Tony Cannon, two respected figures in the fighting game community for having launched Evo and created the rollback netcode that powers the vast majority of modern fighting games' online features, there's little doubt that the strategic team play approach to the tag fighter formula made popular by the MARVEL vs. CAPCOM series, the simplified control scheme, the varied character roster which will feature some of the most popular League of Legends champions and the faithful recreation of their signature special moves will deliver one of the best fighting games of the year, if not of the entire generation.</p>
<h2>CAPCOM Fighting Collection 2 (2025 - PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Capcom-Fighting-Collection-2-Key-Art.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Last year, CAPCOM brought back the MARVEL vs CAPCOM series with a new collection, but the Japanese publisher is not yet done bringing back some of its most beloved franchises. This year will see the return of another series that has long been considered one of the benchmarks for 2D fighting games: the CAPCOM vs SNK franchise.</p>
<p>Besides including the two main entries in the franchise mentioned above, the CAPCOM Fighting Collection 2 will bring back other series that haven't seen a new entry in a very long time, such as the Power Stone and Rival Schools series. Rounding up this collection is the inclusion of Plasma Sword: Nightmare of Bilstein and CAPCOM Fighting Evolution, as well as rollback netcode support, which should breathe new life into these all-time classics. Hopefully, this won't be the last time we will hear and see more of them.</p>
<h2>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact (Summer 2025 - PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Hunter-x-Hunter-Nen-x-Impact-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Anyone who has had the pleasure of reading Hunter x Hunter or watching the anime knows how the series created by Toshihiro Nagoshi was ripe for a fighting game based on it. The wait has been long for such a game to be released, but it is finally almost over.</p>
<p>Despite not being part of CAPCOM's Versus series, Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact will feel familiar right from the get-go to fans of Tatsunoko vs. CAPCOM and Ultimate MARVEL vs. CAPCOM 3, as the game is being developed by the same studio, Eighting. The combination of mechanics lifted from these two games, such as assist attacks, Advancing Guard, the X-Factor-like temporary power-up called Overgear, and the character roster, which includes some if the most popular characters in the series, such as Gon, Killua, Kurapika, Leorio, Hisoka, Chrollo, Meruem, Kite and others, will make for an explosive fighting game that has the potential to appeal even to those who are not into Hunter x Hunter.</p>
<h2>BLEACH Rebirth of Souls (March 21 - PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Bleach-Rebirth-of-Souls-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Much like Dragon Ball, plenty of fighting games based on Tite Kubo's Bleach have been released on consoles in the past. None of them, however, managed to reach the high level of quality of games like Dragon Ball FighterZ and Dragon Ball Sparking! ZERO, but this is set to change this year with the release of BLEACH Rebirth of Souls.</p>
<p>The first proper game based on the series to hit PC promises to be an extremely faithful adaptation of the intense battles of the manga and anime show, as Ichigo, Rukia, and every other playable character will be able to decide the outcome of a battle with a single strike after building up enough power. With a combat system that will let players take advantage of 3D movement, take the fight into the air, and unleash all sorts of special techniques, BLEACH Rebirth of Souls shouldn't disappoint those eagerly anticipating a fighting game that can finally give justice to Tite Kubo's popular series.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/optic-assembles-halo-%E2%80%98super-squad%E2%80%99-for-2025-season.1078572/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/optic-halo-roster-2025-super-squad/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>OpTic Gaming has come out on social media with a revelation regarding its 2025 Halo Championship Series roster. In a massive shakeup, it was revealed that going into the new season, FormaL, Bound, Renegade, and Lqgend will be flying the banner of Team Green.</p>



<p>Last season was tough for OpTic, with the team failing to secure a single major win but landing in second place no fewer than five times. The team fell short of the trophy at every HCS Major and Halo World Champs.</p>



<p>Every loss except for one came at the hands of Spacestation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-year-new-optic">New Year, New OpTic</h2>



<p>OpTic’s social media post announcing the team was met with jubilation from fans:</p>



<figure><p>
https://twitter.com/OpTic/status/1877414903947854216
</p></figure>







<p>Some have already branded the team a ‘God Squad’, being as it is made up of some of the sharpest competitors in Halo esports today.</p>



<p>FormaL is an instantly recognisable force of nature, being one of just two esports pro players on Earth with world championship titles in <strong>two </strong>games. He has long been considered one of the best (if not <strong>the best</strong>) controller-based esports players ever seen.</p>



<p>Bound and Lqgend join OpTic Gaming from Spacestation – the very roster that wiped the floor with OpTic on so many occasions last year, which is ironic at best. Will the duo be able to start winning trophies for OpTic this season, rather than preventing victory at the last minute possible?</p>



<p>Finally, there’s Renegade, who joins OpTic Gaming from FaZe Clan, the only other team to pip OpTic to the post last season during an HCS Major.</p>



<p>These are some of the most storied, seasoned, and successful competitors in Halo esports. Could this be the year that OpTic Gaming lifts multiple trophies <strong>again</strong>? We’ll find out when the season starts.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlestate Games Has Extended The Flea Market Lockdown in Tarkov]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-flea-market-lockdown-extended/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlestate-games-has-extended-the-flea-market-lockdown-in-tarkov.1078566/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-flea-market-lockdown-extended/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has revealed on social media that it has been ‘actively monitoring community feedback’ in Escape from Tarkov, and as a result, it’ll be keeping the Flea Market locked down for a further five days. It was due to be unlocked <strong>now</strong> following December’s wipe, but it’ll now open up to all users on January 14.</p>



<p>This was seen by some as one of the most bizarre changes the developer has made in Escape from Tarkov. By locking down the Flea Market, BSG effectively put a stranglehold on the game’s peer-to-peer economy for a couple of weeks. Also, the studio made it impossible to use non-FIR items to upgrade the hideout, which was seen as another huge mistake.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-little-while-longer">A Little While Longer</h2>



<p>On social media, Battlestate Games wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are actively monitoring community feedback on Flea Market being locked and decided to extend the lock for 5 more days until January 14 3PM GMT / 10AM EST. </p>



<p>We would like to thank you on actively sharing the feedback and reporting the issues. We will continue working on technical fixes and balancing changes in the upcoming days.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans were quick to criticise the announcement, with many questioning which community the team was listening to, as ‘nobody wants this’. Even Pestily, the game’s biggest content creator, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I don’t mind either way but where exactly where was this community feedback taken from? This would of been a perfect opportunity to use the in game survey to get active players polled for thoughts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For the more skilful, talented players, having no Flea Market has added a deeper challenge to the game, but for casual players, it’s a bit more of a nightmare. Those who don’t have hours to while away on the game are left feeling choked. Many tend to rely on the Flea Market when they hit level 15 to build up their hideout, but that’s now impossible for two reasons.</p>



<p>Do you think this is a good change, or has Battlestate Games missed the mark here? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/evolving-monster-hunter-how-capcoms-belief-in-the-series-made-it-a-worldwide-hit-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Monster Hunter series first launched on PlayStation 2 in 2004 and has since won over many fans, evolving at a dizzying pace alongside new developments in hardware. While it may sound like a cliché to say that the whole world has been waiting for it, it's not an exaggeration to say that hunters from around the globe have eagerly awaited the next game in the series, Monster Hunter Wilds, releasing at last on February 28, 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gameplay loop that hunters imagine when they hear about Monster Hunter has remained the same throughout the series even after 20 years. Hunt gigantic monsters, strip them of materials, create equipment, then head back into the next hunt. At the same time, though, it seems rare for the game design of a series to so directly reflect the benefits brought about by advances in hardware. Monster Hunter: World, released in 2018, did away with the segmented maps that players were used to seeing in the series, instead allowing them to roam about a single stage without loading times. It also made many other changes, both big and small, but veteran players remained as passionate as ever, helping it to gain global popularity.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Gaining Confidence in Monster Hunter Via World</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The development team also continues to believe that the major turning point for the series in recent years was World, which did away with the fragmented map from previous titles. While Monster Hunter did already have lots of overseas fans, the proportion of them still wasn't very large compared to the Japanese fanbase. Wilds Director Yuya Tokuda has returned following his work on World, and he has the following to say about this phenomenon:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The gameplay loop for a game like Monster Hunter, where players repeatedly gather materials, is agricultural in nature,” he tells IGN. “Some people told me that they believed it would be hard for that to resonate with a global audience."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The development team also continues to believe that the major turning point for the series in recent years was Monster Hunter World.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of World's creation, the development team did know that the global market was full of shooters and competitive multiplayer games. Kaname Fujioka, who acted as Director starting with the first Monster Hunter and is now Executive Director and Art Director for Wilds, says this was a period when he thought about what makes Monster Hunter fun, focusing on what to do in order to bring the game to a wider audience.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Cooperative games weren't part of the mainstream at the time, making World a major challenge for us,” he says. “If multiplayer cooperative play wasn't going to be big to begin with, we would have to reconsider the very form that Monster Hunter takes. But we had absolute confidence about the kind of fun that Monster Hunter provides, and it possessed a history as a series that grew in Japan to become what it was. We never believed that a Japanese sensibility wouldn't be able to land overseas."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the world would surely understand the fun of Monster Hunter. Believing this, the development team decided not to fiddle with or change the central elements of the series, instead keeping the core of what makes it fun intact while trying to convey that enjoyment to a broader range of players. The development team then performed a thorough analysis of what makes Monster Hunter fun in order to do that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The change in the development team's environment must have also largely contributed to World's success. Ryozo Tsujimoto, long-time producer for the Monster Hunter series, tells IGN, "I think you can also credit the fact that it became easier to communicate with foreign fans starting with World. During World's development we developed a strong habit of looking into feedback that we received from overseas, investigating where the issues lay. By digesting what players tell us, regardless of where they're located, we're able to really think about what we're communicating and what's difficult to get across. I believe that this change of environment helped play a major role in changing our own awareness."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">World gained the support of many players as a result, successfully gaining global popularity. Tokuda says that after seeing the reaction to World, he gained a redoubled confidence in the fundamental kind of fun found within the Monster Hunter games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Thanks to World, we were able to reaffirm that we hadn't made any mistakes with the core elements of Monster Hunter, giving us confidence once more,” says Tokuda. “It's because of our experience with World that we've been able to feel assured as we take the next step with Wilds, further improving its core while creating an even more attractive game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The development team never bent, always believing in Monster Hunter's charm and the elements at the center of what makes it fun. They began developing Wilds with the success of World driving them forward once updates for World reached a pause. They say the team's mission at first was primarily to test out the available technology with a small team. Producer Tsujimoto tells us about those times.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We predicted that the platforms for the game would be more powerful by the time it was released (with new-generation consoles having come in), and so our mission was to depict the world of Monster Hunter with the technology that would be available at that point in time," he explains.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We've always pictured game design that allows players to immerse themselves in hunts as hunters entering inside of Monster Hunter's carefully depicted ecosystems."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What would be possible on new-generation platforms while still making use of their output from World? How could they use the possibilities opened up by new-generation consoles to further evolve the series? Fujioka makes repeated use of a key term when it comes to this: "immersion".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Throughout the Monster Hunter series, we've always pictured game design that allows players to immerse themselves in hunts as hunters entering inside of Monster Hunter's carefully depicted ecosystems,” he says. “Players bought into that sensation to some degree in World, and we tried to take it even further in Wilds."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Through repeated technical verifications, it became clear that the team would be able to realize the image they've long held for Monster Hunter. Seamless map design, and an environment that changes with the passing of time. All of this would allow for an even deeper depiction of the ecosystem inhabited by massive monsters and the hunters who hunt them, generating further immersion. Depicting the world of Monster Hunter that has existed from the start of the series in greater depth and detail could allow for the surfacing of an ecosystem that includes the presence of humans in Wilds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's nature's two faces of being bountiful yet harsh,” says Tokuda, explaining the world of Wilds. “By depicting these two sides, we hoped to create a world that includes those who live in and become involved with it, like the hunters."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Creating Dramatic Moments for All Hunters</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While Wilds retains the traditional gameplay loop of accepting a quest and going to hunt the relevant monster, Tokuda says that hunters will now need to be aware of what monsters have spawned in the world, hunting them at their discretion based on the state of these monsters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As an example, he explains one possible situation. You're after materials in order to craft a piece of equipment, and so you're sprinting through the Windward Plains on your Seikret. Just then, beyond a cloud of sand, you see a large monster that you aren't currently targeting. It's got several wounds, as it's likely already fought a number of other monsters. It's not as if you need its materials at this very moment, but the rewards would be vast. After a moment of hesitation, you turn back and go after the wounded monster. Hunters need the ability to adapt to their circumstances, and Wilds provides a world where players can experience just that.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">IGN First Monster Hunter Wilds Oilwell Basin Artwork</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The design (in past Monster Hunter games) where you participate in one quest at a time does provide the benefit of a game that you can always play in a stable environment, but you can't help but feel this to be unnatural in ways for a game that depicts ecosystems in the wild,” says Tokuda. “It seems like a given that you'd face different monsters and winds from one day to the next, considering that nature-focused perspective."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scenes before your eyes will change from moment to moment, creating dramatic experiences and giving hunters a sense of immersion as though they're really alive in the game's world. As easy as that is to say, it's by no means simple to realize it in a gaming setting. "There are only a few dramatic scenes and events you get to encounter and experience in everyday life over the course of a year," Fujioka says. Rather than simply constructing a world, we ask what kinds of scenes he wants playing out in front of hunters and his philosophy on creating a game that anticipates these kinds of experiences.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"You may only be able to see an evening's beauty for a few dozen minutes over the course of a day, but those moments leave an incredible impression on you,” he replies. “The team has constantly shared an awareness of how important it is to have these kinds of dramatic moments and experiences properly playing out before you in a game while also making sure that they don't appear unnatural. There's the risk of 'nothing happening' to a player within a large open world or with changes in circumstances like seamless shifts in weather. We discussed this concern many times during development, and I was quite aware as a designer to be compacting and connecting what we can do to make things more fun, creating dramatic twists that constantly play out before you."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The developers never thought of themselves as making an open-world game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What's important isn't the form that the game takes, but the form of each individual experience encountered by the player. Ever since the announcement of Wilds, many players have seen its seamless stages, real-time environmental changes and other new elements, and called it an "open world Monster Hunter". In fact, I admit that those were the first words to come to my own mind the moment I heard the news about Wilds. But Tsujimoto says that the developers never thought of themselves as making an open world game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's not as if the words 'open world' came out of any of our mouths during development, either,” he says. “We wanted players to be able to experience a seamless Monster Hunter, and this is the form we ended up with as we implemented what we wanted."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I ask what genre they would call Wilds if they had to give it one, and the three developers look at one another. Fujioka says that while he believes they used phrases like "seamless map" and "seamless stages" during World as well, he could only describe Wilds as a game that gives players "a seamless Monster Hunter experience". </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems that the development team consider the wide-open stages in Wilds as not their goal, but rather a result. According to Tokuda, "Creating large spaces wasn't the goal from the time we made World. It's more accurate to say that they became that large as well as seamlessly connected during the process of properly depicting Monster Hunter's world. More than its size, one of the things that makes Monster Hunter unique is its density of detail. We focused on adding enough density to our stages that just by walking through them, you'll make discoveries, notice interactable elements, and find so much in general, from targets of action to visual aspects. I think that level of detail is a part of depicting the world of Monster Hunter and its ecosystems."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Making Monster Hunter More Accessible, Not Easier</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While the series continues to change with advances in hardware, its core gameplay has always stayed the same. This is because the developers have absolute confidence in what makes it fun. The changes made in World and the improvements found in Wilds have always come from a focus on finding ways to bring what makes Monster Hunter fun to an even larger audience.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have data showing that many of the people who quit World partway through did so before reaching the part where you're really playing Monster Hunter,” Tsujimoto says of the feedback they received from World. “I think there are a lot of reasons for that, but maybe they couldn't find monsters, or they didn't know what to do once they reached them, or maybe the weapon they brought didn't suit them once it came time for action. We've been incredibly careful in Wilds to guide players to the fun of Monster Hunter without changing the core of the series."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mr. Fujioka explains that it's for this reason that the difficulty in Wilds generally follows suit from World.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Monster Hunter is an action game, which means that you're always going to have some players who never complete the game no matter how much you adjust the numbers,” he says. “That's why we quite carefully analyzed the reasons players can't beat it, or why they can't make it to a hunt, then created a way for them to grow step by step. As you progress through the game, a moment will come when these skills that you've learned one at a time will suddenly all be required of you. At the end of the day, our goal with Monster Hunter is to create action that you can sink your teeth into, and the enjoyment of being able to finally defeat a monster by playing together with a team as one. We've had the goal in every title we've made for people picking up Monster Hunter for the first time to ultimately be able to reach the same skill level as veteran hunters."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Given Fujioka’s comments, it sounds as though the development team never even considered making monsters weaker in order to make the game more accessible. They believe in the hunters who decide to take on Monster Hunter, and they want to avoid at all costs lessening the fun that those hunters should eventually come to find. Instead of resorting to the simplest possible way to improve accessibility, they decided to think about a player's experience and design a game that matches it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tokuda continues, "For Wilds, we conducted an even closer analysis of a player's growth curve. It's good that Great Jagras, the first large monster in World, could easily be hit from many different angles, but it had a broad range of attacks in return, making it feel difficult for those not used to action games. Chatacabra, the first monster in Wilds, has only focused attacks, while the next monster, Quematrice, has wider-ranging attacks. We've designed it in this way so that players will gradually learn how to respond as they get used to the game's action."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Another Core: The Communication Factor</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers also spoke about how one other element that helps define Monster Hunter is the communication between hunters. My first time playing Monster Hunter with others was with Monster Hunter Portable 3rd on the PlayStation Portable, but even back then there were already many veteran hunters who had come before me. I remember them taking me by the hand and guiding me through what I needed to bring on hunts and what to do when encountering a monster. But without those people around me, I doubt I ever would have ever become a hunter.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"You didn't even know where to mine, right?" Tsujimoto laughs. "Networked communication wasn't as easy back in those days, so it was like whoever found something became a hero. That information and enjoyment would then spread from there. We even had monsters that we never officially announced in order to encourage more communication."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fujioka says these tricks existed within Monster Hunter from the very beginning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In the mission for Lao-Shan Lung, you're asked to simply repel the monster, but it's actually possible to kill it,” he says. “It's designed so that it can be properly defeated even if that isn't the goal. That information was never officially announced, though, so a player would get that experience and spread the information from there. We were intentional about putting that into the game."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter began as an action game that can be enjoyed with other players, communication included. That philosophy has remained consistent ever since its start in 2004.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What we set out to create from the very start was action enjoyed with others, whether that's in the game's setting or in its gameplay,” continues Fujioka. “The focus is on how much fun we can bring players through its action, and just how solid the push and pull against monsters feels. I think that what makes Monster Hunter unique is that you can get a serious action experience whether you're playing alone or with three others."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It may be a little early to ask, but now that Wilds nears its release, what do the developers see in Monster Hunter’s future? When I ask Fujioka this, he replies with a forced laugh. "The future, huh..." He then goes silent for a bit, as if to think back on his time developing the game, then continues, picking his words with care.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"... Well, I think I've exhausted myself with Wilds, and it feels like it'll be difficult to take a broader view of the game until a while after its release,” he admits. “What I can say, though, is that there has been a dizzying amount of change in the last decade or two, like online games becoming the standard. Advances in hardware and technology are of course going to continue as well. It was a huge shock when the PSP came out and we saw the level of specs that portable games were now capable of. That would have been unimaginable 20 years before its release. All we can do is make games. But when something incredible that feels truly advanced comes along, we get so many ideas about what to do next with Monster Hunter. I think Monster Hunter is just going to keep changing to match the shifts and advances of the times."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The interview left me with the powerful feeling that these creators firmly believe in how fun Monster Hunter is. At the same time, their faith is strong that hunters around the world will enjoy Monster Hunter. They leave the core fun of the games untouched while bringing hunters to new horizons made visible by advances in hardware. After the leap that was World, these creators now aim for even greater heights with Wilds. I can barely wait until the day that I get to hunt in the world they've created with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds is scheduled for release on February 28.
