		<p>Bandai Namco has revealed BLEACH Rebirth of Souls for PC, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S. A release date has not been confirmed. The upcoming game will feature an original story for BLEACH, instead of adapting a story from previous arcs. BLEACH Rebirth of Souls is designed as an arena fighter, with characters from the series clashing in combat. Each character possesses unique abilities for use in battle, where a single strike can end a fight.</p>
<p><iframe title="BLEACH Rebirth of Souls – Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B0XoOx8kTEk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In&nbsp;BLEACH Rebirth of Souls, the more dire the circumstances, the greater character’s power can grow. In the middle of each conflict, the momentum can shift as characters can unleash powerful attacks the closer they get to being defeated. This state reveals new shapes and swords to allow&nbsp; players to snatch triumph from the jaws of defeat.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/08/22/review-bleach-soul-resurreccion/">Bleach: Soul Resurrección Review</a></h2>
<p>The last Bleach game we appeared to have reviewed was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/08/22/review-bleach-soul-resurreccion/">Bleach: Soul Resurrección</a>, way back in 2011. At the time, Dan said,<em> “The story also hasn’t been handled particularly well. Having just a wall of text at the start of a level is actually quite deflating, and rather than pumping up the player for a bit of carnage it has the opposite effect. If the story had been fleshed out then the score would have been a fair bit higher. Overall it’s a fun game, but also a real missed opportunity.”</em></p>

			<p>A new Resident Evil Village comparison video shared a few hours ago highlights the visual improvements the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-village-path-tracing/">path tracing mod released earlier this year</a> for all entries in the series powered by the RE Engine brings to the game.</p>
<p>The comparison video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> highlights how the biggest improvements the mod brings are global illumination and shadows improvements. The mod also enhances RT reflections by adding more reflective surfaces to the game. Unfortunately, things aren't perfect all the time, as the mod doesn't feature any denoiser, resulting in worse image quality at resolutions lower than 4K, and not every sequence in the game looks good, which is not surprising at all, considering the game wasn't built with path tracing in mind.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Village Path Tracing Mod vs Ray Tracing - Graphics/Performance Comparison | RTX 4080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7U4fm0lXkks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Despite a setting and premise that's markedly different from the rest of the series, Resident Evil Village manages to be among the best entries in CAPCOM's survival horror series. This is thanks to an excellent story, polished presentation, and solid core mechanics, as Nathan highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/">review</a>.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Village is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. The game launched late last year for certain <a href="https://wccftech.com/m2-ipad-pro-can-run-resident-evil-village-at-max-visual-settings/">iPhone and iPad models.</a></p>

		<p>Hot off the release of The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak, NIS America has revealed that The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak II is coming in early 2025 for PC, PS5, PS4, and Switch. Both Agnes Claudel and Van Arkride return as the main characters, with the game location remaining as the Claudel Republic.</p>
<p><iframe title="Trails through Daybreak II -  Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, PC)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sI7TgkoXqMk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The description for The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak II says, <em>“One day, a shocking series of murders set the wheels of fate into motion once again. Chaos looming on the horizon, the spriggan Van Arkride receives an unexpected visitor. Who is behind the murders, and what is their goal? Time may be the only key to unlocking the secrets lurking beneath the shadows… “</em></p>

<p>In our The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak review, Miguel said, <em>“The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak is the spark that this series needed, and an incredible new chapter for such an iconic franchise. The shift in tone for the story and the addictive dual-mode combat had me hooked from beginning to end. If you play any game in this series, make it this one.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-reportedly-in-development-by-tencent/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://forums.exputer.com/threads/exclusive-final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-is-in-development.237/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to leaker Kurakasis</a>, Final Fantasy XIV Mobile is in development. This is reportedly part of the strategic partnership <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-tencent-form-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed</a> by Square Enix and Tencent around six years ago.</p>
<p>Back then, the press release explained:</p>
<p><em>Square Enix Group will be accelerating these business development efforts to enhance its content services worldwide through this strategic alliance with Tencent Group. Outcomes of this newly created alliance include the establishment of a joint-venture company, co-development of AAA titles based on new intellectual properties, the licensing of existing intellectual properties, and more.</em></p>
<p>So far, no game project borne out of this partnership made it to market. An unannounced Nier mobile game was canceled in December 2023 (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tencent-axes-square-enix-nier-mobile-game-it-hunts-new-hit-sources-2024-02-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as reported by Reuters</a>) as the developers failed to find the right monetization model for such a high-cost project.</p>
<p>Needless to say, a full port of the gargantuan Final Fantasy XIV MMORPG may prove to be even more problematic in that regard. To this day, it is one of the few games in the genre that mandates a subscription to play; such a business model is unlikely to find success in the mobile space.</p>
<p>We'll have to see if this project, unlike Nier's, ever sees the light of day. Meanwhile, Square Enix has just released the fifth Final Fantasy XIV expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-launches-on-july-2-says-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dawntrail</a>. Following the end of the previous 10-year-long storyline, adventurers are now headed to a brand new continent, Tural, inspired by real-life Southeast Asia and Latin America.</p>
<p>So far, the reception has been a bit worse than expected. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2649240/FINAL_FANTASY_XIV_Dawntrail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On Steam</a>, only 63% of the 2,147 user reviews published to date are positive. On the other hand, Final Fantasy XIV Producer and Director Naoki Yoshida <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/e2da42164b4e6c9967ebb2e41d6321a515d36909" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the game registered a record number of players not seen since the re-launch of A Realm Reborn in 2013. Yoshida-san also outlined some of the planned job adjustments coming in future updates for Monk, Astrologian, Viper, Black Mage, Tank, Samurai, Red Mage, and Pictomancer.</p>
<p>In other news, Naoki Yoshida recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-xiv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke</a> about the possibility of Final Fantasy XIV launching on the next Nintendo console. He said that could happen, but it may be years before such a release takes place.</p>

			<p>While we wait for 2K and Cloud Chamber's <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-in-development-since-2015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioShock 4</a>, a stunning new graphical showcase of 2010's BioShock 2 has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC2Ttbm8m8I" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a>.</p>
<p>Created by German YouTuber 'Digital Dreams', this new showcase shows 2K's Bioshock 2 running in 8K resolution at 60FPS on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU combined with an AMD Ryzen 9 7950x CPU. For this showcase, the YouTuber used '<a href="https://www.patreon.com/NiceGuy147" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CompleteRT</a>' Ray Tracing ReShade shader that adds Ray Traced Diffuse Illumination as well as Ray Traced Reflections. "<em>One of the most advanced&nbsp;<strong>Screen space Ray Tracing</strong> Shaders, lets you add [Global illumination], [Ambient Occlusion], Matte, and Glossy Reflections to your favorite games using Reshade</em>", the description of this Ray Tracing shader reads.</p>
<p>As expected on this setup, the game runs on the highest-possible settings, and the results are pretty spectacular, especially for a 14-year-old title - Rapture has never looked this great. Check out the new BioShock 2 showcase below and judge for yourself:</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K60] Bioshock 2 - CompleteRT -  ultra Settings BeyondallLimits - ULTRA GRAPHICS SHOWCASE" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tC2Ttbm8m8I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Released in 2010 for PC and the available consoles at that time, the PS3 and Xbox 360, BioShock 2 is considered a worthy sequel to 2007's BioShock. Some even consider the sequel better than the 2007 original due to the improved gameplay and combat. "BioShock represented a watershed moment in the gaming industry when it illustrated that games, like feature films, can be viewed as art - both in art design and in the rich depth of the narrative," Christoph Hartmann, then president of 2K said in 2010. “Most importantly, the media are stating what we’ve known all along; that whether or not you’ve played the original, BioShock 2 is a worthy successor to one of the best games of all time that should not be missed.”</p>
<p>As said, 2K and developer Cloud Chamber are currently actively working on BioShock 4 with Cloud Chamber r<a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-team-ramps-up-recruitment-with-30-job-offers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ecently looking for numerous new team players in order to ramp up development on the game</a>. Meanwhile, the creator of the original BioShock, Ken Levine, is currently working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Judas</a> with his studio <span>Ghost Story Games.</span></p>

<p>The Call of Duty League’s ‘regular season’ has now wrapped up and players are preparing to make it big on the stage at COD Champs in Texas later this month. It has been a tough year for many involved, with some teams putting up an abysmal performance that saw loss-streak records broken dramatically, and for others, it has been a jubilant season filled with success. </p>



<p>However, despite the ups and downs, the drama and the clutch moments, viewership for the Call of Duty League has dropped around 29% since 2023.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-on-the-way-down">On The Way Down</h2>



<p>In a string of <a href="https://escharts.com/news/cdl-2024-regular-season-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statistics revealed by escharts.com</a>, it was highlighted that viewership during this year’s CDL regular season tanked by almost a third. The average viewer count dropped by 28.5% while the peak viewer count saw a decline of 26.8% – the airtime remained almost the same, though.</p>



<p>It might seem bizarre to some, but the COD League’s official channel barely managed to retain the strongest market share in terms of viewership. On YouTube, the CDL channel pulled in just 38.6% of viewers, with Scump’s iconic ‘watch parties’ grabbing a whopping 36.8% of the market. At the start of the season, an exclusivity deal threatened the watch parties hosted by Seth ‘Scump’ Abner and other personalities, such as ZooMaa – without them, this year’s viewer count would have collapsed in on itself.</p>



<p>This season’s peak came during the Stage 3 Major between Atlanta FaZe and OpTic Texas, which is considered the El Classico of Call of Duty. In a dramatic showdown, OpTic Texas secured its first trophy in more than 800 days, beating FaZe while a peak count of 335,170 users watched on. The team would later decimate Toronto Ultra to snag the trophy.</p>



<p>With that drop in mind, we now look to COD Champs, which is set to run from July 18 – 21. There’s a $2.2 million prize pool on the line but with viewership going the way it is, how much of an audience will be there to see this season’s champion crowned? </p>

            <title><![CDATA[That New Tarkov Update Has Basically Ruined PvE]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-tarkov-update-ruined-pve/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/that-new-tarkov-update-has-basically-ruined-pve.920316/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-tarkov-update-ruined-pve/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Battlestate Games recently deployed a major overhaul to Escape from Tarkov’s PvE platform, making it so that solo players can run the game on their local PC as opposed to a centralised server. It was intended to reduce matching times to mere seconds, and while that box was ticked, the changes introduced a string of problems that are getting up the noses of players worldwide – as if BSG needed more bad publicity.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-they-broke-it">They Broke It</h2>



<p>Along with the ‘offline PvE’ changes came several tweaks to how the game’s ‘player-vs-environment’ AI characters behave, particularly when roaming the map and interacting with loot crates and such. Battlestate applied a serious update that makes them much freer, which immediately means that players are having a tough time predicting their movements. This is where the issues begin – and it’s a long road from there.</p>



<p>Due to new ‘homing AI’ updates, if the computer-controlled enemies know where you are, they’ll descend upon your location with reckless abandon, which just isn’t right. Players are reporting ‘Scavs’ and PMC characters – again, all AI – almost joining forces in an unrealistic way to combat the solo <strong>and terrified </strong>players exploring a little PvE.</p>



<p>There are also reports of PMCs ‘over-spawning’ on maps, with the most extreme claims suggesting that more than double the normal amount of PMCs are appearing in AI form. They’re smarter, more tactical, and less afraid of making a group push towards a player cowering in a corridor somewhere, holding that angle.</p>



<p>Further, the ‘offline PvE’ change seems to have made it tougher for people to run the base game without experiencing issues. On certain maps, frame rate drops are now commonplace, with some players complaining that Escape from Tarkov has ‘become unplayable’. Battlestate Games has promised that further tweaks are inbound to address these issues – as always.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kien-delayed-22-years/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-delayed-for-22-years-has-just-been-released-%E2%80%93-on-gba.920307/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kien-delayed-22-years/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It might have slipped through the nets of gamers worldwide, but Kien, a game that entered development in the early 2000s, has just been released on Game Boy Advance. Back in 2002, a group of aspiring developers got to work on Kien, seeking to produce a game for the GBA platform – fast-forward some 22 years and only one of the original developers remains with the project, but he never gave up hope.</p>



<p>From facing financial ruin to balancing game development and marketing while studying at university, Fabio Belsanti from Italy finally crossed the finish line a couple of weeks ago, releasing Kien in physical form for the Game Boy Advance after a 22-year delay.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-s-got-to-be-a-record">That’s Got To Be A Record</h2>



<p>Kien is a full-fledged GBA title that sees players assume control of either a fearless warrior or a mystical priestess, fighting through a series of environments on the way to save the planet of Malkut. Here’s the trailer for Kien:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Kien - Official Game Boy Advance Trailer #2 (2024)" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kk0-yXB3Wvw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Belsanti, who was the sole developer left working on the project when it was finally released in June, addressed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jul/04/kein-the-most-delayed-video-game-in-history-released-after-22-years" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">why it felt like the right time</a> to push the game into the market:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I believe we are in a phase similar to the revival of vinyl or cassettes for music – a return to previous, more primitive forms of the medium driven by nostalgia from the generations who lived those eras, and curiosity by those who came after such technology. On a romantic level, the thought of releasing the game on its original console is simply magical. To see Kien come to life on the very platform it was designed for is a dream come true.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The feedback already received on the trailers has been stellar, with retro gaming fans welcoming the arrival of an entirely new game some 15 years after the Game Boy Advance was discontinued. It promises to take them back to days gone by, fuelling their nostalgia-riddled passion for gaming that was likely kickstarted decades ago. </p>

<p>This week, XDefiant’s Season One update arrived, bringing about new maps, weapons, and mechanics, along with a series of tweaks, quality-of-life improvements, and of course, new <strong>issues</strong>. It also introduced Ranked, which hasn’t landed well with the majority of the player base on account of it not <strong>feeling </strong>like a Ranked mode.</p>



<p>Shortly after the new update dropped, Ubisoft’s Mark Rubin took to social media to explain why XDefiant is experiencing so many issues, defending the game against those claiming it was released too early and ‘rushed out’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-built-up-from-the-ground-floor">‘Built Up From The Ground Floor’</h2>



<p>XDefiant was released on May 21 to a relatively positive reception, with hundreds of thousands of players pouring onto the platform in the first hours of the game going online. It was a long-awaited arrival that came following months of delays and postponements, so eager players were just happy to finally receive it – and then the teething issues surfaced. </p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1809020713954914444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking candidly on social media</a>, executive producer, Mark Rubin explained why XDefiant’s launch hasn’t been smooth sailing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What we have is an engine that has only ever been an MMO. And so all of the infrastructure for an FPS has had to be built up from the ground floor. we are working on developing all new tech in an engine that was designed for something else. That being said the engine is really great but it does require a lot of work and with that work comes a lot of bugs that other engines have already worked out. We’re not a shooter that’s been out for 20 years. If you like what we are trying to do stick around and you’ll see things improve and new features get added. <strong>But if the game isn’t for you that’s ok you can move on.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>From the horse’s mouth, if you can’t stomach XDefiant’s core issues, then feel free to go away. Plenty of problems have surfaced in the last month and a half, ranging from hit detection to net code and from menu bugs to animation-based issues, and while Ubisoft is working on them, it seems that each major patch just brings more problems to the table. </p>

The two options presented are bats, which will occasionally leave fruit in the cave, or Mushrooms, which will occasionally spawn in the cave. Demetrius appears to make the offer once you have accumulated 25,000G. This choice is permanent, so you will want to pick the option that works best for you. Here are the benefits of each choice.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Bats</h2><p dir="ltr">If you choose the Bats, fruit will occasionally spawn in the cave. This is an excellent choice if you want to complete the community bundles as early as possible, since you will need several different kinds of fruit for certain bundles. Otherwise, you will need to plant and grow several fruit trees before waiting for the right season for the tree to grow fruit. The fruit doesn't spawn every day, since there is only a chance, which increases if there is already some fruit in there. The fruit never despawns, so you don't have to check every day.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Fruit is useful in the late-game too, since fruit that grows on trees is universally liked, so it's a great steady supply of gifts for villagers. It can also be used for wine as well, which can be nice if you don't want to dedicate a large amount of space for fruit trees. <strong>If you want a steady supply of fruit without needing trees, choose the bats</strong>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Mushrooms</h2><p dir="ltr">If you choose Mushrooms, six mushroom boxes will be added to the cave. Every day the boxes will each have one of the five different types of mushrooms, although the chances are heavily weighted towards the Common Mushroom.</p><p><strong>You should choose the Mushrooms if you really enjoy exploring the Mines or Skull Cavern.</strong> The reason is that the Life Elixir item, which unlocks at Combat level 2, can be crafted using one of each of the other four mushrooms; Red, Purple, Morel, and Chanterelle. Life Elixir heals you completely and there isn't really another way to consistently find every type of mushrooms. Outside of crafting the Life Elixir, there isn't really another reason to choose the mushrooms. You do get a free dehydrator with the mushroom cave, but you will unlock the ability to craft them eventually.</p>

                <p>Clay is a relatively common building material found in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a>, used to make structures and craftable items. Unlike other building materials like Wood and Stone, it isn't always obvious where you can find more Clay.

It can be a little inconsistent with how frequently it appears from tilling, but clearing out large areas of dirt, like the patches found near the Carpenter's house, usually yields some Clay. You can also till the large amounts of dirt on your farm--with the exact amount depending on which farm layout you have. You can also till the dirt patches found sometimes in the Mines and Skull Caverns.</p><p dir="ltr">Artifact Spots, which look like worms coming out of the ground, can also yield Clay. Clay can also appear in fishing treasure chests and geodes, but similar to the Artifact Spots, so many different items can appear in these items that it's not a consistent way to find Clay. Clay can also be mined from Clay Veins, but these are only found on Ginger Island, which you won't get access to after completing either the Community Center or the Jojo Mart.</p><p dir="ltr">Clay is used in several crafting recipes and it is used to build a Silo at the Carpenters. Silos allow you to collect and store Hay, which is used to feed Animals, so building it is very important for Ranching.</p>

<p>It’s easy to forget that not everyone plays video games on Windows. Some users prefer Linux, even on a desktop, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Unfortunately, not every developer supports Linux, which makes it challenging to find and play the games you want. So, can you play Zenless Zone Zero on Linux?</p>



<h2 id="h-does-zenless-zone-zero-support-linux">Does Zenless Zone Zero Support Linux?</h2>



<p>Zenless Zone Zero does not natively support Linux, but it does work. So long as developer miHoYo doesn’t make any significant changes, it should still run fine on Linux. The key is to download and install the game using <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Heroic</a>. It’s a free-to-use, open-source game launcher capable of running Epic Game Store, GOG, Amazon Prime Games, and more on Linux, Windows, and macOS.</p>



<p>Once you download Heroic and install Zenless Zone Zero, consider running the game via Proton Experimental. Most users seem to have luck there.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-zenless-zone-zero-on-steam-deck">Can You Play Zenless Zone Zero on Steam Deck?</h2>



<p>While Zenless Zone Zero isn’t on Steam and will likely never launch on Valve’s digital storefront, it does somewhat work on Steam Deck. There’s no official support, though. As such, you may run into numerous issues and poor performance.</p>



<p>If you want to try to play Zenless Zone Zero on Steam Deck, you can install the gacha game using Heroic or Lutris. It’s the easiest way to download and play the game on the handheld through the Epic Game Store.</p>



<p>Alternatively, the ROG Ally should have no trouble downloading the game, as it runs Windows natively.</p>

<p>While Linux remains in the air, what about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-zenless-zone-zero-offer-controller-support-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controller support in Zenless Zone Zero</a>?

Games like Gran Turismo 7, Elden Ring, Call of Duty, Final Fantasy 16, and NBA 2K24 each take up 100GB or more all by themselves. If you buy a lot of AAA titles, your drive will fill up very quickly. In addition, if you want to expand the PS5's internal storage without compromising on speed, any old SSD just won't cut it. You'll want to pick up an PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 solid state drive with a minimum rated 5,500MB/s read speed.</p><p>Samsung SSDs need no introduction. They've made some of the most popular and reliable <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-ssd">PS5 SSDs</a> on the market.

It is fully PS5 compatible in terms of form factor and performance, with speeds of up to 7,100MB/s. This particular model is preinstaslled with a rugged heatsink that's a lot better than the  flimsy paper-thin graphene "heatsinks" you'll find on some other SSDs at the same price.</p><p>If you have a gaming PC instead of a PS5 console, this SSD would also make a great boot drive. There are faster drives out there, but for OS and general app performance, you won't notice any real world performance difference compared to this drive, which is already far faster than any traditional platter hard drive. The capacity is also ideal. For most people, a 2TB SSD should be enough to cover your OS, apps, and games. Sure a 4TB SSD would be even better, but they're very, very expensive.</p><p>If you want more options, check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ssd">best SSDs of 2024</a>.</p></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 5, 2024 6:45 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">There was a time when there were a few games based on The Matrix movies, and they were even pretty good at times. Today, while video game adaptations are tougher to come by (although you can be Neo or Trinity in Fortnite), fans shouldn't sleep on a tabletop opportunity to delve into the Matrix, with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legendary-Encounters-Matrix-Deck-Building/dp/B0CDQW9K97?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Upper Deck's Legendary Encounters: The Matrix</a> deckbuilding game, available on Amazon.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're a tabletop or deckbuilding game fan but unfamiliar with the Legendary series, you're missing out. They're a series of cooperative games you can play solo or with friends where you battle <em>against</em> the deck, and they're constructed really well to capture the feeling of venturing into the licensed worlds they're trying to portray. The first Legendary game was a <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUpper-Deck-Legendary-What-If%2Fdp%2FB0CJL3XLDJ%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fis-the-matrix-deckbuilding-game-real-or-is-it-a-simulation%2F1100-6524731%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Marvel superheroes deckbuilder</a> and has a <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dlegendary%2Bencounters%26i%3Dtoys-and-games%26crid%3D2M0C27JSNUE41%26sprefix%3Dlegendary%2Bencounters%252Ctoys-and-games%252C153%26ref%3Dnb_sb_noss_2%253Ftag%253Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fis-the-matrix-deckbuilding-game-real-or-is-it-a-simulation%2F1100-6524731%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ton of expansions</a>, but I have the first Legendary Encounters, where the franchise expanded into movies with the Alien franchise. While that one seems to be out of print, the game manages to replicate the specific feel of the original Alien franchise, but with cards, and not only is it a fun and well-designed game, it's genuinely pretty tense for a game you play with cards.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329284-legendaryencountersmatrix.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329284" data-ratio="0.88046272493573" data-width="778" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329284-legendaryencountersmatrix.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329284"></a><figcaption>Legendary Encounters: The Matrix</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329284-legendaryencountersmatrix.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Legendary Encounters: The Matrix was released in 2023, and captures the same feel of the films and lets you join up with up to four other players, and includes characters like Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus, as well as villains such as Agent Smith and the Merovingian. The game is played not only with cards, but with a special playmat that dictates the flow of the game and makes learning it a little easier, as well.</p><p dir="ltr">There are actually <em>a ton</em> of Legendary Encounters games, dipping into lots of different media franchises--some of which are even a little unexpected.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/berserk-board-game-set-for-worldwide-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An official Berserk board game is coming. Fans of the iconic dark fantasy manga can relive its most horrific action-packed moments from the comfort of their table. Better still, thanks to some official partnerships, the game will be coming to store shelves worldwide.</p>
<h2>The <em>Berserk</em> Board Game Announcement</h2>
<p>According to an official press release, the design, production, and sale of the <em>Berserk</em> board game will be handled by Monolith Board Games. Monolith is a France-based board game developer. It was founded in 2014 and has a respectable history of well-designed board games, including <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/222514/batman-gotham-city-chronicles"><em>Batman: Gotham City Chronicles</em></a>,<em> </em>and <em>Claustrophobia 1643</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/berserk-manga-artwork.jpg?itok=pCklKDBc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/berserk-manga-artwork.jpg?itok=7sB1rzKp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The original Dark Knight with the original Buster Sword.</figcaption></figure><p>While the press release is light on details, it states the game will captivate fans domestically and internationally with its grand storyline and intricate artwork. An official <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1113444893542668">Facebook post</a> by Monolith provides additional information. It states the game will use an original game system and be accessible, rich, and intuitive.</p>
<p>Monolith Board Games has several partners producing the <em>Berserk</em> board game. One is Hakusensha, the Japanese manga publishing company behind the manga. The other is Digital Catapult Inc. which specializes in producing and selling media overseas. The latter will distribute English and French language versions of the game in Europe and North America.</p>
<p><em>Berserk</em> is a brutal dark fantasy manga the late Kentaro Miura created. It debuted in 1988 under Hakusensha's semimonthly Young Horses magazine. It tells the story of Guts, a swordsman traveling through a hostile world for revenge. The manga was acclaimed for its mix of Western fantasy trappings, visceral bloody action, bleak atmosphere, and Lovecraftian cosmic horror.</p>
<p>After almost forty years, <em>Berserk's</em> cultural influence cannot be overstated. It spawned several anime, film, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/berserk-and-band-of-hawk-review-tell-me-why" rel="noopener" target="_blank">game adaptations</a>. It has inspired character archetypes and weapon designs for Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy</em></a> series. But its most overt influence is on creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki, the one behind the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-souls" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dark Souls</em></a> series and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>.</p>
<p>At time of writing there is no confirmed date of completion or sale for the <em>Berserk</em> board game.</p>

But <em>Kien </em>took even longer to finally arrive. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jul/04/kein-the-most-delayed-video-game-in-history-released-after-22-years&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jul/04/kein-the-most-delayed-video-game-in-history-released-after-22-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>The Guardian</em></a></span><em> </em>and Patricia Hernandez (former EIC of <em>Kotaku</em>), <em>Kien</em> was developed by a small group of friends in Italy back in 2002. None of them had experience making games. But for the next two years, the pals worked extremely hard to develop <em>Kien</em>, taking very few breaks and crunching a lot. After a few years of development, the game was finished and ready to be published. However, the high costs of shipping the game on Game Boy carts and the risk that <em>Kien </em>might not be successful led to no publisher wanting to release the game. </p><p>Eventually, only one member of the original development team remained: game designer Fabio Belsanti. Despite believing in the unpublished game, he moved on with his life, founded a new development company, and began creating educational games for kids and teens. Through it all, though, Belsanti never gave up hope for <em>Kien</em>. When he noticed recently that retro games and consoles were popular again, he decided to return to <em>Kien </em>and give it another chance. </p><p> “I believe we are in a phase similar to [the revival of] vinyl or cassettes for music,” Belsanti told <em>The Guardian</em>, “a return to previous, more primitive forms of the medium driven by nostalgia from the generations who lived those eras, and curiosity by those who came after such technology.” </p><p>Belsanti teamed up with Incube8, a publisher focused on releasing and supporting new games for classic consoles, like the GBA. Incube8 was a perfect fit for <em>Kien</em> and in June it finally launched, 22 years after development had started on the action-platformer. </p><p>“On a romantic level, the thought of releasing the game on its original console is simply magical,” said Belsanti. “To see <em>Kien </em>come to life on the very platform it was designed for is a dream come true.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://incube8games.com/products/kien-gba-digital-edition&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://incube8games.com/products/kien-gba-digital-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Kien </em>is out now</a></span>. You can pick up a physical version of the game for Game Boy Advance or buy a digital version that you can play on an emulator.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
