            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/toys-for-bob-xbox-partnership<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Crash Bandicoot 4&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Spyro Reignited Trilogy&nbsp;</em>developer Toys for Bob has officially confirmed that it will partner with Xbox for its next game.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/ToysForBob/status/1796556809660207498" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Toys for Bob says Xbox will publish its next project, which is "still very early in development". As such, it might be a while before we hear anything further from the studio.</p>

<p>The developer does, however, say that it's "so sooo inspired about" the game, and that it can't wait to share more. Sadly, it doesn't look like more will be coming in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-june-showcase-direct-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank">next month's Xbox showcase</a>, at any rate.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/toys-for-bob-xbox-publishing-spyro-reignited.jpg?itok=iPLWeom3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/toys-for-bob-xbox-publishing-spyro-reignited.jpg?itok=KUxRHg1L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Toys for Bob and Xbox are teaming up for the developer's next project.</figcaption></figure><p>Rumors first began to swirl that Toys for Bob would team up with Xbox for its next game <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-xbox-has-reached-an-agreement-with-toys-for-bob-for-their-first-independent-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in March</a>, but today's announcement represents the first official confirmation that the partnership is going ahead.</p>

<p>Some might consider the team-up a little strange considering that Toys for Bob <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-bandicoot-developer-toys-for-bob-becoming-independent-considering-partnership">became independent from Microsoft in February</a>, but a studio going indie doesn't mean it can't team up with its former owners, after all.</p>

<p>Additionally, given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">bizarre studio closure spree</a> on which Microsoft embarked recently, Toys for Bob is arguably in the best position when it comes to working with Microsoft and the Xbox brand.</p>

<p>Right now, we're not sure whether Toys for Bob's game will be Xbox-exclusive. Teaming up with Xbox as a publisher would seem to imply exclusivity, but after all, some of Xbox's games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-will-release-four-games-on-other-plaforms-teases-next-generation-hardware">are available on other systems</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/toys-for-bob-xbox-publishing-crash-n-sane.jpg?itok=bswAzT4d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/toys-for-bob-xbox-publishing-crash-n-sane.jpg?itok=pU8W1bgf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Toys for Bob is perhaps best-known for its work with&nbsp;<em>Spyro&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Crash</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Without any further information about Toys for Bob's new project to go on, we can only speculate about what it might be, but many will no doubt be hoping for a new&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Spyro the Dragon&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

<p>A partnership with Xbox could well provide some fuel for that fire; after all, those franchises are technically Microsoft-owned thanks to the Activision Blizzard merger.</p>

<p>Still, we'll just have to wait and see what Toys for Bob has on the cards. Stay tuned for more.</p>

This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, we look back on the start of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">this year's June hype cycle, the period formerly known as E3</a>, now a potpourri of other events and announcement livestreams. </p>
<p>PlayStation got the ball rolling last night with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-playstations-state-of-play-may-2024">latest State of Play broadcast</a>, which included a look ahead at its rather meagre first-party plans for the remainder of 2024: a moderately buffed-up port of Until Dawn, online shooter Concord, and the charming Astro Bot. But, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-hard-to-stay-excited-about-the-playstation-vr2-if-even-astro-bot-wont-wear-one">as our Ian wrote earlier, even the cute robot has got some people (VR fans) disgruntled</a>. Still, as a flat-screen game, surely more people will now play it?</p>
<p>And then there was Silent Hill Transmission or, this time around, basically just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-releases-on-ps5-and-pc-this-october">a longer look at the upcoming Silent Hill 2</a> and a chance for Konami to promote a load of tie-in tat. Joining me this week are Eurogamer's Victoria Kennedy and Vikki Blake to discuss.</p>

            <p>
Spyro developer Toys for Bob has formally confirmed its next game will be published by Xbox, in a teasing statement that ends with a decidedly purple-coloured heart emoji. 
</p>
<p>
Toys for Bob was previously part of the now-Microsoft-owned Activision Blizzard, and made its name making Skylanders, then working on the Crash and Spyro trilogy releases. 
</p>
<p>
But more recent years saw it pulled into work on Call of Duty as a support developer, and earlier this year it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-layoffs-affect-86-staff-at-spyro-crash-bandicoot-studio">lost 89 staff members</a> as a part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">Microsoft's wider layoffs of 1900 staff</a>.

<p>
Things began to look more promising in February, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activisions-skylanders-crash-bandicoot-studio-toys-for-bob-going-independent">the studio announced it was going independent from Activision Blizzard</a> and - it was presumed - would be leaving its days working on Call of Duty behind. 
</p>
<p>
At the time, rumours swirled that its indie status was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spyro-studio-toys-for-bob-secures-deal-with-microsoft-for-its-first-independent-game">tied into some sort of new deal with Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toys-for-bob-website-update-leads-to-new-crash-bandicoot-or-spyro-speculation">one report claimed work on Spyro 4 was now</a>, quietly, underway.

"We're excited to announce that we'll be partnering with Xbox to publish our next new game," Toys for Bob wrote on social media platform X today. </p>
<p>
"We're still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit - but know that we're working hard on an experience we're so sooo inspired about! Can't wait to share more 💜"
</p>
<p>
The purple colour of the image shared with the statement and the purple heart emoji both strongly suggest Toys for Bob is indeed working on a return for the popular purple dragon.
</p>
<p>
While we may not hear more from Toys for Bob for a while, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">Microsoft is primed to reveal what's next for Xbox</a> in just over a week, as part of its not-E3/Summer Game Fest June showcase.

            <p>I fear we may have swum the Rubicon of diminishing returns where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> games inspired by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> are concerned. The recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a> has sucked up all the remaining oxygen in the room, and oxygen is pretty important in Murky Divers, for reasons that are hopefully self-evident. Still, Murky Divers has some fairly eye-catching USPs. It's got underwater physics, of course, and it puts you and - unhelpfully - your friends in charge of a submarine. </p>

<p>The submarine doesn't have a third-person cam or forward viewing ports - you'll need to pilot it using sonar and a big compass mounted in front of the steering wheel, doubtless while shrieking at tardy team-mates to close the airlock before that big green dot on the sonar screen gets within biting distance. What will you be piloting the submarine towards? "Abandoned" seafloor laboratories, of course. Your job in this latest co-op scarefest from Embers (creators of well-regarded "casual Soulslike" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2162020/Strayed_Lights/">Strayed Lights</a>) is to clear up the results of various experiments gone wrong, lugging any and all dead boffins (piece by piece, if needed) back to your submersible, which contains an all-purpose shredder.</p>
<p>Along the way, you must do your level best not to become a corpse yourself. There are hazards such as sparking sockets and "abyssal terrors" such as octopi with grinning demon faces. The curvy submersible aesthetics put me in mind of our number one <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, but the wrecks themselves (and the act of swimming around holding a ripped-off foot) also evoke <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/barotrauma">Barotrauma</a>, Subnautica's grimacing grindhouse cousin.</p>
<p>Expect proximity-based voice chat, immersive 3D audio and procedurally generated wrecks. It's definitely "Lethal Company plus [concept]" but again, you do get a submarine. Murky Divers was announced this week, and will <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2963880/Murky_Divers/">release in Steam early access on 19th June 2024</a>. If you prefer to go up against demon-faced octopi on your lonesome, and you're mad keen on UIs full of unlabelled dials and levers, Nauticrawl is a good suspenseful play. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghames-with-ghoastus-nauticrawl">Ghoastus likes it</a> and he knows a thing or two about horror, on account of being a ghost.</p>

Also, if Senua has line of sight on a totem, you will see her head turn toward its location.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-narrator-replay-1851497118&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-narrator-replay-1851497118">Playing <em>Hellblade II</em> Twice Is Essential</a></span><br></p><p>Also, consider using photo mode to move the camera around a bit to spot a totem. You can’t get a perfect bird’s eye view of everything, but it’s a bit more flexible than the camera ordinarily is. Plus, <em>Hellblade II</em> is rather generous with how far you can extend the camera…not like some <em>other</em> games (looking at you, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129"><em>FF7 Rebirth</em></a></span>).</p><div><h4> You can listen to all of Grettir’s story in one sitting in the Extras menu  </h4><p> It can be a little hard to focus on the entirety of  Grettir’s story as it is scattered throughout Senua’s winding journey  through Iceland.

                <p>Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors has commented on the possibility of raising the price of major games from the industry standard of $70 to something above that. Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracers-lars-wingefors-on-the-brutal-truth-of-the-aaa-market" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>, Wingefors said the video game industry is no different than other businesses in that inflation and production costs continue to rise.</p><p>Wingefors said it's been "hard" to increase price for premium games in the console and PC space, and due to this, "the margin to success is less." Prices beyond $70 for new game releases is not out of the realm of possibility, Wingefors said, and it might take one company being a first-mover and seeing how the market responds.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Alone in the Dark GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"The reality is no one has tried it. If you create an enormous RPG, for example, with 100 or 150 hours of gameplay, very polished and a unique experience, would the consumer be willing to pay more? If they would, they would have more products potentially coming to market. But no one tried it," he said.</p><p>The executive went on to say that Embracer has been "discussing" this very thing. However, for the time being at least, Embracer is following the wider industry and keeping its price ceiling at $70. Of course, many game companies charge more than $70 for new games when considering deluxe/special editions. Many games today, including single-player titles, also have microtransaction systems built into them that provide another revenue stream for the publisher beyond the initial purchase price.</p><p>"Would it be that one [company] one day that tries to increase pricing? That remains to be seen," he said.</p><p>Another possibility, Wingefors said, is that Embracer might consider making shorter games that could help lower costs and increase the upside potential. For what it's worth, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">2024's best-selling game so far in the US, Helldivers II, is priced at $40 USD.</a></p><p>"I just believe there are consumers willing to engage in those amazing RPGs and other single-player games, and ultimately they are willing to spend money on them. Do you increase pricing, or do you make them shorter?" he said. "I think there are ways. I think it would be very sad if everything just became big multiplayer, in-game monetization titles. There are millions of consumers willing to engage more in classic games."</p><p>Some have theorized that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> could launch at a price above $70 for its standard edition. After all, Take-Two was one of the first companies to raise prices from $60 to $70 for new release, and some believe the company might go up another $10 for GTA 6. That remains to be seen, but CEO Strauss Zelnick said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/with-gta-6-release-coming-up-take-two-boss-talks-about-setting-game-prices/1100-6523568/" data-ref-id="1100-6523568">the company's aim is to "over deliver" on value against cost.</a></p><p>As for Embracer, the company recently concluded a cost-cutting program that resulted in hundreds of layoffs, canceled games, studio closures, and more dramatic changes. The name Embracer is going away in the future, but Wingefors maintains <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracers-name-is-going-away-ceo-denies-its-due-to-backlash-and-controversy/1100-6522930/" data-ref-id="1100-6522930">the change is not due to bad press.</a></p>

      </div>
<p>Players voiced their concerns about the situation, questioning why a single-player game needs this requirement. One player even <a href="https://x.com/Drayden42/status/1796329211692740695" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">joked that they'll sign up for PSN</a> when Sony finally ports <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-2022-its-still-baffling-that-bloodborne-isnt-on-pc-yet/1100-6509218/" data-ref-id="1100-6509218">Bloodborne to PC</a>.</p><p>The PSN debacle began earlier this month when Sony announced that players would have to create a PSN account to continue playing Helldivers 2. However, Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-helldivers-2-mandatory-psn-sign-in-requirement-following-player-uproar/1100-6523180/" data-ref-id="1100-6523180">reversed this particular decision</a> after fan backlash. Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut was released on PC earlier this month, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-on-pc-requires-psn-account-for-online-play/1100-6523195/" data-ref-id="1100-6523195">only the multiplayer aspect required a PSN account</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok/" data-ref-id="5000-519021">God of War Ragnarok for PC </a>will launch on September 19. It supports ultrawide monitor support and DLSS/FSR/XESS, as well as all post-launch updates such as new game plus and the Valhalla DLC. The Until Dawn remake will launch on PS5 and PC in Fall 2024.</p>

<p data-characters="249" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re looking to build up a strong party in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, you’re going to need to ascend your party members and for this, you need certain materials. One such material, Wintry Bell, is required to ascend Aalto, Yangyang, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sanhua-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-teams/">Sanhua</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">Ascending party members is vital as you progress and if you want to survive tougher fights, as it allows you to level up characters and increase their stats. Remember that, once you’ve ascended your party members and increased their maximum level, you’ll also need to make sure that their weapons are also leveled up.</p> <h2 id="h-where-to-find-wintry-bell-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to find Wintry Bell in </strong><strong><em>Wuthering Waves</em></strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="625" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="213" data-current-count="213" data-injectable="false">If you’re looking for Wintry Bell, you’ll need to head towards the Gorges of Spirits. This area is located in Tolling Stream, and it’s where you battle against the Calamity class Bell-Borne Geochelone.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">Wintry Bell are abundant in the area around the fight’s arena, so you won’t have too much of a hard time finding it. However, make sure you don’t venture too close to the giant bell in the middle, or you’ll inadvertently find yourself in battle with Bell-Borne Geochelone, which is unfortunate if you’re only there to pick some flowers.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="182" data-current-count="182" data-injectable="false">There’s also a lot of groups of Tacet Discords in the area which may hinder your progress, but they’re not too easy to clear out and at least you could get some Echoes out of it.</p> <h2 id="h-where-to-buy-wintry-bell-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to buy Wintry Bell in </strong><strong><em>Wuthering Waves</em></strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="482" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="189" data-current-count="189" data-injectable="false">Wintry Bell can also be purchased by visiting Shifang Pharmacy in Jinzhou, however this can get pretty expensive, especially for something that can be found pretty easily in the wild.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="237" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">However, if you’re in a pinch, or find that you’re just a few short when it comes time to ascend, you can purchase a maximum of 15 Wintry Bell for 3,000 Shell Credits each.&nbsp;You’ll need to wait for a timer to reset to get more.</p>

<p data-characters="237" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re looking to build up a strong party in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, you’re going to need to ascend your party members and for this, you need certain materials. If Yuanwu is part of your party, you’re going to need Terraspawn Fungus.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">Ascending party members is vital as you progress and if you want to survive tougher fights, as it allows you to level up characters and increase their stats. Remember that, once you’ve ascended your party members and increased their maximum level, you’ll also need to make sure that their weapons are also leveled up.</p> <h2 id="h-where-to-find-terraspawn-fungus-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to find Terraspawn Fungus in Wuthering Waves</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="625" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="185" data-current-count="185" data-injectable="false">Terraspawn Fungus is found only in the area around the Withering Frontline in Desorock Highland. It’s pretty common in the area, alongside Erodorchid, which look fairly similar.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="495" data-injectable="true">Fair warning, this area is completely overrun with Tacet Discords and it’s unlikely you’ll be able to sneak around the area unnoticed. The TDs seem particularly prevalent in areas where there are clumps of Terraspawn Fungus, so you’ll need to be prepared to fight if you want to farm this material.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">On top of this, Terraspawn Fungus spawns in the area directly on top of the location where you fight the Overlord class <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-echoes-in-wuthering-waves/">Thundering Memphis</a>, so you’ll need to err on the side of caution if you don’t want to be dragged into a battle.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-where-to-buy-terraspawn-fungus-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to buy Terraspawn Fungus in Wuthering Waves</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>

<p data-characters="250" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">At launch, all five assault rifles in <em>XDefiant</em> can hold their own and compete with any other weapon in the free-to-play title. So, it wasn’t an easy exercise to rank this loaded class, but here’s a list of the best AR’s in <em>XDefiant.</em></p> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">Assault rifles can do a little bit of everything. This class has weapons capable of taking down enemies in short, medium, and long-range engagements. Being able to kill faster, having a manageable recoil pattern, and having good mobility separate these four choices. With that in mind, let’s jump right into the list. </p> <h2 id="h-every-xdefiant-assault-rifle-loadout-ranked" data-injectable="false">Every <em>XDefiant</em> assault rifle loadout ranked</h2> <h3 data-injectable="false">5. MDR</h3> <figure data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Muzzle:</strong>&nbsp;Barrel Extender</li> <li><strong>Barrel:</strong>&nbsp;Lightweight</li> <li><strong>Optics:</strong>&nbsp;Reflex</li> <li><strong>Front Rail</strong>: Small Vertical Grip</li> <li><strong>Stock:</strong>&nbsp;Padded</li> </ul> <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true"><em>Xdefiant’s</em> first Battle Pass weapon falls victim to landing in no man’s land. The MDR was designed to be a hybrid SMG, but it gets outclassed by the ACR 6.8 in short-range engagements and falls short of every other AR in medium and long-range engagements.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">4. M4A1 </h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid </figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Front Rail:&nbsp;</strong>Small Vertical Grip</li> <li><strong>Optic:&nbsp;</strong>Reflex Sight</li> <li><strong>Magazine:&nbsp;</strong>Quick Mag</li> <li><strong>Rear Grip:&nbsp;</strong>Quick Draw Grip</li> <li><strong>Stock:&nbsp;</strong>Precision Stock</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">The M4A1 is a good first weapon to pick up and is easy to use, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s better than other ARs. Players will have an issue going toe-to-toe regarding firepower with the M16A4 and AK-47, but the speed and accuracy make up for that deficiency, if you still enjoy using the M4A1.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">3. AK-47</h3> <figure data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid </figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Barrel:&nbsp;</strong>Recon</li> <li><strong>Front Rail:&nbsp;</strong>Angled Grip</li> <li><strong>Optics:&nbsp;</strong>Reflex</li> <li><strong>Rear Grip:</strong>&nbsp;Heavy Grip</li> <li><strong>Stock:</strong>&nbsp;Padded Stock</li> </ul> <p data-characters="220" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true">If players want pure firepower, the AK-47 is the perfect AR. Thanks to its ability to shred through enemies almost instantly, we could easily put this weapon higher on the list. However, the M16A4 and ACR 6.8 slight edge</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">2. M16A4</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Barrel:&nbsp;</strong>Rapid Fire</li> <li><strong>Front Rail:&nbsp;</strong>Superlight Grip</li> <li><strong>Optic:&nbsp;</strong>Reflex Sight</li> <li><strong>Rear Grip:&nbsp;</strong>Grip Tape</li> <li><strong>Stock:&nbsp;</strong>Padded Stock</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">Ignore the time-to-kill stats because they don’t paint the full picture for a burst weapon. If you are accurate, the M16A4 takes down enemies consistently in two bursts and outclasses most other medium and long-range engagements. The only thing holding the M16A4 back from holding the top spot its, you will get punished with any missed shots to a fully automatic weapon.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">1. ACR 6.8</h3> <figure data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Barrel:</strong>&nbsp;Lightweight</li> <li><strong>Front Rail:</strong>&nbsp;Leather Wrapped</li> <li><strong>Optic:</strong>&nbsp;Reflex</li> <li><strong>Rear Grip:&nbsp;</strong>Quick Draw</li> <li><strong>Stock:</strong>&nbsp;Lightweight</li> </ul> <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="493" data-injectable="false">According to data provided by <a href="https://www.truegamedata.com/#/weapon_builder/xd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TrueGameData</a>, the ACR 6.8 has the fastest time-to-kill speed for ARs up to 25 meters. The AK-47 takes over as the fastest-killing AR from 25 to 35 meters, but that first-range difference is just enough to make the ACR 6.8 a better weapon and the best overall AR. </p>

            <p>John Romero's autobiography Doom Guy: Life in First Person is being adapted for screen in two different forms.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/doom-guy-life-in-first-person-documentary-drama-john-romero-quake-wolfenstein-1235944457/">Deadline</a>, the story of the id Software co-founder is being made into a documentary by Canadian filmmaker Rob McCallum.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a dramatised adaptation of the Doom creator's book is also in the pipeline. Both of these projects are going to be executive produced by Naomi Harvey of Golden Possum Productions.</p>

<p>"Talking with both Rob and Naomi, I knew they were the perfect team to bring Doom Guy to life," Romero said following the news. "Our backgrounds and aspirations have uncanny similarities, and I trust them to tell the story."</p>
<p>McCallum called Romero's journey "the missing antidote for all of us misfit toys looking for hope and kindred spirits in the darkness of the world", while Harvey added the video game icon's story is "one of triumph over trauma, filled with compassion and inspiration".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romero-is-releasing-a-memoir">Doom Guy: Life in First Person covers Romero's video game career</a>, as well as his childhood and family life. This includes recounts of his alcoholic father, racist grandfather who didn't approve of his parents' mixed-race coupling, and grandmother who ran a brothel in Mexico.</p>
<p>As well as Doom, Romero is also known for Quake and Wolfenstein. These games all pioneered the first person shooter genre, and at GDC last year, Romero was the recipient of a <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/legendary-game-designers-john-romero-and-mabel-addis-honored-gdca-2023">Lifetime Achievement Award</a> for his work.</p>

            <p>There is a time for perfect clarity in a shooter, for clean walls and clear-cut character silhouettes. But this is not it. Retro first-person gunwaltzer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/selaco">Selaco</a> is a messy machine gun dash through an office exploding with glass, concrete, splinters, and sparks. The glock-toting wreckage 'em up first hit our radar when it was announced as a modern combination of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fear">F.E.A.R.</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom">Doom</a>, promising both the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-fears-ai-is-still-the-best-in-first-person-shooters">fiendish AI enemies</a> of the former and the satisfying blasting of the latter. Well, it's out today. Bursting forth into the corporate lobby of early access with uzis akimbo, peppering the walls with angry bullets. Good, I say.</p>

<p>You play the security captain of Selaco, a vast facility housing the last refugees from a fallen Earth. You're being invaded; time to shoot. The early access version includes the "entirety of the Base Campaign and covers the majority of the game" we're told in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1592280/view/4191240933893510804">a recent news update on Steam</a>. There are 11 weapons, plus a "Kit System" that lets you mix and match firearm attributes to create, let's say, a frightening nailgun with a shotgun's hefty spread. The big boasting point, however, is some clever F.E.A.R. style enemies, who shout out to each other, remark on your actions, and generally react to your behaviour in a challenging, pressurizing way. "The enemies will communicate, provide cover fire, flank, rush, defend and much more," say developers Altered Orbit Studios. A wonderful promise I hope it can keep.</p>
<p>The shooter has been designed using GZDoom, a source port of great-great-grandaddy shooter Doom, which is still enjoying the attention of modders and mappers to this day. But Altered Orbit have gone much farther than mere tinkering, pushing GZDoom to lunatic extremes. As a casual dabbler in Quake mapping I can only look at the disintegrating props and smoking rubble of Selaco with a kind of terrified awe. It is, in more ways than one, a hardcore FPS. For one thing, it's releasing with a bonus difficulty mode "designed to make Selaco nearly impossible." Gauntlet thrown, folks. </p>
<p>"There are still many ideas we want to explore, systems we want to flesh out, and game modes we want to add to make it even more replayable," say the devs, talking about the decision to launch into early access. "With our roots being in video game modding, we feel perfectly comfortable releasing something big and making it bigger over time at our own pace."</p>
<p>Heck. It's been a decent few months for boomer shooters. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/phantom-fury-review">Phantom Fury</a> was another setpiece <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> inspired by Half-Life era blastin', and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mullet-mad-jack">Mullet Mad Jack</a> was and ultra-stylish corridor crash, according to Ed's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mullet-mad-jack-review">review</a>. We might be reaching a point of retroshoot saturation but, if I'm honest, one more homage to F.E.A.R. will not go amiss. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trepang-2">Trepang2</a> came out last year with the same love for the much-lauded 2005 psychological bulletdrama, and we quite liked that too. "Oh, I do enjoy shooting these faces!" wrote Alice O (RPS in peace) in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trepang2-review-its-an-indie-fear">review</a>. For fans of this type of game it truly has been good eatin'. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/">pick up Selaco on Steam for £21/$25</a>.</p>

  <p id="tKh0sI"><strong>Fortnite Crew </strong>is a monthly subscription service for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/fortnite-battle-royale/40155"><em>Fortnite</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="xUFOCQ">Members who subscribe to Fortnite Crew receive access to the current Battle Pass, a top up of V-Bucks to their account, and perhaps most importantly, exclusive cosmetics through the Fortnite Crew Pack.</p>
<p id="i7pF7R">As an additional incentive to keep subscribing, you also receive bonus Legacy Styles for certain skins for each additional month you remain a subscriber.</p>
<hr id="T6SQrd">

<p id="2EI5pO">The Fortnite Crew Pack for June 2024 is the <strong>Jing </strong>skin. You can take a closer look at the skin and related accessories, its Legacy Styles and Lego Fortnite style in the following posts by <a href="https://x.com/BuonannoJayden/status/1794778253057749261">BuonannoJayden</a> and <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1793921291465933029">iFireMonkey</a> on X:</p>


<p id="XUkjYt">As shown, the skin has a number of Legacy Styles to unlock<strong> </strong>the longer you keep your Fortnite Crew subscription — with a total of six styles (across five additional months) to unlock.</p>

<p id="qoNtzk">At least, for now; Epic has said “previous Crew Packs’ items may be made available again to Crew members at a later date,” but practically, if you have your heart on a certain pack, be sure to subscribe and claim while you can.</p>

It was just every sentence, I would be yelling ‘Sonic, give me that f***ing Chaos Emerald!’ or something like that. I had no idea what was going on but I just went with it, and I had fun.

<p>Following the move to go independent following Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Toys for Bob has announced that it has reached an agreement with Xbox to publish its next game.</p>



<p>Taking to Twitter, Toys for Bob announced, “We’re excited to announce that we’ll be partnering with @Xbox to publish our next new game. We’re still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit – but know that we’re working hard on an experience we’re so sooo inspired about! Can’t wait to share more.”</p>



<p>The tweet was followed by a purple heart emoji, which could be a subtle nod to Spyro the Dragon, rumored to be the next game the developers are working on.</p>



<p>In March 2024, it was rumored that Toys for Bob reached an agreement that will see the newly independent studio make its first game for Xbox. Matt Booty made the announcement, however, he did not share what the studio’s next game will be.</p>



<p>As Toys for Bob announces, its next game is still early in development, so it’s likely far from being revealed or released.</p>



<p>What do you think Toys for Bob will be developing for Xbox? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

Players speculate the destruction of Meridia and its Terminid supercolony will lead into the release of a third faction, potentially the long-extinct Illuminate.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>MAJOR ORDER: OPERATION "ENDURING PEACE"</p><p>The time has come. We must eradicate the Meridia Supercolony via experimental deployment of weaponized Dark Fluid.</p><p>The destruction of an entire planet is a tragedy - but the tyrannical Terminids leave us no choice.

This led some to call the Major Order a “broken mess”, and nigh-on impossible to complete on the harder difficulties.</p><p>In a post on the Helldivers <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102974129734434919/1246073418995208203" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>, community manager Baskinator confirmed a hotfix is inbound to tackle the problem: “Thank you to everyone that made us aware of the spawning bug in the current Major Order,” Baskinator said. “A hotfix is currently being worked on for that issue and will be deployed as soon as possible. We'll let you know as soon as it's available.”</p><p>The hope is this hotfix will hit Helldivers 2 sooner rather than later, given the Major Order itself has an expiry date of early next week. Some are now calling for Arrowhead to extend the Major Order to encourage more players to jump in after the bug is squashed.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Helldivers 2 Polar Patriots Premium Warbond Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>This week, Arrowhead revealed it is in the process of setting the studio up so it can “make more and better stuff” in the long-term. In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1d2pozq/hello_fellow_helldivers_greetings_from_the_newly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an introductory post on reddit</u></a>, CEO Shams Jorjani, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-is-now-its-chief-creative-officer-i-care-more-about-weapon-balance-than-qbrs"><u>who recently replaced previous Arrowhead CEO and current Chief Creative Officer Johan Pilestedt</u></a>, said the studio has had to adjust to the enormous success and higher profile Helldivers 2 has brought to the company.</p><p>PlayStation 5 and PC co-op shooter Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time, having shifted an incredible 12 million copies in just 12 weeks since going on sale earlier this year. Amid the huge revenue Helldivers 2 has generated, Arrowhead itself has suffered a number of crises, including launch server problems and, most recently, a battle with Sony itself over the console maker’s controversial attempt to force Steam players to account link to PlayStation Network.</p><p>Arrowhead plans to add to Helldivers 2 in meaningful ways to keep players interested in its live service, but some have called on the developer to take more time with balance patches and Premium Warbond releases after recent efforts fell flat, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-says-it-will-take-more-time-with-patches-to-maintain-the-quality-standard-we-want-and-you-deserve"><u>Arrowhead has indicated that’s what it intends to do</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/thousands-of-people-are-booting-up-steam-to-click-on-a-picture-of-a-banana/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=thousands-of-people-are-booting-up-steam-to-click-on-a-picture-of-a-banana<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="211" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I’d like you to try to remember the simplest and most repetitive game you’ve ever played. Okay, now get ready to relegate that game to second place, because that dubious honor now belongs to <em>Banana</em>. </p> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">I’m talking about a game where you simply click on the still image of a banana as many times as you can. No, I’m not talking about a game such as <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cookie-clicker-tips-and-strategy-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cookie Clicker</a></em> where repeatedly clicking on a cookie will bring you new results for <strong>days</strong> on end.</p> <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="733" data-injectable="true"><em>Banana</em> is a different thing, because as far as in-game events go, nothing happens beyond seeing the counter that tells you how many times you’ve clicked on the banana — or on the screen, really — go up a number. So, why did the good folks at <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/banana-a-game-where-you-rapidly-click-on-a-jpeg-of-a-banana-and-nothing-else-has-an-all-time-peak-of-31124-players-on-steamheres-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamer</a> find more than 30,000 people clicking on that banana at the same time? Yes, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2923300/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB</a> shows that a little bit over twenty hours ago, more people were clicking on the banana than they were playing <em>Diablo 4 </em>and <em>Fallout 76.</em></p>
 <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="true">It turns out that it’s not because of the game itself — for most people, at least, I hope. The thing about <em>Banana</em> is that it’s an Egglike, the term that journalist Harvey Randall used to define the genre before anyone had the courage to, so that’s what it’ll be for now on. <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2784840/Egg/">Egg</a></em> is a game about, well, clicking an egg. Thing is, in both games, clicking will get clickers some sort of actual rewards. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="681" data-injectable="true">It works somewhat similarly to Steam’s collectible game cards. Thing is, whereas you’ll earn a limited amount of cards just by having a regular game open on the background, <em>Banana</em>‘s bananas can be amassed by playing the game for one minute, then for spamming clicks for every three hours, and there’ll be a chance to earn a rare banana once every 18 hours. </p>
 <p data-characters="545" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true">All in all, this is a bizarre way to pass your time and to try to earn some money — some of these bananas are getting sold for dozens of bucks. Still, there are a few interesting surprises here. One, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/banana-a-game-where-you-rapidly-click-on-a-jpeg-of-a-banana-and-nothing-else-has-an-all-time-peak-of-31124-players-on-steamheres-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamer</a> states that <em>Banana</em> has a surprisingly wholesome community, meaning that people are probably aware of the bonkers-ness of it all, and are in it also for the laughter. Second, just how refreshing is it to learn of a wacky game revolving around pictures, that has nothing to do with damn NFTs or any sort of dumb Blockchain-driven stuff?</p>
 <p data-characters="87" data-current-count="87" data-injectable="false">You can now try to earn hundreds or perhaps even thousands of cents on <em>Banana</em> on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923300/Banana/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-new-skyrim-mod-expands-a-pivotal-dark-brotherhood-quest.886368/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/a-new-skyrim-mod-expands-a-pivotal-dark-brotherhood-quest/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=a-new-skyrim-mod-expands-a-pivotal-dark-brotherhood-quest<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="258" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Can anyone even remember what vanilla <em>Skyrim</em> looks like? I think we’ve all collectively decided that what Bethesda released all those years ago is a far cry from what many of us experience today, thanks to the near-endless array of mods we can install.</p> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="235" data-injectable="false">No one in the modding community seems more dedicated to improving <em>The Elder Scrolls 5</em> than <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/118229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JaySerpa</a>. Ever keen to inject a bit more immersion, this time they’re bringing us an expansion of one of the more interesting side quests.</p> <figure data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Destroy The Dark Brotherhood - Quest Expansion" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a8gNJ0Ctbf0?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">In the base game, “Destroy the Dark Brotherhood” does exactly what it says on the tin, in that it tasks you with killing the merry band of murderers that dwell within the assassins’ Sanctuary. In this updated version from JaySerpa, however, a few additional things have been added, presumably to give the standard mission a bit of <em>umph</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-improves-the-lackluster-original" data-injectable="false">Improves the ‘lackluster’ original</h2> <p data-characters="38" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">As the description on Nexus Mods says:</p> <blockquote data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true"> <p>This mod introduces new lore-friendly ways to get kidnapped by Astrid (allowing you to Destroy the Dark Brotherhood even after sparing Grelod) while also expanding the actual quest to destroy the DB with new dialogue, choices, more memorable fights and a more cohesive quest. Enjoy!</p> </blockquote>
 <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">It essentially implements two things by giving you an alternative way to meet the Brotherhood without having to kill Grelod the Kind, while also making “Destroy…” itself a bit longer. It does this by not giving you the password to the Sanctuary immediately, meaning you have to seek it out. The mod also comes with new voices, which have either been spliced from vanilla dialogue or has been recorded.</p>
 <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="311" data-injectable="false">Basically, it’s one more reason why people keep playing <em>Skyrim</em>. So long as there are mods out there that expand or improve upon the 2011 release, we’re going to keep seeing <em>TES5</em> in the gaming limelight. <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> is seriously going to have to do a lot of work to match this kind of legacy.</p>

            <p>Supermassive Games has delayed the release of Little Nightmares 3, saying it needs "a little extra time to prepare".</p>
<p>In a statement posted to X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, the Dark Pictures developer said that "as much as [it] can't wait for you to return to the Nowhere", "quality is a top priority" and that's why it's decided to "shift the release of the game to 2025".</p>

<p>"Ever since the announcement of Little Nightmares 3 at Gamescom last year, we've been thrilled to see our community buzzing with excitement and anticipation," the team said.</p>
<p>"As much as we can't wait for you to return to the Nowhere, we also want to make sure we give the game the care and love it deserves. Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way.</p> <div>

<p>"For this reason, we've made the decision to shift the release of the game to 2025."</p>
<p>The statement closes with the promise that more information will come "later this summer", and thanked fans for their patience and "ongoing support".</p>
<p>Announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-3-in-development-from-dark-pictures-studio-supermassive">back in August</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-3-in-development-from-dark-pictures-studio-supermassive">Little Nightmares 3 marks the first time a mainline entry in the series won't be handled by original developer Tarsier Studios</a>. Supermassive Games - the team behind The Dark Pictures Anthology and Until Dawn - is at the helm, taking players on an adventure following two new protagonists. Sadly, though, despite the two protagonists can be played via online co-op, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-3-doesnt-have-couch-co-op-to-preserve-atmosphere-and-immersion">couch co-op will not be an option</a>.</p>
<p>"Co-op was the most requested feature from our fans, so it was really important for us to give them that," Bandai Namco producer Coralie Feniello said when the game was announced. "I do think that it will add a layer to the game as well, by letting you experience it with a friend.</p>
<p>"But at the same time, we really want the player to experience it as they want. So that's why we kept single player, so if you don't play online co-op you would be able to play with AI with you."</p>

There’s no place for racism in this world.” Likewise, <em>The Acolyte</em>’s showrunner Leslye Headland was ready to say much the same to her series’ pre-emptive detractors. </p><p> “As a fan myself, I know how frustrating some <em>Star Wars</em> storytelling in the past has been. I’ve felt it myself,” Headland said in her own comment to the Times. “I stand by my empathy for <em>Star Wars</em> fans. But I want to be clear. Anyone who engages in bigotry, racism, or hate speech … I don’t consider a fan.” </p><p>Time will tell just how <em>The Acolyte</em> weathers this kind of bad-faith criticism—after all, part of what has made the backlash over the series so absurd beyond its clear bigotry is that it’s based on a series most people haven’t seen much of beyond a trailer yet (for what it’s worth, the people who <em>have</em> seen it seem <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/acoltye-reviews-star-wars-reactions-jedi-sith-disney-1851498522&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/acoltye-reviews-star-wars-reactions-jedi-sith-disney-1851498522">to largely enjoy it</a></span>).

<p>With the recent announcement that God of War Ragnarok is finally coming to PC, everyone with an interest is preparing their systems. To do so, it’s important to first learn the God of War Ragnarok PC system requirements, so here you go!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-god-of-war-ragnarok-system-requirements-on-pc">The God of War Ragnarok System Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>I don’t know about you but I prefer knowing whether my system can run an upcoming game beforehand. It’s not like I’m going out to buy a new part to run a single game, but it can help temper expectations. Here are the minimum and recommended system requirements for God of War Ragnarok on PC:</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 or Later</li>



<li><strong>GPU</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 / AMD Radeon RX 5500XT</li>



<li><strong>CPU</strong>: Intel Core i3 8100 / AMD Ryzen 3 1300X</li>



<li><strong>RAM</strong>: 16GB</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 90GB SSD</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 or Later</li>



<li><strong>GPU</strong>: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 / AMD Radeon RX 6800</li>



<li><strong>CPU</strong>: Intel Core i7 9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 3700X</li>



<li><strong>RAM</strong>:16GB</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>:90GB SSD</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-how-long-to-beat-god-of-war-ragnarok-on-pc">How Long to Beat God of War Ragnarok on PC?</h2>



<p>Assuming your system can run God of War Ragnarok once it launches on PC, let’s take a look at how much time you’ll squeeze out of the action adventure. On average, players spend approximately 27 hours completing the main story, up to 55 hours completing every bit of content in the main game, and another 10 or so hours completing Valhalla.</p>



<p>That said, Valhalla is a premier roguelite game mode that adds countless challenges and new gameplay mechanics to the fray. You can easily spend far more than ten hours playing through the available content!</p>

                <p>Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Rockstar Games parent company Take-Two, has weighed in with his thoughts on how new technology like generative AI could impact the video game industry. Speaking at the <a href="https://wsw.com/webcast/cowen162/ttwo/2064582" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TD Cowen Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference</a>, Zelnick said generative AI will absolutely shake up how games are made, but it will not reduce employment levels.</p><p>"Generative AI will allow us to do a bunch of things more efficiently, so we'll turn out attention to other things. Those other things will probably still be costly and time-consuming," he said. "I don't think for a minute that generative AI is going to reduce employment. That's crazy. That's actually crazy. It's not going to make people irrelevant. It's going to change the nature of certain forms of employment. And that's a good thing."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA VI) Trailer Breakdown</p>

<p>As an example, Zelnick said in the 1870s, around 65-70% of the US population made their living in the agriculture business. Today, that number is around 1-2%. People aren't working those jobs as much these days because people don't generally enjoying getting their hands dirty (and increasingly farmers don't either, Zelnick said, pointing to advancements in automation in the farming business).</p><p>"When was the last time you ran into someone who said, 'It's horrible. I can't get a job as a farmer. I'm trying. I'm unemployed. There are no farming jobs for me,'" he said.</p><p>Beyond the video game industry, Zelnick foresees "certain people" losing jobs to AI, like those who work in call centers for "routine" things like helping someone buy a sofa online. A pop-up box that shows up on a furniture website helping you make a purchase is already AI in action, and the human who had that job previously may now be working somewhere else and potentially earning more, Zelnick said.</p><p>"These are competent people who are highly educated. Better jobs came along that probably pay them more. I'm in a WhatsApp chat with a bunch of Silicon Valley CEOs and the conventional wisdom out there is that AI is going to make us all unemployed. It is just the stupidest thing I've ever heard. The history of productivity tools is that it increases employment. It increases value. It increases yield. It enhances growth. All of these things will happen," he said.</p><p>Shifting back to video games specifically, Zelnick said Take-Two has been in the AI business since its very first days in the form of computer programming. Take-Two has already benefitted from numerous game development tools that have led to many yield efficiencies, he said, and costs have gone up, too.</p><p>"Those efficiencies were created, and allowed us to turn our attention to more complex activities that continue to engage and delight consumers," he said.</p><p>Zelnick has been one of the more outspoken video game executives on the subject of AI. Before this, he said AI has a lot of potential for video games, but it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-true-gta-competitor-wont-be-made-with-ai-take-two-boss-says/1100-6511244/" data-ref-id="1100-6511244">won't allow developers to create a GTA competitor with ease.</a></p><p>"It's not going to allow someone to say, 'Please develop the competitor to Grand Theft Auto that's better than Grand Theft Auto', and then they just send it out and ship it digitally and that will be that. People will try, but that won't happen," Zelnick said.</p><p>Take-Two recently announced a dramatic cost-cutting program that led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-parent-company-explains-why-it-just-canceled-games/1100-6523539/" data-ref-id="1100-6523539">hundreds of layoffs and numerous game cancellations.</a> Microsoft, too, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-phil-spencer-reflects-on-recent-mass-layoffs/1100-6522156/" data-ref-id="1100-6522156">heavily invested in AI and also had significant layoffs recently.</a> Electronic Arts, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-laying-off-around-670-people-sunsetting-unspecified-games/1100-6521460/" data-ref-id="1100-6521460">very enthusiastic about AI and slashed hundreds of jobs.</a></p>
