<p>In a video posted originally on Twitter (now X), and since shared on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mortalkombatleaks/comments/1mvg8d9/video_of_the_legacy_kollection_menu_ui/">Mortalkombatleaks subreddit</a> (thanks <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lwtovnr3y22f">Wario64</a>!), a list of games available on the collection is shown off, with two more titles revealing themselves at the bottom.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vtkshz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Those two games? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mortal_kombat_mythologies_sub-zero">Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/mortal_kombat_special_forces">Mortal Kombat: Special Forces</a>. Not two particularly beloved games, if memory serves, but every single game deserves to be preserved, so we're really pleased to see them here.</p>
<p>After all, it wouldn't be a true history lesson or timeline if you simply covered all the cracks, and some people probably like these games.</p>

<p>Those unaware of these two Mortal Kombat spin-offs, let's take you through them. Mythologies: Sub-Zero launched on the N64 in 1997 (shortly after the PS1 release)and focuses on the elder Sub-Zero Bi-Han, who is on a quest to find Shinnok's amulet. Acting as a prequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mortal_kombat_4">Mortal Kombat 4</a>, this isn't a traditional fighting game, it's a side-scroller with a little light platforming but similar controls to earlier MK games.</p>
<p>Special Forces was a PlayStation exclusive that came out in 2000 and, similarly to Sub-Zero, focuses on an individual character in Jax and is a completely different genre, a top-down action-adventure game. The game suffered from development issues and Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias, along with others at Midway, left part-way through development.</p>
<p>We're sure to get an official announcement from Digital Eclipse or Atari pretty soon, but it doesn't look like these are the last additions to the game, either.</p>
<p>We already know the game is getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-gets-proper-physical-release-on-switch-2">a full physical release on Switch 2</a>, which is excellent news, so we hope we're getting an official release date, which hasn't been announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/whoops-it-looks-like-mortal-kombat-legacy-kollections-release-date-has-leaked-early">despite numerous leaks</a> over the weeks.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-5-price-hike-us</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-prices-to-increase-in-the-us-from-tomorrow.1275918/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced a price hike for PlayStation 5 hardware in the US, with all three major models of the PS5 getting price increases starting from tomorrow.</p>

<p>In a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Sony says that due to a "challenging economic environment" (which the company says that "many global businesses" are also navigating), the recommended retail price for PS5 hardware will be increasing from August 21st.</p>

<p>The base PlayStation 5 model will be going up to $549.99, the PS5 Digital Edition (which, as a reminder, doesn't come with a disc drive) will cost you $499.99, and the PS5 Pro will jump to a fairly eye-watering $749.99. Again, as a reminder, the Pro doesn't come with a disc drive either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-5-price-hike-us-models.jpg?itok=nDxwzatd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-5-price-hike-us-models.jpg?itok=4US4gvOx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS5's base models will be getting a price hike, as will the PS5 Pro.</figcaption></figure><p>While the PS5 hardware itself will be getting price rises, the console's accessories will remain at their current recommended price, and there are "no other price changes to announce for additional markets", Sony says.</p>

<p>This move is in line with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-prices-raised-hardware-software" rel="nofollow">similar decision made by Microsoft</a> back in May, with the tech giant blaming "market conditions" for putting up the prices of its Xbox Series X|S consoles, as well as certain games in the holiday season.</p>

<p>However, Microsoft subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-outer-worlds-2-70-dollars-xbox" rel="nofollow">walked back its decision</a> to charge $80 for certain major releases (including&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>), although there's every chance prices will rise in future.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, Sony hasn't committed to charging $80 for its games either, with holiday releases like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date" rel="nofollow">the upcoming&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date" rel="nofollow">Ghost of Y≈çtei</a>&nbsp;</em>costing $70 as usual. Other publishers, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-no-80-pricing" rel="nofollow">like EA</a>, also won't be raising their game prices for the foreseeable future.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-playstation-5-price-hike.jpg?itok=-1TusAgq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-playstation-5-price-hike.jpg?itok=Q0Wbocng 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony won't be hiking its game prices any time soon.</figcaption></figure><p>The market conditions that have necessitated this PS5 price hike are also likely what's stopping Microsoft from announcing pricing for its ROG Xbox Ally handhelds, which are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rog-xbox-ally-release-date" rel="nofollow">due to launch in October</a>.</p>

<p>It's likely said market conditions are referring to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg7jjkvzmkxo" rel="nofollow">tariffs</a> imposed on many countries around the world by President Donald Trump, with components and manufacturing processes becoming exponentially more expensive for many hardware manufacturers as a result.</p>

            <p>
If the creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-4">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of War 4</a> get their way, the grim darkness of the far future is actually going to be a lot like that halycon summer I spent back in 2010, playing through the first Dawn Of War for the very first time. In a new interview following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-4-announced-delivers-ork-screamy-rtsness-next-year">last night's announcement</a>, KING Art Games co-founder Jan Theysen has described Relic's original real-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game as the new sequel's "guiding star" - specifically for its grander battles and greater emphasis on base-building versus the second game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-dawn-of-war-ii">more focussed, borderline action-RPG campaign</a> and the third game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-3-review">MOBA-inflected, something-for-everyone approach</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Speaking to Wrrrammer Youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TY_dYhAnWg">The Great Book Of Grudges</a>, Theysen explained that the decision to track it all back to DOW1 came from discussion with players of the developer's previous alternate-history RTS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/iron-harvest">Iron Harvest</a>. "A lot of the feedback was '[it would be] be great if we would have bigger armies, or if we would have more base building, and more fortifications, and all of that stuff'," he said. "And so for us, relatively quickly, we said, 'OK, we feel like this is the way to go'. Instead of going more in the Dawn Of War 2 direction, let's go for Dawn Of War 1 and basically make something like a modern interpretation or an evolution of Dawn Of War 1." 
</p>
<p>
Theysen added that "we obviously also looked at Dawn Of War 2 and 3 and whatever we found might work for the game we wanted to make, we absolutely used that. But Dawn Of War 1 became our guiding star." MOBA-mislikers rejoice, I guess.
</p>
<p>
Dawn Of War 4 doesn't cut-paste ideas and mechanics wholesale from the first game, of course, for time is a river that only runs in one direction, whether it's stained with Ork blood or no.</p>
<p>"What you can't really do is just take this stuff that worked 20 years ago, put it in the modern game and expect [it to work]," Theysen went on. The new RTS strives for the same feel, however. In particular, the developers have given attention to the "relatively drawn-out" battles of the first game, and how they challenge you to weigh the value of a single objective against your base economy and the fortunes of the wider conflict.
</p><p>
"It's not like you go there and it's fast time-to-kill and then you go to the next point," Theysen commented. "But it was a little bit like if I really wanted to, you know, I can really make sure that I don't lose this point, right? Because I can invest resources, I can bring units back and heal them, you know, and then I can bring in reinforcements and so on, right? And so if I really want, I can maybe win the battle, but then I might lose the war, right?" Dawn Of War 4 also aims to cultivate this tension in terms of how and when you upgrade units.
</p>
<p>
The discussion of tactics vs strategy sits nicely alongside discussion of the game's four factions, later in the interview - that's the dauntless Space Marines, the ever-rioting Orks, the skeletal pharaonic Necrons and the crusty modem-humping spannerheads of the Adeptus Mechanicus.</p>
<p>I really like the sound of the last two and their base dynamics. The Adeptus Mechanicus can deploy the noosphere, a cybernetic network, to AOE-buff their units and structures, providing they arrange them more craftily than, say, the Orks. As the opposing player, you'll want to sabotage the noosphere connections to disempower the other Admech fortifications.</p>
<p>The Necrons, meanwhile, gain defensive advantages such as living metal healing while on their home turf, and benefit from slow and steady expansion. There's a link between the area they control and how fast they accumulate resources, so you might want to contain them early, before they sprawl too far.
</p><p>
All of which makes me want to fire up the other three Dawn Of War games this evening and make comparisons - my memories of the Relic trilogy are hazy, but I can certainly relate to the overarching observation about Dawn Of War's clashes being more protracted. I guess the other question here is what exactly they've carried over from the other two games. I suspect we'll need to go hands-on before we know the answer.
</p>
<p>
Some plot recap to close: Dawn Of War 4 takes place on planet Kronus, 200 years after the events of Dawn Of War expansion The Dark Crusade. It's got four singleplayer campaigns - four! Our skullcups runneth over, etc - together with skirmish, co-op, competitive multiplayer and the returning Last Stand mode. It's out in 2026.

            <title><![CDATA[Subnautica 2 Developer Unknown Worlds Sues Former Leadership]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/subnautica-2-developer-unknown-worlds-sues-former-leadership/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Unknown Worlds, the studio behind the Subnautica franchise, has filed a lawsuit against three of its former leaders, accusing them of abandoning the company, misappropriating confidential data, and scheming to rush Subnautica 2 to market in order to secure a massive payout.</p>



<p>The suit, which was <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/904055347/Unknown-Worlds-Entertainment-v-Cleveland-McGuire-and-Gill-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=tUP1182XR5apSqla4qJM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">filed on August 15</a>, targets studio co-founders <strong>Charlie Cleveland</strong> and <strong>Adam ‚ÄúMax‚Äù McGuire</strong>, along with former CEO <strong>Ted Gill</strong>, all of whom were fired on July 1, 2025. According to the complaint, the trio <strong>‚Äúlargely abandoned‚Äù</strong> their duties as Subnautica 2‚Äôs creative and technical leads while simultaneously downloading tens of thousands of company files in the days before their termination.</p>



<p>The dispute traces back to Krafton‚Äôs 2021 acquisition of Unknown Worlds for <strong>$500 million</strong>, with an additional <strong>$250 million earnout</strong> tied to the successful development and release of Subnautica 2. Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill, described at the time as essential to the franchise‚Äôs future, stood to collect roughly 90% of that earnout.</p>



<p>Instead of staying engaged, Unknown Worlds claims Cleveland shifted to filmmaking, McGuire focused on his passion project Moonbreaker, and Gill allowed the studio to drift without oversight. Development of Subnautica 2 slipped years behind schedule, with Krafton reviews describing the 2025 builds as ‚Äúunready‚Äù and lacking core gameplay.</p>



<p>By 2025, with the earnout deadline approaching, the lawsuit says that the three executives pressed Krafton to release Subnautica 2 in an unfinished state, despite internal and external feedback that the game could damage the franchise. When Krafton refused, they allegedly threatened to <strong>self-publish the game</strong> to capture revenue for the earnout window.</p>



<p>Unknown Worlds also accuses the trio of <strong>taking company secrets on their way out the door</strong>. Between the start of June and July 1, 2025, McGuire allegedly downloaded nearly 100,000 files, Cleveland about 72,000, and Gill exported his entire company email account. The studio says the three refused to return their devices or confirm what information they retained, and even threatened to delete all of the files entirely.</p>



<p>Unknown Worlds is seeking <strong>injunctions, the return of confidential data, and monetary damages</strong> for the delays, brand harm, and breach of duty it says the defendants caused. It also wants to prevent any further use or disclosure of its files.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill‚Äîthrough Fortis Advisors, which represents former shareholders‚Äîhave filed their own suit against Krafton, seeking to be reinstated and to force payment of the earnout. That case is headed for an expedited trial in November.</p>



<p>Fan reaction to the firings has largely sided with the company. On Reddit, one user summed up the prevailing mood: ‚ÄúThis is defending the game, not the execs. Because those three were literally not involved in it in any way.‚Äù</p>



<p>In a lawsuit filed on August 15, Unknown Worlds is suing co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, along with former CEO Ted Gill for ‚Äúabandoning‚Äù their roles at the studio after the acquisition by Krafton.</p>



<p>This lawsuit is in addition to the others <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/krafton-doubles-down-former-subnautica-2-executives-abandoned-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">involving Krafton</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-subnautica-2-leadership-suing-krafton-after-firing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the former leadership</a>. As of publishing, none of the accused parties (McGuire, Cleveland, or Gill) have publicly responded to the lawsuit.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Rising video game and console prices have frustrated consumers this year, and today, Sony is adding its flagship console to the list of products getting price hikes. In the United States, the PS5, PS5 Digital Edition, and PS5 Pro are each increasing in price by $50.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/">a blog post</a> from Sony Interactive Entertainment vice president of global marketing, Isabelle Tomatis, the change is due to "a challenging economic environment." This brings the new prices for each device to the following:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>PlayStation 5 ‚Äì $549.99</li><li>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition ‚Äì $499.99</li><li>PlayStation 5 Pro ‚Äì $749.99</li></ul><p>As of today, prices remain unchanged in other countries, but <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/14/sony-raises-playstation-5-price-in-europe-australia-new-zealand-and-more">many of them faced price hikes earlier this year</a>. This news comes a few months after Sony said it was considering raising its prices in the US, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/14/sony-is-considering-price-hikes-to-cover-trumps-tariffs-but-it-might-not-affect-ps5">but it might not affect consoles</a>. That was, obviously, not the case. Other instances of companies increasing prices lately include <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/01/switch-accessories-alarmo-and-amiibo-prices-are-rising-but-not-switch-2">Nintendo increasing Switch 2 accessory prices</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/01/xbox-console-and-accessory-price-increases-begin-today-80-first-party-games-starting">Xbox raising its console and game prices back in May</a>.

		<p>11 bit Studios has released a brand new trailer for the console version of Frostpunk 2, which shows how the development team has adapted the game for controller use. The console version of Frostpunk 2 will make use of radial menus for a lot of aspects of the game, including construction of the city, decision making, and exploration. The user interface has been designed so console players can easily navigate the menus and options that make up the gameplay of Frostpunk 2, and you can see it in action below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Frostpunk 2 | Console Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YNIyRe-Buc8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Frostpunk 2 is set 30 years after the events of the original Frostpunk, taking players into the age of oil and all of the issues that come with that, both technological as your society moves on from coal and social strife that will divide the inhabitants.</p>
<p>We didn‚Äôt review Frostpunk 2 for its PC release, though will look to catch up on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/20/frostpunk-2-wins-polish-game-of-the-year-at-digital-dragons/">Polish Game of the Year</a>&nbsp;game when it hits consoles, but looking back at that original game, Jason wrote in our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/03/frostpunk-review/">Frostpunk review,</a>&nbsp;<em>‚ÄúFrostpunk is a horrifyingly playable post-apocalyptic survival game that demands more out of you than most games ever could. Each decision and each sacrifice you make is hard on your city and on you. There are so many impossible choices and no win situations that the game is almost hard to play, but it‚Äôs so compelling that you will be unable to step away from it. The only real negative is the sheer overwhelming nature of the world the game is set in, and really that is more of a compliment to the designers than anything else.‚Äù</em></p>

<p>Frostpunk 2 will launch for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on 18th September,</p>

              <p>There‚Äôs a large storm forming on the horizon. This October, around 40 games across all kinds of genres, franchises, and scales are set to launch on every major platform under the sun. There‚Äôs no escaping it. There are likely at least two games (or more!) in October that you‚Äôll want to play, including stuff like <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-closed-weapon-system-better-beta-ea-bf6-2000618282"><em>Battlefield</em> 6</a> and <em>Moonlighter 2</em>. So batten down the hatches and get ready to ride out the video game super storm that is coming in just a few short months.</p> <p>Here‚Äôs the full list of planned October releases as of August 20:</p> <ul> <li><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> ‚Äì October 2</li> <li><em>Gigasword</em> ‚Äì October 2</li> <li><em>Neon Inferno</em> ‚Äì October 2</li> <li><em>Borderlands 4</em> on Switch 2 ‚Äì October 3</li> <li><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> ‚Äì October 3</li> <li><em>Absolum</em> ‚Äì October 9</li> <li><em>Painkiller</em> ‚Äì October 9</li> <li><em>Barbie Horse Trails</em> ‚Äì October 10</li> <li><em>Battlefield 6</em> ‚Äì October 10</li> <li><em>Little Nightmares 3</em> ‚Äì October 10</li> <li><em>Nascar 25</em> ‚Äì October 14</li> <li><em>Just Dance 2026</em> ‚Äì October 14</li> <li><em>Ball x Pit</em> ‚Äì October 15</li> <li><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em> ‚Äì October 16</li> <li><em>Keeper</em> ‚Äì October 17</li> <li><em>The Elf on the Shelf: Christmas Heroes</em> ‚Äì October 17</li> <li><em>Escape Simulator 2</em> ‚Äì October 21</li> <li><em>Bloodlines 2</em> ‚Äì Oct 21</li> <li><em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em> ‚Äì October 21</li> <li><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> ‚Äì October 21</li> <li><em>Double Dragon Revive</em> ‚Äì October 23</li> <li><em>Moonlighter 2</em> ‚Äì Oct 23</li> <li><em>Plants Vs. Zombies: Replanted</em> ‚Äì October 23</li> <li><em>The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles</em> ‚Äì October 23</li> <li><em>Fast &amp; Furious: Arcade Edition</em> ‚Äì October 24</li> <li><em>Once Upon a Katamari</em> ‚Äì October 24</li> <li><em>Ire: A Prologue</em> ‚Äì October 28</li> <li><em>The Outer Worlds 2 ‚Äì </em>October 29</li> <li><em>Arc Raiders ‚Äì </em>October 30</li> <li><em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em> ‚Äì October 31</li> <li><em>Mina the Hollower</em> ‚Äì October 31</li> </ul> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460">On Tuesday, during Gamescom Opening Night Live,</a> I noticed a few games received October launch dates. I wondered to myself how many other games were arriving in that same month. Checking online, I discovered a giant list of October releases. This is one of the most jam-packed months I‚Äôve seen in some time. It‚Äôs not just that a lot of games are arriving in a short window, but how varied the list is. We have big open-world AAA games, like <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> and, on Switch 2, <em>Borderlands 4.</em>&nbsp;But we also have smaller games like <em>Ball X Pit</em> and <em>Moonlighter 2</em>. There‚Äôs a park builder courtesy of <a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-leak-october-ps5-baby-dinos-1851783878"><em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em></a> and a massive online shooter in the form of <em>Battlefield 6.</em> New <em>Pok√©mon</em> and <em>Digimon</em> games, a fresh <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, a big Obsidian RPG, a creepy horror game, vampires, and even a fucking Christmas game. Heck, the new Double Fine game, <em>Keeper</em>, is out in October, and I‚Äôve been waiting years for that studio‚Äôs next project. Now it‚Äôs coming, but sandwiched between, like, six other games I want to play.</p> <p>What‚Äôs going on here? Well, some of this is just normal video game industry stuff. Studios want to get their games out before the holiday shopping season. But I bet some of these games were holding off until they knew what Rockstar was planning with <em>Grand Theft Auto 6.</em> And once it became clear October and November wouldn‚Äôt be dominated by <em>GTA 6, </em><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta6-grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026-1851778799#:~:text=Copied!&amp;text=Rockstar%20has%20announced%20that%20GTA,time%20to%20create%20the%20game.">as Rockstar delayed the open-world game to May 2026</a><em>,</em> some publishers and devs likely committed to launching in the spookiest month of the year.</p> <p>Sure, maybe a few of these get delayed, but I‚Äôm not holding my breath. October isn‚Äôt that far away, so I‚Äôd expect most of these games to be locked in and not budge to November or later. That‚Äôs a scary thought as someone who works at a video game website. While I‚Äôm excited to have new stuff to play and write about, I wish it were a bit more spread out. Such is life. Good luck out there, folks, and remember: You can‚Äôt play it all, so play what you can and enjoy the ride.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Welcome to <em>Beastro</em>! In this charming fusion of fantasy adventure, not all heroes wield swords‚Ä¶ Some prefer the spoon. And, sometimes to save the world you‚Äôve got to start with a really good meal.</p><p>Palo Pori is a beautiful and peaceful village of artisans and tastemakers. Beyond the village‚Äôs protective wall, darkness has begun to stir. Ravenous monsters have claimed the land and threaten to sink their teeth into this final morsel of hope and happiness.</p><p>Play as Panko, a young, talented chef, helping to run the local eatery. When Panko‚Äôs teacher goes missing, a mysterious visitor arrives with warnings of the dangers beyond the wall. It‚Äôs up to Panko to step up and take over the restaurant and tend to the ingredients and patrons. But that‚Äôs not all, Panko also finds himself serving the Caretakers, brave adventurers, sent to save the world. In this adventure, preserving peace starts in the kitchen!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>From Town to Table</strong></p><p>In Palo Pori, fresh is best! Gather ingredients and resources, care for animals and grow your own fruit and veg to build up your very own cozy town to table restaurant. Forage for wild herbs and unlock new seeds to grow to expand your meals.</p><p><strong>Serving Your Community</strong></p><p>Chop, flip, and sizzle your way through mouthwatering mini-games as you whip up delightful dishes for the townsfolk. Good food is always better with company, so work hard to improve your <a title="Genres > Cooking [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a> and experiment with ingredients, to keep your patrons happy.</p><p>Tailor your restaurant to the tastes of your community, develop new meals, progress your know how through a skill tree and adjust the decor to increase your restaurant‚Äôs appeal.</p><p><strong>Feed the Caretakers</strong></p><p>You‚Äôll also need to feed the hungry Caretakers; these brave denizens of the land will venture out into the wilds to fight the ravenous monsters threatening the peace of Palo Pori. Each Caretaker hails from their own flavour region, affecting their own tastes and preferences: some like it bitter, some like it sweet and some are just looking to fulfil their craving of the day! Craft thoughtful meals and balance the flavour profiles to boost their spirits, sharpen their skills, and unlock new abilities. Because let‚Äôs face it‚Ä¶ Who can save the world on an empty stomach?</p><p><strong>Delicious Deck Building</strong></p><p>Now it‚Äôs time to put your meal to the test! This is where taste meets tactics. The dishes you serve will build your Caretaker‚Äôs deck ‚Äì each ingredient unlocking a card. And once they‚Äôve eaten, they‚Äôll venture into the wilds to fight the monsters. Upon their return, they‚Äôll recount their journey and play out their battles through a charming puppet theatre sequence. They might even bring you back some MONSTEROUS ingredients from their ventures. Fight the monsters in turn-based deck building combat, inspired by traditional trick-taking card games. Outplay the monsters, by matching their flavour magic or neutralising it with a balancing card. Add an enhancing card to power up your moves! Your magic can turn the tables!</p><p>Utilize the unique effects of your ingredients to put your enemies to sleep, blow away their cards, and more, but watch out, you‚Äôre not the only one with special abilities. If you‚Äôre not paying attention, you might get burned.</p><p>In this food-based fantasy adventure, it‚Äôs time to give peas a chance! ‚Äì Are you ready to get cooking?</p><p>Unlock the magic in food.</p></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/culinary-fantasy-adventure-game-beastro-announced-for-xbox-series-pc]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Multiplayer in Call of Duty games has become colorful over the last few years, as players have been able to dress up as their favorite celebrities and pop-culture icons before dropping into a match. Between WWE performers and I Know What You Did Last Summer's iconic slasher, there have also been original creations mixed in, and this has been met with a mixed reception by the playerbase. With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> on the way, Activision has spoken about how it's listening to fan feedback and how it will "calibrate" what it has to offer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-set-for-november-cod-next-coming-in-september/1100-6534015/">when the game launches in November</a>.</p><p>"We have thought about this, and I think if you look at us, we're always looking at community feedback," Black Ops 7 associate creative director Miles Leslie said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-devs-paying-attention-to-community-feedback-on-goofy-skins" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a>. "We always try to make sure that we are trying to touch the widest audience. I've had the pleasure of working on Call of Duty now for almost 20 years, and we're constantly looking at ways to push into different audiences and fans, and that's what you saw with that; there are fans that really love it. Obviously, there are fans who those may not be their favorite. We're going to try to calibrate that as we move forward, and we take that feedback seriously."</p>

            <p>
El Presidentes assemble! Tropico 7 - the latest entry in Kalypso Media's Caribbean-set city building sim - is official and heading to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, PC, and Game Pass next year.
</p>
<p>
The original Tropico debuted in 2001, melding elements of city building, resource management, and political wrangling that gave players the freedom to run their tropical island either as a feared dictator or peace-loving statesman. The series has changed hands multiple times since then, with developer Limbic Entertainment taking the reins for 2019's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tropico-6">Tropico 6</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for the newly revealed Tropico 7, it's being helmed by Gaming Minds Studios (Port Royale 4, Railway Empire 2) and features a new story campaign playing out across 5 maps. That's alongside 20 additional sandbox maps, a random map generator, and 10 extra scenarios. There's also talk of new terraforming tools, a new council feature serving as a focal point for your political machinations, a new nemesis in Victoria Guerra, and more.

		<p>Sony has announced that it will be raising the prices of the PlayStation 5 consoles in the US. While Sony does not give the reasons why, it is likely to do with the the tariffs that the US Government has brought in over the past several months, which has caused prices to rise across various goods for consumers in the country. The full statement from Sony is as follows.</p>
<p><em>Similar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment. As a result, we‚Äôve made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. starting on August 21.</em></p>


<p><em>The updated recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. are as follows:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>PlayStation 5 ‚Äì $549.99</em></li>
<li><em>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition ‚Äì $499.99</em></li>
<li><em>PlayStation 5 Pro ‚Äì $749.99</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The recommended retail prices for PlayStation 5 accessories remain unchanged, and we have no other price changes to announce for additional markets.</em></p>

<p>As stated the price rises come in tomorrow, August 21st so if you are in the US and were waiting to get a PS5 now is probably the best time to get your order in.</p>

It's been a staple in <strong>Mario</strong> games for a long time, so it's pretty natural to assume things would be similar here. Except it isn't, but the change actually makes a lot of sense here. And we have one Shigeru Miyamoto to thank for that.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ndw.jp/dkbananza-interview-250820/">Nintendo Dream</a> (translated by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lwthqxjaqk2c">Nintendo Patents Watch on Blusesky</a>), the game's director, Kazuya Takahashi, revealed that Miyamoto was the one who suggested that 'B' should be Dig, not Jump.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4nthupl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Acknowledging that B has historically been the jump button in many Nintendo platformers, Takahashi said "Miyamoto-san pointed out to me, <em>‚Äú'for digging downward, wouldn‚Äôt the B button be more intuitive?'</em>" And, given that the B button is the bottom face button... yeah, that makes sense.</p>

<p>Seems like Takahashi agrees, too ‚Äî "When I actually tried it, this key mapping indeed felt more intuitive. So that was Miyamoto-san‚Äôs suggestion." Well, there you go then.</p>
<p>Of course, for those traditionalists who can't get over the B button not being jump, there's the option to assign Jump to the B button. All's right with the world, then.</p>
<p>There are some other fun tidbits in the interview, like how long the team spent balancing the sound of DK's footprints with the sound of destruction. It's worth checking out the whole piece for a real deep dive into DK's latest outing.</p>
<p><em>Are you still enjoying Donkey Kong Bananza? Have you swapped the Jump and Dig buttons around? Let us know in the usual spot.</em></p>

			<p>Amidst all the craze of <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a>, PlayStation has slipped in the news that the PS5 and PS5 Pro are going up in price in the US starting tomorrow, August 21, 2025, following price increases in <a href="https://wccftech.com/major-ps5-price-increase/">Canada</a> three years ago and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">in Europe and the UK and other regions in the world this past April</a>.</p>



<p>Basically, the price of the consoles is going up $50 across the board.</p>



<ul>
<li>PS5 (with disc drive) - was $499.99, will be <strong>$549.99</strong></li>



<li>PS5 (without disc drive) - was $449.99, will be <strong>$499.99</strong></li>



<li>PS5 Pro - was $699.99, will be <strong>$749.99</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Sony's chief financial officer, Lin Tao, confirmed this past May that the company was looking at a <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-is-considering-a-ps5-price-increase-in-the-us-in-response-to-tariffs/">price increase in the US as part of Sony and PlayStation's response to US tariffs</a>, and today that increase was revealed, though Sony doesn't come out and directly blame the increase on tariffs.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/">PlayStation Blog post</a>, the vice president of global marketing at Sony, Isabelle Tomatis, writes that the increase is happening as a result of Sony's journey to "<em>continue to navigate a challenging economic environment.</em>"</p>



<p>Pricing around official PlayStation accessories "<em>remain unchanged</em>" for now, and it seems like, at least for the near future, PlayStation fans around the globe don't have to worry about price increases in their regions, as Tomatis writes, "<em>we have no other price changes to announce for additional markets.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There‚Äôs a persistent belief that in order for sharks to breathe underwater, they must keep on swimming. While this is partly true for a few species, the myth likely stems from how certain types of fishes (bony fish, if you want to know) need to breathe through constant motion, inhaling and pushing a huge amount of water through their gills as they swim. As the misconception goes, for sharks, much like their aquatic peers, to cease movement is to spell certain death ‚Äî which is exactly how it feels playing <em>Sword of the Sea</em>.</p><p>The new game from Giant Squid scales this idea up by orchestrating movement into a grandiose, stirring symphony. Similar to the studio‚Äôs previous work ‚Äî the underwater adventure <em>Abz√ª </em>‚Äî <em>Sword of the Sea</em> is an eco-fantasy about restoring the sea and its ecosystem in an arid landscape. Perched atop a sword, you surf across shifting dunes, leap toward dilapidated structures swallowed by sand, and unearth remnants of an ancient civilization that met its end in an unknown catastrophe.</p><p>The melody lifts as you backflip and perform ollies through this mural, with the music eventually soaring as you revitalize the landscape. You flit through the undulating contours of the seascape, the shoals now humming with new life. You spin in elegant arcs with the sea creatures that emerge, vaulting among the schools of fishes that make their unceasing journey toward the sky.</p><p>The seamless fluidity of movement in <em>Sword of the Sea</em> is deeply mesmerising. As a figure known only as the Wraith, you skate and flow through dunes and waves in search of ways to repopulate the barren desert with aquatic life. This can be done by completing simple puzzles, such as plunging your sword into craters or lighting up clusters of lanterns, which are typically found on higher grounds that you‚Äôll need to perform acrobatic stunts to reach. That‚Äôs when emerald water and lush green grass will burst forth from these craters, with scores of fishes crashing through the dunes and floating jellyfish materializing with a pop, offering you access to previously unreachable heights.</p><p>Gliding through the freshly revitalized lands is even more exhilarating. Subsequent chapters include more ways to boost your movement to a thrilling degree, such as beacons for gliding across and glowing orbs you can collect to ramp up your speed.</p><p>Despite this focus on speed, the game doesn‚Äôt rush you to move on, even after restoring an area. Spending a few minutes nailing heel flips off the crests and troughs of the waves, and reveling in motion amid dense schools of fishes, is tantalizing. At the same time, you can seek and collect trinkets used to unlock new skateboarding tricks, like a double jump or kick flip. These are moves that you can string together ‚Äî and put to the test ‚Äî through optional timed puzzles.</p><p>This affinity the game has for kinetics, however, never supplants the sense of reverence it holds for the sea. The sea life isn‚Äôt just a resource or a means to a utilitarian end; you don‚Äôt simply hop on and steer the local fauna, such as orcas and turtles, toward the highest peaks or your next destination, although you can ride on them to enjoy a leisurely swim underwater. Other sea creatures, such as a dolphin and a shark, appear mythical and godlike, and you can later enlist their help in your expedition to traverse even greater distances. Sailing through the choppy waters with the aid of these majestic beings is particularly enchanting, as they jump over crumbling buildings and careen into towering crystals ‚Äî feats you‚Äôll never manage on your own.</p><p>These moments are accentuated by bright, cel-shaded aesthetics, which makes the ocean appear almost celestial and otherworldly. There‚Äôs also a symbiotic relationship between the Wraith and the sea life they‚Äôve helped rehabilitate. Glowing algae, nesting at the edges of once-buried rooftops, helps you to jump higher, while tapestries of giant seaweeds allow you to float upstream, making your travel much more seamless. It‚Äôs a necessary reminder of how humanity plays a pivotal role in conservation efforts, and that we, in turn, can only benefit from the ocean‚Äôs well-being.</p><p><em>Sword of the Sea</em> ratchets up the tension in its final chapters, leading to a climatic sequence that involves vanquishing the source of its calamity with breathtaking grace. It‚Äôs a fitting finale, but it also doesn‚Äôt mark the end. Instead, the game extends an invitation to redo your run again from the beginning, this time armed with a speedometer and a proposal to shave off more minutes, or even seconds, off your own record. It wants you to skate faster, jump higher, and plunge harder into the sea.</p><p>Not only is <em>Sword of the Sea</em> a celebration of the ocean, its love for unrestrained motion is also a metaphor for ‚Äî and an homage to ‚Äî the sheer vibrancy of underwater life. It‚Äôs an adventure I dove right into again, my skateboard surging with the pulse of the sea.</p><p><sub>Sword of the Sea <em>is available now on the PS5, Steam, and Epic Games Store.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTI4Mg=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Khee Hoon Chan</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/762217/sword-of-the-sea-review-ps5-steam]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sony has announced that it is raising the price of the PlayStation 5 (PS5) in the United States.</p>



<p>Starting on August 21, the price of the base PS5 will rise to $549.99, the PS5 Digital Edition will jump to $499.99, and the PS5 Pro will cost $749.99. All increases are $50 from their previous prices.</p>



<p><strong>‚ÄúSimilar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment,‚Äù </strong><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sony said</a>. <strong>‚ÄúAs a result, we‚Äôve made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. starting on August 21.‚Äù</strong></p>



<p>Sony‚Äôs move follows price increases of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-to-increase-ps5-price-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platform in different regions</a> already. It also follows the decisions <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-is-raising-the-price-for-all-xbox-series-consoles-accessories-and-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-to-raise-switch-prices-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo to raise</a> the price of their hardware in recent months. </p>



<p><strong>‚ÄúThe recommended retail prices for PlayStation 5 accessories remain unchanged, and we have no other price changes to announce for additional markets,‚Äù </strong>Sony added.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Journey solo or in two-player co-op to save the world from an ancient evil.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Positive Concept Games and game management platform indie.io announced at gamescom Wednesday that 16-bit action RPG Shrine‚Äôs Legacy will release October 7 on Steam. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you‚Äôre not already familiar with Shrine‚Äôs Legacy, it‚Äôs inspired by classic RPGs of the SNES era and blends that retro look with more modern real-time combat and puzzle solving. The story takes place in a land called Ardemia, a magical world threatened by a returning evil. It can only be saved by uniting the Sword of the Shrine and the eight elements of magic scattered across the world.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/19/3-1755628114233.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as two young heroes, Rio and Reima. Rio is heir to the Sword and a descendant of the last hero to banish the ancient evil, while Reima is a mage who‚Äôs been desperately seeking the Sword. The two are brought together by the rise of this evil and will go on a journey to find the eight elements before it‚Äôs too late.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That journey will take you across an expansive world full of dungeons to explore, puzzles to solve, and secrets to discover. Investigate its nooks and crannies to find crafting materials and magical jewels, and face down treasure-guarding bosses to earn stat-increasing items and learn powerful spells. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/19/2-1755628162405.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a character-focused tale, one that will force its two heroes to deal with pain, tragedy, and loss. Vanquishing an ancient evil isn‚Äôt possible without sacrifice, and we won‚Äôt go into spoilers here, but you‚Äôll find out just how much Rio and Reima are willing to lose to successfully complete their quest. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can play all of Shrine‚Äôs Legacy either solo or in two-player co-op. As you could probably guess from their descriptions, Rio is a melee fighter and Reima is a ranged magic user. If you play solo, you can swap between them at any time, with AI controlling whichever character you‚Äôre not actively playing. For co-op, you can go the old-fashioned way and play with a friend on the couch or pair up online via Steam Remote Play Together or Parsec. Either way, there‚Äôs full controller support and customizable keyboard controls.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/19/1-1755628218433.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to try Shrine‚Äôs Legacy for yourself, there‚Äôs a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1435720/Shrines_Legacy_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">free demo</a> available on Steam now.

Because the prices aren't yet live, neither are pre-orders.</p>

<p>The handheld is made in partnership with Asus, a company that has been producing the ROG Ally handheld for a few years now. The cheaper models currently retail for around $500 USD, so it's likely that a partnership between Asus and Xbox would go for around that amount or higher.</p><p>Xbox's release date announcement also detailed some of the handheld's new features, including a handheld compatibility program, which helps to indicate which games are best suited for handheld play, similar to the Steam Deck's verification program. On Xbox, games will either be "Handheld Optimized" or "Mostly Compatible," with the latter requiring "minor in-game setting changes for an optimal experience on handheld." There's also a "Windows Performance Fit" rating to judge how well the game will run on your device.</p><p>Stay tuned to our Game Informer coverage to see our hands-on impressions with these devices.

            <p>Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/">announced</a> that it is raising the price of the PS5 in the US. The price increase of $50 affects all PS5 models and will come into effect from 21st August.</p>
<blockquote><p>Similar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment. As a result, we‚Äôve made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. starting on August 21.</p>
<p>The updated recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5 ‚Äì $549.99</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition ‚Äì $499.99</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Pro ‚Äì $749.99</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Sony stated that its prices for PS54 accessories are unchanged, and that there are no price changes to announce for additional markets.</p>
<p>The PS5 has already seen price rises in other markets, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">UK getting its own hike back in April</a> this year. Australia and New Zealand also got the news back then that they'd have to pay more to own a PS5.</p>
