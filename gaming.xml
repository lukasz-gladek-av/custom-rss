            <p>
If there were ever a dead horse that didn't need so much flogging, it might be the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> series. Undeniably beloved by many, it has fallen victim to that whole franchising thing, having received an entry only in 2024 via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, a sequel game that was perhaps a little bit too messy. And here we are, in 2026, with PEGI potentially spoiling the reveal of a new entry in the series subtitled Reunion. Spoilers ahead for the game!
</p>
<p>
You can see as such on the official PEGI ratings board website by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-be-still-my-irritated-heart">simply searching for Life is Strange</a>, with Reunion popping up right at the top. There is even an entire outline of the game, revealing that this one brings about the return of none other than Chloe Price, who was absent from the most recent entry.
</p>
<p>
"Chloe Price was Max Caulfield’s partner in time… Losing her is Max’s greatest regret," reads the game's synopsis. "Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max’s help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus."
</p>
<p>
Welp! This sure sounds like a game the Life is Strange fandom will feel incredibly normal about. There are also some more PEGI-oriented references to parts of the game, like there being a scene where the player (presumably Chloe) has her drink spiked at a party, alongside some apparent depictions of "strong, realistic violence," with numerous references to suicide. Sounds heavy, but par for the course with this series.
</p>
<p>
This just being a PEGI rating, there's zero word on when a proper reveal might come, so you'll have to wait to see what this one ends up looking like.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New PEGI rating data has surfaced for an unannounced Life Is Strange title.</p>



<p><em><strong><a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=life%20is%20strange&amp;op=Search&amp;age%5B0%5D=&amp;descriptor%5B0%5D=&amp;publisher=&amp;platform%5B0%5D=&amp;release_year%5B0%5D=&amp;page=1&amp;form_build_id=form-81eGuZckjPQ3buJikytFNQNQ7dlj2m3r6HpbbuwqoKs&amp;form_id=pegi_search_form">PEGI rating information</a></strong></em> has been leaked for an unreleased game in the popular Square Enix series. Titled Life is Strange: Reunion, it was rated 16 for violence, strong language, and drug use.</p>







<h2 id="h-reasoning-for-the-pegi-rating-in-life-is-strange-reunion">Reasoning For The PEGI Rating In Life Is Strange: Reunion</h2>



<p>The rating information notes that the game features a character realizing that her drink has been spiked, and she begins to experience hallucinations. There is also a recap from a previous game in the series, which includes a scene where a girl is shot in the torso.</p>



<p>Overall, the rating is in line with most other games in the franchise, excluding Life Is Strange 2, which was rated 18.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to the information, the game had a tentative release date of March 27, 2025, on the PlayStation 5. However, that time has clearly passed. The most recent release in the series was Life is Strange: Double Exposure, released in 2024.</p>







<p>Most recently, it was announced that a TV series based on the video game franchise would be coming to Amazon Prime Video. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-show-announced-prime-video/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

                <p>More than a decade after launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online/" data-ref-id="5000-140736">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> will finally get cross-play, as developer ZeniMax Online Studios has confirmed it's actively working on the feature. However, it might still "be a while" until the feature is ready.</p><p dir="ltr">While cross-play has long been something ZeniMax Online has said it wants to do and has explored options for, this is the first time the developer has confirmed it's actually happening, though there is not yet a clear idea of when, exactly, the feature will arrive.</p><p dir="ltr">"Cross-play is definitely coming, but it's going to be a while," ESO executive Susan Kath said as part of a virtual Q&amp;A attended by GameSpot ahead of the game's 2026 preview livestream. "Just to set the stage on that. We are working on it. It is a complex problem for a game like ESO--it was not ever built with this in mind. There are a lot of considerations we have to make."</p><p dir="ltr">Though it might still be a bit of a wait, Kath said players could potentially see some tests related to the feature by the end of the year.</p><p dir="ltr">The news came as part of recent livestream previewing the year ahead for the nearly 12-year-old MMORPG, which is moving to a seasonal content release model in 2026 in contrast to the yearly chapter (expansion) releases that have defined the game for most of its life.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, ESO players can only play with other players on their respective platforms, with separate servers for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation players. ZeniMax Online has previously outlined the technical problems that have prevented cross-play up to this point, including issues stemming from the game being built without cross-play in mind, concerns surrounding each server's separate economies, problems around performance, and the fact that PC players can play with game-modifying add-ons that console players can't.</p><p dir="ltr">Cross-play was just one of the big announcements ZeniMax Online shared for its long-running MMO, as it also detailed what else players can expect in the months and year to come.</p><p dir="ltr">After a transitional 2025 that also saw the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">ZeniMax Online team hit by Microsoft layoffs</a> and its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-elder-scrolls-online-teams-reportedly-canceled-mmo/1100-6533760/" data-ref-id="1100-6533760">unannounced MMO project Blackbird canceled</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-the-elder-scrolls-online-is-going-all-in-on-seasons-in-2026/1100-6537219/" data-ref-id="1100-6537219">2026 is the year ESO is going-all-in on seasons</a>, complete with the introduction of a battle pass system called Tamriel Tomes. The year will also see the introduction of several class reworks, new experimental zones and activities, the introduction of solo dungeons, and the addition of previously paid DLC content like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-onlines-dark-brotherhood-and-thieves-guild-dlc-will-soon-be-free/1100-6537209/" data-ref-id="1100-6537209">Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild into the base game for free</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online/" data-ref-id="5000-140736">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> is continuing to expand, as previously paid DLC content for the Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, and more will soon become part of the base game for free.</p><p dir="ltr">In March with the game's Update 49, the Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, Imperial City, and Orsinium DLC will be folded into the base game and become accessible for all players. Closer to the end of the year, the Greymoor chapter will also become part of the base game.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, ESO players need to subscribe to the game's optional ESO Plus membership (around $15 a month) or purchase each DLC separately using the game's premium currency, Crowns, in order to access the content outlined above.</p><p dir="ltr">Orsinium, released in 2015, added the homeland of the orcs and new dungeons for players to explore at the cost of 3,000 Crowns, or around $25. The Imperial City DLC, released in 2015 for 2,500 Crowns (roughly $20), saw players return to one of Oblivion's most iconic locations in an effort to stop Molag Bal's daedric forces from abusing the seat of power at the center of Tamriel.  Both the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild DLC released in 2016 for 2,000 Crowns each, translating to about $20 per DLC.</p><p dir="ltr">With the Dark Brotherhood DLC, players are able to join the shadowy organization of assassins and gain access to a new Assassin passive skill line that more easily allows for the murder of NPCs. Those who join the Thieves Guild gain access to sneaking-and-stealing-focused passive skills, allowing players to make more money from stolen goods and access special treasure troves hidden across Tamriel.</p><p dir="ltr">Greymoor, meanwhile, will be the biggest addition of the bunch when it becomes free sometime in the winter of 2026. The chapter originally released in 2020 and introduced the western regions of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/games-like-skyrim/2900-5554/" data-ref-id="2900-5554">Skyrim</a>, where players can embark on a quest to stop an ancient vampire lord.</p><p dir="ltr">The news of previously premium DLC becoming free came as part of a recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-the-elder-scrolls-online-is-going-all-in-on-seasons-in-2026/1100-6537219/" data-ref-id="1100-6537219">ESO 2026 roadmap</a> livestream. During the presentation, developer ZeniMax Online Studios outlined its plans for its MMORPG in the year ahead--one that includes a new seasonal focus, the addition of a battle pass, and class reworks. ESO's move to a seasonal model comes after a transitional 2025 that didn't see the release of a new chapter. Instead, 2025 saw the release of one experimental season, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-online-is-ditching-chapters-in-favor-of-more-frequent-bite-sized-updates/1100-6528526/" data-ref-id="1100-6528526">Seasons of the Worm Cult</a>, that played out over the course of the year.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to free DLC, ZeniMax Online also confirmed it's working to finally bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-is-finally-getting-cross-play-but-it-might-still-be-a-while/1100-6537192/" data-ref-id="1100-6537192">cross-play to ESO</a> in the future, though it sounds like it could still be a while before players on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation are able to play together.</p>

Those new chapters added new regions of Tamriel for players to explore, additional story content, optional paid DLCs, and, occasionally, things like new classes and systems.</p><p dir="ltr">ZeniMax Online announced in 2024 that going forward, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-online-is-ditching-chapters-in-favor-of-more-frequent-bite-sized-updates/1100-6528526/">ESO wouldn't have a traditional yearly chapter release</a>, labeling 2025 as a "transitional" year as the team prepared to focus on its plans for 2026. In a recent livestream and subsequent press Q&amp;A attended by GameSpot, the developers have now revealed what ESO's 2026 will look like, and it includes more experimental seasonal content, battle passes, new story content, solo dungeons, a PvP progression system, class reworks, and more.The team also announced its long-term goals for the game, including that it's looking to finally introduce cross-play between platforms, as well as long-requested features such as guild mail and guild housing.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4631357-eso_seasons-roadmap_infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631357" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4631357-eso_seasons-roadmap_infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631357"></a><figcaption>ESO's 2026 roadmap, which ZeniMax Online Studios stresses is still subject to change.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4631357-eso_seasons-roadmap_infographic.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Game director Nick Giacomini said ZeniMax Online has heard from players that ESO's longrunning chapter-based structure had become "too formulaic," and jsaid it was also limiting from a development standpoint. Its move to a more seasonal model is in the name of being able to more quickly bring fresh ideas and gameplay to the nearly 12-year-old MMORPG.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's something players have been asking us to do for a really long time--to pause and work on addressing pain points, and build the future of ESO together," Giacomini said. "This is the beginning of a major shift, just like One Tamriel was a decade ago, where we are going to be making major changes, just in a completely different way."</p><p dir="ltr">Each season will be completely different, Giacomini said, all the while giving the team the flexibility to improve and iterate on parts of the core game.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Goodbye Chapters, Hello Seasons</h2><p dir="ltr">As part of the seasonal model, all future content updates will be free, a major change from most of ESO's existence when players needed to buy new chapters or various DLC packs to experience most of the game's new content. Should future seasons add new zones, additional storylines, or new systems, all those additions will come to players free of charge. There will be four seasons a year, with each season lasting three months.</p><p dir="ltr">"In general, the things that were rolled out as chapters, those will just be game updates from now on," executive producer Susan Kath said.</p><p dir="ltr">ESO's transformation will begin with Update 49 in March, when it will bake the game's premium <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-onlines-dark-brotherhood-and-thieves-guild-dlc-will-soon-be-free/1100-6537209/" data-ref-id="1100-6537209">Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood, Imperial City and Orsinium DLCs into the base game</a>. That update will also mark the first time ZeniMax Online will release an ESO update simultaneously across PC, Xbox, and PlayStation, the new normal going forward.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630772-esoseasons2026lavawhip.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630772" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630772-esoseasons2026lavawhip.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630772"></a><figcaption>Season 0 will bring big changes to the Dragonknight class.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630772-esoseasons2026lavawhip.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Next, in April, ESO's first proper season will kick off. Titled Season 0, it will bring with it a major class update for Dragonknight that will see its skills and visuals reworked, as well as updates to the two-handed weapons skill line. Season 0 will also add a new experimental event zone called The Night Market.</p><p dir="ltr">This new zone is designed to be much harder than typical overworld combat in ESO (something the team is also looking to address later this year with a new Overland difficulty setting). It's a group-focused PvE zone where players are encouraged to group up and push farther and farther into the zone. Players will choose one of three factions to represent, earning rewards along the way. Those rewards will include a new upgradable house (the first to include a bank), as well as a new gameplay-effecting reward type ZeniMax Online is keeping quiet about for now.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the Night Market is billed as a limited-time event, it will return later in 2026 after its initial run. Should it prove popular, ZeniMax Online said it could potentially become a permanent feature.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Tamriel Tomes</h2><p dir="ltr">The release of Season 0 will also see the launch of the game's new battle pass system, called Tamriel Tomes. This system will replace the game's existing daily challenges and login rewards. Instead, there will be weekly and seasonal challenges (with the ability to re-roll unwanted weeklies) that will progress the battle pass as players complete them.</p><p dir="ltr">As players progress the tome, they'll be able to unlock free cosmetic rewards ranging from armor appearances to new skill styles, as well as currencies like Seals of Endeavor. In typical battle pass fashion, there will be a free version as well as $15 and $30 premium versions that come with additional cosmetics. Premium versions of the battle pass won't expire, allowing players to continue progressing them after the end of a season.</p><p dir="ltr">Going hand-in-hand with Tamriel Tomes is the new Gold Coast Bazaar, a system that sounds similar to World of Warcraft's Trading Post. The bazaar will sell various cosmetics and former limited-time rewards, as well as some new ones. Items will rotate in and out but will be available for long durations, like the entirety of a season, Giacomini said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630773-esoseasons2026thenightmarket.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630773" data-ratio="0.56246648793566" data-width="1865" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630773-esoseasons2026thenightmarket.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630773"></a><figcaption>The Night Market will offer far greater challenges than ESO's typical content.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630773-esoseasons2026thenightmarket.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Items in the bazaar can be bought with a new currency, Trade Bars, earned primarily through Tamriel Tomes but also in small amounts in-game. While most of the available Trade Bars will be found in the free version of each seasonal battle pass, the paid versions of Tamriel Tomes will additionally include a small amount of the currency. But you won't be able to purchase Trade Bars directly with Crowns, ESO's premium currency.</p><p dir="ltr">"Over the years, we've introduced so many limited-time cosmetics...and if you missed them, it was either impossible to get them again, or we would re-introduce them unpredictably or inconsistently," Giacomini said. "The bazaar provides a consistent and reliable place for players to finally be able to claim these rewards."</p><p dir="ltr">The introduction of Tamriel Tomes and the Gold Coast Bazaar will bring some changes to ESO's optional subscription, ESO Plus. Its price won't change and no benefits are being removed, but additional benefits will be added, such as subscribers earning battle pass progress at an accelerated rate. Every month a player is subscribed to ESO Plus, they'll also earn credit towards a free premium Tamriel Tome upgrade that can be bought once 12 credits have been earned. These credits don't have to be earned consecutively, meaning players can subscribe to ESO off and on and still accumulate credits to eventually be used for a premium Tamriel Tome.</p><h2 dir="ltr">ESO's 2026 Roadmap</h2><p dir="ltr">As for future seasons, ZeniMax Online made clear it is treating its 2026 roadmap as a living document that may change or shift over the course of the year, but it does have plans for what later seasons will include. Season 1, slated for late summer, will introduce new Thieves Guild content, multi-stage world events, a new trial, and new story content centered around the fan-favorite daedric prince Sheoggorath. The season will also bring class updates to the Warden.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 2 is slated for the winter, and will include Sorcerer class updates, the introduction of solo dungeons (a single-player version of the game's existing group dungeons), large-scale world events in Skyrim, and a still-shrouded-in-secrecy High Seas of Tamriel event that will involve naval combat. It will additionally add the game's Greymoor chapter into the base game.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the biggest requests ESO players have had over the years is cross-play. In the past, the studio has outlined the difficulties posed by linking its players across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, but it sounds like, at long last, it's doing the work to make that dream a reality. The only downside is that it sounds like cross-play might not be coming anytime soon.</p><p dir="ltr">"Cross-play is definitely coming, but it's going to be a while, just to set the stage on that." Kath said. "We are working on it. It is a complex problem for a game like ESO--it was not ever built with this in mind. There are a lot of considerations we have to make."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630780-eso2026seasonsfurnishings.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630780" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630780-eso2026seasonsfurnishings.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630780"></a><figcaption>Updates in 2026 will bring faster riding skill training and higher furnishing limits for some homes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630780-eso2026seasonsfurnishings.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While cross-play may take some time to arrive, there are other quality-of-life changes coming sooner. Some of the changes coming ahead of Season 0 include account-wide outfit slots, the ability to respecc skills and attributes for free from the game's user interface, and equal experience points for the skills on players' back action bar. Other improvements coming include faster riding training, with the ability to raise the skill by three points at a time instead of one, and the power to upgrade backs from the UI rather than having to travel to a vendor. Higher furnishing limits are coming to some houses as well.</p><p dir="ltr">That's far from an exhaustive list, and even more "player experience improvements" are slated for later in the year, according to ZeniMax Online's roadmap. Judging from the whole roadmap, each season looks wildly different from the last. That's by design, as Kath said the goal is for there to not be a "typical season" blueprint the studio is following. It's a sentinment Giacomini echoed.</p><p dir="ltr">"The key difference is variety and choice," Giacomini said. "We want to be building what's important to you, the players, and we believe this new model is the best way to do so."</p><p dir="ltr">More details regarding launch dates for ESO's Season 0, and new content like the Night Market, will be revealed in the coming months. ZeniMax Online studio director Rich Lambert said last year he wants ESO to be a "30-year MMO. However, he said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-online-studio-wants-to-make-other-games/1100-6534748/" data-ref-id="1100-6534748">studio does still want to make other games</a>, despite Microsoft recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">canceling an unannounced new MMO</a> from the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-elder-scrolls-online-teams-reportedly-canceled-mmo/1100-6533760/" data-ref-id="1100-6533760">codenamed Blackbird</a>.</p>

		<p>Seasons are coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/elder-scrolls-online">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> on 2nd April, as Bethesda look to make the biggest shakeup to the MMORPG’s continued development in a long, long time. Chapters are out with quarterly Seasons coming in, bringing all new content and features for free to all players, and a new battle pass system known as Tamriel Tomes. Oh, and all updates will now be launched simultaneously across PC and consoles.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to cover, so let’s get exploring everything announced during the stream.</p>

<p>Going from Chapters to Seasons will come with a transition period. Season Zero launches in April and will be followed by Season One and Two later this year on a three month cadence.</p>



<p>Compared to Chapters, this means you will still see quarterly updates for the ESO, but the team point to this switch to seasons letting be more fluid and reactive to fan feedback and game needs, as opposed to the strict annual roadmaps that the team had worked to previously with the one major focal point in June of each year. That the shift to seasons was <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/67321">announced in December 2024</a> and is only coming to fruition in early 2026 is a sign of how inflexible this could be.</p>

<p>What will a Season contain? Well it could be new zones and storylines, it could be new events, a new or revamped class, skill line or system, a broad range of quality of life improvements, or some mixture of all of these.</p>
<h2>ESO Season Zero</h2>
<p>Starting with Season Zero the team are looking to blend a mixture of new features and revisiting older content. Update 49 will release on 9th March and precede the main Season Zero launch on 2nd April. This will then run through to 8th July.</p>
<p>The first ever group event zone in TESO will be added in the form of The Night Market –&nbsp;running from 29th April through June as a trial run that could see this return or become permanent. This PvE zone in Fargrave is designed to be genuinely difficulty to overcome, and while you don’t need to be in a guild to head there, but it will help if you’re in one, while there are unique rewards such as a new house to earn.</p>

<p>This comes alongside a new PvP progression system and the first iteration of a new overland difficulty setting, to up the challenge of simply getting around the world.</p>
<h2>Classic Content Revamps</h2>
<p>Alongside new content is the focus on raising the bar of quality. Visual refreshes and balance updates are going to rollout across the classes and combat styles, starting with the Dragonknight and two-handed weapon skill lines, continuing with the Werewolf, Warden and Sorcerer through the quarterly updates. Each Season will come with one main class to focus on, but smaller improvements sprinkled throughout. The aim is to make a single class more viable without needing to multi-class.</p>

<p>Core quality of life improvements will make outfits possible account-wide, as well as making skill and attribute respecs free within the UI, back bar XP, faster rider training, increased furnishing limits, and plenty more down the line, including guild housing, hybridisation and cross-play.</p>
<h2>OK, so where’s the battle pass, then?</h2>
<p>Of course, all of this still needs paying for in some fashion, and so there’s the new Tamriel Tomes battle pass with both free and premium tracks of rewards for new armour, weapon styles, crates and more. Daily login rewards are out to help reduce some of the FOMO, and you’ll be able to progress through the ranks with a mixture of weekly and seasonal points from questing, trials, PvP, crafting, dungeons and more –&nbsp;you’ll be able to re-roll weeklies that you dislike, to some extent.</p>

<p>There’s also the Gold Coast Bazaar, which will let you buy rewards including some previously time limited ones, with a steady pace to the shop refreshes. This use the Trade Bars earned through the Tamriel Tome (mostly on the free track) and from some other in-game activities.</p>
<p>Curiously, ESO Plus remains, and will continue to feature all of the standalone expansion contents of before, but the appeal of this optional subscription will be reduced. The main bonuses are accelerated Tome Point earning, and you’ll be able to get a free premium plus upgrade once a year for the Tamriel Tomes.</p>
<h2>Is this a good or bad thing for ESO?</h2>
<p>All in all, this could be a really positive move for The Elder Scrolls Online. There’s always the fear with battle passes that they become all-consuming engagement traps, and compared to older expansion pack models, seasons can often feel much less significant – it’s already been confirmed that you won’t see big new landmasses, but that the game will have smaller additions and look to revisit areas.</p>
<p>The benefit, though, is that this change helps to reduce the mental burden of stepping into a decade-old game and understanding what you need to buy to get the latest experience. Now it will (mostly) just all be there. And for existing players? The developers getting to be more responsive to feedback and making game changes more publicly and speedily is only a good thing.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Elder Scrolls Online Content Will Be Free; Seasons Model Debuts April 2, 2026 Across All Platforms with Season Zero: Dawn and Dusk]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-elder-scrolls-online-content-will-be-free-season-model-debuts-april-2-2026/</link>
            <guid>1399957</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Over a year ago, <strong>ZeniMax Online Studios</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-switch-from-yearly-chapters-to-seasonal-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that its MMORPG <strong>Elder Scrolls Online</strong> would transition from the expansion-like Chapter model to a seasonal model. However, 2025 was a transitional year in which the so-called <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-add-subclassing-and-seasons-of-the-worm-cult-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seasons of the Worm Cult</a></strong> still retained some elements of the Chapter model.</p>



<p>It is only now that the studio is launching the proper Seasons model, which will go live on <strong>April 2, 2026</strong>, with <strong>Season Zero: Dawn and Dusk</strong>. The reveal came today <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3KEv1KkCZM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during a livestream</a> that we at Wccftech, alongside other outlets, were able to watch in advance.</p>



<p>Right away, one big change is that for the first time in the history of Elder Scrolls Online, an update (specifically <strong>Update 49</strong>) will be released simultaneously on PC and consoles. This is a necessary first step toward cross-play, which the studio is still working on, although it will take some time to achieve it.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ESO_Seasons-Roadmap_Infographic-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Game Director <strong>Nick Giacomini</strong>, whom we <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-qa-zos-leadership-change-game-alive-30-years-unfortunate-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed at Gamescom 2025</a> after he took over from <strong>Rich Lambert</strong>, emphasized that the team has frequently heard from players that the game has become more predictable lately. This change <strong>can make the game more rewarding and exciting</strong>, he said, and the Chapter model limited ZOS because it took a long time to produce, leaving little room to react to player feedback or address longstanding issues.</p>



<p>Updates and content will still arrive quarterly, but ZOS is moving Elder Scrolls Online away from the templated and stale release cadence of a dungeon pack, a new featured zone, another dungeon pack, and so on. This model also lets the developers keep iterating on the core game. Perhaps one of the most significant changes is that <strong>all new content coming to the game will be free starting with Season Zero</strong>. No longer will there be barriers to playing a new Trial or dungeon with friends. </p>



<p>The goal is that each season may look completely different. Seasons will happen four times a year, be three months long, and each will contain a <strong>Tamriel Tome</strong> and access to the <strong>Gold Coast Bazaar</strong>. Tamriel Tomes are the game's version of a Battle Pass. </p>



<p>Each season has a unique Tome available for the full season. Everyone has access to the free version and progresses by completing weekly and seasonal challenges to earn Tome Points, unlocking pages and choosing rewards. By the way, ZeniMax Online Studios is reworking Daily Login Rewards and the Endeavors system within Tamriel Tomes. There are also <strong>two paid premium upgrade options for Tamriel Tomes</strong>. These unlock additional tiers of rewards (cosmetics, personalities, mounts). With the premium options, players can continue unlocking pages even after the season ends.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ESO_Tamriel-Tomes_Infographic.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The <strong>Gold Coast Bazaar</strong>, on the other hand, is a new in-game store dedicated to earnable rewards. This is a consistent place to claim limited-time cosmetics you might have missed in the past (events, Twitch drops, etc.), which is something the Elder Scrolls Online community had long requested. Items in the Bazaar are purchased with <strong>Trade Bars</strong>, which are earned primarily in the Tamriel Tomes but also through regular gameplay.</p>



<p>The developers also revealed they're getting rid of <strong>Event Tickets</strong>. Players with existing Event Tickets will receive Trade Bars in exchange. Unlike Event Tickets, there is <strong>no cap</strong> on how many Trade Bars you can hold. Trade Bars cannot be purchased with Crowns; they must be earned by playing.</p>



<p>What about <strong>ESO Plus</strong>, the current subscription model? Well, it's staying. Its price won't change and subscribers will accumulate one token for every 12 months they are subscribed, which they can use to unlock one Premium track for a Tamriel Tome of their choice. They also get a monthly grant of Tamriel Tome points and an accelerated earning rate for earning those in the game.</p>



<p>When it comes to content, Season Zero's highlight will be the first-ever <strong>Event Zone: </strong>the<strong> Night Market</strong>. This limited-time PvE zone set in <strong>Fargrave</strong> will be much more challenging than the usual zone, requiring players to group up (organically) to succeed. The zone also features a faction system. Players align with one of three factions, and there is a competition to see which faction makes the most progress. Of course, there will be various rewards, and even a brand new house with a <strong>Bank included inside</strong> for the first time. The Night Market will be available in the game from April 29 through mid-June, although the developers have opened up to the possibility of bringing it back and possibly making it permanent. Additionally, a first iteration of the optional <strong>Overland difficulty system</strong> is coming toward the end of Season Zero.</p>



<p>A new PvE group Trial called <strong>Crimson Veldt</strong> will be released in Season One, while Season Two will see the introduction of <strong>Solo Dungeons</strong>. These are one-man versions of existing dungeons, starting with <strong>Moon Hunter Keep</strong> and <strong>March of Sacrifices</strong>. Season One will also add new stories and quests based on the <strong>Thieves Guild</strong> and the Mad Daedric Prince, <strong>Sheogorath</strong>.</p>



<p>Throughout the year and beyond, the team has committed to a series of visual and combat improvements (including reduced floatiness) to enhance visuals for class and weapon abilities and improve class identity. It will start with the <strong>Dragonknight</strong> class and two-handed skill-line, then the <strong>Werewolf</strong> skill-line at the end of Season Zero, the <strong>Warden</strong> class in Season One, the <strong>Sorcerer</strong> class in Season Two, and so on.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ESO_Seasons_CombatRefresh_FieryBreath-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>But that's not all. The roadmap reveals that Season One will introduce <strong>multi-stage, dynamic world events for the first time in Elder Scrolls Online</strong>, as well as a new system called the <strong>Sage Vault</strong>. Moreover, Season Zero adds the first full-fledged <strong>PvP progression system</strong> to the MMORPG, and the studio said they are making big investments in Player-versus-Player content, including bringing back <strong>three-sided Battlegrounds</strong>, fixing spawn camping issues in maps like Mor Khazgu, adding ways to get around the Cyrodiil RvR map faster, and fixing Alessia, Ash, and Chalman keeps to stop players from <em>slingshotting </em>into inner keeps.</p>



<p>Before Season Zero: Dusk and Dawn, Update 49 will go live on <strong>March 9, 2026</strong> with the following quality of life improvements:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Free Respecs:</strong> You can respec skills and attributes directly from the UI at no cost.</li>



<li><strong>Guild Traders:</strong> Return to the 30-day listing window.</li>



<li><strong>Outfit Slots:</strong> These are becoming account-wide.</li>



<li><strong>Riding Training:</strong> Faster training duration.</li>



<li><strong>Attribute Points:</strong> You can now add stat increases in bulk (three at a time) rather than one by one.</li>



<li><strong>Mounts for Gold:</strong> Adding a brand new mount for gold and moving 16 existing Crown Store mounts to be purchasable with gold.</li>



<li><strong>Housing Limits:</strong> Furnishing limits are being increased on over half of the houses. ESO Plus members get an additional boost to limits.</li>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Back in September, studio game director Rich Lambert told GamesIndustry.biz that the Elder Scrolls Online team were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-online-is-switching-from-chapters-to-bite-sized-updates-in-the-wake-of-microsofts-awful-layoffs">exploring a move from big expansions to smaller, more frequent updates</a>. Jump ahead four months and, well, that's exactly what they're doing.</p>
<p>Wait, stop running away from me, I'm not bringing you old news reheated like the last of the (now decidedly whiffy) Christmas turkey leftovers, I come bearing fresh details like… a freshly cooked turkey that is seasoned with patch notes and battlepass infographics.</p>
<p>Yum.</p>
<!--more-->
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bethesda Softworks / Zenimax Online Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Ahead of the break for Christmas I was given details of the first three seasons coming in 2026 and then swiftly sworn to secrecy under threat of murder by the Dark Brotherhood. Thankfully that contract has now expired and that blade at my back sheathed. I can tell you that it's not just the cadence and scale of releases that's changing. All these new seasonal updates will be free for players, whether they're playing through Game Pass or paid up ESO Plus members.</p><p>On April 2, Zenimax Online Studios will release Season Zero for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">The Elder Scrolls Online</a>. This will then be followed by Season One in July and Season Two in October. Gone are the days of the 12 - 18 month wait between major expansions, and in their place is a new season model that sees smaller updates released every three months.</p>
<p>"We've heard from players that the game has become predictable and too formulaic," game director Nick Giaomini said at the pre-Christmas briefing. Adding that the chapter model was partly to blame: "It took 18 months, longer than that, to do. It was all hands on deck to support. That lead time just didn't really leave much room to react to player feedback or address long standing issues."</p>
<p>Unlike the chapter expansions, which contained broad baskets of new toys for all types of players, such as new areas to explore, storylines to follow, dungeons to crawl, and classes to unlock, seasons will be less generous but more focused. This change, Giaomini said, will give the team the "flexibility to make our game more exciting and invest in addressing long standing pain points, add features and improvements players have been asking for, and update and iterate on the core game, rather than always just chasing something brand new."</p>
<p>You can see something of that more bitesized approach in ESO's first three upcoming seasons, which make changes and additions across the game, not only focused in a new region.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bethesda Softworks / Zenimax Online Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In Season Zero, coming in April, there is a new PvE area called The Night Market, the introduction of a battle pass called Tamriel Tomes, a PvP progression system for Vengeance players, and new difficulty options for players wanting to up the challenge in overland areas. Alongside these new toys, the team is also providing an art and balance refresh for the Dragonknight class and the two-handed weapon skill tree. Later in the season there will also be a similar update to the Werewolf class.</p><p>Then, in July's Season Two update, alongside new quests for the Thieves Guild, multi-stage co-op world events, and a new trial called the Crimson Veldt, the team is working on a similar balance and art refresh for the Warden Class.</p>
<p>October's Season Three brings a new dungeon, dynamic world events, and a refresh for the Sorcerer class.</p>
<p>The updates remind me of Ubisoft's approach to Rainbox Six Siege Seasons. After the shooter got a little long in the tooth, they slowed the expansion of the game and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rainbow-six-siege-operation-health">announced Operation Health</a>. Ubisoft used each new season as an opportunity to overhaul older maps and characters to better fit in with all the new content that had been released in the years since. It was a healthy change, and meant that characters released early in the Siege's history and fell out of use gained a second wind.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bethesda Softworks / Zenimax Online Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This shift to seasons also sees many of the previous expansions – the Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood, Orsinium, and the Imperial City – rolled into the base game. Previously, you had to buy these as separate DLC or be a paying ESO Plus member. Naturally, Zenimax isn't doing this out of the goodness of its heart. Seasons brings a new way for you to spend your coin in the Elder Scrolls Online.</p><p>Tamriel Tomes is ESO's new battle pass system. A new Tome is released each season and it brings an unlock track where you can earn rewards by completing certain challenges within the game. Challenges might mean completing certain dungeons, crafting certain items, or competing in PvP. Complete the challenges, earn points, and spend those points on rewards. Those rewards are largely cosmetic, with new armour sets, furnishings for your homes, and Seals of Endeavour (the in-game currency you use to buy Crown Crate items).</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bethesda Softworks / Zenimax Online Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While there is a free Tamriel Tomes battle pass, there are also two paid upgrades which unlock extra tiers and rewards to be earned in each season. However, the unlocks don't have to be earned within the season's timespan, which is a bit of a blessing.</p>
<p>The shadow over all of these changes is that Microsoft gutted the studio back in July, when they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">laid off more than 9000 employees</a> across the corporation. Zenimax staff <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-staff-discuss-microsofts-inhumane-mass-layoffs-and-how-the-future-looks-for-the-carcass-of-workers-that-remains">described the cuts at the time</a> as "inhumane", coming swiftly and giving little opportunity for fired workers to even say goodbye. The team was working on a new project, codenamed Blackbird, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-studios-canned-blackbird-game-was-a-nimble-high-flying-shooter-claims-report">which was cancelled as part of the downsizing</a>.</p><p>What Giaomini says about a shift to seasonal releases allowing the remaining team to be more nimble sounds sensible, but I do wonder how much of it is a necessary shift as a result of a much reduced workforce. Would the ability to maintain the MMO and create the amount of content included in a new expansion simply have been impossible following the cuts? I'm due to speak with someone at Zenimax next week, where hopefully I'll find out more.</p>

		<p>Ubisoft, which received <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-and-tencent-create-new-subsidiary-just-for-assassins-creed-rainbow-six-far-cry/">€1.16bn investment in 2025 from Tencent,</a>&nbsp; have closed its studio in Halifax, Canada, with the shutdown coming just a few weeks after the employees voted to unionise.&nbsp; The studio had been running for over ten years.</p>
<p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Over the past 24 months, Ubisoft has undertaken company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs,” said a Ubisoft spokesperson. </span><span data-testid="content-text">“As part of this, Ubisoft has made the difficult decision to close its Halifax studio. 71 positions will be affected. We are committed to supporting all impacted team members during this transition with resources, including comprehensive severance packages and additional career assistance.”&nbsp;</span></p>


<p data-testid="content-paragraph">Employees at Ubisoft Halifax formed a union under CWA Canada, which also includes employees from Bethesda Montreal, on December 18th, 2025. 74% of the staff voted in favour of the move.</p>
<p data-testid="content-paragraph">“In an era marked by industry-wide uncertainty, studio closures, layoffs, and increasing instability, we want to make clear our commitment to one another and to our craft,” they stated at the time.</p>
<p data-testid="content-paragraph">CWA Canada has not made any official comment about the timing of the two events, but is “demanding information”. “Today’s news is devastating,” commented CWA Canada president, Carmel Smyth. “We will pursue every legal recourse to ensure that the rights of these workers are respected and not infringed in any way.”</p>

<p data-testid="content-paragraph">Rockstar Games was recently accused of ‘union busting’ after firing 30 employees who belonged to a union, stating that the employees were fired for sharing company information in a public forum. This has been denied by the staff.</p>
<p data-testid="content-paragraph">Following the dismissals last week, the&nbsp;<a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/staff-at-rockstar-fired-en-masse/">IWGB branded it</a>&nbsp;as&nbsp;“a brazen act of illegal union busting”, with IWGB president Alex Marshall calling it “a calculated attack on workers organising for a collective voice and to improve their difficult working conditions.”</p>

			<p><strong>StarCraft</strong> is reportedly making a comeback at <strong>BlizzCon 2026</strong>, with a recent report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond">Jez Corden at Windows Central</a> pointing to <strong>Blizzard</strong> unveiling the <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-allegedly-incubating-a-starcraft-shooter/">long-rumoured third-person StarCraft shooter</a> at this year's convention.</p>



<p>Corden's report covering the upcoming year for Xbox included several claims as to what we'll see from Microsoft and Xbox in 2026, including the reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-fallout-3-remake-will-arrive-eventually/">Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas remasters</a> and a claim (which was corroborated by a separate outlet) <a href="https://wccftech.com/machine-games-reportedly-has-wolfenstein-3-r6-siege-like-multiplayer-game-on-the-cards/">that MachineGames has Wolfenstein 3 in development</a>.</p>



<p>When it comes to Blizzard, Corden claimed that BlizzCon 2026 is where we'll see reveals for World of Warcraft's next expansion and updates on both Overwatch and Hearthstone and potentially new mobile titles. But none of that will be the 'big' announcement from the show, with Corden instead claiming that title will go to the reveal of the third-person StarCraft shooter coming from Blizzard.</p>



<p>"<em>The headline for BlizzCon 2026 is most likely going to be StarCraft. It was previously reported that StarCraft is getting the third-person shooter treatment, and I confirmed these rumours true via my own sources a while back</em>," Corden writes.</p>



<p>A third-person shooter set in the StarCraft world is the exact kind of project that has the potential to bring the StarCraft franchise back to life, since it has seemingly remained dormant for over a decade. The last major release in the franchise was StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, which arrived back in July 2010 and was followed by three DLC expansions, the last of which was released in 2016. The last time we saw a new StarCraft release at all was 2017 with the release of StarCraft Remastered.</p>



<p>Since then, Blizzard has seemingly dedicated its focus to Overwatch 2, Diablo IV and World of Warcraft over returning to the popular sci-fi RTS series. A new third-person shooter would be the culmination of years spent waiting for fans who never got over the cancellation of StarCraft: Ghost, and the thing to bring back the franchise ahead of the next RTS title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-not-blizzard-will-reportedly-be-making-the-next-starcraft-game/">which we last heard would be coming from Nexon instead of Blizzard</a>.</p>



<p>Hopefully, when BlizzCon 2026 rolls around, we'll have a new shooter to look forward to.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I waited over a decade for my favorite Pokémon to get a Mega Evolution, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span> finally gave it to me. I dove headlong into the RPG upon release, spending every spare moment I could in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246#:~:text=the%20citizens%20of-,Lumiose%20City,-.%20It%E2%80%99s%20a%20Pidgey"><span>Lumiose City</span></a><span>, but now that I’m nearly done with everything the game has to offer, I’m starting to feel my running and jumping through the streets of its Paris-inspired setting shift to a light jog.&nbsp; As I catch the last few monsters in the expansion’s dex and cross off the remaining sidequests, my steps slow as I wait for my Mega Raichu, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>flying behind me like he’s Superman, to catch up</span></a><span>, savoring a few more seconds with his golden, two-tailed, superpowered form.</span></p> <p><span>A friend of mine who also happens to be one of the biggest </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>fans I’ve ever known was visiting me in New York City a few months back, and I was surprised to learn that she hadn’t finished 2024’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954?_gl=1*1qxy3gl*_ga*MTMxODc3NjkwMi4xNzI1Njc2NzM3*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk3NDk3MDkkbzI2OSRnMSR0MTc0OTc0OTc1NiRqMTMkbDAkaDA."><i><span>The Veilguard</span></i></a><span>, despite being positive on it. She explained that, especially after everything that’s happened to BioWare in the past year, she felt like seeing the credits roll on this latest entry would mean the end of a “moment” of her life, as </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>future seems murky</span></a><span> at best. I kind of understood, but part of me is also of the mind that seeing something through to the end is only half the experience. Sitting with it and examining its complexities is just as important. But eventually, you exhaust yourself of all that reflection and move on to something else. My reluctance to put </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>in the rearview mirror is helping me understand where she was coming from, and why people often opt not to finish games they deeply admire and enjoy. It is comforting knowing that you haven’t hit that endpoint yet, even if it means you’re depriving yourself of something you love.</span></p>

 <p><span>I’ve been writing about </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>for months here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, and I can feel that part of me that loves to critically analyze and engage with these games preparing to move on as next month’s inevitable Generation X announcement on Pokémon Day approaches. This game has been a really compelling experiment , letting Game Freak play around with real-time battles and a single-city setting, and I truly wish the studio would release another major DLC expansion or </span><i><span>something</span></i><span> to keep it going. But I also recognize it’s done what it needed to do. I don’t need more for more’s sake. In fact, with most video game franchises, I prefer things to go away forever after they’ve run their course.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000657801" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000657801"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000657801">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is a weird outlier for me on that front as I’m always down to explore a new place in this universe, and since Game Freak took a year without a new game or DLC pack in 2024, the gap between </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>’s expansions and </span><i><span>Legends Z-A</span></i><span> felt painfully long. So even if </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>hadn’t given Raichu two much needed Mega Evolutions, I would have been squeezing every drop of Pokéjuice out of this game. But on top of that, my superhero rat just got here, and I would be surprised if Mega Evolution showed up in the next pair of RPGs we’re probably getting our first glimpse of next month.</span></p>

 <p><span>I put over 120 hours into </span><i><span>Legends Z-A</span></i><span> and its DLC. I had Mega Raichu by my side for about 60 of those hours, and that still doesn’t feel like enough. Raichu and I will inevitably meet up again in the next game, but it sure hurts knowing I waited all this time to have him Mega Evolve just for it to only last a couple of months before we move on. Lumiose City may not be pretty to look at, but I still love hanging out with its weird citizens who say odd shit and love this metropolis with all their heart. I’m not ready to say goodbye just yet.</span></p>

 <p><span>So now, to make it last just a little bit longer, all I can do is bide my time. I’m booting up my Switch 2 less often. I’m doing menial tasks and wandering in places I’ve already seen dozens of times. As long as there’s an incomplete quest or a Pokémon I haven’t added to my Pokédex, I have a reason to come back. The knowledge that it’s not over is somehow more comforting than having one less game on my backlog list.</span></p>

              <p>Consoles used to come in fun colors, sometimes with transparent shells and other wild features. Those days are long gone, and now we mostly get stuck with black and white consoles with a few limited color options for accessories. So I’m happy to see Sony announcing some genuinely cool-looking console covers and controllers for the PlayStation 5 arriving in March.</p> <p>On January 7, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/07/revealing-the-hyperpop-collection-with-three-new-designs-for-ps5-accessories-launching-this-march/">PlayStation unveiled its Hyperpop Collection</a>, which features three vibrant new PS5 console covers and controllers. You can get a PS5 shell or Dualsense gamepad in Techno Red, Remix Green, and/or Rhythm Blue. Silly names aside, these console shells look awesome, sporting a gradient design that goes from black on the top to a vibrant color at the bottom, assuming you have your PS5 standing up next to your TV.</p>

  <p>However, what I really find exciting are the three new controllers, which also sport the same black to color gradient pattern. These things look sick as heck, and I want one right now to replace the boring black Dualsense controller I’ve been using for a bit now.</p>

 <p>Sony says the console covers will cost $75, and the Hyperpop Dualsense controllers will be priced at $85. That’s $10 more than a standard Dualsense, which is annoying. But that gradient design is soooo good that I’m willing to pay the extra price. I’ll just consider it a cool tax.</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, I’ll have to wait a bit before I can get my hands on that Remix Green Dualsense controller. The Hyperpop Collection launches on March 12, 2026, with Sony starting pre-orders for the slick-looking hardware on January 16, 2026 at select retailers and on PlayStation’s official store.</p>

Fans have spent the time since the December 16 launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-cold-snap-update-goes-live-alongside-big-170-patch-notes"><u>update 1.7.0</u></a> (a.k.a. Cold Snap) theorizing about what the new year may hold while sharing any new concerns with Embark. Although The Goalie Raider Deck helped tide players over late last month, the lack of a firm 2026 roadmap has left some fans curious about what’s to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One player tapped into some of their more pressing issues and shared them with Embark yesterday. They specifically take issue with what they believe is a “lack of urgency” at the studio, calling for communication and tweaks for Stella Montis, cheaters, the skill tree, Trigger Nades, and more. Birdie replied, and while not every point was addressed, it seems Embark has plans to tackle balance changes sooner rather than later – and a Trigger Nade nerf may be on the docket.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The holidays delayed things a bit, but the dev team want you to know that they are looking into balance, for example, the stitcher, kettle, and trigger nade,” the community manager explained. “Rest assured that we hear you and work on delivering a good gaming experience, things are just not immediate.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The shape these nerfs will take remains unclear for now, leaving some players concerned that they’ll do more harm than good before actually evening the playing field. It’s also unclear if the next Arc Raiders update will feature some of these teased balance adjustments, but it’s least being looked into as Embark gets back into the swing of things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today’s Arc Raiders news is a far cry from the 2026 roadmap fans have been hoping to see. While we wait for something more concrete from the team, you can read about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-arc-raiders-movie-and-tv-show-offers-are-already-coming-in-and-the-boss-of-embark-studios-sounds-up-for-it"><u>why some fans are expecting to eventually see an Arc Raiders movie and TV show</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Another entry in the Wolfenstein franchise may be on the way, according to multiple reports today. Specifically, a Wolfenstein 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The possibility was first mentioned by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Central today</a> as part of a 2026 Xbox predictions piece, and was corroborated by <a href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-3-in-development-machinegames-bethesda-2000657758" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kotaku</a>. No hard details were provided, just that the game is in development with Machine Games and, per Windows Central, may be timed to coincide with the already-announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wolfenstein-series-in-development-at-amazon-with-fallout-show-team-attached">Wolfenstein TV series with Amazon</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This would be Machine Games' first return to Wolfenstein since 2019's Wolfenstein: Young Blood, which saw series protagonist B.J. Blazkowicz's twin daughters searching for him in France and, of course, fighting the Nazis. Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus, was all the way back in 2017, so a third Wolfenstein game would be a long-awaited return indeed. Of course, MachineGames has been a bit busy lately, helping out on Doom: Legacy of Rust and developing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Windows Central also suggests the studio may be working on a "Rainbow Six Siege-like multiplayer game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wolfenstein reports also aren't a huge shock, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/machinegames-teases-were-not-done-with-wolfenstein-yet">Machine Games studio head Jerk Gustafsson said</a> just this past September that the series was always meant to be a trilogy, and that "we're not done with Wolfenstein yet." A third game would presumably find a way to wrap up B.J. Blazkowicz's story, and would almost certainly find a way to wrap up the ongoing battle against the Nazis. It's unclear if it would take place before or after Young Blood.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Young Blood, we weren't the biggest fans, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/25/wolfenstein-youngblood-review">giving it a 6.5/10 </a>and calling it "an aggressively okay co-op shooter that doesn’t come close to recapturing the joy of its predecessor’s action or its surprisingly interesting characters and story." We did, however, love The New Colossus, saying it's "a fantastic single-player shooter" with "brilliantly written characters and performances" in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/28/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-review">our 9.1/10 review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Mojang Studios has shared a first look at its upcoming baby mob remasters, which is currently being tested. When the update is finished, the dev team promises that the wolf pups, kittens, piglets, calves, baby chickens, baby ocelots, lambs, and baby rabbits will be "even chunkier, floofier, and more charming than ever before."</p><p>In the accompanying announcement video, game director Agnes Larsson explains that previous baby mobs were just scaled down versions of the adult creatures.

                <p>If you spend any time on social media, whether that be Bluesky or X, you may have seen some reports going around that Microsoft is preparing to cut tens of thousands of jobs amidst the rising costs of artificial intelligence. Whether true or not, Microsoft's lead communications officer has come forward to refute the claims.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/microsoft-msft-eyes-major-january-layoffs-as-ai-costs-rise" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report on the site TipRanks</a> said that Microsoft is "considering massive layoffs" this month, with the plan to cut anywhere between 11,000 and 22,000 jobs on the Azure Cloud, Xbox, and global sales teams. After circulating on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/whatlayoff.com/post/3mbtiwjmgtz2o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/2008806488190709970" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a> for a while, Windows Central editor Jez Corden <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2008865530749571146" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">purported that the news was "false"</a> on Xbox's side of things. Not long after this, Microsoft CCO Frank X. Shaw--who's been at the company for nearly 17 years, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fxshaw/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to his LinkedIn</a>--chimed in to dismiss the report as well.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/fxshaw/status/2008908227589624203" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">100 percent made up / speculative / wrong.</p>  — Frank X.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ces-2026-demo-footage-nvidia-dlss-4-5-dynamic-multi-frame-generation/</link>
            <guid>1399855</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 Dynamic Multi Frame Generation</strong> was undoubtedly the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-6x-mfg-240hz-gaming-400-games-available-on-all-rtx-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest gaming-related announcement</a> made by the world's largest company (by market cap) at <strong>CES 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>After years of trailing behind NVIDIA in the upscaling department, AMD finally delivered a worthy competitor with <strong>FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 4</strong> in 2025, with the year ending on a high note <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-redstone-official-200-games-supported-3x-performance-boost-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thanks to the <strong>Redstone</strong> update</a> that injected FSR with a machine learning algorithm, as well as delivering an improved <strong>Frame Generation</strong> algorithm and the brand new <strong>Ray Regeneration</strong> (an analog to NVIDIA's <strong>DLSS Ray Reconstruction</strong>) and <strong>Radiance Caching</strong> (seemingly similar to NVIDIA's <strong>Neural Radiance Cache</strong>, although it is not yet ready for release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fsr-radiance-caching-requires-further-development-optimization-is-not-currently-planned-release-darktide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as confirmed by the developers of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>).</p>



<p>Less than a month later, NVIDIA answered in kind with the release of its <strong>second-generation transformer model</strong> for the DLSS Super Resolution upscaling algorithm. NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 has been trained on a much larger and higher-fidelity dataset, and as such, utilizes five times the compute power; that's why the initial tests have shown older <strong>GeForce RTX</strong> graphics cards struggling with it.</p>



<p>Luckily, those PC users can still use the older models, either the CNN one or the first-gen transformer model, which run games noticeably faster. NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 is not really about increased speed - that's what Dynamic Multi Frame Generation helps with, but more on that later - <strong>it is instead about delivering the highest possible quality</strong>. This model demonstrates its power through a deeper understanding of game scenes and a more intelligent use of game engine pixel sampling and motion data, delivering output images with improved lighting, sharper visuals (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-in-quality-mode-delivers-better-image-quality-than-native-resolution-in-red-dead-redemption-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as demonstrated in an early <strong>Red Dead Redemption 2</strong> comparison</a>), and enhanced motion clarity.</p>



<p>We had our very own CEO, Abdullah Saad, attending CES 2026 and checking out the various NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 demos available at the booth. He was particularly impressed by the lighting improvement delivered by the new transformer model in the game <strong>Black Myth: Wukong</strong>, and the NVIDIA rep explained:</p>



<p><em>There's a very technical reason for that. The engine does the math in what's called physical space, which is like how the physics actually operates. It's not thinking in terms of gamma and stuff like that. It's thinking basically in real life math, like the light goes here, this light is at this amount of nits, and then at some point down the pipeline, it gets tone-mapped and ported to your display. The older DLSS, preset K, is accumulating the data at the end of that, so after tone mapping. It's losing some of that data, the highlights for example, and it's accumulating on that. TAA (Temporal AntiAliasing) can also have that problem, but here we move the new one closer to the engine so it's seeing more of what the engine is trying to show as far as the lighting goes, so it's losing less of that highlight detail.</em></p>



<p>In more technical terms, the previous upscaling algorithm worked in logarithmic space to mitigate flickering, but resulted in muted lighting, clipped details, and crushed shadows in high-contrast scenes. Now, DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution trains and infers directly in linear space, the same space used by games, and is thus capable of allowing glowing neon signs and bright reflections to retain their full color range and detail. This could be an indirect been to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-hdr-gaming-interview-veteran-developer-explains-its-sad-state-and-how-hes-coming-to-its-rescue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR gaming</a></strong> under NVIDIA DLSS 4.5.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The other half of the NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 announcement, Dynamic Multi Frame Generation, won't be available publicly before Spring 2026, but it could be tested at the NVIDIA CES 2026 booth. Beyond unlocking <strong>6X mode</strong> (five additional frames rendered apart from the real one), the update will also introduce <strong>an intelligent system capable of targeting your specific display's maximum refresh rate</strong>. </p>



<p>In the CES 2026 demo (featuring <strong>Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2</strong> game), the system was shown targeting the 240Hz of the 1440p display on hand. The NVIDIA rep stated:</p>



<p><em>If you went to a scene where it went up to 300 FPS, you'd see it lowering the multiplier because you'd be generating frames that are just being thrown out, right? This is a smarter way to use it. If you go up to one of the windows, the scene will get a lot lighter. You'll see your frame rate go up, and then it'll start lowering the multiplier because it'll know that you don't need that much frame generation.

<p>NVIDIA also promises <strong>improvements in frame pacing and better accuracy in rendering in-game user interfaces</strong>, as shown in the official video above. The former will be particularly important, although we'll have to wait for its public release to test it. </p>

Not suitable for persons under 16 years of age.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Brief Outline of the Game</strong></p><p>Chloe Price was Max Caulfield’s partner in time… Losing her is Max’s greatest regret. Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max’s help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus.</p><p><strong>Content Specific Issues</strong></p><p>This game features depictions of the use of illegal drugs. During a party scene, the player is offered wine and is given the option to take a sip. The player character realizes that she has been spiked from the drink that she sipped on and is experiencing hallucinations. Images on screen become distorted and a scene plays out with the character seeing strange images. A character tells the hallucinating character that she is “tripping balls.” It is then explained that she is high on mushrooms. There are also depictions of strong, realistic violence. In the opening scene, the game recaps the previous games from the series which includes a scene where a girl is shot in the torso before she is then seen lying on the ground with blood seeping through her shirt. Much of the violence in the game is implied; a building is set on fire and people are heard inside screaming for help. This game also contains the use of strong language, including ‘fuck.’ Milder bad language is also present, including ‘asshole,’ ‘piss,’ and ‘shit.’</p><p><strong>Other Issues</strong></p><p>This game offers players the opportunity to purchase in-game items in the form of new outfits and a digital deluxe upgrade, which some parents or carers may want to be aware of. Parents, carers, or other responsible adults should check to see what is being offered before making any purchase on behalf of a child. It should be noted that the game can still be played without the need to purchase such items. There are images in the game which may be scary to younger players, including scenes of dead bodies with no blood or injury detail and human skeletons. Some sexual innuendo is found in the game. When the player goes to a party, another character tells them that someone didn’t show up as their “girlfriend thought this was an orgy.” Suicide is referenced in the game frequently, but no depictions are shown.</p></blockquote><p>Thanks, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q6nkau/new_possible_life_is_strange_game_leaked_life_is/" target="_blank">r/GamingLeaksandRumours</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/life-is-strange-reunion-rated-in-europe]]></content:encoded>

                <p>MachineGames is working on a third new Wolfenstein game to follow 2014's Wolfenstein: The New Order and 2017's Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus. This is according to reports from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-3-in-development-machinegames-bethesda-2000657758" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, both of which said the game is happening but had no other details to share.</p><p>This would be the first new Wolfenstein game since Wolfenstein: Youngblood and the VR game Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot, both of which were released in 2019.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolfenstein-dev-hopes-to-return-to-the-franchise/1100-6534556/" data-ref-id="1100-6534556">In September 2025</a>, MachineGames creative director Axel Torvenius said he wanted to continue the story of William "B.J." Blazkowicz in a third Wolfenstein game.</p><p>"We have always seen this as a [Wolfenstein] trilogy," Torvenius said in a Wolfenstein documentary by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Noclip</a>. "So that journey for B.J., even during those first few weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for, at least, that character. What will happen in the second one, what will happen in the third one. So I think that's important to say, because--at least, I hope--that we're not done with Wolfenstein yet. We have a story to tell."</p><p>If MachineGames is indeed working on a third Wolfenstein game in its trilogy, it could be announced at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-confirmed-for-january-2026-but-it-wont-have-everything/1100-6536932/" data-ref-id="1100-6536932">this month's Xbox Developer Direct </a>or the expected Xbox summer showcase, though these are both just guesses.</p><p>Beyond a possible new Wolfenstein game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolfenstein-tv-series-in-the-works-from-same-company-behind-fallout-show/1100-6533457/" data-ref-id="1100-6533457">Prime Video is producing a live-action Wolfenstein TV series</a>. It's still early days, though, and there is no word on any specifics about the show.</p><p>The Wolfenstein titles take place in an alternate timeline where Germany won World War II after they discovered advanced technology. The Wolfenstein video game series has been around since 1981, and 1992's Wolfenstein 3D from developer Id Software is credited as one of the key games that helped popularize first-person shooters in the '90s.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GDQ’s Organizers Plan To Keep Growing The Event, But They Don’t Want It To Become Just Another Video Game Convention]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/agdq-2026-interview-speedrun-convention-charity/</link>
            <guid>1399837</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Compared to the PAXes or even MAGFests of the world, Awesome Games Done Quick is itsy bitsy. Around 2,000 speedrunners and fans mill about in Pittsburgh’s Wyndham Grand hotel, with a theater where speedruns take place serving as the obvious centerpiece. Other attractions – like an arcade, a game room with consoles and PCs, and a small artist alley – exist, but they feel more like brief breaks from the 24/7 speedrun deluge than fully fledged alternatives. The entire event spans just a handful of rooms across two floors. Some might view this as a downside, but I find it refreshing.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s an intimacy to AGDQ that makes it feel uniquely cozy. If you make a friend, you <em>will </em>run into them again. Runners and hosts are accessible and friendly. Vocal audience participation during runs is common. The vibe is slumber party, with some audience members going so far as to wear pajamas to late-night runs.&nbsp;</p><p>In my few days attending, I’ve also come to appreciate the event’s focus: There’s one main thing pretty much everyone is here for, so we all have a shared destination and set of hyper-specific discussion topics. The standard model of a video game convention (or comic convention, or anime convention) lends itself to sprawl and bloat. They can even be actively unpleasant to attend – squirming seas of people shuffling between halls, attempting to extract amusement from vast selections of activities that rarely rise above the level of Fine.&nbsp;</p><p>AGDQ, in its current state, lacks unnecessary flab. This makes sense, considering that it began as a group of 20 friends in founder Mike Uyama’s mother’s basement. It was not born as a convention, even as it has since bolted on some of the format’s more common trappings. But that was 2010 and this is now; AGDQ attracts tens of thousands of concurrent viewers across Twitch and YouTube, and the organization behind it now employs over 100 people.&nbsp;</p><p>GDQ, meanwhile, is now far more than just one event, with AGDQ joined by Summer Games Done Quick, as well as a series of smaller charity marathons hosted by satellite organizations like Frame Fatales and Black In A Flash. Every non-event week, meanwhile, GDQ hosts regularly scheduled “Hotfix” programming, with two themed shows each weekday as well as weekend specials. There’s more to speedrunning than GDQ, but it has, in many ways, evolved into a one-stop shop for the average person’s speedrunning needs.</p><p>What does this growth mean for the event that started it all, though? GDQ director of operations Matt Merkle doesn’t plan to shy away from further expansion and experimentation.&nbsp;</p><p>"We've already actually expanded,” he told Aftermath. “The artist alley is a new addition. We just started that last summer. We have amazing artists supporting the event – the stuff they do for us to advertise the event. We wanted to bring them into the event and let people purchase their works. ... I think it's been fantastic. The community really loves that artist alley, and we'll continue to grow that as we get into bigger hotels that can support it."</p><p>But Merkle is cognizant of the fact that he’s in possession of bottled lightning.&nbsp;</p><p>“Obviously speedrunning is gonna be the primary focus of the event for the foreseeable future,” he said. “But we'll always continue to experiment with different things. Over the summer, we had a live concert, which was really cool to do for the first time. ... We definitely continue to experiment so that when people come back to the event year after year, they have something new to experience on top of the stuff that they know and love."</p><p>The show’s format, Merkle added, helps it nimbly avoid some of more traditional conventions’ biggest pitfalls.</p><p>“The event lasts for seven days rather than three or four, so you have plenty of time to experience the entire event – to go around and enjoy yourself,” he said. “We don't focus on panels as much as other conventions, so people aren't focused on just getting in lines and waiting for the panel they want to see most or something. Because we control the growth and ensure that there's always plenty of space and time to do everything, it makes it so you don't feel rushed, you don't feel cramped. You feel that you have space to do what you want and hang out with your friends."</p><p>Even as AGDQ continues to grow and attract more attendees, Merkle wants to preserve the show’s unique vibe.</p><p>“Intimacy is a core part of it,” he said.</p><p>That intimacy – and <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/site/rules?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a rigorous set of rules</u></a> – means people feel safe at AGDQ. This comes through whether you’re in attendance or watching along from home. What other video game event, after all, boasts “trans rights” as its rallying cry? Merkle recognizes the importance of maintaining that core component of the event as well.&nbsp;</p><p>“If you’re harassing anybody in our community or making people feel uncomfortable, we don’t want you here,” he said. “I think the community has come to expect that type of vibe at this event, and that’s why we have so many people that feel safe to come to these events. … We take it seriously.”&nbsp;</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/speedrunning-dog-interview-peanut-butter-agdq/"><div><p>Speedrunning Dog Talks To Blog - Aftermath</p><p>The story behind Awesome Games Done Quick’s speedrunning dog</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>

			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p>On top of Windows Central's claim that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-fallout-3-remake-will-arrive-eventually/">Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas remasters/remakes would arrive "<em>eventually</em>,"</a> its executive editor, Jez Corden, also added more to the rumour mill on what Wolfenstein and Indiana Jones developer MachineGames has on the go. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond">According to the report</a>, the studio is working on a Rainbow Six Siege-like multiplayer game, while also having Wolfenstein 3 "<em>on the cards</em>."</p>



<p>Interestingly, though, this time it's not just Windows Central claiming that Wolfenstein 3 is in development. Shortly after the initial Windows Central report, <a href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-3-in-development-machinegames-bethesda-2000657758">Kotaku published its own</a>, corroborating what Windows Central claimed and, based on conversations it had with its own sources, went as far as to <strong>confirm that Wolfenstein 3 is in fact currently in development.</strong> </p>



<p>It's not shocking to hear that a new Wolfenstein game is coming from MachineGames. <a href="https://wccftech.com/machinegames-plans-for-third-wolfenstein-bj-blazkowicz-game-trilogy/">Back in September 2025,</a> when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE">NoClip</a> released a documentary on the making of the first two games, studio head <strong>Jerk Gustafsson</strong> said, "<em>We have always <strong>seen this as a trilogy</strong></em>. <em>That journey for BJ, even during those first weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for at least [BJ], what would happen in the second one and what would happen in the third one</em>. <em>I think that's important to say, because⁠—at least I hope⁠—we're not done with Wolfenstein yet. <strong>We have a story to tell.</strong></em>"</p>



<p>If that's not a comment meant to prime players for a coming sequel, then there's no telling what is. Gustafsson would have made that comment, fully aware of when the documentary was to be released, with full knowledge of what the studio had coming. Today's reports add further fuel to the fire that we are indeed going to get a third, and seemingly closing chapter of BJ Blazkowicz's story.</p>



<p>The last Wolfenstein game was 2019's Wolfenstein: Youngblood, which focused on Blazkowicz's daughters instead of BJ himself. If a new game in the series arrives this year, it'll have been a seven-year gap since the last game in the series and a nine-year gap since the last game to feature BJ as the protagonist. </p>



<p>Along with a new game seemingly in the works, there's also <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/">a TV show adaptation of Wolfenstein coming from Amazon</a>, which could likely be revealed at the same time as the third game.</p>



<p>As for the multiplayer game Corden mentions, there's not much else to go on besides the quick description that it is meant to be a "<em>Rainbow Six Siege-like multiplayer title</em>," though if Wolfenstein 3 is going to be ready in time for the coming TV show, then that may be the project the studio is closer to completing. While the idea of a new multiplayer game from MachineGames is exciting, fans of the studio would much rather the team focus on BJ Blazkowicz before anything else.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll have more official news to share from the studio itself soon.</p>

You know what I might have most about games? There's no universal way to play them. You buy a DVD, you buy a DVD player, and aside from maybe a region lock issue you're as good as gold. If I buy Snowboard Kids for the N64, and I don't have one of those, well, I'm up a particular creek. That has meant that many a game over the years has been stuck to particular platforms, one of the most surprising being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jet-set-radio-future">Jet Set Radio Future</a>, to this day a game that's still only available on the original Xbox, and the Xbox 360 through backwards compatibility. But! Thanks to some techy wizards, that might change in the near future.
</p>
<p>
That's because of a decompilation project that is currently underway for the North American release of the game. Now, I'm a far cry from those tech wizards I mentioned, but as far as I understand it, decompiling a game is a process where a game is taken apart so that it can be rebuilt. This allows for things like native PC ports of games that maybe never had any, which, in this case for Jet Set Radio Future, is something that could one day be an option.

<p>
Right now, according to the project's <a href="https://codeberg.org/KeybadeBlox/JSRF-Decompilation">Codeberg page</a>, the decompilation process itself is about 30% done, but these kinds of projects normally take quite a while, so don't expect it to be finished any time soon. And again, decompiling doesn't mean that a PC port will be ready to go right out the gate either.
</p><p>
Still, it would be nice to free this one from defunct platform prison. There are obviously excellent spiritual successors like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bomb-rush-cyberfunk">Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</a>, yet sometimes going straight to the source is what you need. It's also just a unique way to preserve a game, even if not the intended way to experience it.
