			<p>The new PS Plus July 2024 games for the Extra and Premium tiers have leaked, and they are quite good.</p>
<p>The information once again comes from reputable deals leaker 'billbil-kun', who <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/playstation-plus-extra-premium-juillet-2024-voici-un-apercu-des-nouveaux-titres-qui-vont-bientot-rejoindre-le-catalogue-de-jeux-54974" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> the upcoming new title for Sony's subscription service on French deals website Dealabs. According to the leaker, this month's new additions for the Extra and Premium tiers include fan-favorite <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crisis-core-final-fantasy-vii-reunion-the-price-of-freedom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/remnant-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remnant 2</a>. Other titles are said to include Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous – Enhanced Edition, Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord, No More Heroes 3, and Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes Complete Edition.</p>
<p>Aside from Remant 2, it's possible that Remnant: From the Ashes will also be added to the service, but according to the leaker, the information about this title also being included isn't 100%.</p>
<p>As always with these kinds of leaks and rumors, the information hasn't been officially confirmed by Sony just yet. Going by this leaker's track record, however, it's only a matter of time before Sony's official announcement will follow. Going by previous monthly announcements, the new PS Plus titles are expected to be officially announced tomorrow with the games being added to the tiers next week on July 17th. We'll update you as soon as we learn more about the next batch of PS Plus games.</p>
<p>Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion was released for PC and consoles back in 2022. This remaster was released to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Final Fantasy VII. Here's what we wrote about the remaster in our launch review:</p>
<p><em>"With vastly enhanced visuals and audio, a major combat overhaul that finally makes the game fun to play, and a great ending, Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII – Reunion is, without a doubt, one of the best remasters released in recent years. While some of the original's issues haven't been addressed, such as the bad story pacing and mediocre writing, they shouldn't stop any Final Fantasy VII fan from getting the game. The price of freedom is steep, but it is one worth paying."</em></p>

<p>Sony is getting set to announce the July additions to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog, but before that happens, a few of the games set to be added have been leaked.</p>



<p>According to the ever reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/playstation-plus-extra-premium-juillet-2024-voici-un-apercu-des-nouveaux-titres-qui-vont-bientot-rejoindre-le-catalogue-de-jeux-54974" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun and dealabs</a>, Remnant 2 and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 Reunion are set to be added to the collection this month. The announcement of the July games, the report says, is expected to come on Wednesday, July 10. The games are expected to be available starting July 17.</p>



<p>In addition to those two headliner games, other games expected to be added to the service include Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord, No More Heroes 3, Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes Complete Edition, and Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous – Enhanced Edition.</p>



<p>Other games coming to the catalog weren’t revealed in the report, but, on average, Sony adds about 12-15 games per month to the service. So, we could expect to see at least six to nine more games announced.</p>



<p>Last month the catalog <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-game-catalog-gets-14-games-in-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saw 14 games added</a>, including Monster Hunter Rise, Crusader Kings 3, Football Manager 24, and more.</p>



<p>The PlayStation Plus Game Catalog is available to all subscribers of PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium. Those with Premium usually get access to additional classic games.</p>

<p>MrBeast just revealed (yet again) that his next video is his ‘best video yet’. This weekend, he’ll publish one of the most star-studded videos he’s ever produced, featuring fifty of the biggest content creators in the world, sealed in a glass cube and being made to compete for a $1 million prize.</p>



<p>It’s not clear from the video what the challenges will be, but it was said that the $1 million prize is ‘for their subscribers’, and while fifty enter, only <strong>one </strong>streamer will be successful.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-huge-lineup">Huge Lineup</h2>



<p>In the trailer for MrBeast’s next video, which will drop this Saturday, one of the most monumental lineups imaginable is standing front and centre, ready to win the $1 million grand prize. Here are some of the most notable personalities taking part in the challenge video:</p>



<ul>
<li>Pokimane</li>



<li>Kai Cenat</li>



<li>Bella Poarch</li>



<li>The Botez Sisters</li>



<li>KSI</li>



<li>Logan Paul</li>



<li>Ludwig</li>



<li>FaZe Rug</li>



<li>Lazarbeam</li>



<li>Sketch</li>



<li>Speed</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a veritable smorgasbord of energetic content creators, which means that the level of drama is set to reach epic proportions. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s a glass cube full of somewhat ostentatious streamers who have all had their fair share of issues with controversies, scandals, and ego-fuelled rises to stardom. It’ll be interesting to see how it plays out given the stock taking part in the challenge.</p>



<p>From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sketch-confirms-of-leaks-real-stream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sketch’s recent OnlyFans leak</a> to Speed’s tortured experiences at the hands of his fans in Europe, plenty has blown up recently to take some of these creators to the tops of news feeds worldwide.</p>



<p>Jimmy isn’t wrong – it could be his best video yet.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The upcoming second act of Echoes, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s current "episode" that continues the story of its latest expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">The Final Shape</a>, is changing how the game dishes out story. Instead of a new story beat becoming available each week, as in Act 1, all three Act 2 story beats will be available when it becomes available on July 16.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie announced the change during its Echoes: Act 2 live stream, which gave a look at the changes and additions coming to the game. The pacing of the story is something players have complained about for some time, in fact. It was one of the major reasons many disliked Destiny 2's seasons, the game's previous approach to delivering new stories between major expansions.</p><p dir="ltr">Seasons would break up stories into weekly tidbits that could usually be finished up within an hour or two, forcing players to wait days for the next installment like a weekly TV show and often feeling artificially drawn out for no good reason. The new Episode structure was meant to replace the season approach by dividing stories into larger six-week acts that would change the game up more often.  In Echoes Act 1, however, the story was still dished out in small bits week by week, making it feel like a season by another name.</p><p dir="ltr">Narrative director Alison Luhrs said on the stream that Bungie heard that feedback from players and agreed. As such, all three of the story beats for Act 2 will drop at the same time--at the launch of the act--and the same goes for Act 3. The idea is that players can work through the story at their own pace; if they want to binge it all on the first day, that's up to them.</p><p dir="ltr">The upside of the act structure seems to be that it allows the game to be even more responsive to what's happening in the story. Bungie showed off two of Act 2's new Battlegrounds activities, which take place on Nessus and have players hunting for answers by delving underground. The Battlegrounds feature altered locations that were first introduced at the end of Act 1; at the end of that story, a white Radiolaria lake on Nessus was drained, revealing a whole new area beneath it. The Battlegrounds will explore what's changed there, with players heading underground to find out where all that Radiolaria went, and why.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Luhrs, the act will also take players back to explore one of Destiny's "most storied locations," while the game continues to tell the story of Saint-14, who is struggling with his identity after an encounter with the mysterious apparent villain of Echoes, a being known as the Conductor.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the Battlegrounds themselves, they should see some pretty intense fights. Senior activity designer Ryan Harris said the team is trying to differentiate Battlegrounds from Strikes by making them more combat-intensive, with as many as 40 enemies on screen at a time and new bosses specific to the activities. These include Vex Wyverns that will come at players in pairs and feature the new behavior of teleporting to flank players and avoid attacks. There might also be a boss with, as Harris put it, the biggest health pool he'd ever given one.</p>

<p>In 1994, Hewlett-Packard released a miracle machine: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_200LX">HP 200LX</a> pocket-size PC. In the depths of the device, among the MS-DOS productivity apps built into its fixed memory, there lurked a first-person maze game called <em>Lair of Squid</em>. Intrigued by the game, we tracked down its author, Andy Gryc, and probed into the title's mysterious undersea origins.</p>

<p>"If you ask my family, they’ll confirm that I’ve been obsessed with squid for a long time," Gryc told Ars Technica. "It’s admittedly very goofy—and that’s my fault—although I was inspired by <i data-stringify-type="italic">Doom</i>, which had come out relatively recently."</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Lair of Squid</i>, you're trapped in an underwater labyrinth, seeking a way out while avoiding squid roaming the corridors. A collision with any cephalopod results in death. To progress through each stage and ascend to the surface, you locate the exit and provide a hidden, scrambled code word. The password is initially displayed as asterisks, with letters revealed as you encounter them within the maze.</p>

<p>Buckle up for a tale of rogue coding, cephalopod obsession, and the most unexpected Easter egg in palmtop history. This is no fish story—it's the saga of <em>Lair of Squid</em>.</p>
<h2>A computer in the palm of your hand</h2>
<p>Introduced in 1994, the HP 200LX palmtop PC put desktop functionality in a pocket-size package. With a small QWERTY keyboard, MS-DOS compatibility, and a suite of productivity apps, the clamshell 200LX offered a vision of one potential future of mobile computing. It featured a 7.91 MHz 80186 CPU, a monochrome 640x200 CGA display, and 1–4 megabytes of RAM.</p>

<p>I've <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/gear-envy-my-collection-of-500-plus-pieces-of-computer-and-gaming-hardware">collected</a> vintage computers since 1993, and people frequently offer to send me old devices they'd rather not throw away. Recently, a former HP engineer sent me his small but nice collection of '90s <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-golden-age-of-hp-palmtop-pcs">HP handheld palmtop computers</a>, including a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_95LX">95LX</a> (1991), <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.net/display_item.php?hw=198">100LX</a> (1993), and 200LX.</p>
<p>HP designed its portable LX series to run many MS-DOS programs that feature text mode or CGA graphics, and each includes built-in versions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_1-2-3">Lotus 1-2-3</a> spreadsheet, a word processor, terminal program, calculator, and more.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/3010/hp-95lx-games-from-compuserve-in-the-1990s">owned a 95LX</a> as a kid (a hand-me-down from my dad's friend), which came with a simplistic overhead maze game called <a href="https://archive.org/details/TigerFoxV2.11990EverettKaserAction"><em>TigerFox</em></a>. So imagine my surprise in 2024, when trawling through the productivity and personal organization apps on that 200LX, to find a richly detailed first-person maze game based around cephalopods, of all things.</p>
<p>(I was less surprised to find an excellent built-in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/how-bill-gates-minesweeper-addiction-helped-lead-to-the-xbox/"><em>Minesweeper</em></a> clone, <em>Hearts and Bones</em>, which is definitely a more natural fit for the power and form of the 200LX itself.)</p>
<p><em>Lair of Squid</em> isn't a true <em>Doom</em> clone since it's not a first-person shooter (in some ways, it's more like a first-person <em>Pac-Man</em> without pellets), but its mere existence—on a black-and-white device best suited for storing phone numbers and text notes—deserves note as one of the weirdest and most interesting pack-in games to ever exist.</p>
<p>Just after discovering <em>Lair of Squid</em> on my device earlier this year, I <a href="https://x.com/benjedwards/status/1786944643701125358">tweeted</a> about it, and I extracted the file for the game (called "maze.exe") from the internal ROM drive and sent it to DOS gaming historian <a href="https://ko-fi.com/dosnostalgic">Anatoly Shashkin</a>, who put the game <a href="https://archive.org/details/LairOfSquidHP200lx">on The Internet Archive</a> so anyone can play it in their browser.</p>
<p>After that, I realized that I wanted to figure out who wrote this quirky game, and thanks to a post on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.classicdosgames.com/interviews/everettkaser.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.classicdosgames.com/interviews/everettkaser.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">RGB Classic Games</a>, I found a name: Andy Gryc. With some luck in cold-emailing, I found him.</p>

                <p>In a franchise first, College Football 25's Ultimate Team mode will let you pull active NFL players, alongside current college players and past greats. Confirmed inclusions are Patrick Mahomes, Davante Adams, Christian McCaffrey, Josh Allen, Ceedee Lamb, Stefon Diggs, and Joe Burrow, with many more to be featured in the full game.</p><p>More details on how Ultimate Team will work in College Football 25 have been revealed. At the start of Ultimate Team you will get a set of players based on your favorite school. From there, you can complete challenges, work on the Field Pass (i.e. Battle Pass), or fork over cold, hard cash to get player packs. You can also pick up Ultimate Alumni, i.e. top players from past College Football entries, via special events throughout the game's first season, as well as past and current players through several weekly programs like Conference Story of the Week, ICYMI, and Legends.</p>

Of course, there is a competitive seasons mode called H2H Seasons and a co-op one called Squads Regular Season. There are weekly multiplayer modes like the Gauntlet (where you try to wrack up ten wins before hitting 2 losses) and House Rules (party games with unique rule sets.</p><p>College Football 25 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523761/" data-ref-id="1100-6523761">will release on July 19</a>.

You can get the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23564531/sony-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-ps5-features-review"><strong>DualSense Edge</strong></a> for $174.99 (about $24 off) via <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PS5-DualSense-Edge-Wireless-Controller%2F1707140316%2F">Walmart’s</a> online-only deal, dropping the specialized gamepad down to its lowest price to date.</p><p>The highlight of the DualSense Edge is its impeccable software integration with the PS5. You can fine-tune up to four profiles that each have your own personal tweaks for things like stick sensitivity and custom rear button controls, and it’s easy to swap between profiles on the fly. The Edge also has all the haptics and features of the standard DualSense, along with extras like hair trigger lockouts, interchangeable stick toppers, and two styles of rear paddles / buttons.</p><p>Now, the DualSense Edge does have some noteworthy faults for such a pricey controller, like slightly anemic battery life and sticks as prone to drift as its cheaper counterpart packed with every PS5. However, Sony at least baked in some features that somewhat stymie these shortcomings — like a lengthy USB charging cable that has a nifty locking mechanism and user-replaceable stick modules that you can purchase later for $20 if yours ever catch some drift (if <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/stick-module-for-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller">you ever find them in stock</a>, of course).</p><div><p>Sony’s pro-style controller, the DualSense Edge, might suffer from shorter battery life than the standard DualSense model, but it features great software integration with the PlayStation 5 and plenty of customizable components. </p></div><p>This sale on the Edge is part of Walmart’s greater sales event running counter to Amazon’s upcoming Prime Day, which is scheduled for July 16th and 17th. The imaginatively named “Walmart Deals” event runs through July 11th, and in addition to the DualSense Edge, there are notable sales like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/8/24194403/apple-macbook-air-m1-laptop-walmart-early-access-deal-sale">M1 MacBook Air for $649</a>.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
If the absence of any positive Dead Space 2 remake news has been getting you down, there's at least one new way to get a bit of Necromorph in your life right now, even if it's probably not quite what fans were hoping for. EA's sci-fi horror series is the focus of a new Battlefield 2024 limited-time PvE mode, Outbreak, which is available to play now.
</p>
<p>
Outbreak, described as a "high-intensity survival mode", pits up to four players against hordes of Augmented Targets (which regrettably look more like slightly fleshy crash test dummies than Necromorphs) as they travel across the Redacted map toward their extraction point.
</p>
<p>
Starting at the western end, the goal is to pass through eight sectors while facing off against increasingly difficult waves of enemies. Players get one life per wave (downed players respawn on the next wave provided at least one squad mate survives) and Ascension points earned from defeating enemies can used at armoury stations to purchase weapons along the way.
</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>
By playing Outbreak, participants can unlock the Future Imperfect epic weapon charm, Genesis/Necrosis epic player card, Unifier rare player tag, and Made Anew epic MP28 skin.
</p>

Outbreak mode is available from today, 9th July, and runs until next Tuesday, 16th July. It arrives as part of Battlefield 2024's 7.40 update, which also brings a number of quality of life improvements, as per developer DICE's <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-7-4-0">latest patch notes</a>. 7.40 is the latest release for Battlefield 2024's seventh season, which will also <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/whats-ahead-2042">be its last</a>.

As for Dead Space, its status as a series remains unclear. EA Motive's remake of the original Dead Space launched to significant acclaimed last year, but a subsequent report <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-2-remake-was-reportedly-in-development-but-not-any-more">claimed</a> its sales were "lacklustre" and that a planned Dead Space 2 remake has since been canned. There's some small sliver of hope for Dead Space fans, hoewver, in that EA took the unusual step of commenting on the report, insisting, "There is no validity to this story".

			<p>Concord was announced during a PlayStation Showcase in 2023, and the time has come for the game to be released. The release is just around the corner, with its official release date dropping on August 23rd. Since <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-pre-orders-beta-price-post-launch-updates-free/">the game's release</a> is soon, the developers have <a href="https://x.com/PlayConcord/status/1810392214888952262" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the PC system requirements you will need to play Concord.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the specs needed at a minimum level and a recommended level aren't as hefty as people may have expected. While the game is also available on PlayStation 5, many players will want to play it on PC to try and get a better visual experience.</p>
<p>Regardless of what settings you are trying to run the game on, it's necessary to have the game installed on an SSD and have at least an Intel i-7 or AMD Ryzen 7 processor. You can run the game at the absolute minimum settings with an Intel Core i7-8700k or AMD Ryzen 7 2700x. As you scale up the settings, you will want a more powerful CPU, such as the Intel Core i7-10700k or AMD Ryzen 7 3700x.</p>
<p>When it comes to GPUs, there is a lot of wiggle room as there are plenty of graphics cards capable of running this game regardless of settings. At a minimum, you'll want an NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1660 or AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT. As you scale up towards ultra settings, you can see a significant rise in graphics card quality. Instead, you'll want an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070Ti or AMD Radeon 7900 XT.</p>
<p>Regarding memory, 8GB DDR4 is fine if you are okay with playing the game on minimum settings, but you'll want 16 GB DDR4 RAM for higher settings. The game also isn't too bad regarding the size of the installation. Many modern games have quite hefty download sizes, but Concord will only occupy 30GB of your drive. Overall, it's fair to say that Concord's requirements are quite decent and aren't as taxing on the wallet as some other games have been of late.</p>

How do you follow a survival horror game steeped in meta-textual commentary on art and its own troubled road to release, with incredibly bold themes and genre-bending moments that earned it several major game awards? If you are developer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-ps5-sam-lake-horror-game-1850957409&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-ps5-sam-lake-horror-game-1850957409">Remedy</a></span>, then you do a complete 180, which is what<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-dlc-night-springs-canon-1851525597&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-dlc-night-springs-canon-1851525597"><em>Night Springs</em></a></span>, a<em> Twilight Zone</em> parody of three anthology stories loosely tied to the base game and the first of two pieces of DLC for <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, is. And it’s an absolute joy. Even when a story falls flat, <em>Night Springs</em> is a great argument for studios to make shorter, but still high-quality, experiences at the AAA level.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195922" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Is Alan Wake Worth Playing Before Its Sequel? | Total Recall" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="390" data-playlist="195922,195928,196086" data-current="195922"><div><p>Is Alan Wake Worth Playing Before Its Sequel? | Total Recall</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21438.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I wasn’t thrilled about the prospect of <em>Night Springs</em> when it was first announced. The three anthology episodes the DLC contains are essentially non-canon to the rest of the Remedy Connected Universe (which includes both<em> Alan Wake</em> games and 2019’s <em>Control</em>), and even though it stars familiar characters from the base game it doesn’t really continue or elaborate on their stories. After the tour de force that was <em>Alan Wake 2</em> (my favorite game of 2023) I wasn’t thrilled at the idea of diving back into something that doesn’t advance that story. And I wasn’t entirely wrong. By and large <em>Night Springs </em>doesn’t build on the base game’s narrative threads (with one major exception that I’ll get to) but I was wrong in assuming that such an approach would be boring.<em> Night Springs</em> is a much-needed breather from the weighty base game, a perfect palette cleanser. </p><figure id="" data-id="e44ed4123e681edcd1f695791e404ecb" data-recommend-id="image://e44ed4123e681edcd1f695791e404ecb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1272" data-height="716" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pink-clad waitress walks through a street under a banner that reads &quot;1 Waitress + 1 Writer = 4Ever&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A pink-clad waitress walks through a street under a banner that reads &quot;1 Waitress + 1 Writer = 4Ever&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e44ed4123e681edcd1f695791e404ecb" data-recommend-id="image://e44ed4123e681edcd1f695791e404ecb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1272" data-height="716" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pink-clad waitress walks through a street under a banner that reads &quot;1 Waitress + 1 Writer = 4Ever&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That is best exemplified by the DLC’s first chapter “Number One Fan,” which follows the Oh Deer Diner’s waitress Rose. Of course, in the context of the in-game show <em>Night Springs</em>, this isn’t exactly Rose, rather she is just The Waitress. After doing the rounds at her diner, during which she pours coffee, serves her award-winning pie, and offers tough but fair life advice to strangers, she makes contact with The Writer, with whom she is romantically involved. She needs to save him from his evil twin, The Writer informs her via talking fish wall decoration, so she picks up an automatic shotgun and sets out. The Waitresses’ attitude is filled with outlandish pep that you can’t help but laugh at, and this absurdity extends to all corners of the DLC—even its loading screens, which will change based on what episode you are playing. In “Number One Fan,” the loading screens promise you that with the power of love, anything is possible! That, mixed with the literal rose-tinted hue of the world around you are a stark contrast to the dark and gritty base game. The fully automatic shotgun only adds to the absurdist vibes, as it makes all combat so trivial but also laughably gory. Remedy is telling you that this shouldn’t be as hard or stressful as the base game. Have fun! Fight the guy who turns into a wolf and rides a motorcycle (that also turns into a wolf). Before you know it the 30-45 minute experience is over.</p><p>All of<em> Night Springs</em> episodes have a similarly short runtime—the entire thing can be beaten in one brisk evening if you want. They all still have the same high-production value as the base game but take a fraction of the time. It’s another signal from Remedy that these are just supposed to be small, fun adventures to tackle at your leisure. It makes me wish more AAA games would make smaller experiences that looked and played this good.</p><figure id="" data-id="b0bffc180ee176de7c73bbd1015cf147" data-recommend-id="image://b0bffc180ee176de7c73bbd1015cf147" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jesse Faden walks towards a coffee warehouse and looks at a sign that reads &quot;join us, make the world coffee&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jesse Faden walks towards a coffee warehouse and looks at a sign that reads &quot;join us, make the world coffee&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b0bffc180ee176de7c73bbd1015cf147" data-recommend-id="image://b0bffc180ee176de7c73bbd1015cf147" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jesse Faden walks towards a coffee warehouse and looks at a sign that reads &quot;join us, make the world coffee&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While “Number One Fan” swings far away from <em>Alan Wake 2</em> in its tone, the second episode hews closer to the base game, to its detriment. “North Star” puts players in the shoes of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/control-the-kotaku-review-1837569523&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/control-the-kotaku-review-1837569523"><em>Control</em></a></span>’s Jesse Faden, or rather a character called The Sibling who looks like her. She’s hunting down a coffee cult in the base game’s Coffee World map. The Sibling lacks any of the powers her <em>Control </em>look-alike wields and instead uses an automatic pistol and a flashlight. The gameplay loop here is fairly similar to the base game, as is the horror-tinged tone. Because of this, “North Star ‘’ is pretty forgettable, but mercifully short—I only had to play for about half an hour before credits rolled and the DLC’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-night-springs-times-and-galaxy-theme-songs-1851564121&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-night-springs-times-and-galaxy-theme-songs-1851564121">sick theme song</a></span> played. </p><p>The final episode of <em>Night Springs</em> is called “Time Breaker” and it is some of Remedy’s best work. It follows the base game’s Sheriff Tim Breaker, but as you might suspect by now it isn’t really Tim Breaker. Though Time Breaker is even more complex than the first two episodes of <em>Night Springs</em>. This isn’t a version of Tim Breaker, rather this is a version of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/quantum-break-the-kotaku-review-1768387991&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/quantum-break-the-kotaku-review-1768387991">Shawn Ashmore</a></span>, the actor who portrays the character, aptly called The Actor in the episode’s credits. The episode begins on a film set with The Actor discussing the concept of the multiverse with The Director (Remedy’s creative director Sam Lake hamming it up as a cartoonish version of himself). Before long, The Actor finds himself traveling through alternate dimensions just like the character he’s portraying on film. </p><figure id="" data-id="397d566840013c539d120f4d63009b99" data-recommend-id="image://397d566840013c539d120f4d63009b99" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tim Breaker sits inside a comic panel with a thought box that reads &quot;something was different&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tim Breaker sits inside a comic panel with a thought box that reads &quot;something was different&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="397d566840013c539d120f4d63009b99" data-recommend-id="image://397d566840013c539d120f4d63009b99" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tim Breaker sits inside a comic panel with a thought box that reads &quot;something was different&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“Time Breaker” starts closer to Alan Wake 2 in visual presentation but soon, through that aforementioned dimension hopping, the episode turns into a shifting prism of game genres. While <em>Alan Wake 2</em> isn’t afraid to shift mediums and bend genres, it mostly played with the uncanny valley between reality and fiction by swapping between gameplay and live-action sequences. In “Time Breaker” Remedy explores the multitude of forms games have taken over the years, turning the AAA third-person game into, at times, a retro 2D side-scroller, an interactive comic book, and even a text adventure. The best compliment I can give “Time Breaker” is that it reminded me of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-the-kotaku-review-1793002839&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-the-kotaku-review-1793002839">Yoko Taro’s games</a></span> (I say this as a massive Yoko Taro sicko, I played <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-shut-down-1851206958&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-shut-down-1851206958"><em>NieR: Reincarnation</em></a></span>). But more than just a chance for Remedy to try something fresh, “Time Breaker” gives lore hounds something to chew on. The entirety of <em>Night Springs</em> is hosted by the base game’s mysterious <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-best-video-game-characters-of-2023-1851085884/slides/2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-video-game-characters-of-2023-1851085884/slides/2">Mr. Door</a></span>, and the final episode digs deep into the character. While we can’t quite tell what is or isn’t true about what the episode reveals about him, it plays within the bigger RCU in ways the rest of the expansion doesn’t to great success. “Time Breaker” only leaves the audience wanting more.<br></p><p>Thankfully more is coming. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/alan-wake-ii-the-lake-house&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/alan-wake-ii-the-lake-house"><em>Lake House</em></a></span> will be the second piece of DLC coming to the game this October and looks to pick up the threads of <em>Alan Wake 2</em> more directly while also likely leading into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/04/29/remedy-shares-development-updates-for-control-2-max-payne-1-2-remake-and-codename-condor&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/04/29/remedy-shares-development-updates-for-control-2-max-payne-1-2-remake-and-codename-condor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Control 2</em></a></span>. <em>Lake House</em>’s more serious tone furthers the notion that <em>Night Springs </em>is meant to act as a break for the player, a chance to do something different and fun before getting back into the main event.

Most of the trophies in <em>SWtD</em> aren’t that big of a deal. If you know exactly what to do and when, you could unlock all 37 trophies/achievements in <em>SWtD</em> in about three and-a-half hours. It’s theoretically possible to do in a single run, but you’d need a guide, and you’d end up spoiling most of the game’s twists for yourself. And, given one of the game’s more quirky achievements that asks you to switch up the language settings, you’d also be playing on your first run in a language that you (probably) don’t know how to read.</p><p>The best way to unlock all of <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em>’s unlockables is to plan on two playthroughs. Go in blind for your first one, enjoy the horrors, then clean up everything you missed the second time around.</p><p>Naturally, this guide necessarily contains <strong>heavy spoilers</strong> for the entirety of <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h15681"><a id="list"></a>All of <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em>’s trophies/achievements</h2><figure id="" data-id="917c7ab2ce92661cb4e68028c12664d0" data-recommend-id="image://917c7ab2ce92661cb4e68028c12664d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player looks up a lift being carried on chains while monstrous flesh circles around everything." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player looks up a lift being carried on chains while monstrous flesh circles around everything." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="917c7ab2ce92661cb4e68028c12664d0" data-recommend-id="image://917c7ab2ce92661cb4e68028c12664d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player looks up a lift being carried on chains while monstrous flesh circles around everything." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For completing the game, you’ll earn the following story-related trophies/achievements:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>All Beans and Forgiveness</strong> (Bronze/10G)</li><li><strong>The Sickening of the Calm</strong> (Bronze/10G)</li><li><strong>Breathe In, Breathe Out, Repeat</strong> (Bronze/10G)</li><li><strong>Home by Christmas</strong> (Bronze/10G)</li><li><strong>Eye of the Needle</strong> (Bronze/25G)</li><li><strong>Everything Breaks</strong> (Bronze/25G)</li><li><strong>I Am The King</strong> (Bronze/25G)</li><li><strong>Compression Ignition</strong> (Bronze/10G)</li><li><strong>Into the Belly of the Beast</strong> (Bronze/10G)</li><li><strong>Surfacing</strong> (Bronze/25G)</li><li><strong>Beacon in the Dark </strong>(Bronze/25G)</li><li><strong>Treading Water </strong>(Bronze/25G)</li><li><strong>Beaufort Eleven</strong> (Bronze/15G)</li><li><strong>Leviathan</strong> (Bronze/25G)</li><li><strong>The Drowning of Davey Rennick</strong> (Bronze/25G)</li><li><strong>The Horror Sings</strong> (Bronze/25G)</li><li><strong>Still Wakes the Deep</strong> (Gold/100G)</li></ul><figure id="" data-id="8d2a30e4805568e5231b86780e34a820" data-recommend-id="image://8d2a30e4805568e5231b86780e34a820" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player extinguishes flames with a fire extinguisher." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player extinguishes flames with a fire extinguisher." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8d2a30e4805568e5231b86780e34a820" data-recommend-id="image://8d2a30e4805568e5231b86780e34a820" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player extinguishes flames with a fire extinguisher." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are also a couple of points in the game where you’ll have to find and use a fire extinguisher to progress forward.

These include finding dead crew members, answering all the emergency phone calls that come in over the course of the game, and, uh, dying a lot. If you want that platinum trophy and/or 1,000 gamerscore, then you’re going to need to deliberately murder Caz around 2 dozen times.</p><p>It’s worth noting here that <em>SWtD </em>handles its “collectibles” a little differently from most other games. Progress on each trophy/achievement is saved directly to your profile, much as in the <em>Resident Evil </em>remakes. So you don’t have to get everything on a single run through the game for it to count. This can come in handy, as several trophies/achievements are linked to unlabeled tasks that you can do in the first 10 minutes.</p><hr><h3 id="h15683"><a id=""></a>Full Fathom Five (Bronze/10G)</h3><figure id="" data-id="265c3568706601ffba43777fd2dd3855" data-recommend-id="image://265c3568706601ffba43777fd2dd3855" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player looks down at the ocean from a broken bridge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player looks down at the ocean from a broken bridge." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="265c3568706601ffba43777fd2dd3855" data-recommend-id="image://265c3568706601ffba43777fd2dd3855" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player looks down at the ocean from a broken bridge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For this achievement, you’ll have to die by falling into the sea in five different areas on the rig’s exterior.</p><p>This is harder than it sounds as you’ll spend roughly two-thirds of <em>SWtD</em> deep in the rig’s guts. When you <em>are</em> outside, you aren’t always at imminent risk of falling overboard. You have to actively look for opportunities to jump over a railing to Caz’s watery demise.</p><p>On a typical blind run through the game, you’re most at risk of falling into the sea on the Under Rig right after the initial outbreak and on Starboard, when you’re using the helicopter as a makeshift ladder. Those both have a couple of sudden surprises that can take you off-guard.</p><figure id="" data-id="ec481cf27e18f3cafdbf7c5185065a57" data-recommend-id="image://ec481cf27e18f3cafdbf7c5185065a57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player holds on to a helicopter hanging off a ledge by cables." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player holds on to a helicopter hanging off a ledge by cables." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ec481cf27e18f3cafdbf7c5185065a57" data-recommend-id="image://ec481cf27e18f3cafdbf7c5185065a57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player holds on to a helicopter hanging off a ledge by cables." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You can also deliberately find places to leap into the sea right when you reach Lifeboats Access; on your second visit to the Deck, as you’re using the fallen shipping containers to evade Muir; and on the stack on the Processing Quad. For extra black comedy points, follow up your victory over Addair by quietly dropping through one of the holes in the stack’s walkway.</p><p>There’s a final opportunity for Full Fathom Five if you need it right at the end of the game when you revisit the Crew Lounge in Accommodation. At this point, a big hole’s been torn in the wall and it overlooks the sea. It’s morbid, but it offers one last chance to throw Caz overboard.</p><hr><h3 id="h15684"><a id=""></a>Clear Down (Sliver/25G)</h3><p>For this achievement, you’ll need to answer all the emergency phone calls over the course of the game. Five of these cannot be missed due to being mission objectives, while eight are technically optional. </p><p>It can be difficult to hear a phone’s ring over all the other industrial mayhem that’s usually happening in <em>SWtD</em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/cartoon-network-hashtag-highlights-how-busted-twitter-is<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Twitter’s trending sidebar is no longer–if it ever was–a good metric of a day’s conversation; today, for instance, I’ve got a promotion I can’t be rid of for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/06/prageru-climate-change-denier-republican-donors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted right-wing pseudo-school</a> PragerU. But beneath that, I’ve also got the hashtag “RIP Cartoon Network,” which is full of panic that the beloved animation channel has officially shut down. It hasn’t, though, or not any more than it had already.</p><p>The hashtag is an invention of <a href="https://x.com/AWorkersIgnited" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animation Workers Ignited</a>, which has been raising awareness of labor issues in the animation industry. As part of that, they’ve put out a couple very good and informative <a href="https://x.com/AWorkersIgnited/status/1805299856635772999" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">videos</a>. The <a href="https://x.com/AWorkersIgnited/status/1810440310838968397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest</a> is about how animation carried the entertainment industry during the pandemic thanks to its ability to be done remotely, only for animation workers to face layoffs and cuts afterwards at the altar of making lines go up.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Cartoon Network is dead?!?!</p><p>Spread the word about what’s at stake for animation!!!

While some people, particularly those in the know, fulfilled the assignment by telling <a href="https://x.com/MatthewB64/status/1810525874158260259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moving</a> <a href="https://x.com/lindsaykatai/status/1810543303525601617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and</a> <a href="https://x.com/MagusSerling/status/1810442757221257307" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anger-inducing</a> stories about corporate greed upending their lives, following the <a href="https://x.com/hashtag/RIPCartoonNetwork?src=hashtag_click" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hashtag</a> took me to tons of regular animation fans freaking out that something new had happened to the network, or that it had been officially closed.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of these tweets include Community Notes, maybe the only good feature Twitter owner Elon Musk can take vague credit for, that Cartoon Network has <em>not</em> shut down and citing the Animation Workers Ignited video or <a href="https://bleedingcool.com/tv/ripcartoonnetwork-trends-as-animation-industry-concerns-grow-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">news articles</a> about the hashtag. The Ignited account later <a href="https://x.com/AWorkersIgnited/status/1810505074189455758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>, “For clarity, the original Cartoon Network Studios is gone.

And also, while nothing new has happened to Cartoon Network, I wouldn’t call it alive: it’s owned by Warner Bros, who hate <a href="https://aftermath.site/coyote-vs-acme-fuck-david-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everything</a> they <a href="https://aftermath.site/rooster-teeth-shut-down-warner-brothers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">own</a>. In 2022, Cartoon Network Studios <a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/warner-bros-tv-group-layoffs-82-staffers-channing-dungey-1235400286/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">merged</a> with Warner Bros Animation and saw <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/12/23400943/warner-bros-cartoon-network-layoffs-david-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs and show cutbacks</a>. It vacated its building in <a href="https://www.cartoonbrew.com/studios/rip-cartoon-network-studios-burbank-building-2000-2023-230408.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2023</a>. It’s not dramatic to call it a shadow of its former self, the way so many things we once enjoyed are. The Ignited video is very correct that Cartoon Network, along with animation more broadly, is in a bad place and that people should be pissed off about it.</p><figure></figure><p>Was “RIP Cartoon Network” a good hashtag to pick? It’s dramatic and prone to virality, so in one way yes. But in another way it highlights one of Twitter’s ever-more-dire flaws, which is how swiftly and widely misinformation spreads on the platform these days. This was <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-twitter-false-news-travels-faster-true-stories-0308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">always the case</a>, of course, but it feels much worse in the platform’s current landscape of <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/elons-gordian-knot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">desperation for advertizers</a>, <a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/07/26/elon-musks-absurd-twitter-rebrand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">edgelordification</a>, whatever-the-fuck <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/10/it-sure-looks-like-x-twitter-has-a-verified-bot-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">verification</a> signifies now, and <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/who-is-behind-all-the-pussy-in-bio-porn-spam-on-x.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pussy in bio</a>. It’s easy for things to spin out of hand, especially when there’s some emotion behind it, with posters responding to other posters in a sprawling game of Telephone. And even with Community Notes, there are less checks to bring things back to Earth than ever, as <a href="https://www.poynter.org/commentary/2023/news-media-quit-twitter-npr-pbs-new-york-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reputable news outlets</a> flee the platform and paid verification makes it hard to tell who can be trusted. (Remember how long it took us to figure out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24181373/noam-chomsky-not-dead-yet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Noam Chomsky wasn’t dead</a>?)</p><p>The hashtag has had the knock-on effect of throwing chum in the water of the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=2f3821052c9136cf&amp;sca_upv=1&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWILYEELdF0y3yed43kR9yGI_9sS1pQ:1720538793868&amp;q=rip+cartoon+network&amp;tbm=nws&amp;source=univ&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjhzYW9opqHAxU_D1kFHQaVBssQt8YBKAF6BAgTEAQ&amp;biw=1431&amp;bih=660&amp;dpr=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEO machine</a>, as outlets raced to debunk the rumor and get those sweet clicks. (Lest you think this article is part of that: while Aftermath is aware that SEO exists, the odds of Google picking this up are <a href="https://aftermath.site/google-seo-results-broken-media-private-equity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vanishingly low</a>. If you got here from Google, though, <a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">please subscribe</a>!) And the hashtag itself is full of hangers-on using it to get eyeballs on whatever their cause or self-promotion grift is.</p><p>I’m fascinated by how this little dust-up presents a snapshot in miniature of our current online landscape, though in this case it’s raising awareness of labor conditions and not <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/elon-musk-promoted-matt-walsh-213619740.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hate speech</a>. But “good” misinformation is still misinformation. Ignited’s follow-up tweet leads me to believe it was an accident, that the group didn’t think hard enough about how the hashtag could be misread, which is a good lesson in messaging for all of us. But watching it happen reminds me how much less I trust Twitter as a source of information these days, a habit I’m finding hard to break, and a reminder that you probably shouldn’t trust it either.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-zenless-zone-zero-character-seth-lowell-announced/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/zenless-zone-zero-reaches-50-million-global-downloads-hoyoverses-latest-success/">Zenless Zone Zero </a>has only been available for a public audience for several days, but the players love it. The game was released with various characters you could unlock and try and pull using standard banners. Since its release, miHoYo has announced the newest character, Seth Lowell, to join the roster and the first to join the game.</p>
<p>Seth is a brand new character who joins the squad of playable characters in Zenless Zone Zero. He is an adorable cat cop in the Criminal Investigation Special Response Team. As of yet, we don't know his capabilities or his role in the game.</p>
<p>The official social media accounts for Zenless Zone Zero began posting pictures of this white-haired cat boy and attaching some quotes that he uses within the game. <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/news/124698" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seth Lowell</a> is being voiced by the highly talented Nazeeh Tarsha, who has voice-acted in games such as Genshin Impact, Street Fighter 6, and many more.</p>
<p>Seth Lowell is the second playable character from the Criminal Investigation Special Response Team to be available in the game. Zhu Yuan is the first playable character from that faction. We also already know we will get a third character from this faction named Qingyi.</p>
<p>While not much is known about either character's arrival in Zenless Zone Zero, it is heavily hinted that Seth Lowell has big connections to New Eridu, especially as he says to contact New Eridu's Public Security, the section he works in.</p>
<p>We are currently unsure of what weaponry Seth Lowell will be equipped with and what elemental attribute he'll be carrying. Based solely on the quotes that have been released, he may be a melee fighter who uses fists or fist weapons.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there is currently no set release date or time for Seth or Qingyi's release. There is also no information on their rarity, but we expect that miHoYo will begin drip-feed details over the coming days before their release. Once both Seth and Qinyi are released, there will be three playable characters from the Criminal Investigation Special Response Team faction, compared to the stark Obol faction, which only has one playable character.</p>
<p>Will you be rolling for Seth or Qinyi?</p>
