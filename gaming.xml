            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>July 2025 kicked off with devastating news for Microsoft employees, as it laid off <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">9,000 workers across the entire company,</a> with a significant number of those layoffs hitting Xbox and Microsoft's gaming division. <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Studios</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">game projects</a> were shut down, veteran developers were either laid off or<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-banjo-kazooie-sea-of-thieves-director-leaves-rare-after-35-years-following-everwild-cancellation/"> left</a> because of the cuts, and amid reports that the layoffs are directly related to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">Microsoft wanting to invest more in its AI efforts</a>, Microsoft and Xbox executives have failed to read the room multiple times.</p>



<p>While claims were circulating that Microsoft and Xbox are<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/"> "<em>trying their damndest to replace jobs with AI agents</em>,"</a> it was unfortunate, to say the least, that a seemingly automated invite went out to developers inviting them to a roundtable at Gamescom 2025 all about <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-xbox-ai-tools-game-development-laying-off-thousands/">how AI tools can aid in game development</a>. Disdain towards Xbox, Microsoft, and the c-suite executives who didn't lose their jobs compounded when an executive producer at Xbox suggested that <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-microsoft-layoffs-ai-prompt-chatgpt-matt">laid-off workers confide in ChatGPT to help them cope with being laid off</a>.</p>



<p>At least executive producer Matt Turnbull's ill-advised LinkedIn post was, at least on the surface, an attempt to help laid-off workers. Principal development lead for Xbox Graphics, Mike Matsel's post, however, is somehow even more tone-deaf and bull-headed. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mmatsel_the-xbox-graphics-team-is-hiring-folks-with-activity-7349539853866344449-O1G3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">Matsel put out a call</a> that the Xbox Graphics team was hiring two roles. He specified that the team is looking for people "<em>with experience with device drivers, GPU performance, or related validation or engineering system experience</em>." He then links the two job postings, and tells people to message him directly if the postings on Microsoft's website claim to be closed. </p>



<p>That's all fine and well, and even though putting out a hiring call a little more than a week after mass layoffs is never a good look, it's unfortunately a common occurrence. What cinches Matsel's post as tone-deaf, is that he shares an AI-generated image along with his post, which shows someone working at a desktop, presumably looking at nothing, since the image shows their screen on the backside of the monitor. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The comments are, unsurprisingly, filled with people digging into Matsel for posting the image, with one person saying "<em>You could have just sketched an ad on paint, at least it would have been funny. This is just embarrassing.</em>" Another, seemingly referencing Matsel's lack of care in his post, wrote, "<em>I too can post AI slop. Put me on the team, coach!</em>"</p>



<p>You have to wonder whether Turnbull and Matsel made their posts earnestly, or if they were baiting the uproar that both posts have caused. Neither is a good look, because if they earnestly made these posts, then that shows a huge inability to read a room, and a lack of understanding as to how they should communicate with others, whether that's trying to communicate a message of empathy, or opportunity. </p>



<p>If they were baiting the reactions, it's surprising and disappointing to see two high-level executives seeking enjoyment out of a situation that has devastated hundreds of their former coworkers and each of their families. </p>

            <p>Gun.</p>
<p>There are a lot of them in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, it being a shooter and all. HD2 players aren't happy for it to end there though.</p>
<p>They've been asked for their input in renaming the single city on Super Earth they've so far succeeded in rebuilding since all of that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-battle-for-super-earth-makes-chinese-news-following-the-successful-and-slightly-review-bomby-defense-of-equality-on-sea">Illuminate invasion business</a>, and they're voting for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-next-warbond-is-full-of-funky-alien-tech-including-a-somewhat-stable-wormhole-teleportation-pack">Gun</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Let's face it, given the precedents set by the likes of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36064659">Boaty McBoatface</a> and its lesser known NASCAR twin the <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2021/05/01/why-kansas-nascar-cup-called-buschy-mcbusch-race-400/4897438001/">2021 Buschy McBusch Race 400</a> (yes, that was a name given to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Buschy_McBusch_Race_400">actual professional motor race</a>), this isn't a surprise.</p>
<p>Having managed to rebuild the city of Remembrance through their recent Galactic War efforts, players are currently voting in an <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1391934973841375273">Arrowhead-run Discord poll</a> dedicated to deciding on a new name for it. A new name by which to remember Remembrance. Yep, the whole thing's the usual kind of Helldiversy meta-joke that's still managed to make me crack a grin.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Cue the equally jokey response thus far. 35k and counting votes, that's over 70% of the total share, to rename the city 'Gun'. Well ahead of the second place runner 'Everlasting Memory', which currently boasts just over 9k votes, and third place 'New Remembrance' at 3k. Now, the option that's currently last, 'Peacebeacon's Bloodlight', I'd argue deserves to be there, but I think fourth place 'Winds of Change of Tides of War' warrants a bit more than just over 1k votes.</p>
<p>Sure, it's far too long, but you could abbreviate it to the snappy WoCoToW, which would only make you sound a bit like an alarmed space bird being attacked by a Terminid whenever you say it. Plus, long-winded and grandiose bollocks is the name of the game with HD2's Starship Troopers-ish <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-not-just-helldivers-2-plenty-of-games-owe-a-lot-to-the-films-of-paul-verhoeven">satire of the fash</a>. Did everyone just forget naming their ships something like 'Ombudsman of Individual Merit'?</p>
<p>Anyway, they're clearly gonna name it 'Gun', which is still at least minor chuckleworthy and also feels very 2025. That is to say, I'm not too pistolff about it.</p>
<p>Gun.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-players-are-pushing-to-rename-one-of-super-earths-cities-gun]]></content:encoded>

I do not have information as to the exact timing at this point,” NatetheHate continued. “If I had to speculate, I would say probably the last week of July because Friday of that week is August 1st which is Nintendo’s earning report day. So, I could see them having a Direct that week leading to that investors’ report.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the episode, the leaker dives into all the reasons fans are getting impatient for the next Switch 2 showcase. Nintendo has a big first-party fall lineup, but not much of it is Switch 2 exclusive at the moment. We still need dates for <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> (cross-gen) and <em>Kirby Air Riders </em>(Switch 2 only). All of the big third-party ports like <em>Borderlands 4</em>, <em>Elden Ring</em>, and <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake </em>are slated for 2025 but haven’t been nailed down either. </p><p>According to NatetheHate,<em> Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is definitely coming to the Switch 2, but it’s unclear if that would get announced in a Nintendo Direct or via a standalone trailer by Rockstar Games. There’s also been a surprising lack of support from Microsoft so far. <em>Gears of War: Reloaded </em>is seemingly feasible on the new hardware, but is currently only announced for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. <em>Helldivers 2</em> is also getting ported to Xbox. While a stretch, that would probably be the biggest Switch 2 surprise of all if it somehow became a reality.</p><p>There’s also the mysterious absence of <em>Call of Duty</em>. Microsoft made promises to bring the franchise back to Nintendo platforms as part of its Activision acquisition, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/will-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-come-to-switch-2-1851784023&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/will-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-come-to-switch-2-1851784023">and the latter confirmed</a></span> that both sides were working on something that would be announced in the future. Does that start this year with <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, or in 2026 with the next sequel? Nintendo was reportedly being very precious with Switch 2 devkits during development, so it’s hard to have a good sense of who may have projects in the pipeline already and who is playing catchup. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-3d-mario-odyssey-donkey-kong-bananza-director-1851785403?_gl=1*1l973qf*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI1MDMwMzgkbzc5JGcxJHQxNzUyNTA2ODE2JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-3d-mario-odyssey-donkey-kong-bananza-director-1851785403?_gl=1*1l973qf*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI1MDMwMzgkbzc5JGcxJHQxNzUyNTA2ODE2JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">Finally, there’s the question of Mario</a></span>. It seems clearer than ever that <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is being made by a portion of the <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> team but not all of it, freeing up the others, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pauline-donkey-kong-bananza-timeline-dk-lore-1851786019&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pauline-donkey-kong-bananza-timeline-dk-lore-1851786019">like Nintendo veteran Yoshiaki Koizumi</a></span>, to work on the next 3D <em>Mario</em> game. It feels like we’re running out of time (and room) for the next one to arrive this fall, but the 2026 spring window could be a decent bet. Nintendo rarely teases things that are more than a year away at this point, but I’m hoping they make an exception in this case. They’ll want to have the next<em> Mario </em>ready for the next <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> movie anyway, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-movie-nintendo-bananza-super-mario-bros-1851786191&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-movie-nintendo-bananza-super-mario-bros-1851786191">that’s coming in April</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-direct-july-mario-red-dead-2-1851786219]]></content:encoded>

This stemmed from the game's newest client update for the Battlefield Labs test. This kind of thing is never meant to be seen by the public, so it's possible "Battlefield 6" is a placeholder name, or that there is no open beta and that the text itself is a placeholder.</p><p>Previous datamining efforts have revealed things like the first glimpse at a<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/behind-the-next-battlefield-game-culture-clash-crunch-and-colossal-stakes/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> rumored Battlefield battle royale mode</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alleged-battlefield-6-leak-shows-first-look-at-single-player-campaign/1100-6532642/" data-ref-id="1100-6532642">the game's campaign.</a></p><p>The Battlefield Labs test is closed, so you have to hope to be chosen to gain access.

It wouldn't be surprising, though, a Battlefield 2042 and other entries in the series had open betas prior to launch.</p><p>EA will formally reveal the next Battlefield game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reveal-still-happening-this-summer-ea-assures/1100-6532481/" data-ref-id="1100-6532481">at some point this summer</a>. Some fans thought there might be a reveal in June to join in with the numerous other gaming industry events, but that didn't happen. Now, some are theorizing that the official Battlefield 6 reveal might be accompanied by an announcement of an open beta, but none of this is confirmed as of yet.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is the first new entry in the franchise since 2021's Battlefield 2042, a poorly received entry in the series that EA management said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-studio-gm-responds-to-poor-launch-everybody-was-disappointed/1100-6504812/" data-ref-id="1100-6504812">suffered in part due to the remote-working experience during COVID.</a> It was, however, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-vanguard-and-black-ops-cold-war-were-no-1-and-2-best-selling-games-of-2021-in-the-us/1100-6499720/" data-ref-id="1100-6499720">No. 5 best-selling game in the US in 2021.</a></p><p>In other news, EA and DICE have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-add-something-close-to-an-ultimate-ability-for-each-class/1100-6533119/" data-ref-id="1100-6533119">discussed ultimate-like abilities coming to Battlefield 6</a> and defended the decision to not have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-brings-back-controversial-change-from-battlefield-2042/1100-6531734/" data-ref-id="1100-6531734"> class-locked weapons</a>.</p>

            <p>
If you were previously excited about the impending arrival of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-war">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War</a>'s Definitive Edition release, there are now two additional reasons to be excited. Firstly, it's out very soon on the newly announced date of 14th August, and secondly, there's a nice chunky discount if you own the Anniversary edition of the game.
</p>
<p>
Dawn of War's Definitive Edition was announced back in May, amid a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-and-space-marine-1-spruce-ups-are-coming-this-year">wave of other Warhammer 40K news bits</a>, promising a fancied-up version of the original 2004 real-time strategy game intended to be more palatable on modern day hardware.
</p>
<p>
There's 4K support, for instance, alongside upscaled textures (4x the originals, supposedly), an enhanced battlefield camera, "optimised" HUD and screen layouts for widescreen viewing, plus improvements to world lighting, units reflections, and shadows.
</p>

<p>
And it's not just the base game getting those enhancements, seeing as the Definitive Edition also includes Dawn of War's three expansions: Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, and Soulstorm. That, according to developer Relic Entertainment, amounts to "four Classic Dawn of War Campaigns, nine Armies, and over 200 maps". Plus, the Definitive Edition remains compatible with "over 20-years of lovingly crafted community mods".
</p>
<p>
Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition will cost $29.99 USD (or your local equivalent) when it launches for <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warhammer_40000_dawn_of_war_definitive_edition">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3556750/Warhammer_40000_Dawn_of_War__Definitive_Edition/">Steam</a> on 14th August. And anyone that already owns the game's Anniversary Edition, which released back in 2006, will be able to purchased the new version with 30 percent off as a "thank-you to our loyal fans."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-warhammer40kdawnofwar-pc">gave the original version of Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 8/10</a> back in the day when numbers still went above five. "It's a perfect gaming world," Eurogamer contributor Keiron Gillen wrote, "being exploited perfectly, for the first time."

            <p>Armchair History Interactive would like to you know that their upcoming strategy game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/master-of-command">Master Of Command</a> is full of smart, unforgiving systems. I know that because they emailed RPS saying that our "strategy features often spotlight smart, unforgiving systems".</p>
<p>I imagine several other outlets also received this exact email but this didn't stop me thinking "you know what - they're right! I <em>am</em> strategy-clever and tactics-tough! And what better way to show that than by covering this game, completely of my own volition and with no outside influence from cleverly worded PR emails playing on my sense of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>-knower's pride. That'll show those fatcats down at the community historical strategy club treasury committee. Who's "making too many explosiony noises during this serious reenactment of the Somme" now, eh?</p>
<p>Truthfully though, I probably would have covered this without the email. It looks suitably grand, and I really dig the idea of a strategy where the management isn't about empires, but the personal journey of your army on campaign. Plus, you get to play uniform dress-up. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>The game is set during the Seven Years' War, and you'll be managing your army's supplies, soldiers and equipment across the campaign. Lose all your lads, you lose the run. The line from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878450/Master_of_Command/">Steam</a> description that really hooked me is this'n:</p>
<blockquote><p>At its core, Master of Command is about the relationship between your army and the world around it. March too far and your men will starve. Rest too long and the enemy will reinforce. Your troops rely on you not just to lead them into battle, but to keep them fed, equipped, and alive long enough to reach the final objective.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don't march on an empty stomach, though. That'd be madness. First, fill your belly with features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>Real-Time Tactical Battles:</strong> No turns, no pausing. Engage in historical combat where morale, stamina, terrain, and timing determine the outcome.</li>
<li><strong>Fully Customizable Regiments:</strong> Equip your troops with historical equipment and weapons that affect accuracy, stamina, morale, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Campaign:</strong> Choose a region and enter a fully real-time map with fog of war, branching encounters, and a mobile enemy presence.</li>
<li><strong>Persistent Army Management:</strong> Every loss matters. Units gain experience, officers level up, and your choices carry across each region of the campaign.</li>
<li><strong>150 Historical Units:</strong> Recruit from an extensive roster of 18th-century European forces, each with unique stats, roles, and visuals.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Master Of Command is out sometime this year. I'm going to paint all the hats pink, see how those damn fatcats down at the community historical strategy club treasury committee like that one.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/master-of-command-is-a-strategy-game-of-crunchy-musketry-and-total-war-style-battles-that-tells-the-story-of-an-army-not-an-empire]]></content:encoded>

It also, like the old games, includes visual gags in each of its updated levels. But one particular joke spotted in one of the game’s few totally new levels, Waterpark, seems to include a dig at how Activision treated Neversoft and the <em>Guitar Hero</em> franchise. And Iron Galaxy, the studio behind <em>THPS 3+4</em>, says it is going to remove the joke.</p><p>As spotted by fans online, in Waterpark, you can find a trash can containing a box for a fictional game titled “<em>Banjo Champion</em>.” In a Reddit post, one fan shared an image of the Easter egg/joke and insinuated it was Iron Galaxy shitting on Neversoft. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/THPS/comments/1ly2f8i/comment/n2rjhzz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/THPS/comments/1ly2f8i/comment/n2rjhzz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This led to a comment from Iron Galaxy denying the poster’s claim</a></span>.</p><p>“We have the utmost respect for anyone who makes games,” said Iron Galaxy on Reddit. “We’re investigating how that got in there in the first place. Thank you to the community for bringing this to our attention, and we’ll be removing that from the environment art in the next update.”</p><p>This prompted a lot of replies from fans asking Iron Galaxy to leave it in, as they didn’t believe it was a joke about Neversoft, but instead a joke about Activision. </p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has contacted Iron Galaxy and Activision for comment. </p><p>When I spotted this box on Waterpark, I assumed it was Iron Galaxy making a joke about how Neversoft, the creators of the <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater </em>series, were forced off the skateboarding franchise around 2005 and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20100216142213/http://www.bingegamer.net/2010/rumor-layoffs-loss-of-guitar-hero-at-neversoft/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100216142213/http://www.bingegamer.net/2010/rumor-layoffs-loss-of-guitar-hero-at-neversoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had to develop new <em>Guitar Hero</em> games instead</a></span>. That sounds a lot like how Activision operates in 2025, shoving all of its teams onto its current big cash cow, <em>Call of Duty</em>, and not letting them make their own stuff. Eventually, <em>Guitar Hero</em> sales tanked, and Neversoft was closed in 2014, with its remaining staff shoved into the <em>CoD </em>mines. A sad and frustrating end for a great studio.

                <p dir="ltr">Not even a month after launch, Broken Arrow has received a hefty new update for the real-time strategy game. The patch lets players alter their map size in skirmish and custom lobbies; previously, this was automatically selected by the game. In addition, developer Steel Balalaika Studio has addressed anti-cheat issues.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1604270/view/521970734297251862" rel="nofollow ">Update 1.08</a> for Broken Arrow introduces new PvE scenarios on the Kaliningrad and Ruda maps, for up to three players. Meanwhile, the sprint cooldown for infantry is being slashed in half, down to 30 seconds. Steel Balalaika says it doesn't want to make too many balance changes all at once, so is starting with this alteration.</p><p dir="ltr">As for cheating, there have been over 2,000 players banned in Broken Arrow. However, the developer is investigating possible banishments that were unfairly handed out to people. For instance, Steel Balalaika noted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1604270/view/537731883551691566" rel="nofollow ">on Steam</a> that players utilizing cheats only in single-player modes could have been banned from multiplayer, since the anti-cheat system can't differentiate between the two.</p><p dir="ltr">Broken Arrow launched on June 19 and costs $50. Per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1604270/charts/" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>, the RTS game is a top 100 seller on Valve's platform and appears to be averaging a peak of 20,000 concurrent players daily for July. It's a realistic take on the genre, offering a single-player campaign with 19 missions following US and Russian forces. The game also has more than 300 military and tech units to utilize.</p><p dir="ltr">Below are the full patch notes:</p><h3 dir="ltr">Added:</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Added option to change map size in Skirmish and Custom lobbies.

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">While story is not usually a focus in the Donkey Kong series, Donkey Kong Bananza see the titular ape partnering with a teenaged Pauline, a character who had previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-character-leak-spurs-speculation-over-dk-lore/1100-6530707/">leaked</a> before her official reveal in last month's Donkey Kong Bananza Direct. The revelation has already prompted plenty of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-raises-the-possibility-of-a-dk-multiverse/1100-6532529/" data-ref-id="1100-6532529">speculation over the Donkey Kong timeline</a> and whether this game could be a prequel, or another universe altogether.</p><p dir="ltr">The Donkey Kong Bananza Direct had revealed that other characters from the Donkey Kong Country series would also feature in the game, such as Kranky Kong and Rambi, while the infamous DK Rap can also be heard.</p><p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Bananza is the gorilla's first 3D platformer since 1999's Donkey Kong 64 and the first to be internally developed by Nintendo since 2005's Donkey Kong Jungle Beat. In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-looks-like-the-mario-odyssey-successor-no-one-expected/1100-6532824/">preview</a>, it was confirmed that it is being developed by the same team behind Super Mario Odyssey.</p><p>A listing has also revealed that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-movie-team-returns-for-a-donkey-kong-film-listing-reveals/1100-6533131/">Donkey Kong film is in the works</a> from the same Mario movie team, as Nintendo and Universal jointly filed a copyright for an "untitled Donkey Kong motion picture."</p>

			<p>I’m slowly maneuvering through a neon-lit club that’s been the site of a casualty-heavy shooting alongside another teammate. The music is blasting and the lights are dazzling, but nobody is here save for a few terrified civilians, a handful of armed attackers, and crude piles of innocent bodies on each dancefloor. It’s grim, and I’m tense as I search every room for enemies. I slowly swing a door open…and it swings back towards me to close. I swing it open once more, and it returns back at me yet again. Before I can press the button to open it a third time, it pulls all the way back to reveal a shotgun-toting enemy who was behind it all along, and I laugh and scream as I frantically start shooting take him down. It’s fun and tense, it’s stupid and scary, and it’s Ready or Not.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ready or Not: Weight of the Badge - Console Release Date Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M5eMHPLjBgI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At face value, Ready or Not is an incredibly serious game. Whether you boot up the single player Commander mode or a co-op lobby, you’re initially tossed into a realistic police station, and given a list of almost two dozen different S.W.A.T. encounters to take on – each one either based on an eerily familiar real-life tragedy, or simply set in the kind of speculative or terrifying circumstance that I would never want to find myself in. It’s easy to see a mission list that includes an active campus shooter level, a club shooting level, and a sex trafficking level and think the game is going out of it’s way to pursue shock value above all else. The game doesn’t just agree that these situations are awful and terrifying, though, but it also smartly acknowledges that the deliverers of justice can be awful and terrifying too.</p>


<p>When you load into a mission, your base objectives are always to rescue every civilian and “bring order to chaos” – this means killing or arresting every armed enemy on the premises. Your only option for securing an innocent life, though, is to yell them down and cuff them as they question what you’re doing in a terrified or confused tone. And while you’re hunting down a primary armed suspect, you’ll encounter questionable activities or environmental details that go strangely ignored by your direct objectives, yet slowly paint a clearer picture of corruption and ignorance that, instead of feeling like shock value, rings startlingly true with how cops in America are perceived and behave today.</p>


<p>This helps to provide a lot of nuance to the scenarios, but you can also play with four friends in co-op and watch each other get flung across a hallway by a booby-trapped door. The wild tonal ping-pong that happens when you play Ready or Not in co-op makes for some of the most entertaining multiplayer gaming I’ve dug into all year. Guiding AI companions through slow, narrow corridors is challenging, but nowhere near as engaging as the cops-and-robbers roleplaying that you get with real people. It’s so&nbsp;easy to either lock in and pursue objectives, or slip up and laugh until your belly hurts when a friend messes up or the mission goes south.</p>
<p>There is a staggering amount of hardware at your disposal in Ready or Not that makes it incredibly easy to tackle the same mission a dozen different ways. Besides multiple kinds of primary and secondary weapons to choose from, you’ve got a variety of attachments, scopes, and special gear that can help you lock in a particular specialisation and role. Maybe you want to rock a nimble amount of armour and non-lethal suppression gear. Maybe you want to be the first through every opening with a bullet proof shield. Maybe you just want to shoot the hinges off every door with a shotgun.</p>

<p>The mechanical variety at your disposal can get tripped up while playing on console by an equipment wheel that’s a bit too unwieldy to navigate – with the game’s PC origins, it’s great to see there’s support for keyboard and mouse controls, if you want to circumvent this issue. The UI in general is also just very small for playing on a TV, compared to playing on PC.</p>
<p>A few situations in Ready or Not&nbsp;do bring the experience to a screeching halt, though. As mentioned earlier, playing with AI isn’t nearly as thrilling. At times, they’re almost&nbsp;<em>too</em> competent and can clear out an entire room with the precision of RoboCop before you’ve even realized that room exists. The main single-player Commander mode attempts to add a layer of meta-progression with a squad of partners who you dynamically manage and upgrade as they go on missions, get injured, face failure, and can even die. It’s interesting, but not nearly enough and not all that exciting. Perhaps a roguelike spin on your mission objectives and gear could add a lot to the experience, but as it stands, I had no reason to get attached to the identical gruff old police men the game threw at me.</p>

<p>I also repeatedly faced an awkward moment in each mission where, as you get done exploring the level and have taken care of nearly every objective, there’s always just one more civilian or enemy hiding somewhere. Thus, you’re forced to slowly backtrack through the map to find them – a repetitive task that immediately strips away all tension and often brings the silly co-op fun to a screeching halt. Until one of you rounds the corner and yelps in surprise while firing wildly.</p>
<p>These are minor flaws, though, in what is otherwise an incredibly addictive and punishing co-op thrill ride. Ready or Not is an absolute blast, and the huge variety of levels and equipment provide a feast of equally intense and hilarious co-op possibilities for you and your friends.</p>

<p>In addition to Pokémon Presents</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>YouTuber Nate the Hate has claimed that a Nintendo Direct is due to take place later this month.</p>
<p>Speaking on his latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y">podcast episode</a>, Nate states that a Direct will take place after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> releases on <strong>17th July 2025</strong>. He goes on to stress that he does not know any further details, including specific dates, timings, and potential content.</p>
<p>He does, however, speculate that a Direct could happen in the last week of July, theorising that Nintendo will want to put a new showcase out before its three-month earnings release on <strong>Friday, 1st August 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's what he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What I have been told... There is a Direct this month, so the month of July. But, that Direct will not take place until after Donkey Kong Bananza releases. Beyond that, I have no additional information, I do not have information as to the exact timing at this point.</p>
<p>"If I had to speculate, I would say probably the last week of July because Friday of that week is August 1st, right, which is Nintendo's earning report day. So I could see them having a Direct that week leading to that investor's report."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nate has proven to be reliable in the past, having successfully predicted the exact date on which the Switch 2 announcement trailer would drop. Still, it's worth taking this with a grain of salt regardless. It's a fairly safe estimate, all told, given that Nintendo has often dropped announcements and Directs around the time of its earnings reports.</p>
<p>We also have to keep in mind that we're getting a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/the-next-pokemon-presents-is-coming-in-july">Pokémon Presents showcase on 22nd July</a>. It wouldn't be completely out of the question for Nintendo to follow up with a proper Direct so soon after, but it's definitely another wrinkle to consider.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest question mark lingering over our heads at the moment is when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is due to release. The game is scheduled to launch this year, but no specifics have been shared at the time of writing. We're also very keen to learn when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> is due to launch, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios has announced a&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>modding competition, and the top prize is a hefty wad of cash, but even if you don't win that, there are other goodies up for grabs.</p>

<p>As revealed on the official&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498325386812199405" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">page</a>, the modding contest will see modders using the&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-modding-tool-at-launch" rel="nofollow">modding tools</a>&nbsp;in order to create something that will impress and delight the 11 bit judges. The top prize is a $10,000 cash payout, which ain't too shabby.</p>

<p>Even if you don't nab the top prize, though, there are several other areas you might win in. Other contest categories include Best City Mechanics, Best Frostland Mechanics, Best Graphics, and Best Politics, and the best mod in each of these areas will win a custom AMD Radeon RX 7700 graphics card.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-2-modding-contest-areas.jpg?itok=KZ7Nztlm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-2-modding-contest-areas.jpg?itok=B26iDu7Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s modding contest wants you to make an unforgettable mod.</figcaption></figure><p>Even if you do happen to win in one of those other categories, you'll still be eligible for the Best Overall Mod category as well, so it's entirely possible that one mod will win two or even three prizes at once.</p>

<p>Three mods will also be the recipients of the contest's Honorable Mentions, which will net those modders an 11-bit "goodie pack", although 11 bit doesn't say what will be contained within those packs.</p>

<p>In terms of rules, you must submit your&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>mod to mod.io, although you can also upload it to the Steam Workshop if you like. You'll need to use the #fp2modcontest hashtag, too. You can check out the full rules for the contest, as well as info on how to enter, <a href="https://mod.io/g/frostpunk2/r/fp2-mod-contest-terms-conditions" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>




<p>11 bit says it doesn't matter if you've already uploaded your mod; any mod is eligible, as long as it's uploaded to mod.io, it can run with the current version of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>, and it doesn't contain "harassment, sexual/erotic, or otherwise inappropriate content".</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the world of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>, 11 bit revealed back in February that the game will be coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-console-summer-roadmap" rel="nofollow">sometime this summer</a>, although we still don't have a release date for those versions yet, unfortunately.</p>

<p>For now,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and it's also part of PC Game Pass. The modding contest is open right now, and it runs until August 22nd, with the winners being announced by the start of September. While you wait, you can check out our own Andrew's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/frostpunk-2-review-balance-resources-or-city-will-burn" rel="nofollow">review of the game here</a>.</p>

Deep beneath the smog of a plausibly denied planetoid, there lurks a space hulk full of dessicated hand monsters, shorn dreadlocks and long-emptied Pulse Rifles. The vessel mostly lies silent, but every so often, an ancient server deep within the core crackles awake, beaming an ominous signal far out into the void, and the chitinous corridors come alive with flamethrowers and squelchy stabbing noises and oh, so much screaming. Also, the coveted chirping of Steam achievements.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The vessel in question is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/aliens-vs-predator">Alien Vs Predator</a>. Not Rebellion's original three-way <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> from 1999, mind, but the 2010 threequel which people derided at the time, but which is clearly some gradation of Good Video Game in that a few of those people are still playing it, 15 years later. 
</p>
<p>
This weekend, the supposedly dead game enjoyed a sudden Steam playercount bounce to around five thousand concurrent players, care of a community-run server. Many were motivated by the desire to earn one of the game's rarest Steam achievements, The Six Pack, which requires you to play a ranked match with six Steam friends. That a whopping 2.2% of players have earned this to date suggests (out of context) that the original AVP multiplayer scene died on its arse rather quickly. So it's nice that <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/10680">somebody's coordinating efforts to boost the numbers</a>. We'll make it to 3.0 someday. Perhaps in another 15 years.
</p>
<p>
I'm writing this up partly because it's evidence of the good that can happen when publishers take steps <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/70-of-games-with-online-requirements-are-doomed-according-to-stop-killing-games-survey">to ensure that their online games can be played after the cessation of official support</a>. And partly, I'm writing it up because it's nice to revisit Rebellion's Alien games. The 1999 game was a frantic pressure-cooker shooter with excellent lighting, in that you generally couldn't see the Aliens until you flash-bulbed them with muzzle fire. It also featured many lovely adaptations of the film sets, which you could clamber all over as a sticky-fingered xenomorph. It didn't do nearly as good a job with the Predators, but then again, there has never been a good Predator game. You know I speak truth, Yautja lovers. Fight me.
</p>
<p>
The 2010 game has been much shat-upon. In our review, Alec Meer (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-aliens-vs-predator">witheringly summed it up</a> as "not a terrible singleplayer shooter", "just a very ordinary one", adding that the multiplayer almost saves it: "when a couple of adept players are stalking random panickers like myself, this really threatens to be the game we hoped it would be." I was similarly unenamored when I reviewed the game for some magazine or other, but the community drive for Six Pack achievements has me yearning for the dropship.
</p>
<p>
The Six Pack initiative seems to have prompted a wave of Overwhelmingly Positive Steam reviews. I was tickled by the one that objects that the game should more properly be called "Marines vs Aliens vs Predator". I like the implication that human players of Aliens vs Predator - which I estimate covers about about 70% of you, based on the wording and tenor of the average RPS comment - are in danger of feeling left out. Also, Marines aren't a species, but don't let that stop you launching a Change.org petition. While you're at it, see if you can get Godzilla vs Kong retitled Godzilla vs Kong vs Commuters.

This guy wants to save everyone he can, and the movie makes a point of showing him going to great lengths to protect the people and animals of Earth. One of the standout moments in the movie is when Clark, in the midst of a much bigger battle, saves a small squirrel. Superman doesn’t trade lives. Everyone is worth saving, whether they’re a person or a little rodent. He initially does this because a damaged message from his parents, recorded before they sent him from his doomed home planet of Krypton, seemed to instruct him to be humanity’s protector. But once the message was repaired, it’s revealed that, in this version of events, Clark was sent to the planet to rule over it like a dictator. Nevertheless, he makes his own decision to commit to the mission he started: to be humanity’s protector. But he’s not “of this world,” so Lex Luthor and his ilk conspire against our hero and use propaganda to try and turn the public on him. That’s pretty much the immigrant experience in America.</p><p>The core conflict of <em>Superman </em>is refreshingly simple. Clark cannot fathom how geopolitics could be more important to <em>anyone</em> than saving the lives of innocent people. An early interview between him and Lois Lane escalates because she repeatedly pokes at him for not saving people “the right” way. This principle extends to him stopping the country of Boravia from invading its neighbor, Jarhanpur. Though these places are fictional, the parallels between these events and the real-world conflict between Israel and Palestine aren’t subtle. Some debate whether or not this was actually Gunn’s intention or if it’s merely happenstance that the film’s geopolitical conflict mirrors a real one, but that hasn’t stopped people from taking this to mean the movie is pro-Palestine or, more specifically, anti-Israel.</p><p>As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://comicbookclublive.com/2025/07/13/is-superman-about-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://comicbookclublive.com/2025/07/13/is-superman-about-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some critics have pointed out</a></span>, <em>Superman </em>could very well be about Palestine, but it could also be about Ukraine. The truth is the film’s fictional framing is non-descript enough that it can be interpreted as being about many things. My cynical read is that it could give DC some plausible deniability to talk about these kinds of conflicts without having to make a big public statement, but whatever the authorial intent is, the fact that viewers are coming away from it wholeheartedly believing that it is “political” speaks to the truth of its story. It’s emboldening to those who want the world to be better, and uncomfortable for those who think things are just fine as they are. Lex Luthor is willing to spread lies, put people in danger, and even kill innocent people to maintain his power. Superman, having been on the receiving end of a torrent of abuse and distrust, still wants to believe in people, rather than falling into cynical detachment. When Lois asks how he can still think everyone he meets is “beautiful” after everything he’s been through, Clark says believing in people, even after you’ve been let down, is “punk rock.” If that’s “too political” for you, then that sounds like a you problem. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/superman-israel-palestine-woke-clark-kent-punk-rock-1851786212]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Bluey is one of the most popular animated shows in the United States, with viewers streaming more than 55 billion minutes of the cartoon in 2024.

Exclusive to Amazon, the bundle pulls together the Bluey: The Videogame and one of two adorable gnome plushies. It’s set to release on <strong>October 17</strong>--but since the show is so popular, we’d recommend preordering a unit before they sell out.</p><div title="6533134 - Bluey Gnome Plush Bundle" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3889" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6533134 - Bluey Gnome Plush Bundle" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FGJZ7D64?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FGJZ7D64?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FGJZ7D64?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Bluey Gnome Plush Bundle</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FGJZ7D64?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FGJZ7D64?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FGJZ7D64?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$50 | Releases October 17</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluey-Videogame-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0CJ3GM5CS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluey: The Videogame</a> isn’t new--in fact, it launched back in 2023. Reviews were mixed for the title, though fans of the animated cartoon will likely find something to enjoy about the simple adventure. What makes this version compelling, however, is the exclusive Gnome Plush.</p><p>Each bundle comes with one of two different gnomes, making it a fun surprise for young Bluey fans. While the video game is available on most consoles, this bundle is limited to Nintendo Switch (though it's fully playable on Switch 2).

But since the adventure is quite short, consider pairing your Bluey game and gnome with some other Bluey merch. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluey-Seasons-One-Three-Blu-ray/dp/B0DFWKTXTD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluey: Seasons 1-3 (Blu-ray)</a> is also on sale for just $26 (was $50), which happens to be its lowest price of all time.

            <p>Xbox's principle development lead for its graphics department has put out a LinkedIn post announcing some new job opportunities. The catch? He used a cringey AI-generated graphic to do so, drawing ire.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7349539853866344449/">Mike Matsel's weekend post </a>calls for those experienced with "device drivers, GPU performance, or related validation or engineering system experience". The attached image shows a lady typing away on a computer, with the text displayed on the back of the monitor. Brilliant.</p>
<p>This caught traction online and, as you can imagine, responses to this post are quite negative. Alexander Bertram-Powell wrote: "Appreciate this preview of the care and attention to detail that make you a leader", while Danylo S followed up with: "First layoffs, then post for hire with AI slop, wonderful work, Xbox".</p>

<p>This post came at a bad time, too. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">Xbox cut a significant chunk of its workforce across various game developers</a> such as Zenimax Online Studios, Rare, The Initiative, and more.</p>
<p>It's also been reported <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/microsoft-using-more-ai-internally-amid-mass-layoffs">Microsoft is pushing its remaining employees to use more AI at work in the wake of these layoffs</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I wasn’t very happy when I lived in Washington DC. After The Washington Post <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/washington-post-is-closing-launcher-its-highly-regarded-video-game-website" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down</a> its video games desk Launcher, two months after I moved to town to run it, I felt lost and angry. I felt stuck: in a lease in a city I didn’t want to live in, in a job that had its upsides but simply wasn’t the one I’d overhauled my life for. Determined not to let my situation ruin my sobriety, and with most of my friends hundreds of miles away, I channelled all my feelings into riding my bike.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite being a car-centric city, DC and its surrounding areas have an excellent trail system and robust <a href="https://waba.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bike</a> <a href="https://www.thebikehouse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">culture</a>. I spent my weekends <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cv8VA5IOOib/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">devising</a> <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1639772559129313282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long</a>, <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1644833560811929607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aimless</a> loops around town; I joined <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dcbikeparty/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">group rides</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_T_UzltqOC/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">themed</a> <a href="https://waba.org/event/the-cider-ride/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rides</a> and <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1664998270320492545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">races</a> and one queer-specific meetup full of terrifyingly fit older men in Spandex whom I gamely tagged after in my work pants. I threw myself into bikepacking, jumping from a couple short jaunts along the C&amp;O Canal on a newly-purchased <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1642575452639305728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gravel bike</a> into a three-day loop through <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1660665354639507456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maryland farmland</a>. After that, if I could think of someplace to go and map out an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cvpr4PFOimJ/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impractical</a> way to bike there while sleeping in a tent along the way, I went. I did little <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1670780212856979457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overnights</a> on the C&amp;O and in a sweltering <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1673101872880549889" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">campsite</a> off Virginia’s Washington and Old Dominion trail. I wandered through <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1678089175050887170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virginia gravel</a>; I <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CwyhB2pMBOQ/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biked</a> (and <a href="https://aftermath.site/failing-on-a-bike-trip-taught-me-too-much-about-myself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed</a> to bike) to neighboring towns. I eventually took a train all the way to <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-road-goes-ever-on-and-on" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pittsburgh </a>just so I could spend a week <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CyenHj4tOFH/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biking</a> back, and I still have a list of trips in the area I’d like to tackle even though I’ve moved away.</p><p>One of my more ridiculous dreams during this time was to bike to Frederick, Maryland to see the <a href="https://www.highwheelrace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Clustered Spires High Wheel Race</a>, a penny farthing race around a few blocks in a small, <a href="https://www.visitfrederick.org/plan-your-visit/about-frederick-county/history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">historic</a> town about 50 miles out of DC. Despite the minimal distance, I could never figure out a reasonable bike route to get there. This didn’t stop me from planning a trip and even reserving a campsite in 2023, but a warning from a colleague who attempted the ride and a mechanical issue on another ride the week before shook my confidence, and I ended up not going. But this weekend, a friend with family in the area agreed to drive me down from New York to finally see the race.&nbsp;</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>The National Clustered Spires High Wheel Race bills itself as “the only race of its kind in America” and “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DL2JOVKsIts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the largest high wheel race in the Western hemisphere</a>.” (There are also penny farthing races in <a href="https://www.sweden3days.se/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sweden</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/hillingdon-cycle-circuit/the-grand-old-ordinary-race-british-penny-farthing-championship-2024/1298044204225226/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">England</a>.)&nbsp; Started by Frederick couple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0ILnIKpcKg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric and Jeanne Rhodes</a> in 2012, 2025 marked its 11th year. The format has changed over the years, and this most recent version had heats of riders competing in timed crits around a .4 mile section of Frederick’s downtown. The two qualifying rounds required riders to do as many laps as possible in 20 minutes, with the top riders going at a half-hour championship through a blisteringly sunny 90+ degree afternoon.</p><p>Rider Chris Meacham of Pennsylvania ultimately <a href="https://results.raceroster.com/v2/en-US/results/gf3bw7vj3zq64bte/results?subEvent=234172&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won </a>the men’s division with 24 laps, while Melissa Eisdell, all the way from England, won the women’s division with 21. (The race itself was co-ed; the announcers said that 10 women competed this year out of a field of around 50, the most women who have ever competed.) Meacham told the <a href="https://www.fredericknewspost.com/news/economy_and_business/tourism/thousands-line-downtown-streets-as-high-wheel-racers-fly-past/article_8cbd9af1-3826-5669-92e6-522bf21f2eaa.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frederick News-Post</a>, “People are so much more excited about this type of bike race than any other bike race I go to… People are freaking out, so that's amazing. It just feels comfortable and safe here.”</p><p>It is, frankly, pretty hard not to freak out when you see a penny farthing in real life instead of an old photograph. The penny farthing was invented in <a href="https://www.highwheelrace.com/high-wheel-bicycles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1871</a> and was basically obsolete by the <a href="https://tnmot.org/collection/penny-farthing-bicycle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">late 1880s</a> thanks to the invention of the bike as we know it today, then called a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_bicycle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">safety</a>” bike due to how much safer it was than its predecessor. Without the drive train of today’s bikes, the penny farthing gets its speed from the size of its front wheel; the bigger the front wheel, the farther the bike goes with each wheel rotation, so a bigger wheel means a potentially faster bike. When these giant wheels start turning too fast for riders to keep up, they’ll drape their legs over the handlebars to get them out of the way of the spinning pedals, something I saw frequently at the race.</p><figure><video controls="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/07/IMG_6216.mov"></video></figure><p>Those handlebars are one part of what makes the penny farthing so <a href="https://theviewfromadrawbridge.com/2024/01/05/penny-farthings-transportational-death-traps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dangerous</a>. Unlike the bikes we know today, the rider’s entire weight is over that big front wheel; not only do your knees have to clear the handlebars to turn the wheel, but they can make it hard to bail from the bike if you fall. (This led to various <a href="https://www.udcpennyfarthing.com/history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">innovations</a> in handlebars.) Given where the rider is sitting and the design of the bike, a penny farthing is particularly prone to flipping over, called “taking a <a href="https://www.unicycle.com/blog/from-the-velocipede-to-the-modern-penny-farthing-a-history-of-bikes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">header</a>” because riders would launch head-first into the ground. This was a common occurrence in the past, and a potentially fatal one. For a bike that I mostly associate with old-time whimsy, I was horrified to learn how <a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/bicycle-history/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treacherous</a> they are.</p><p>The street fair at the Frederick race included the opportunity to sit on a penny farthing, safely immobilized and mounted via stepladder rather than a notch on the frame that actual riders <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QubZwutTtfM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use</a> once they get some speed going. I was shy when my friends suggested we sit on the bike for a photo, imagining it was meant for kids, but we drifted into the suspiciously adult-heavy line anyway, where two women were offering to draw handlebar mustaches on those waiting. I waved away the period-appropriate clothing as I climbed onto the bike, still trying to maintain some sense of journalistic distance, but once up there it was hard not to, in Meacham’s words, freak out. Even safely balanced, the bike was <em>very high</em>; I could see over the top of the street fair onto the racetrack, and it was exhilarating how flimsy and exposed the whole thing felt.&nbsp;</p><p>The one bike <a href="https://www.cyclingclassic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">race</a> I did in DC was a frighteningly serious affair, full of expensive racing bikes and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bikedc/comments/13zgp12/why_so_many_crashes_at_armed_forces_cycling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brutal crashes</a> in which I rode my little 80s <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1528891151335424001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trek</a> with its upright handlebars, a contrast that caused the race announcer to comment on how happy I looked pedaling along as grimly hunched racers swept past me. The atmosphere of the penny farthing race reminded me of that moment in its combination of frivolity and serious race kit. The common denominator was, of course, penny farthings, which ran the gamut of restored antiques, modern <a href="http://www.hiwheel.com/antique_replicas/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replicas</a>, and even a few smaller designs. Some racers wore period-appropriate outfits like suspenders, knickerbockers, and waistcoats. Others wore more dramatic costumes, with colorful tights, fake tuxedos, and decorative sunhats or tricorners affixed to their required helmets. Still others wore racing gear, bike shorts and jerseys stuffed with gels and water. One racer <a href="https://www.fredericknewspost.com/news/economy_and_business/tourism/heart-donation-by-one-mans-son-allows-another-to-advocate-from-atop-a-high-wheel/article_8d08a684-0e24-570a-a02e-3dd629aa816e.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wore a jersey</a> for the organ donation organization Donate Life; the father of the rider’s heart donor was among the spectators.&nbsp;</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>But even the silliest-dressed person looked intense and focused as they did their laps. At first, it seemed absurd to see people on penny farthings <a href="https://www.liv-cycling.com/global/campaigns/how-to-draft-on-a-road-bike/21873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drafting</a> each other or bending low to be more aerodynamic as they swept around the course. During the final I stood next to a man in an antique wool jersey and tall argyle socks, who told me he was a collector of vintage bikes but had only tried out a penny farthing once, at a prior year’s race, where he fell off and broke two ribs. He explained the unique strategic and physical challenge of racing a penny farthing: due to the bike’s mechanics, there’s not much chance of coming from behind or a dramatic sprint to the finish, so the race is instead a push-and-pull of getting and maintaining a lead and conserving your energy for the duration. It takes a lot of effort just to move and balance the bike, not to mention the fitness required of any bike race. As Meacham told the Frederick News-Post, “Being fit is one thing. Actually handling [the bike] is another."</p><p>But things weren’t all serious: In the intermission between the qualifiers and the finals, there were unicycle tricks, a “low wheel” race where riders raced the tiniest bikes they could find, and a “slow” race where penny farthings tried to go as slow as possible to cross the finish line last. This short, slow race was in many ways more harrowing than the main event, as riders wavered and wrestled gravity, towering above their spotters. The first round of the slow race had to go again when the effort made a rider veer so much that they didn’t travel in a straight enough line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>During the intermission I explored the perimeter of the course, where downtown Frederick bustled with the crowd. There were food vendors set up on the green outside City Hall, and a soda shop selling race merch and vintage sodas. Beyond just riding my bike, one of my favorite things about my DC-area bike trips was getting to see new towns for the first time, and I scrambled around reading informative history markers and admiring the old architecture. After the race, my friends convinced me not to buy an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbKApkQe2Jk&amp;list=RDnbKApkQe2Jk&amp;start_radio=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">autoharp</a> from a nearby pawn shop, and I failed to convince them to visit the <a href="https://www.visitfrederick.org/listing/national-museum-of-civil-war-medicine/750/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Museum of Civil War Medicine</a>, both of which were probably <a href="https://aftermath.site/civil-war-middle-age" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for the best</a>. We escaped the sun and heat by eating some very good Thai food and browsing a freakishly large antiques store. The racers all appeared to have their afterparty at a brewery off the course, and it was wild to see so many penny farthings lined up in the alley like you’d see any other bikes after a group ride.</p><figure></figure><p>If anything bad came of my day, it’s that I learned that a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESEF6FOhvGQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small penny farthing</a> can be had for a few hundred bucks, which would make it not impossible for <em>me</em> to take part in the Frederick race next summer. My friends didn’t entirely talk me out of this ridiculous idea when I shared the fruits of my online shopping research in the car back to NYC the next morning, but this plan reminded me of how swiftly my bike-riding time in DC had ramped up into feats that brought me stress as well as happiness. Maybe as a consequence of the years I spent <a href="https://aftermath.site/dry-january-sober-curious" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drinking</a> about my feelings instead of having them, I’m not very good at just <em>enjoying</em> enjoyable things, instead having a tendency to push their limits rather than just let them be what they are. So hopefully I will <em>not</em> buy a penny farthing of my own (unless you are a reader looking to offload one?..).</p><p>The best thing about the race was the best thing about all of my bike trips: getting out of the grooves of my own head and into the world. Even though I'm back in New York and in a job Jeff Bezos can't dissolve on a whim, I still struggle with feeling stuck sometimes. I still dream of just vanishing into the woods on my bike when the pressures of owning a business and the horrors of the world feel inescapable. Leaving all that behind to learn about some new niche subculture, to see people thriving in a unique world they've made and to get to share it with them, was the perfect antidote for these times, and even worth living my dream via car instead of ridiculous bike journey.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/uma-musume-gacha-horse-racing-anime"><h3>Pretty Girl Horse Racing Game ‘Uma Musume’ Is Engrossing And Weird As Hell</h3></a><p>Breed horse girls to create even better horse girls, so that they can achieve their dream of winning races and performing a concert literally right after</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-disability-pride-last-of-us-forza"><h3>Why Disability Journalism In Games Needs To Evolve Beyond Marketing</h3></a><p>"We’ve conditioned ourselves to believe that we’re all one big happy family"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/outlier-best-mens-pants-indestructible-pants"><h3>All My Pants Are From Outlier Because They Appear To Live Forever</h3></a><p>Outlier makes pants that will survive the abuse of several presidential administrations.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/plushie-lawsuit-emotional-support-chicken-nuggets-what-do-you-meme"><h3>Plushie Maker Suing Over ‘Emotional Support Chicken Nuggets’</h3></a><p>It’s a pretty standard copyright and trademark infringement case, despite being about stuffed chicken nuggets.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/high-wheel-bike-race-frederick]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/krafton-confirms-leaked-subnautica-2-development-documents-are-real-as-a-way-of-%E2%80%9Cminimizing-speculation%E2%80%9D.1243062/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you were making a list of predictions for the video game industry in 2025 back in January, it's doubtful that you would have included a very public and messy battle between developer Unknown Worlds and its parent company, KRAFTON, over the development of Subnautica 2 on that list. </p>



<p>But that's exactly where we are today, as the whole situation has kept getting messier and even more public, with KRAFTON confirming that leaked documents showing the development progress of Subnautica 2 are in fact real. It is confirming the legitimacy of the documents as a measure of "<em>minimizing speculation</em>," it said in a statement to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-latest-subnautica-2-twist-krafton-confirms-this-leaked-internal-review-document-is-real">Eurogamer</a> and other outlets. That said, establishing the legitimacy of these documents accomplishes more than 'minimizing speculation.'</p>



<p>To recap, two years ago, and just a couple of years into <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-studio-unknown-worlds-entertainment-acquired-by-krafton-inc/">Unknown Worlds being a KRAFTON subsidiary</a>, everything looked fine from the outside. According to KRAFTON in November 2023, we were going to have a new Subnautica game to play by <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-is-getting-a-new-game-by-june-2025-says-publisher/">June 2025</a>. When Subnautica 2 was properly revealed in <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-launches-next-year-in-early-access-on-pc-and-xbox-will-also-be-on-game-pass/">October 2024</a>, everything seemed on track with the November 2023 prediction.</p>



<p>June 2025 came and went, without Subnautica 2 launching into early access as planned. Everything almost immediately became very messy and very public. </p>



<ul>
<li>On July 2, 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/">KRAFTON fired the three co-founders of Unknown Worlds</a>, Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill, and Max McGuire, replacing them with former <a href="https://wccftech.com/callisto-protocol-devs-next-game-project-titan-cancelled/">Striking Distance Studios</a> head, Steve Papoutsis. <p>KRAFTON offered no explanation for Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire's departure at the time, only <a href="https://krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/">saying</a> that while it "<em>sought to keep the Unknown Worlds' co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in</em> <em>the game's development, the company wishes them well on their next endeavors</em>." KRAFTON quickly switched to how confident it was in Papoutsis, and added, "<em>There is nothing more important than the gamer experience."</em></p></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>The next day on July 3, <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter">Unknown Worlds did its best to reassure concerned fans</a> that Subnautica 2 was still in good hands, and that there was no reason for alarm at the departure of Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire. <br></li>



<li>On July 4, Cleveland <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">published a lengthy statement on social media</a> in which he called his and his co-founders' departure "<em>quite a shock</em>," and claimed that Subnautica 2 was "<em>ready for early access release</em>."<br></li>



<li>Five days later, on July 9, <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">Bloomberg published a report</a> that claimed Subnautica 2 had been delayed into 2026, which would jeopardize Unknown Worlds' chances of earning a $250 million bonus the studio was promised when KRAFTON acquired Unknown Worlds in 2021, if the team hit certain revenue targets by the end of 2025. <p>To the external viewer, it was easy to speculate that KRAFTON was delaying Subnautica 2 to avoid paying the substantial bonus. Not only had one of the game's lead developers claimed it was ready to launch, but Bloomberg's report also included internal comments from Papoutsis, who allegedly said KRAFTON's reason for the delay was a lack of content, a fairly subjective measure to base the readiness of an early access launch on. Sources Bloomberg spoke to also alleged that hitting the revenue goals required to unlock the bonus were "<em>unattainable</em>" without a 2025 launch for Subnautica 2.</p></li>



<li>Hours after Bloomberg's report, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/">the delay was confirmed by Unknown Worlds</a>, which published a statement saying the decision to delay the game was based on feedback it had received during internal playtests. KRAFTON also added that delaying the game "<em>was not influenced by any contractual or financial considerations."</em><br></li>



<li>The next day, on July 10, <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/">KRAFTON pointed its finger directly at the three co-founders</a>, Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire, blaming them for Subnautica 2's delay, alleging that they had "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles and responsibilities. KRAFTON claimed the three leaders "<em>refused</em>" to do their jobs, and even claimed that Cleveland was prioritizing a personal film project over his day job working at Unknown Worlds. KRAFTON also claimed that the three co-founders were due to get 90% of the aforementioned $250 million bonus, with the remaining 10% divided amongst a portion of the 100 developers working at Unknown Worlds.<br></li>



<li>Later that same day, Cleveland confirmed what seemed inevitable at this point, that he and his fellow co-founders <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lwsxco/lawsuit_a_community_update_from_charlie/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">had filed a lawsuit against KRAFTON</a>. Cleveland also denied any insinuation that he and his co-founders would have kept the $250 million bonus to themselves, saying that the bonus would have been shared with the whole studio, and added that they did the same thing in 2021, sharing the earnings from KRAFTON's purchase of Unknown Worlds with the development team. Jason Schreier, who authored the original Bloomberg report, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3ltpa5br36k2o">added that the suit was for a "<em>breach of contract</em>."</a><br></li>



<li>The next day, on July 11, documents claiming to be part of an internal presentation documenting <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-leaked-document-shows-krafton-delay/">Subnautica 2's development leaked online</a>. The documents showed that, in KRAFTON's eyes, Subnautica 2 was below the "<em>level of polish and market impact required to drive IP growth and expansion.</em>" It also showed that content initially planned for the early access launch had been removed, and overall, dubbed the game as not ready for launch, even in early access. "<em>Due to a gap between the current state and the content volume assumed during the initial planning, it is necessary to reassess the release timeline and roadmap</em>," reads a bolded section on one of the leaked pages.</li>
</ul>



<p>Which brings us to today, July 14, where over the weekend on July 13, KRAFTON confirmed that the leaked documents are in fact real. "<em>KRAFTON is issuing the following statement in response to growing speculation surrounding the development of Subnautica 2,</em>" the company began. "<em>This statement aims to offer clarity and context regarding the current situation</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>The document that has been circulating on social media and reported by various outlets is indeed part of an internal milestone review conducted as part of the Subnautica 2 project. KRAFTON has confirmed that portions of it have been leaked and are now being widely shared across online platforms and within the fan community. KRAFTON recognizes the confusion this has caused. Given these circumstances, KRAFTON has determined that transparent communication is necessary and has chosen to confirm the authenticity of the document. KRAFTON believes that minimizing speculation and ensuring accurate communication with players must take precedence</em>." </p>



<p>"<em>Milestone reviews are conducted regularly in collaboration with KRAFTON's creative studios across all projects. These reviews help assess development progress, define clear objectives, and ensure that each project aligns with KRAFTON's standards in both creativity and quality. This process is central to KRAFTON's commitment to delivering polished, high-quality games at the right time.</em>" KRAFTON ended its statement saying it will "<em>continue working closely with Unknown Worlds to ensure that Subnautica 2 meets the expectations of players who have supported the franchise over the years</em>."</p>



<p>In all of KRAFTON's public comments on this issue, the company has tried to claim that it is centering the player in all of this, and that its goal is always to ensure players are getting the absolute best experience possible, and that KRAFTON is being as transparent as possible with players. </p>



<p>Confirming the legitimacy of these leaked documents backs up what KRAFTON has been saying all along, that Subnautica 2 was not ready to be out this year and that it needed more time. It also potentially helps KRAFTON in both the court of public opinion and the coming lawsuit it faces against Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire. </p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether it can prove the three co-founders "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles, and that the game really wasn't ready to launch, and if players will believe that a massive corporation like KRAFTON is as concerned as it says it is with clear communication with players in all of this. It'll also be interesting to see what Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire's lawsuit is referring to regarding KRAFTON allegedly breaching the contract it had with the three co-founders. So far, at the time of this writing, there has been no word from Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire since KRAFTON confirmed the leaked documents to be authentic.</p>



<p>Needless to say, this story is far from over. We'll continue to update you as more details become public.</p>
