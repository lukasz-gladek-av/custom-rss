		<p>RoboCop: Rogue City – Unfinished Business will lay down the law when this standalone expansion launches for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on 17th July,</p>
<p><iframe title="RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business | Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ykC7btuV6Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>OCP’s plan to create a centralised control centre for all their law delivering robots has been thrown into disarray when&nbsp;Omni Tower has been overrun by mercenaries. RoboCop will have to fight his way up the tower, taking on a menagerie of classic goons, fan-favourite bots and flying drones and mercenaries along the way.</p>
<p>Thankfully there’s some new weapons and more brutal finishers to help mix things up as you make your way up the tower, as well as some new allies to work alongside. Inevitably, RoboCop will take one heck of a beating as he goes up floor-by-floor.</p>
<p>But there’s also special missions that will take players into flashback sequences to a time before RoboCop, giving the chance to play as Alex Murphy for the first time and reveal some about the game’s antagonist. It will be interesting to see how different that is compared to the rather stompy FPS action of the main game.</p>

<p>RoboCop: Rogue City is Teyon’s latest FPS based on an 80’s film franchise. Set between the second and third films, RoboCop methodically stomps around town on the trail of a new drug gang and peel back a new mystery while blasting everything in sight into smithereens. The game has passed a significant milestone with Nacon proudly touting over 1 million players since launch.</p>
<p>It’s also a game that’s divided opinion a little amongst our writers. A few of us have had a great time with it, getting exactly what they want out of a RoboCop game – one-note bipedal cop-bot action – while others were a little less enthused.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/31/robocop-rogue-city-review/">Ade handled our RoboCop review</a>, and sadly did not have the best of times, awarding it a 4/10 for some technical flaws, as well as a monotonous plodding pace to story and combat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-oblivion-remastered-this-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>GeForce NOW users who love roleplaying games have plenty to do this week with the launches of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-launches-on-april-24th-on-pc-and-consoles-new-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. The games may differ heavily when it comes to RPG design (the former is a classic Western open world action RPG with real-time combat, whereas Clair Obscur is a linear JRPG-inspired turn-based game with some innovative real-time elements). Still, they have a few things in common: they're both powered by Unreal Engine 5, available on Game Pass, and can now be played on NVIDIA's cloud platform if you don't have the required PC hardware.</p>
<p>Both games&nbsp;<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/tempest-rising-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-more-add-support-for-nvidia-dlss-super-resolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support</a></span><a href="https://wccftech.com/tempest-rising-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-more-add-support-for-nvidia-dlss-super-resolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution upscaling</a>, which can be enabled by any GeForce NOW user with a Priority or Ultimate subscription. Oblivion Remastered takes it one step further with DLSS Frame Generation and hardware-accelerated Lumen ray-traced global illumination, both of which can be activated by GFN players with an Ultimate subscription.</p>
<p>We've covered Oblivion Remastered a lot in the past few days, but Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is also exciting. Critics have raved about it in their reviews, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">averaging over 90 in the Metacritic scores</a> across all platforms. You'll have to wait a bit longer to read our review, as Wccftech was not provided with an advance code and has only been able to access the game today with everyone else.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here's the full list of weekly GeForce NOW additions:</p>
<p><em>● The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game</em><br>
<em>Pass, April 22)</em><br>
<em>● Sunderfolk (New release on Steam, April 23)</em><br>
<em>● Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, April</em><br>
<em>24)</em><br>
<em>● Ace Attorney Investigations Collection (Steam and Xbox, available on the Microsoft Store)</em><br>
<em>● Ace Attorney Investigations Collection Demo (Steam and Xbox, available on the Microsoft Store)</em><br>
<em>● Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Demo (Steam)</em><br>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/until-dawn-dev-supermassive-reportedly-cancels-blade-runner-game.1172490/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supermassive-blade-runner-game-canceled-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Quarry&nbsp;</em>developer Supermassive Games has reportedly canceled an in-development&nbsp;<em>Blade Runner&nbsp;</em>game that was set to release some time in 2027.</p>

<p>That's according to an Insider Gaming report, which cites anonymous sources that supposedly worked on the project. According to Insider's report,&nbsp;<em>Blade Runner: Time to Live&nbsp;</em>was a "character-focused, cinematic action-adventure" game that would have run around 10-12 hours.</p>

<p>The game would have featured the four key pillars of "stealth, combat, exploration, and investigation", which would have set it apart from Supermassive's usual fare; the developer is mostly known for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/quarry" rel="nofollow">movie-style adventure games</a> that <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-pictures-anthology-little-hope" rel="nofollow">don't usually feature much</a> in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-pictures-anthology-man-of-medan" rel="nofollow">way of gameplay</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blade-runner-enhanced-edition-supermassive-games-canceled-project-rumor.jpg?itok=yly1jTn2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blade-runner-enhanced-edition-supermassive-games-canceled-project-rumor.jpg?itok=Bwf_bVCX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Quarry&nbsp;</em>developer Supermassive Games has reportedly canceled a&nbsp;<em>Blade Runner&nbsp;</em>game.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Insider Games, you'd have access to various skills and abilities that you could upgrade in&nbsp;<em>Blade Runner: Time to Live</em>, and you'd also be able to use "past memories to figure out the story", as well as using "in-game technology to complete your investigations".</p>

<p>It sounds like the game would have been a pretty ambitious one, and it sounds pretty far out of Supermassive's usual wheelhouse as well; it puts me in mind of The Chinese Room's work on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025" rel="nofollow">the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em></a>.</p>

<p>Supposedly,&nbsp;<em>Blade Runner: Time to Live&nbsp;</em>would have arrived in 2027 across PC and current-gen machines, as well as the next generation of PlayStation and Xbox consoles (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/full-next-gen-xbox-reportedly-set-for-2027-xbox-branded-gaming-handheld-due-out-later-in-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">assuming there is one</a> where Xbox is concerned, of course).</p>

<p>Insider's report says that the project would have cost around $45 million before music, testing, and other expenses, and that&nbsp;<em>Blade Runner&nbsp;</em>rights holder Alcon Entertainment is the reason the game was canceled, although the report doesn't go into specifics "to protect the sources of the information".</p>

<p>Supermassive is also the developer on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-3-delayed" rel="nofollow">Bandai Namco's&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares 3</em></a>, which will be the first game in the series not to be developed by original studio Tarsier.</p>

            <p>Supermassive Games - known for releases such as Until Dawn and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-quarry">The Quarry</a> - has reportedly cancelled an unannounced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> game.</p>
<p>The project was titled Blade Runner: Time To Live, and according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPUISqX5T6E">Insider Gaming</a>, it was going to be a "character focused, cinematic, action adventure" release, poised to be launched across PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, as well as on next generation Xbox and PlayStation systems. Reportedly, it was a single-player game, slated for a 2027 debut.</p>

<p>The report claims the player would be the only Blade Runner in 2065, and the game's campaign would feature a 10-12 hour "compelling" story, which would blend "the philosophical themes of Blade Runner with kinetic action-adventure gameplay".</p>
<p>This story would see players taking on the role of So-Lange, the report states. So-Lange is a vintage model Nexus-6 "inexplicably still alive well beyond your limited lifespan".</p>
<p>Documentation seen by Insider Gaming reads: "Journey from the teeming undercity of New Zurich 2065 to the eerie remnants of the forgotten world beyond... Under orders to retire Rev, the mysterious and ruthless leader of an underground replicant network, you are betrayed and left for dead in a brutally hostile environment."</p>
<p>Blade Runner: Time to Live was said to have entered pre-production in September 2024, with pre-production then expected to wrap up in March 2025. The end of prototyping, meanwhile, was set for this September.</p>
<p>On the cost side of things, Blade Runner: Time to Live's development budget was reported to be in the region of $45m, with $9m of this expected to cover external performance capture and acting talent.</p>
<p>The game was ultimately cancelled, reportedly towards the end of last year. As to why, that's allegedly due to Alcon Entertainment, who is the owner of the Blade Runner rights, although no further details were provided at this time.</p>
<p>While we may never know what could have been, according to one source, Blade Runner: Time to Live was "rather impressive".</p>
<p>Next up from Supermassive Games will be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/directive-8020-is-a-notable-upgrade-to-the-dark-pictures-anthologys-formula">long-awaited next Dark Pictures Anthology game, Directive 8020</a>. This one's set in space, features Bond and Marvel star Lashana Lynch, and has been in development for some time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The NvRTX branch of the impressive Unreal Engine 5 Zorah tech demo sports some advanced features that even the most powerful GPU on the market cannot handle at native 4K resolution properly.</p>
<p>As shown in a new test video shared by Compusemble, advanced features like Mega Geometry, ReSTiR Global Illumination and Path Tracing and more can tank performance at native 4K resolution even on an<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/"> RTX 5090 GPU,</a> the most powerful GPU currently available on the market. In some scenarios, the demo runs at a whopping 13 FPS, proving how gaming hardware still isn't ready for some of the advanced RTX features NVIDIA has been working on. Things get slightly better with NVIDIA DLSS, and it's only in Performance mode that the RTX 5090 can run the demo at above 30 FPS in the same scenario that tanked performance at native 4K resolution.</p>
<p><iframe title="Zorah Demo: NvRTX Branch vs Stock UE5 - NvRTX Can Run As Low As 13FPS on 5090 Depending on the Scene" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zdbjsO8k8mM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Even though the Unreal Engine 5 Zorah demo cannot be run at acceptable performance at native 4K resolution, there's no denying that some of the technology is impressive. Among the new features that have yet to be implemented in games is RTX Neural Rendering, which can quickly create a neural representation of thousands of textures to save VRAM and RAM much more than the currently used compression tech. More information on Neural Rendering can be found on NVIDIA's <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/get-started-with-neural-rendering-using-nvidia-rtx-kit/">official website.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-1886-announced-2027<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher 11 bit studios has announced&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886</em>, a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>in Unreal Engine 5 (and, despite what the title suggests, nothing to do with&nbsp;<em>The Order: 1886</em>).</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3645160/view/545607485799530656" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, 11 bit says the aim with&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>is to "recreate the experience of the original game in [Unreal Engine 5]", and that the project is part of an effort to "further expand upon&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>" away from the original game's now-defunct Liquid Engine.</p>

<p>This is almost certainly the new&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>game to which 11 bit referred in its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-frostpunk-game-2027-11-bit-studios" rel="nofollow">most recent financial summary</a>; the studio already confirmed a 2027 release for that project, so unless there's another one in the works for the same year, it's most probably&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-1886-remake-original-game-city-view.jpg?itok=R2Vt-VH2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-1886-remake-original-game-city-view.jpg?itok=jiUQUZya 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>aims to reimagine the original (pictured here) with new visuals and gameplay mechanics.</figcaption></figure><p>According to 11 bit,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>will feature "improved visuals, higher resolution, and all the other possibilities Unreal has to offer", serving as a "great introduction to the world of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>" but also the perfect game for "die-hard fans".</p>

<p>However, the project won't just be a rebuilt version of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>. Instead, it'll feature "tons of new content, new mechanics, new events, technologies, and buildings", as well as a totally new path, Purpose, to go alongside Faith and Order.</p>

<p>In addition,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>will support expansion via DLC in future, as well as official modding support, which is something that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-modding-tool-at-launch" rel="nofollow">available for the second</a>&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>but not for the first due to engine limitations.</p>

<p>You can check out the very brief teaser trailer for&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>below. It doesn't give very much away, and it's really more of a mood piece than a full trailer, but hey, it might help you to get excited for the game.</p>




<p><em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>is due to land on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3645160/Frostpunk_1886/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> sometime in 2027. No console release has been announced yet.</p>

While hundreds of thousands of hopeful gamers will likely be refreshing the websites of <a href="https://buff.ly/340n4Ou">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://buff.ly/BCrRzOM">Target</a>, and <a href="https://buff.ly/dfdT51Z">Walmart</a>, hoping to be lucky enough to successfully push an order through and secure their piece of the first Switch 2 wave, Nintendo also <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0c942683-aa0d-42df-b11a-12e2b25a91dd" href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/heres-how-to-pre-order-a-nintendo-switch-2">asked interested players to register their My Nintendo accounts</a> as interested in pre-ordering the upcoming system to enter into a lottery. However, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa took to Nintendo's Japanese social media accounts to share some bad news regarding the lottery system.</p>

<p>According to a post shared on Nintendo's Japanese X account, Nintendo received 2.2 million interested players in Japan alone. If that number is truly representative of the number of players who want to purchase a Switch 2 in Japan, it would far exceed the initial Japanese sales numbers of the Switch 1, which, according to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/nintendo-sells-313700-switch-consoles-in-japan-over-launch-weekend/"><em>VentureBeat,</em></a> reached just over 313,000 units in its first weekend. In the console's first month, Nintendo sold 2.74 million units worldwide, meaning that the 2.2 million Japanese registrations nearly reaches that number on its own.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jqQG2xco8eI" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>According to Furukawa, Nintendo cannot fulfill all of those requests at launch. However, if you register through the My Nintendo Store and are not selected to purchase during the first wave, you will have another chance once the company can replenish its supply.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can see the full translation of Furukawa's post from X below.</p>

<div>
<p>Hello, this is Furukawa. We have been procuring many materials and proceeding with production in advance so that we can deliver the Nintendo Switch 2 to you. On April 2nd, we announced details about the Nintendo Switch 2 and started accepting applications for the lottery sale on the My Nintendo Store. As a result, we received an extremely large number of applications, approximately 2.2 million people in Japan alone. However, this number far exceeds our expectations, and far exceeds the number of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles that can be delivered from the My Nintendo Store on June 5th. Therefore, unfortunately, we expect that a significant number of customers will not be selected when the winners are announced tomorrow, April 24th.</p>

<p>In order to avoid the trouble of those who were not selected in the first lottery sale having to reapply, My Nintendo Store will automatically carry over those who were not selected in the first lottery sale to the second lottery sale. However, even including the quantity for the second lottery sale, we cannot fulfill all of the applications we received. We deeply apologize for not being able to meet your expectations despite our prior preparations.</p>

<p>In response to this demand, we are currently working on further strengthening our production system. In addition, starting tomorrow, April 24th, game retailers and online stores nationwide will begin accepting pre-orders or lottery sales for the Nintendo Switch 2 console (please check the information of each retailer for details). The console will also continue to be sold at the My Nintendo Store after the release date (more details will be announced at a later date). With the cooperation of retailers, we will continue to ship the console and make efforts to get as many Nintendo Switch 2 consoles as possible into your hands.</p>

<p>We plan to continue producing and shipping a considerable number of Nintendo Switch 2 units in the future. We apologize for the delay in our ability to meet your expectations, and we appreciate your understanding.</p>
</div>

<p>Though Furukawa alludes to it, he doesn't directly say that Nintendo will be unable to fulfill demand through its retail partners. Still, with the company seeing such increased demand in its home country, players worldwide will likely encounter fierce competition and, more than likely, frustration while trying to get their hands on a launch model Switch 2. Nintendo Switch 2 arrives on June 5. For more on the console, you can read our hands-on impressions <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2bca940b-8846-4536-bd3c-87ddd37f9549" href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/03/hands-on-with-nintendos-next-console">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/23/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-set-for-october-collectors-edition-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The follow-up to 2020's <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima/ghost-of-tsushima-review-a-most-honorable-epic">acclaimed Ghost of Tsushima</a>, Ghost of&nbsp;Yōtei has garnered a lot of excitement following its announcement during a PlayStation State of Play livestream last September. The open-world adventure places players in the boots of a new samurai named Atsu 300 years after the events of Ghost of Tsushima. However, developer Sucker Punch Productions largely went quiet following the surprise reveal last year. That changed today, as the studio revealed additional details about Ghost of&nbsp;Yōtei, including the release date.</p>

<p>Players who have been waiting a half-decade to continue exploring Sucker Punch's stunning recreation of feudal Japan can now circle October 2 on their calendars. The game is available in the standard edition for $70, but if you're excited enough to want some bonuses, Sony is also offering a Digital Deluxe Edition as well as a physical Collector's Edition. The Digital Deluxe Edition costs $80 and includes in-game Snake Armor, exclusive armor dye and horse with saddle, a charm, an early unlock of the Traveller's Map, and a sword kit. Meanwhile, the Collector's Edition costs $250 and offers all the Digital Deluxe content (including a digital copy of the game), plus physical items like a sash, a tsuba, art cards, a papercraft ginkgo tree, and a zeni hajiki coin game with pouch.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>The final inclusion of today's Ghost of&nbsp;Yōtei announcements is a trailer called "The Onryō's List." The story goes that 16 years prior to the events of the game, a gang called The&nbsp;Yōtei Six killed her family and pinned her to a burning ginkgo tree, leaving her for dead. She somehow survived the ordeal and what appeared to be a death sentence from the gang of outlaws and she harnessed that strength and motivation to learn how to fight, kill, and hunt. In Ghost of&nbsp;Yōtei, Atsu returns home with a list of the six names of those in The&nbsp;Yōtei Six, with eyes toward vengeance.</p>

<p>Using the same katana that pinned her to the tree, Atsu embarks on a mission to avenge her family. The story plays out in Ezo, which is known as Hokkaido today. New gameplay mechanics will allow the player to understand Atsu's past to fully come to know how much was truly stolen from her by The&nbsp;Yōtei Six. Sucker Punch claims it has built upon and evolved the way players can explore the massive open world, with more freedom and variety on offer than in Ghost of Tsushima. Atsu can choose which member of The&nbsp;Yōtei Six she wants to pursue first, while also claiming bounties, learning new skills, and exploring the natural beauty of northern Japan.</p>

<p>You can see the new trailer released by Sucker Punch Productions below.</p>

<p>Ghost of&nbsp;Yōtei arrives exclusively on PlayStation 5 on October 2. If you're hungry for more information surrounding the highly anticipated follow-up, Sucker Punch promises to show more in the approach to that date.</p>

			<p>F1 25 is just around the corner – OK, maybe it’s a chicane or chicken – with the latest entry in Codemasters’ long-running motorsport series set to arrive on the 30th of May for PS5, XSX|S and PC. While there are improvements over last year’s entry across the board, from extensive visual updates through to new systems and features that aim to bring the digital version of the sport closer than ever to the real thing, today’s focus is on the returning Braking Point, the F1 series’ central narrative mode, that drops you into the endless drama surrounding the fictional Konnersport team.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 25 Braking Point 3 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D52QfcK9qJc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A dramatic event sees the Konnersport team thrown into chaos this time around, and given the real-world drama that surrounds F1, they’ve got plenty to draw from, whether its the loss of sponsorship, drivers moving to another team, rookies nope-ing out of contracts on social media, or some wide-reaching breach of the extensive rules and regulations. Either way, things aren’t looking good at Konnersport, and you’re stepping in here to steady the ship.</p>


<p>New to this year’s entry is branching or alternative storylines, and you can decide which of the Konnersport drivers you’re going to take control of, leading to bespoke objectives for that driver, and a unique storyline conclusion. Whether that means there’s a minimum of two endings, or even more, we’re excited to find out, but it’s great to see Codemasters heaping new content into a mode that’s well-liked, but previously hasn’t had the same mileage as the others. It looks as though you’ll want to play through it multiple times to see all of the possibilities, and that’s a great option for those who tire of the long seasons or the high adrenaline and inevitable crashes of competitive online racing.</p>
<p>That’s not where the story ends though, as once you’ve finished with Braking Point you can take your driver into Driver Career or take the position as their Team Principal in My Team, making them the 11th team on the grid. I especially like this, giving the whole storyline some serious longevity and impact, and there’s also some mirroring of Brad Pitt’s forthcoming F1 movie or upcoming Cadillac team, where they will take this 11th spot.</p>


<p>While the on-screen action is at the heart of Braking Point, the team has made some welcome changes to various technical aspects of the mode, including the appearance of an all-new Hard mode to ramp up the challenge, and updating and revising the facial capture for the drivers using Nvidia’s Audio-to-Face technology through the returning interview sequences, making sure that the drama and high-tension moments look better than ever before. It’ll also benefit from all of the other improvements across the board, making it feel as though this is an essential part of the F1 25 experience.</p>
<p>2025 looks to be an amazing year for F1 storylines, and F1 25 hopes to put itself at the centre of that with Braking Point. We can’t wait to finally get our hands on it in the near future.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-stability-performance-improvements-mods/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remastered-new-mods-introduce-stability-and-performance-improvements.1172415/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-stability-performance-improvements-mods/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A couple of Oblivion Remastered mods shared online a few hours ago introduce stability and performance improvements to the game, allowing those with more dated systems to run the game with fewer technical issues.</p>
<p>The No More VRAM Leaks Crashes mod, which was released today by SmokerNaruto on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/399?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, is a modified Unreal Engine 5 configuration file that caps texture streaming to the user's GPU VRAM and disables ray tracing and Lumen to prevent crashes on GPUs with lower VRAM capacity, like 4 and 6 GB. However, improvements for 8 GB VRAM GPUs are also expected, so this mod is definitely worth a try for those who are having trouble running the game properly.</p>
<p>Much like stability, performance in Oblivion Remastered is not particularly solid on anything&nbsp;<span>other than a top-end machine. As such, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/280?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LEGEND FPS patch</a> by NBCoo is another mod that is more than worth a try. It</span> introduces some tweaks that can improve performance without significantly impacting the visuals, such as turning off motion blur, bloom, film grain, and even improving water. Some users, however, have experienced slightly worse performance with this mod, so the experience may vary depending on the system configuration.</p>
<p>After months of rumors and speculation, the Oblivion Remastered was finally confirmed to be real this week with a highly anticipated reveal, which came shortly before the game<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/"> launched</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Developed by Virtuos, the game uses Unreal Engine 5's latest version to deliver improved visuals while keeping the Gamebryo engine for its underlying logic to offer gameplay mostly in line with the original, complete with some choice improvements such as revamped UI and more.</p>

			<p>Today, Polish developer 11 bit studios announced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3645160/Frostpunk_1886/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frostpunk 1886</a>, a reimagining of the original Frostpunk game powered by Unreal Engine 5 technology. The game is currently slated to launch at some point in 2027.</p>
<p>11 bit studios plan to provide a much improved visual experience, but they won't stop there. Fans can expect a lot of new content, mechanics, events, technologies, and buildings. There will even be an entirely new Purpose path in addition to the existing Faith and Order paths. Additionally, the switch from the original game's proprietary Liquid Engine to Epic's Unreal Engine 5 will also bring mod support, a feature that franchise fans have requested for years, to Frostpunk 1886.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the studio also expressed a desire to continue making content for both <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/frostpunk-2-day-after-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frostpunk 2</a> and this reimagining of the original, keeping both updated for a long time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Frostpunk 1886 | New Game Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9fw6_MvSss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The studio didn't share any further specifics, but there'll be time for that, given that we will have to wait for a couple of years. Meanwhile, you can refer to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/frostpunk-chilling-good-stuff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our original Frostpunk review</a> (scored 8.5/10 back then):</p>
<p><em>Frostpunk is unforgiving and punishing but that’s why you’ll invest more and more time into it. It takes what you know about city builders and turns it on heads. It’s bleak, and the beautiful design brings life to an otherwise frozen hellscape. The race against the clock is stressful as you try to make sure everyone is alive while the weather gets colder and colder and materials become more and more scarce. Frostpunk is a pleasant surprise that is definitely worth your time if you’re looking for something different and brutally challenging.</em></p>
<p><em>Frostpunk is a challenging city builder where your decisions have dramatic repercussions on the citizens you’re tasked with looking after in a wintery apocalypse. It's a pleasant surprise that is definitely worth your time if you’re looking for something different and brutally challenging.</em></p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a> is introducing its first paid battle pass, after previously experimenting with a free version of the feature.
</p>
<p>
Timed ahead of the game's Team of the Season (TOTS) event, EA will roll out a premium version of the Season 7 pass priced at 500k in-game UT Coins, or which you can buy for 1000 FC Points (around £9).
</p>
<p>
Access to this 40-tier pass begins today, 24th April, and will reward tradeable packs, Season Point boosters, TOTS items, evolution consumables and retro cosmetic evolutions. Its centrepiece is an exclusive 96-rated Immortal Icon Franck Ribery, the former French winger who spent most of his career at Bayern Munich. 
</p>
<p>
Announcing the Premium Pass, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-25/news/pitch-notes-fc25-premium-pass">EA said</a> that while this iteration of the battle pass wouldn't change, it would be  "monitoring your feedback to make sure we deliver the best experience possible in whatever mode you play in FC moving forward".
</p>
<p>
Anyone with feedback is invited to provide it via the EA Sports Discord, or EA's own direct feedback portal. 
</p>
<p>
On social media, however, the opinions are somewhat mixed. While some players have pointed to the items within the pass making up for its costs - and Ribery alone being worth the coins - others have said that Ultimate Team is already a money-sucking experience, without another additional thing to buy.
</p>
<p>
"Having Players EXCLUSIVE to the Paid Season pass is extremely greedy and is not the path to go down," <a href="https://x.com/Wildcatz442/status/1915300812835737605">wrote social media user Wildcat</a>. "If its packs/cosmetics/SP/kits im sure 99 percent of the community won't mind. But locking a card like that ribery behind a paywall??? Even if its only 500k coins its just greedy as hell."
</p>
<p>
"Don't get the outrage," <a href="https://x.com/NCFC_CJW/status/1915325530091487610">wrote Norwich City supporter Callum</a>, however. "I ain't sticking up for EA but if that Ribery was an SBC everyone would be happy spending 500k on it 😂 Let alone the other rewards (you even get coins back from tradable packs)."
</p>
<p>
EA Sports recently said that its upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-says-switch-2-versions-of-fc-and-madden-nfl-to-have-feature-parity-with-consoles-as-much-as-the-hardware-allows">Switch 2 versions of FC and Madden NFL would aim to have feature parity</a> with other consoles "as much as the hardware allows".
</p>
<p>
"This is a new FC, with some genuine differences on- and off-pitch," our Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-25-review">Eurogamer's EA Sports FC 25 review</a>. "It's also the exact same FC it's always been."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We now know how much those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-will-have-paid-upgrades-for-certain-switch-games-bringing-enhanced-frame-rates-and-more">previously announced Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrades for games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> will cost. However, I am afraid it is not going to be a 'one size fits all' deal.</p>
<p>As shown on Nintendo's official store, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787250.html">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> will cost £66.99 on its release, but those who already own the game on the original Switch can upgrade their copy for £7.99. This is the same for its sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Tears-of-the-Kingdom-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787249.html">Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>However, while <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Kirby-and-the-Forgotten-Land-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Star-Crossed-World-2787773.html">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a> also retails for £66.99 via Nintendo, its upgrade back is £16.99. So, £9 more than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>'s upgrade pack.</p>

<p>This is the same pricing as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Super-Mario-Party-Jamboree-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Jamboree-TV-2785806.html">Super Mario Party Jamboree – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition ＋ Jamboree TV</a>. As with Kirby, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> edition of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> retails for £66.99, with an upgrade pack available for owners of the original game coming in at £16.99.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that while the Zelda games do both have new features arriving with their Switch 2 editions, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/achievements-can-be-earned-in-switch-2-editions-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom">such as Zelda Notes</a>, Kirby does have new content coming, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-closer-look-at-kirby-and-the-forgotten-lands-remixed-switch-2-worlds">takes the form of a remixed campaign known as Star-Crossed World</a>. But then the Zelda upgrades come as part of a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription, while others do not.</p>

			<p>English voice recording for Final Fantasy VII Remake part 3 may have already begun, judging from a recent social media post.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/english-voice-recording-for-final-fantasy-vii-part-3-likely-underway.1172094/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, Cody Christian, who plays Cloud Strife in the Remake trilogy, recently shared an Instagram story with a caption that suggests the voice actor is recording lines for the character. Considering the story was confirmed to have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/">complete</a>d a few months back, it's not unlikely the script has also been finalized, thus allowing the voice recordings to begin.</p>
<p>Very little is known about the third part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, except that its development started before Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launched last year on PlayStation 5. As already mentioned, it was confirmed a few months back that the plot for the game is complete, and the concept powering the final part of the trilogy is crucial. One of the features that will set the upcoming finale apart from its predecessor is the ability to explore the world with the Highwind airship, a feature the development team is fully committed to delivering without compromises. Hopefully, this means that even the regions that already appeared in Rebirth will receive some shakeup to make it interesting to revisit them.</p>
<p>While Final Fantasy VII Remake fans who own a PlayStation 5 had the chance to experience the second entry in the series last year, PC players were given the opportunity to play Final Fantasy VII Rebirth only this year. The wait, however, was worth it, also thanks to modders who are introducing features not available in the vanilla game, such as additional <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mods-new-playable-characters/">playable characters.</a></p>

			<p>Ever since we learned via rumors and leaks that Oblivion was returning, it was unclear whether it would be a remaster or remake. The initial wording found in Bethesda's internal documents <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> during the Microsoft vs. FTC trial mentioned a remaster, but then we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found out</a> that Bethesda had enlisted another developer (Virtuos, the same one that's doing Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater) to port the game to Unreal Engine 5 and make several improvements to areas such as combat, leveling, user interface,</p>
<p>Indeed, after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiling and launch</a> earlier this week, many were surprised at the amount of work that had been done. One of them was original The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Design Director Bruce Nesmith, who became Lead Designer of Skyrim and also worked on Starfield before leaving Bethesda in September 2021 to pursue a career as a book author. <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/original-elder-scrolls-oblivion-designer-was-floored-by-new-release-im-not-sure-remaster-does-it-justice/?callback=in&amp;code=ZTGYZMU0ZTETM2I4NS0ZOGU3LTGXMJETMZIXY2IZOGFINWMX&amp;state=e74208805f8a402a906dbd7c2f353923" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to Videogamer</a>, he said this is closer to 'Oblivion 2.0' than a mere remaster:</p>
<p><em>I spent a lot of years working on that game. A lot of blood, sweat, and tears went into it, along with everybody else on the team. And I intimately knew every single scene that they were showing. And they looked amazing.</em></p>
<p><em>I was assuming this was going to be a texture update. I didn’t really think it was going to be the complete overhaul that they’ve announced it to be… I would not have batted an eye at that. But to completely redo the animations, the animation system, put in the Unreal Engine, change the leveling system, change the user interface. I mean, that’s, you’re touching every part of the game. That’s a staggering amount of remastering. It almost needs its own word, quite frankly. I’m not sure 'remaster' actually does it justice. The closest that could come to categorizing it is Oblivion 2.0.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, the new game is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-seems-to-be-rather-well-suited-to-mods-and-one-of-them-adds-ray-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily moddable</a>. While its graphics run on Unreal Engine 5, the game logic is still powered by the original engine, so several original mods are being ported right now. This could pave the way to many further improvements from the already thriving modding community. There are already 270 mods on Nexus, and it's just the beginning.</p>

The first <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> launched in 2018, so assuming the remake does come out in 2027, it’ll be nearly a decade on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Frostpunk is a city-building survival video game set in an alternate history late 19th century.
