Well, Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino has spoken up to put fan concern to bed.</p>
<p>Yes, <strong>The Sinister Broker Bazario’s Schemes</strong> is still coming this December on Switch 1 and 2, and it''ll be here "around Christmas", the founder of the company <a href="https://x.com/akihirohino/status/2000857953973264733">shared on social media earlier today</a>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, this new free DLC brings the Fantasy Life i's blend of RPG elements, crafting, simulation, and exploration into a roguelike formula. Ginormosia is transforming and you'll be going up against new monsters, discover a new artifact, and find new weapons and mounts, too.</p>
<p>So it's pretty meaty! Something to play after you've over-indulged this holiday season, then. Hino said that the team will "be sharing the latest information from the official channels soon, so stay tuned!" So expect something in the next week or so. Because yes, Christmas <em>is</em> next week.</p>

<p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time's upcoming DLC was announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/fantasy-life-i-free-dlc-will-steal-more-time-in-huge-roguelike-open-world-mode">in June this year</a>, a little under a month after the game's release, with a release window <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-scores-a-free-dlc-update-this-december">following in September</a>.</p>
<p>There have been plenty of other free updates and tweaks since launch too, and with Level-5 riding high after Fantasy Life i and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Inazuma Eleven</a>, we can't help but be extremely excited for the future.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/16/larian-confirms-divinity-will-be-turn-based-use-early-access-and-how-theyre-using-ai/</link>
            <guid>1384942</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke has revealed some key details about the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/divinity-revealed-by-larian-studios-who-probably-watched-the-wicker-man-recently/">freshly announced Divinity</a> and the direction that the studio is heading with their game creation.</p>
<p>In short, Vincke confirmed that Divinity will be a turn-based RPG, building on the successes of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/divinity-original-sin">Divinity: Original Sin</a> games and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/baldurs-gate-3">Baldur’s Gate 3.</a> He also stated that they will bring Divinity first to Early Access, just as they did for BG3, and divulged just how Larian is using generative AI within the creative process, and how that gels with needing humans to actually make games.</p>


<p data-component="paragraph">“It’s a turn-based RPG featuring everything you’ve seen from us in the past, but it’s brought to the next level,” Vincke said in an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">interview with Bloomberg</a> ahead of Divinity’s announcement. He also discussed the split from working on a Baldur’s Gate 4, saying that “Conceptually, all of the ingredients for a really cool game were there except the hearts of the developers,” and that instead of using tabletop system, “Here, we’re making a system that’s made for a video game. It’s much easier to understand.”</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">Vincke said they plan to do an early access release of Divinity, and that, while 2026 is not an expected release for this, the development cycle is hopefully going to be shorter than it was for Baldur’s Gate 3. He’s aiming to release much sooner, as “I think three to four years is much healthier than six years,” Vincke said.</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">Is AI a part of that? Larian has invested pretty heavily in bringing generative AI into how the studio works, but with the company now standing at 530 employees globally, this is still a huge studio. Larian is now larger than Insomniac Games or Naughty Dog, which is honestly quite surprising.</p>

<p data-component="paragraph">Vincke says that there won’t be AI-generated content in Divinity, but the AI tools allows for things like developing concept art, dropping in placeholder text, for internal powerpoint presentations and more quickly exploring ideas. At the end of the day, Vincke states that “everything is human actors; we’re writing everything ourselves”, and that while there was some pushback internally, “I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it.”</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">Even so, the use of generative AI within the game development pipeline could be a bone of contention for the studio’s fans and gamers at large. In the instance of generating concept art, it can be seen as a tool and aid for the artists at the studio, but it could still mean that there’s fewer artists employed by Larian or less work being outsourced, and what images and artwork were the models they’re using trained on?</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">Larian will have to be vary careful to ensure that no AI-generated concept art of placeholders slip through to any public builds of the game, that’s for sure.</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">But if you’re excited for Divinity and want to play something that’s been created before the widespread proliferation of AI in game development? Well, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/15/divinity-original-sin-2-free-upgrade-for-switch-2-ps5-xbox-series-xs-is-out-now/">Divinity: Original Sin 2 just got a free upgrade</a> for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and Switch 2, and it’s on sale for all consoles as well.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-costco-sams-club-membership-gets-a-60-holiday-discount-with-auto-renew-2000653353</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>My New Year’s resolution list for 2026 is almost ready, and spending mindfully, aka not overspending, is at the top. It’s going to be a tough one, since I basically hunt deals for a living. If you’re planning to save on everyday groceries, prescriptions, gas, etc, you might want to consider grabbing a 1-year Sam’s Club membership, which gets you access to all these and more at a discounted rate.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4484/"> A year-long Club membership is usually sold for $50 at StackSocial, but the retailer just took 60% off it, letting you grab it for just $20.</a></p>
<p>The Plus membership (with a bit more perks) is discounted, too. It’s going for $60, down from $110 after a nice 45% off. These are selling fast, and they expire soon. We share how to grab one, plus all the benefits these memberships offer, below.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4484/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Save Big On Groceries, Gas, and Medicines</h2>
<p>Before we get into the specifics of each subscription, here’s a bit about how it’s going to work; completing your purchase on StackSocial gets you an instant promotion code via email, which you can use while signing up for the Sam’s Club membership. The code is non-transferable, and it renews automatically every year until you cancel. The membership offer is only available to new Sam’s Club members in the USA, and is valid at over 597 U.S. Sam’s Club locations. You need to redeem your code on or before December 31, 2025, as it expires after that. This digital membership card can be accessed using the Sam’s Club app on your smartphone or even a desktop. There’s a one-person limit per subscription, but you can purchase an additional membership as a gift for a loved one.</p>
<p>Club members get to enjoy wholesale pricing, member-only gas prices, and instant savings on already-discounted items. Over 600 generic prescriptions start at just $14, plus you can enjoy walk-in vaccinations at Pharmacy locations. The Scan &amp; Go option lets you scan items using the dedicated app as you shop, allowing you to skip long checkout lines at the store. Additionally, picking up pre-packaged items is free! You will also save on travel, entertainment, personalized printing, and automotive services all year-round.</p>



<p>Plus members get free delivery on all eligible orders of $50 or more, early access to deals, and free delivery on eligible prescriptions. They will also earn 2% back on qualifying in-club purchases.</p>
<p>Basically, these memberships pay for themselves in the long run by helping you save a ton on a wide range of items and even experiences. The Club membership is going at a $30 discount, while the Plus option can be yours for $50 less. Occasional shoppers looking to save should grab the former, but if you’re a frequent shopper who regularly uses pharmacy services and wants free shipping, Plus is likely going to be a better option for you. Note that at the time of writing, over 20,000 discounted subscriptions have been sold. It’s a popular pick, but it expires soon. It’s best to snap it up while there’s still some time left.</p>
<p>That said, StackSocial is offering plenty of other subscriptions for less at the moment. Now is also a great time to grab magazine subscriptions, a lifetime Microsoft Office license, and more without paying the full price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-series-season-two-reviews-prime-video-2000653876</link>
            <guid>1384921</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The second season of Amazon Prime’s </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>series debuts later today, but reviews for the post-apocalyptic atom-punk show are pouring in now—and the vibes seem mostly positive, aside from concerns over the story expanding in too many different directions.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Picking up exactly where season one left off (with Ella Purnell’s Lucy and Walton Goggins’ </span><span>Ghoul setting off in pursuit of Lucy’s evil dad), </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span>’s second season takes us to what many players believe is the setting of the best game in the franchise: New Vegas. Goggins’ world-weary and cynical Ghoul and Purnell’s wide-eyed and naive Lucy are a match made in Western heaven, and it seems that their dynamic still feels fresh in this new season—though critics only got to see six out of the eight episodes in season two.</span></p>

 <p><span>Whereas season one spent a lot of time setting the scene and building the audience’s connections to the lead characters (who also include Aaron Moten’s Maximus, a rookie soldier in the Brotherhood of Steel), </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span>’s latest installment focuses on the apocalyptic wastelands’ competing factions and their leaders. Much like in the games, their conflicting ideologies and consistent tensions make the wasteland even trickier to navigate, but it seems the time spent on these various factions dilutes the adventures of the three leads: Lucy, the Ghoul, and Maximus.</span></p>

 <p><span>There appear to be numerous flashbacks to the pre-apocalypse in this season, focusing on Goggins’ pre-Ghoul identity of Cooper Howard, who spies on his wife and her work with the Vault-Tec corporation. According to </span><a href="https://archive.is/20251216141105/https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/844926/fallout-season-2-review-amazon-prime-video#selection-1491.235-1491.340"><span>Andrew Webster at </span><i><span>The Verge</span></i></a><i><span>,</span></i><span> the show ensures that the cause of the nuclear wasteland is abundantly clear: greedy tech execs: “</span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> is never subtle with its social satire and that remains true here. The end of the world is brought about by a group of tech oligarchs who wield too much power, and as one character muses early on, ‘every dollar spent is a vote cast.’ Board meetings show billionaires salivating at the business opportunities that come with the apocalypse.” I wonder what Amazon’s Jeff Bezos thinks about that</span><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-review-episodes-1-6"><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>’s review,</span></a><span> Matt Purlow writes that </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>season two is “structured more akin to </span><i><span>Game of Thrones</span></i><span>,</span><span>” with “multiple other concurrent storylines that make </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> feel like the story of the wasteland itself as much as it is the tale of the key characters.” This results in a “very packed season” with “inevitable casualties,” mostly notably of which are the stories of the vault dwellers, whose silliness Purlow feels is at odds with the rest of the season’s tone.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Here’s what other reviewers had to say about </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> season two, which is currently sitting at a </span><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/fallout/s02"><span>100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes</span></a><span> with just 28 scored reviews in:</span></p> <blockquote><p>I worry that <i>Fallout</i>’s downward spiral will only continue. As <i>Westworld </i>soldiered on, the world got bigger, but the story got more generic. By the time HBO canceled <i>Westworld</i>—on a major unresolved cliffhanger!—it didn’t seem like anyone even cared where it was all headed. <i>Fallout </i>risks going down the same path. The last few episodes of season 2 might correct that course (season 3 is also already greenlit, for what it’s worth) but if not, Nolan may develop an unfortunate reputation for setting up exciting sci-fi TV shows that fail to pan out. – <strong>Jake Kleinman, </strong><strong><i>Polygon&nbsp;</i></strong></p> <p><span>Though all the storylines aren’t as compelling as the others, the series’ structure and pacing keep it moving so the audience doesn’t completely lose interest. For viewers who are well-versed in the </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> game universe, seeing Easter eggs around New Vegas and various factions coming to life on screen for the first time undoubtedly adds a level of interest and delight that may go over the heads of newcomers. – <strong>Aramide Tinubu,</strong></span><strong><i> Vanity Fair</i></strong></p> <p><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> remains a show that glories in high contrast visuals, emotions and characters. There is no shortage of new disgusting ways for the people of this irradiated world to get maimed and die, and no shortage of new mutant creatures for Lucy, Ghoul and Maximus to have to battle, either. Both Parnell and Moten have settled comfortably into their roles, and the latter feels distinctly more natural as buttoned-up Maximus this time around. — <strong>Kelly Lawyer, </strong></span><strong><i>USA Today</i></strong></p> <p><span>Bogged down with world-building, Season 2 feels as if the Amazon Prime Video executives know they’ve got a hit on their hands and can’t help but game out a </span><a href="https://www.indiewire.com/craft-considerations/fallout-walton-goggins-nose-la-production-design-1235004555/"><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> universe</span></a><span> filled with spinoffs and sequels, even though they still need to develop the characters who first got viewers invested in a post-apocalyptic society that’s still controlled by corporate interests. — <strong>Ben Travers, </strong></span><strong><i>Indie Wire</i></strong></p></blockquote> <p><span>The comparisons to </span><i><span>Westworld </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Game of Thrones</span></i><span> certainly have me worried, but I’ll weigh in myself when I can watch </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>season two with my own eyes—you know, the same ones that <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-season-2-finale-episode-flood-3-kai-master-chief-1851356937">actually liked the </a></span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-season-2-finale-episode-flood-3-kai-master-chief-1851356937"><i><span>Halo</span></i></a><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-season-2-finale-episode-flood-3-kai-master-chief-1851356937"> TV series</a> (eesh).&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>season two episodes air every Wednesday on Prime Video, starting today, December 16.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Techland Already Working on ‘New Experience in the Dying Light Franchise’, It Seems]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/techland-new-experience-dying-light-universe/</link>
            <guid>1384918</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Techland released Dying Light: The Beast in September, and it became regarded as one of the gems of the ten-year-old franchise. It reintroduced Kyle Crane to the series, cast players into a gorgeous, dense world, and kick-started more games with something of a cliffhanger ending.</p>



<p>Now, thanks to a new job listing uncovered at the heart of Techland, it seems that the developer is already hard at work on the next Dying Light experience. The team is looking to expand, adding a Lead Online Game Designer to lean into a new ‘online experience in the Dying Light universe.’</p>







<h2 id="h-is-dying-light-3-coming-soon">Is Dying Light 3 Coming Soon?</h2>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast was viewed by Techland as Dying Light 3, even if it didn’t adopt that moniker. The game, which is one of our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-review/">top-rated games of 2025</a>, was incredibly well-received by fans of the zombie-slashing franchise. The closing moments of the game reveal that more is incoming, but there’s no indication of <strong>when </strong>we’ll get another game.</p>



<p>It might not take <strong>that long</strong>, as Techland appears to have entered development on whatever might come next.</p>



<p>Whether that’s a full-fledged game or something of a spin-off, like many thought The Beast was, we just don’t know. From speaking to franchise director, Tymon Smektala, we know that there are stacks of ideas in the pipeline for Dying Light.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/dying-light/new-game-techland-job-post" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a> uncovered a job listing at Techland for a Lead Online Game Designer. Amongst other things, the listing said that the successful candidate will ‘define the framework and structure for a new online experience in the Dying Light franchise’.</p>



<p>Technically, every Dying Light game since the first surfaced in 2015 has been an online game, so there’s nothing new there, but the uttering of that very word, ‘new’, is enough to get fans salivating.</p>



<p>For now, we should stress again that nothing is confirmed until it’s confirmed, and this might be for nothing more than a small spin-off game.</p>

<p>Embark Studios has deployed an ARC Raiders update that effectively changes the face of the game. It’s the Cold Snap update, and it adds a blanket of snow over the game, introduces the Flickering Flames event, and makes several quality-of-life improvements that players are already thankful for.</p>



<p>It also introduces a soft Cred cap that will prevent players from farming Feats to rack up silly amounts of Cred between seasons. This balancing mechanic means they can’t just insta-unlock an entire Raider Deck when it drops at the beginning of a new season.</p>







<h2 id="h-no-more-hoarding-cred-in-arc-raiders">No More Hoarding Cred in ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>The latest bout of changes by Embark Studios in ARC Raiders has been welcomed with open arms. The Cold Snap update addresses some of the most critical issues in ARC Raiders, but it also introduces a wealth of additions, such as a festive-themed event, new map conditions, and more.</p>



<p>On December 26, ARC Raiders will get a new season, and that means an entirely fresh Raider Deck stocked full of exclusive cosmetics and other rewards. However, the majority of the player base has spent the last few weeks grinding Feats and racking up <strong>thousands </strong>of Cred points for their efforts.</p>



<p>This means that when the new Raider Deck drops, they’ll be able to waltz through it, unlocking everything in one sweep.</p>



<p>To combat this, Embark Studios has capped how much Cred you can earn, locking it to 800 maximum. That means that when you hit 800 Cred, you’ll not be able to earn a single coin more until you spend it.</p>



<p>That also means that, ahead of a new season, the maximum Cred you can ‘bank’ will be 800.</p>



<p>The team explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Dev note: We decided to implement a cap so that players won’t be able to fully unlock new Raider Decks by accumulating Cred and added more items to Shani’s store to purchase using Cred. We believe that the Raider Decks offer a rewarding experience to enjoy while players engage with the game, and a large Cred wallet undermines this goal. We will not be removing Cred that has been accumulated before the introduction of the soft cap.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But Embark Studios has been the ultimate nice guy here. When you log into ARC Raiders, you’ll notice that whatever you had before <strong>has not </strong>been reduced to 800 to account for the cap. That will come into effect from the next season, which starts on December 26.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Divinity Will Be Better Than Baldur’s Gate 3 “On All Fronts” Says Larian CEO</p>
      </div>
<p>"It's been the blueprint, especially the community participation with early access, which is what interests us. It was [with] Divinity: Original Sin 1, Divinity: Original Sin 2, Baldur's Gate 3--they [the community members] were a large part of how we developed the games," he said.</p><p>Vincke said these games "improved massively" due in part to them releasing in early access.</p><p>"Players being invested in it increases the pressure and their participation in it, so you get something really cool out of that process--even if it's painful for the developer," he said. So, we have to swallow our pride and say, 'Ok, you guys are right, we're wrong, we accept it, you've made your point.'"</p><p>Putting a game into early access "causes extra development effort, but it leads to a better game," Vincke said, adding that this is the whole point.</p><p>Baldur's Gate 3 has been Larian's biggest success to date, selling more than 20 million copies, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to Bloomberg.</a> That game's first act launched into early access in August 2020, and Larian added more content over the ensuing months and years leading up to the public release for everyone in August 2023.</p><p>As for the new Divinity game, it was announced at The Game Awards with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/man-the-game-awards-trailers-got-really-gross-this-year/1100-6536908/" data-ref-id="1100-6536908">super-gross trailer.</a> The game will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-larian-ceo-swen-vincke/1100-6536981/" data-ref-id="1100-6536981">better than Baldur's Gate 3 "on all fronts," according to Vincke.</a> The developer is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">using generative AI for Divinity</a> to help developers have more time and freedom to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/" data-ref-id="1100-6531123">work on creative concepts instead of boring work that "nobody wants to do."</a> At least one former Larian developer spoke out against Larian's use of generative AI, saying the studio <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/anoxicart.bsky.social/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">should show their employees "some respect."</a></p>

Creative director Marco Ponte said the decision to delay the game was made "after months of internal testing," along with discussions from fans. As a result of these discussions, the developer also decided to cut multiplayer co-op from the game.</p>

<p>"We know this may come as a disappointment, but we believe it is the right creative direction for an uncompromising vision of the world after Judgment Day," Ponte said.</p><p>Additionally, the developer canceled plans to launch the game as an early-access title. "We want your first steps into the wasteland to be a complete and polished experience," Ponte said.</p><p>As for a new release date for Survivors, Ponte didn't have one to give, but the game will not be out in 2025. That was what many people guessed already, though, given the year is nearly through.</p><p>Looking ahead, Nacon will conduct closed playtests in the time ahead--you can <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.nacongaming.com%2Fplaytests">sign up here</a> for a chance to get into a future test.</p><p>"We know expectations are high, and we can’t wait to show you what we've been working on. For now, I can only thank you for sticking with us as we do our absolute best to create a game worthy of the Terminator legacy," Ponte said.</p><p>Terminator: Survivors was not the only Terminator game to be delayed this year, as Bitmap Bureau and Reef Entertainment delayed Terminator 2D: No Fate, but it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/terminator-2d-no-fate-has-been-delayed-yet-again/1100-6535978/" data-ref-id="1100-6535978">finally came out on December 12.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>We’re excited to announce that <em>Game Informer</em> Issue 374, arriving in mailboxes and at newsstands in January, features an extensive cover story on <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/world-of-warcraft-midnight">World of Warcraft: Midnight</a>. My 12-page deep dive offers exclusive insights into the making of the upcoming expansion, including its massive player housing feature, the reimagining of the Quel'Thalas zone, a fresh playable Allied Race, and the Demon Hunter class's new Devourer specialization. Notably, we've also secured a few exclusive details about the team's reimagining of Northrend, arguably the game's most iconic location to date, which arrives in the subsequent expansion, The Last Titan.</p><p>Covering a video game with such a rich history as World of Warcraft requires a measure of thoroughness that's hard to fit into a single story, so associate editor Charles Harte accompanied me to Blizzard's headquarters to author a retrospective that serves as a fantastic primer for anyone reading about the 21-year-old MMORPG for the first time. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">Subscribers gain early access</a> to the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/wowmidnight">magazine's digital version</a> and can expect supplemental online and video coverage through January.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cover art depicts a crimson-haired Blood Elf returning home, spoils in hand, as her neighborhood brims with life in the background.

            <title><![CDATA[Mini Review: Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition - A Great Upgrade That Misses A Few Wins]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition</link>
            <guid>1384882</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>I'm not sure how many times I've played through the opening hours of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, but it's a lot, and it's been across a long period of time via various platforms.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is that I've experienced this all-timer during phases of janky performance, and whilst it's a game that still shines, no matter the technical issues at hand, it's one that's all the more dreamy when it runs well and is, most importantly, easy to parse at all times.</p>
<p>Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a busy old thing in how it utilises every inch of your screen to convey info about everything that's going on at any given time, you see. There's a lot to digest, and having a nice crisp resolution, coupled with a frame rate that's smooth, really brings it all home as a remarkable achievement in gaming that everyone should dive into.</p>
<p>I gave the Switch 1 port a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/divinity_original_sin_2_-_definitive_edition">9/10 in my review of that version back in 2019</a>, remarking that "beyond a quite understandable drop in resolution and texture quality, this is [...] running at a solid and dependable 30fps". Ah, yes, that's right, this one already ran surprisingly well, so we're on easy street. Sort of.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:91617 @ 1765904262 -->
<p>Yes, we can put an end to a streak of properly awful Switch 2 ports (that's right, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</a>, I am talking about you guys) by rejoicing in the fact that Larian has delivered a free update that, whilst bare-bones, gives us a much-improved experience overall. And that's what actually matters.</p>
<p>Whilst it's definitely a disappointment that we've only got 30fps in portable, and with no mouse mode added in to boot (I mean...why?!), the handheld 30fps here <em>is</em> the smooth-feeling sort, and it's also not the type of game that critically needs to be at 60fps, at the end of the day.</p>
<p>In docked mode, it does now hit 60fps, though. Hooray! And it's stuck resolutely to 60fps throughout all of my time playing. It also — thanks to a resolution bump to 1080p — looks way clearer on-screen whilst benefitting from some lighting and shadow touch-ups. Oh, and loading times, thankfully, are way down here, so that's a very nice bonus. These are meaningful quality-of-life upgrades for players who've grown accustomed to long waits and blurry visuals on Switch 1 or anyone who's likely to pump a lot of time into this gem in the near future.</p>
<p>And so, overall, whilst this <em>is</em> as bare bones as these things get, it is free if you own the game already, and you can't argue that it ain't prettier, crisper, and better to play now, can you? Also, given that it's an all-timer for all times, well, they get away with it.</p>
<p>Now, where's Baldur's Gate 3? Didn't you guys know <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/reviews/xbox-series-x/baldurs-gate-3">I gave that a 10?</a> Make with the mind-flayers already.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition]]></content:encoded>

			<p>It's no secret that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-and-black-ops-6-launch/">has not been the big blockbuster hit that Activision expects</a> from its marquee series every year. Its release has gone so poorly that Activision has <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-team-vows-no-more-back-to-back-releases-after-black-ops-7-flop/">even promised to change how it approaches future releases in the series</a> to avoid what happened this year. At this point, something new, something that's not Black Ops or Modern Warfare, feels like what the series needs to survive, and according to X (formerly Twitter) user GhostOfHope, that's what we're getting with Call of Duty 2027.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/2000945365055394031">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, GhostOfHope, who has proven to be a reliable source of leaks regarding Call of Duty, claimed that the 2027 game will be made by Sledgehammer Games and that it will introduce a new sub-series to the annual shooter franchise. That means that, according to GhostOfHope, whatever the 2027 Call of Duty game is, it won't be a new entry in either the Modern Warfare or Black Ops sub-series of games.</p>



<p>A new sub-series also means a new set of characters, and a new setting, as this game is reportedly set sometime between the late 90s and early 00s. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>EXCLUSIVE: COD2027 made by Sledgehammer Games will be a new sub franchise with completely new characters set in the late 1990s/early 2000s. </p><p>- Omnimovement with NO Tac Sprint is currently planned for the game</p><p>- Pick 10 returning is a big discussion happening</p><p>- Zombies… <a href="https://t.co/2SbZ4ZlfVk">pic.twitter.com/2SbZ4ZlfVk</a></p></div>— Hope (@TheGhostOfHope) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/2000945365055394031?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The leaker also claims that this new entry will include some major gameplay changes, as it'll feature omnimovement but with no tactical sprint, but perhaps the biggest change claimed by GhostOfHope is that the 2027 game may not feature a Zombies mode at all.</p>



<p>Right now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-identity-concerns-black-ops-6-carry-forward-black-ops-7/">considering how stagnant Call of Duty has felt over the last few years</a>, even with recent releases having bright spots that some players might point to, all of this makes it sound like we're in for a very different kind of game in 2027. But with how formulaic the series already is, it's difficult to imagine Activision and its studios straying too far from what's been proven to be successful.</p>



<p>We'll see how it all shakes out, especially after how next year's Call of Duty game goes. At this point, Activision has no choice but to stick with what it already has planned for 2026, unless it wants to try skipping a year for the first time in over a decade of Call of Duty games being annual releases. It'll be interesting, to say the least, to see how players react to next year's game, and how much actually gets changed in 2027. In the meantime, we can all keep playing Battlefield 6.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Larian Studios has revealed more information about its upcoming <em>Divinity </em>game, and if you were worried that the studio would deviate from its recent spate of turn-based RPG successes, then worry no more.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, Larian head Swen Vincke confirms that the new <em>Divinity </em>game, which was revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-game-awards-2025-recap" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7f71e644-2289-45c0-a1c9-dc56c3797e8a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">during the Game Awards last week</a> (and which still doesn't have an official title), will be a turn-based RPG.</p><p>Vincke also says that the game will represent his studio "unleashed", and that it'll feature many of the hallmarks you've come to expect from a Larian game "brought to the next level". I expect that means plenty of reactivity, lots of options in combat, and a dizzying amount of content in general.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Don't worry: Larian's new <em>Divinity </em>game won't betray the studio's turn-based strengths.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Boldly, Vincke says he believes that the studio's new <em>Divinity </em>game will be "way better" than the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-has-way-over-10-million-players-mod-support-has-been-in-works-since" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a6faddb2-01d3-46aa-a769-c7be021e6a4f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">phenomenally successful <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Schreier, Vincke and Larian were originally intending to work on a new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>RPG with Wizards of the Coast before realizing there was no enthusiasm for such a project, hence the pivot to <em>Divinity</em>.</p><p>Vincke says that Larian wants to finish the new <em>Divinity </em>in less time than it took the studio to release <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>; he says that "three to four years is much healthier than six years", so it sounds like that's about as long as you can expect to wait for the game to launch.</p><p>Perhaps controversially, Larian is also using generative AI to make the new <em>Divinity </em>game. Vincke is quick to assert that <em>Divinity</em>'s actual content won't be AI-generated, but that the studio is using the technology for concept art, placeholder text, and exploring ideas during development.</p>
<p>Reassuringly, though, Vincke concludes by saying he intends to use the money generated by <em>Baldur's Gate 3 </em>for more experimentation and expansion in <em>Divinity</em>. He says the game will do "a couple of things that you haven’t seen in RPGs before".</p><p>We'll have to wait and see what Larian is intending to do with <em>Divinity</em>; we're probably a ways away from even a full reveal, let alone a release date. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p><em>Dead Island 2 </em>had a lengthy and protracted development, which is probably partly why Dambuster wants to reassure fans that <em>Dead Island 3 </em>is very much in the works.</p><p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/e3-2014-dead-island-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a81e91d7-4004-4de5-ae3c-8bc56962c3e8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">originally</a> being worked on by <em>Spec Ops: The Line </em>studio Yager, before publisher Deep Silver <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deep-silver-drops-developer-dead-island-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a179414a-bc53-4112-843d-eb6c1a63b510" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">parted ways with the developer</a> in 2015.

            <p>
Larian's new Divinity RPG should spend a lot less time in development than their previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> - or at least, that's the dream. CEO Swen Vincke wants the process to take "three to four years" in total, which seemingly includes an early access period. 
</p>
<p>
For context, we first heard that Larian were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-have-two-new-games-in-the-works-fueled-by-the-very-same-fire-as-baldurs-gate-3">officially working on a new game</a> (two, actually) back in April 2024. Here, let me run those numbers through Rock Paper Shotgun's in-house Mirror of Fate. Gosh. Assuming I have performed the rituals correctly, that means Divinity will launch out of early access in 2027 or 2028. In less positive news, Larian are reportedly making limited internal use of generative AI for tasks such as concept art development and internal presentations.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Announced in 2019, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> took about six years to develop in entirety, but some of that is owing to delays from Covid lockdowns. Still, shaving off a couple of years while still aiming to deliver <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-reveal-a-new-divinity-rpg-that-boasts-greater-breadth-depth-than-ever-before">"greater breadth and depth than ever before"</a> is no small endeavour, even when you allow for the effects of the Covid pandemic.
</p>
<p>
"I think three to four years is much healthier than six years," Vincke told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level">Bloomberg</a>'s Jason Schreier in a new interview, conducted just before Divinity's announcement at Geoff Fest last week. One way they're hoping to speed things up is to develop quests and storylines in parallel. For this, they're enlisting a lot more writers and scripters - Larian currently employ 530 people across seven locations, including their recently founded Warsaw studio.
</p><p>
That said, Vincke feels that "the creative process itself actually is something you cannot accelerate", telling Schreier that BG3 was a much better game for giving the developers time to explore concepts and bin things off. "People underestimate how many times we're implementing something and realize in the middle that it's just not going to work," he said.
</p>
<p>
The less salubrious side of all this is that Larian have apparently been "pushing hard on generative AI", in Schreier's phrase, using generative AI tools "to explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text". 
</p>
<p>
According to Vincke, the developers aren't using generative AI to make things that appear in the finished game. "Everything is human actors; we're writing everything ourselves." Apparently, some Larian devs have resisted the introduction of AI tools, but Vincke says that "I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we're using it."</p>
<p>While Vincke doesn't make this connection in the Bloomberg piece, I imagine the automating of certain tasks is related to the desire to get Divinity out faster. Still, Schreier also paraphrases Vincke as saying that there have been no "big gains in efficiency" as a result of the AI push. The utility of generative AI in the workplace at large remain heavily <a href="https://hbr.org/2025/09/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity">disputed</a>, and the technology continues to be associated with <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117">spiking electricity consumption</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">the mass-production of clone art and misinformation</a> in the name of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-is-right-to-call-genai-a-political-topic-its-a-mechanism-of-class-war">oligarchal profits</a>.
</p><p>AI-generated art tends to get referred to as "slop". There's certainly a lot of literal slop in the Divinity announcement trailer, below - it's full of mud, blood and sick, but we can seemingly rest assured that all of that was hand-puked by humans rather than projectile-vomited by a generative AI. Somebody please resurrect the screaming ghost of Jean-Paul Sartre to explain to me what kind of nausea I'm feeling. No, you are not allowed to generate a clone of Sartre using ChatGPT.</p>

Elsewhere in the chat, Vincke expresses anxiety about Larian's current scale (yet more of that hot, delicious context: unlike many larger publicly owned game companies, Larian have not carried out any mass layoffs in the past couple of years).</p>
<p>"I think a lot of founders have the same problem," he says. "I have to be large, otherwise I can't make my video game. With growth suddenly comes a whole bunch of responsibilities that you didn't necessarily think you were ever gonna have, but you have them and then you make the best of them. Size exposes you to new problems that you couldn't imagine existed."
</p><p>
I spoke to Vincke myself this week, focussing more on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-talk-divinity-their-next-rpg-after-baldurs-gate-3-its-almost-as-though-its-the-first-in-the-series">the direction of the new Divinity RPG</a>, while finding time for some hard-hitting reporting about Larian's blatant swinophobia. Amongst other things, he confirmed that it's a turn-based CRPG successor to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/divinity-original-sin-2">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, with a world that skews darker than you'll find in Baldur's Gate 3.

<p><em>Disclosure: Former RPS deputy editor Adam Smith (RPS in peace) now works at Larian and is the lead writer for Baldur's Gate 3. Former contributor Emily Gera also works on it.</em></p>

            <p>I can't believe it either, your majesty. While outlining their plans for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> in the new year, Paradox have teased a major expansion by turning around and revealing a work-in-progress donkey. They've also spilled the beans on some of the tweaks coming with yet another "realm maintenance" update as part of this <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/dev-diary-191-2025-in-review.1888979/">year-end dev diary</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Following 2025's chapter four additions, which culminated with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-largest-ever-crusader-kings-3-expansion-takes-us-to-china-japan-and-southeast-asia-this-october">October's All Under Heaven DLC</a> extending the courtly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategising</a> into medieval China, Japan and Southeast Asia, 2026 will be the year of chapter five. As has become the norm, that means two more major expansions.</p>
<p>What're they about? Well, here's the main hint Paradox are offering, at least when it comes to one of the pair:</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Paradox Interactive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Either your next kingdom's Far Far Away, or something involving trading/farming is afoot. "If 2025 was the year of going wide (Nomads, all of Asia) then 2026 will be a year of depth," the studio scrawled above their ass. "We’re going to go back and revisit some parts of the game that’ll deepen the overall game experience. Just like how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-sorry-for-all-the-dead-bodies-i-left-behind-while-walking-from-ireland-to-china-in-crusader-kings-3s-brilliant-new-dlc">Roads to Power</a> set the stage for All Under Heaven, the All Under Heaven expansion is setting the stage for this future content. There are some central areas of the game that we’ve been itching to improve for a long, long time now."</p><p>Alongside those add-ons, 2026'll see CK3 get another free "realm maintenance" update aimed at revamping existing areas of the game or enacting less urgent changes based on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-have-a-direct-impact-on-crusader-kings-3s-future-and-get-a-few-hints-to-where-the-grand-strategy-is-heading-next">player feedback</a>. This update's being aimed at a release "early in the second quarter of the year". Among its tweaks will be a retooling of accolades to make them more rewarding and easier to pass on to a knight's squire, while attributes being made clearer and there'll be "more agency" around earning them. Also, Paradox wrote, "Glory will get a bit of a revamp, so it is no longer lost when the knights die in battle (it’s their job after all, and dying in battle can be quite glorious in these times…)."</p>
<p>The studio then went off to show off how some of the interfaces around these changes will look, with some panels showing off more in-depth visualisation for the various story cycles your ruler can be wrapped up in. If you get a pet cat or dog, there'll also now be a tab where you can read a bio for them, detailing facts like their age, fur colour, and whether they're a good boy.</p>
<p>None of the pet info slides shown off suggest you can get a pet donkey once the mystery ass expansion drops, but there's still plenty of time for that to be rectified once the calendar flips to next year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Update Allows You To Reset Your Skill Tree—For a Price]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-reset-skill-tree-after-update/</link>
            <guid>1384846</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders players everywhere have been asking for a function to reset their skill trees since the game came out. Mostly, it was because they were working towards Security Breach before Embark Studios nerfed the ability, leaving them with stacks of skill points in a path they might not have otherwise picked.</p>



<p>Following the recent rollout of the Cold Snap update, Embark Studios has finally implemented a function that allows users to reset the skill points, but it comes with a fairly hefty cost.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-reset-your-skills-in-arc-raiders">How to Reset Your Skills in ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>If you navigate to your Raider menu and check out your skills screen, you’ll see that there’s now a function to reset the paths you’ve chosen. With the press of a button, you can pull back all your assignments and restructure your build as you see fit, all without carrying out an Expedition.</p>



<p>This change comes with a sizeable cost.</p>



<p>You’ll need to pay 2,000 credits <strong>per skill</strong> to withdraw your entire build. Given that you can assign a maximum of 75 skill points in ARC Raiders, it’ll cost you 150,000 credits to respec your entire character.</p>



<p>At this point, that’s a drop in the water for some players. But for the more casual players or those who perhaps don’t loot as well as the average ARC Raiders fan, it’s a sizeable stack of coin.</p>



<p>But it now means that you can wipe your entire skill selection and build something entirely new, which is great news for anyone chasing the now-nerfed Security Breach perk. Once upon a time, it was the most broken perk in the game, but following a change weeks ago, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embark-studios-nerf-security-breach-perk/">made much weaker</a> by Embark Studios in a move to balance the skill tree.</p>







<p>Let us know on the Insider Gaming Discord server if you <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">plan to wipe your skills in ARC Raiders</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A Call of Duty leaker is making some big claims about the future of the franchise, specifically the 2027 version of the annual franchise.</p>



<p>According to TheGhostOfHope, developer Sledgehammer Games is planning some bigger changes for the game. Mainly in terms of what possible will be removed.</p>







<p><a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/2000945365055394031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostOfHope claims</a> that Zombies is <strong>“currently still not planned to return”</strong> in the game. They also say that <strong>“omnimovement with no tac sprint is currently planned for the game.”</strong></p>



<p>Regarding removing Zombies, TheGhostOfHope speculated about the possible reason.</p>



<p><strong>“I think the idea is that they don’t want to burn out Treyarch who is gonna come off [two] back-to-back games and they don’t want to have too much zombies content overall so that way 2028 is more hype,”</strong> they said while adding that they believe the omnimovement will be the Black Ops 6 version without the tactical spring and wall jump.</p>



<p>As far as what could be returning, it was said that Get High is coming back and that Pick 10 being brought back is <strong>“a big discussion happening.”</strong></p>



<p>As with any rumor or claim, please take the information with a grain of salt until it is either verified by Insider Gaming or confirmed by Activision or Sledgehammer Games. It’s also worth noting that TheGhostOfHope’s last claim regarding next year’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/infinity-ward-debunk-recent-modern-warfare-4-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared to be debunked</a> developer Infinity Ward. Of course, until the game is announced next year, everything is purely speculative.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">For the Animal Crossing fans looking for new dialogue or major overhauls to what exists in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, you may not want to hold your breath for the 3.0 Update or the Nintendo Switch 2 version. The announcement for anything new for the five-year-old game was already a delightful surprise (especially after Nintendo previously said they were done with major updates years ago), but there don't seem to be many secrets or surprises beyond what was shown in the reveal trailer. IGN was invited by Nintendo to get a hands-off look at what's coming to ACNH on January 15, 2026, and the roughly 25-minute demo confirmed certain ACNH fan factions' excitement and disappointment: namely, this one is for the decorators. That being said, as someone who does love decorating in Animal Crossing, this update is an exciting reason for me to play more regularly again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 version's three main features aren't all that interesting, though the speed and graphical updates are pleasing. In the demo, I saw and had it confirmed that the Switch 2 exclusive Megaphone tool is limited to calling residents who can actually hear. So, it won't impact anyone inside a building, which makes it less useful for tracking down a particular character. Then, the final major benefit to playing on Switch 2 is being able to play with up to 12 people total in multiplayer, though that hinges on <em>everyone</em> in the session playing on a Switch 2. I feel lucky I know even three people still playing, leaving this update as the least impactful.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The hotel is by far the biggest change out of everything. It was explained that, like other facilities in ACNH, the hotel is something you'll unlock. Since it's tied to the pier, it cannot be moved and getting it is not optional. I didn't see what's involved in building the hotel, but once it's there, it'll receive season-appropriate decor like other facilities. Inside is the welcoming site of Kapp'n's family. The main activity you'll do in the hotel is decorating rooms similar to the Happy Home Paradise DLC, with the key difference being that you have a list of room themes to choose from (such as Ranch Room, Skyscraper Room, and plenty more) and are free to do what you will with it… or skip using a theme entirely and freestyle the design. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you use a theme, you're provided a selection of items that match. Though unlike HHP, you're not required to use any specific items even if you do opt to use a theme. Then, when you're done, you'll receive a reward of the new hotel currency, tickets, once per day. You can keep decorating the eight guest rooms, but you won't receive any extra currency. Tickets can then be spent at the hotel gift shop that has hotel-related items along with new furniture, most of which I did not get to see. The other way to earn tickets is by crafting requested items for Kapp'n. The new bulk crafting feature wasn't shown in my demo either.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/15/switch2-acnh-ns2e-announce-trl-guest-room-decor-scrn-02-1765828312788.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Tourists who stay in the hotel can roam your island in the customizable outfits displayed in the hotel, which helps to clearly identify them. Unfortunately, there wasn't much interaction with tourists in my demo. The one conversation with a tourist didn't make it clear whether or not they can be invited to stay on the island, though it was mentioned in the demo that if the visitor is convinced, they could potentially become a resident. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The four new characters coming to ACNH with 3.0 (two from Splatoon, two from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom) weren't present in the demo, though the items that get added to ACNH after scanning one of their respective series amiibo were. It was clarified that to get one of the new Splatoon or Legends of Zelda characters and the associated special items, all you need to do is scan any one amiibo from their respective franchise, rather than any specific amiibo. The items looked great peppered around the item, and it seems most of the items are interactive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those looking for even more decorating, Slumber Islands await. We unfortunately again didn't see much of the special Slumber Island space beyond what was shown in the reveal trailer. This feature requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. With that, you'll get access to three island save spots and can create a small, medium, or large island, with the large size being close to being the size of the normal island. The Animal Crossing community has come up with some amazing island designs over the years, and the Slumber Islands feature is primed to encourage even more of that. Whatever you've collected will be available on the Slumber Islands, and anything you do or use in the dreams won't impact your main island. It was confirmed during the demo that there won't be any new additional custom design save slots, though, so players will need to get creative with what's already available if custom designs are a key part of their island design process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our demo didn't show Resetti's new suite of cleanup services, all the new items coming with the hotel, or how much it costs to upgrade storage. There wasn't a chance to ask the developers questions either, so it's still unclear whether we should expect any other ACNH updates beyond this. I'm eager to see the patch notes whenever Nintendo releases them to see if there are any secret small quality of life updates or item updates for holidays (will we get a 2026 balloon arch for the New Year's event?), but, as I mentioned earlier, I'm skeptical we'll see any major changes other than what's been announced. Even still, I'm enjoying having a reason to return to my island and get it cleaned up for future tourists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Miranda Sanchez is the executive editor of guides at IGN and a member of </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Unlocked</a><em>.

Well, Geoff Keighley tweeted it, so we're not surprised by how it turned out after that. I mean, I actually thought we were gonna make it, that it wasn't gonna leak until the show. But yeah, bureaucracy was against us because it was too fast [and too close to the show]. Normally, it takes more time for something like that to be filed, and here they filed really, really fast.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/unnamed-17-1765885306252.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Hellstone teased the announcement of Divinity ahead of The Game Awards.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: After the success of Baldur's Gate 3, it seemed like you and the developers had a lot of options for what was next – especially continuing with that franchise. Firstly, was the plan to always return to the Divinity series right after BG3 was finished?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>No, we were working on something else for Baldur's Gate originally, and I think we've talked about that publicly. Eventually, we were going to go back to the Divinity series, but before we did, we were going to take more time away from it, and then we changed our minds, honestly. Our hearts weren't into the thing that we were making before this, so it was an instant decision to say, 'Okay, we have to make Divinity now. So let's start doing it.' But when we did, it took us a little while to set everything up because we didn't have anything ready. So it was quite a flip, for sure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How far along in development is Divinity right now?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>We've been working on it for over two years in development. We're now in full production.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: It can't be stated enough how massively successful Baldur's Gate 3 was for not just Larian Studios, but for how it renewed interest in the CRPG genre, the larger Dungeons and Dragons franchise, and also brought in new players for both of those. What were some key lessons you took away from that, and what do you plan to bring into the next Divinity?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>One of the biggest lessons was the success of cinematics – and how we present the story and choices. Obviously, we did a lot of things differently in BG3 than we did with Divinity: Original Sin 2, and that game was much better, I think. But the fact that, when people started seeing choices cinematically, what an impact that has on players, how they bond with the characters, and the attractions and choices in the game. So I think that was probably my biggest takeaway from everything, yeah, for sure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Does returning to the Divinity series feel different now following the success of BG3? Do you view this series differently now compared to how you felt about Divinity: Original Sin 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Yeah, in a way. We learned the value of having a solid universe behind you, for sure. One of the first things we started doing was saying, 'Okay, we're gonna put a lot of effort into making this universe feel tidy.' That's also why we are just calling it Divinity, right? There's never been a game that's just Divinity first, because there were all kinds of versions with different names. So this is actually going to be Divinity, which is going to have a proper universe backing it. We're building everything as you would expect, with lots of surprises, so that we can build on top of it. We learned that from BG, because we spent a lot of time delving through all kinds of DnD books, so that's probably one of the biggest takeaways from that development process.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Divinity Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Divinity is also entirely owned by Larian Studios. You all have intimate knowledge of the lore, and without working with other agencies.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Yeah, we also have the benefit of being able to do what we want with it, right? Other things do not bind us. I mean, D&amp;D, for all its glory, is a ruleset that is made for tabletop role-playing games. Here, we have the benefit of making something that's actually a video game first. So it's very different, but I think people who enjoyed Baldur's Gate 3 are gonna love what we're doing with this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: There must be a great freedom in being able to bend and even break the rules of your systems however you please.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Yes, and we want you to break the systems in our games. That's our gameplay formula; we want you to break things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: That was a part of the fun of Baldur's Gate 3 for many people; you could come up with some wacky solutions to combat and quests. Would you say you're looking to elevate that even with Divinity?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Yes [Laughs]. But I can't talk about the game's mechanics yet. I think you want to discover this aspect by seeing it. It's one thing to talk about it, but when you're gonna see it in action, you're gonna say, 'Ah!,' you're gonna be nodding. I think if you like BG3, this is gonna be great.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is the scope of this game bigger than Original Sin 2 and even Baldur's Gate 3?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Ah, smart question. I will say that it's bigger than BG3. I've actually never compared BG3 to Original Sin 2, so I don't know what the numbers are. I reckon BG3 is bigger for sure, yeah, but Original Sin 2 is pretty big as well. I can't compare Divinity to Original Sin 2 accurately, but I can say that it'll be bigger than BG3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: As you develop the Divinity universe further, do you feel more comfortable operating within this setting, and does it feel easier compared to BG3?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>I mean, it actually feels a bit harder because we have to create the entire universe. We really wanted to tidy up because the first Divinity games were made with little thought for universe-building, and it's only in Original Sin 2 that we started thinking more about it – but even then, not really 100% to what we did with Baldur's Gate 3. So now we're really thinking about it, and so that's a lot of work to make sure we get it right. Because it's the little things, right? I mean, what do people do when they go out to eat? What do they do when they go to sleep? What all of that has to be called out. So there's a lot of stuff to consider.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Shifting to a development question, Baldur's Gate 3 and Divinity: Original Sin 2 used the early access release model. Will Divinity be planned with a similar release model, including early access?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Most likely, but I don't want to commit to it right now, because we don't know how the games industry will change. We're not ready to do anything in early access yet, but I think it's worked well for us in the past. We had the player community and their feedback, and that has made all of our games that were in early access much better. So yeah, I think we would very much like to do that again. But that said, we don't want too many people playing in early access, because we do need to 'cook' and it's still a period of development. So that might be a little bit problematic, but we'll see. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Given that Baldur's Gate 3 and Original Sin 2 were still very much structured in traditional CRPG gameplay, do you feel the need to switch things up with mechanics to go for something different?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Well, we certainly want to innovate, yeah. But there are some core pillars that we don't need to change. It's going to be a single-player game, and it's also going to be a cooperative multiplayer game. Obviously, all within our formula, and there's still plenty of room for innovation. So you will see. There will be more agency for sure, more freedom for sure, more shenanigans that you can do for sure. So, in the combination of all these things, that's the thing that will surprise people the most.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: It feels like we're in this renaissance period for role-playing games in the wake of Baldur's Gate 3, especially the CRPG-style of video games. As a developer and an admirer of the genre, do you feel optimistic about where this genre of games is going, especially in how they tell stories?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Yeah, certainly for the genres of RPGs, I can't speak for other developers, but you see that there's way more interest and investment money available to put into RPGs. I mean, an RPG won the Game of the Year tonight at The Game Awards. We also have Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, which was also nominated tonight, along with Hades 2, which has a lot of RPG elements, even though it's a roguelite. So, I think it's… normal, yeah? Because I think it's one of the best genres out there.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/65718f3be3efa-1765886424254.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Swen Vincke admits the pressure is on Larian to deliver. Image credit: Larian.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: On that note, did you play Expedition 33?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>I haven't finished it yet, but it's really good. I took an interest in it very early on because the art style instantly appealed to me. So yeah, I think it's a remarkable achievement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: When it comes to working on the next Divinity game after BG3, is there a sense of pressure on yourselves to deliver?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Yeah, the pressure is high. Pressure is high. Yes, for sure. We feel the pressure on our shoulders, yeah, especially because we set high ambitions for ourselves. But I mean the opposite of that would be that we say, "Oh, you know what, we'll just make a lesser game." That wouldn't be very motivating at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Well, it seems like you're feeling great about the current vision for Divinity and feeling good about what's to come.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Oh, no, we're in the middle of development – there's always anxiety, for sure [Laughs]. These are complicated things to make, so it's not like, "Oh, let's make the game." No, it's a mess [to make games], but we'll be fine eventually. The team is good, we have trust, and we know that they know what they're doing, that eventually we're going to get what comes out of it. But if you were to go and look now, it's as messy as a building that is under construction, right? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, we will figure it out. We will learn the language of the game and how to write in it to start making poetry. Eventually, it gets really good, but it takes time. It takes iteration, and every single time you take an extra step, you learn more things about your game, and then you improve it. And that's just a process that takes time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

First, I want to thank you all for the patience and understanding you’ve shown thus far. Though we’ve been quiet, we haven’t been idle; this year has been productive and we’ve made important progress across all fronts, from world design and combat to narrative depth and atmosphere.</p><p>Our aim with <em>Terminator: Survivors</em> has always been to bring you an authentic and immersive <a title="Genres > Open-World [799 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> <em>Terminator</em> experience that recreates the harsh reality of Skynet’s uprising, and the resilience of humanity in spite of it.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You’ll be immersed in a bleak story where every machine patrolling the open world is a lethal threat, and the chilling sight of a T-800’s red eyes on the horizon means you run, you hide, or you die… Your journey will be one of desperation, as you explore, fight Skynet’s first prototypes, and help the resistance rise from the ashes of civilization. This isn’t just another <a title="Genres > Shooter [4,363 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a>. It’s a fight for the <a title="Genres > Survival [498 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> of all humanity from the moment you step out of the rubble. The start of the resistance against the machines, as seen through your eyes.</p><p>After months of internal testing, discussions with players and fans of the license, we came to the conclusion that to give you an authentic “<em>Terminator</em>” experience with the best possible shooting and exploration gameplay, <strong>we would have to put aside the <a title="Genres > Co-Op [363 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative multiplayer</a></strong>. We know this may come as a disappointment, but we believe it is the right creative direction for an uncompromising vision of the world after Judgment Day.</p><p>We’ve also had to overhaul our release plans, <strong>instead of launching in Early Access</strong>, we want your first steps into the wasteland to be a <strong>complete and polished experience</strong>. You might have guessed already, but that means <em>Terminator: Survivors</em> won’t be launching in 2025. We don’t have a new date locked in, but we’ll let you know when we’re ready to share a new release date.</p><p>Nevertheless, your feedback is a crucial part of our development process, and so we’ll be organizing several closed playtests (under NDA) as the launch window gets closer. If you’re interested in taking part and helping us shape the future of Terminator: Survivors, you can sign up here.</p><p>We know expectations are high, and we can’t wait to show you what we’ve been working on. For now, I can only thank you for sticking with us as we do our absolute best to create a game worthy of the <em>Terminator</em> legacy. We’ll be back with more news as soon as we can.</p><p>—Marco Ponte and the <em>Terminator: Survivors</em> Team</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/terminator-survivors-delayed-to-unannounced-date-no-longer-an-early-access-title]]></content:encoded>
