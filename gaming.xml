            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/672637/nvidia-rtx-5060-review-meddling-gamersnexus-wake-up-call<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia has gone too far.</p><p>This week, the company reportedly attempted to delay, derail, and manipulate reviews of its $299 GeForce RTX 5060 graphics card, which would normally be its bestselling GPU of the generation. Nvidia has repeatedly and publicly said the budget 60-series cards are its most popular, and this year it reportedly tried to ensure it by withholding access and pressuring reviewers to paint them in the best light possible. </p><p>Nvidia might have wanted to prevent a repeat of 2022, when it launched this card’s predecessor. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23777753/nvidia-rtx-4060-review-roundup">Those reviews were <em>harsh</em></a>. The 4060 was called a “slap in the face to gamers” and a “wet fart of a GPU.” I had guessed the 5060 was headed for the same fate after seeing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/603421/youtubers-are">how reviewers handled the 5080</a>, which similarly showcased how little Nvidia’s hardware has improved year over year and relied on software to make up the gaps.</p><p>But Nvidia had other plans.</p><div><p>Here are the tactics that Nvidia reportedly just used to throw us off the 5060’s true scent, as individually described by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AiekGcwaIho?autoplay=1"><em>GamersNexus</em></a>, <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-grants-rtx-5060-drivers-access-to-media-willing-to-publish-previews"><em>VideoCardz</em></a>, <a href="https://x.com/HardwareUnboxed/status/1920420643813691496"><em>Hardware Unboxed</em></a><em>,</em> <em><a href="https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/geforce-rtx-5060-preview-benchmarks,3433080.html">GameStar.de</a></em>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsy9FE4swtY"><em>Digital Foundry</em></a>, and more:</p></div><div><ul><li><span>Nvidia decided to launch its RTX 5060 on May 19th, when most reviewers would be at Computex in Taipei, Taiwan, rather than at their test beds at home. </span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Even if reviewers already had a GPU in hand before then, Nvidia cut off most reviewers’ ability to test the RTX 5060 before May 19th by refusing to provide drivers until the card went on sale. (Gaming GPUs don’t really work without them.)</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>And yet Nvidia allowed <em>specific</em>, cherry-picked reviewers to have early drivers anyhow <em>if </em>they agreed to a borderline unethical deal: they could only test five specific games, at 1080p resolution, with fixed graphics settings, against two weaker GPUs (the 3060 and 2060 Super) where the new card would be sure to win.</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>In some cases, Nvidia threatened to withhold future access unless reviewers published apples-to-oranges benchmark charts showing how the RTX 5060’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price">“fake frames” MFG tech</a> can produce more frames than earlier GPUs without it.</span></li></ul></div><p>Some reviewers apparently took Nvidia up on that proposition, leading to early reviews where charts looked positively stacked in the 5060’s favor:</p><p>But the reality, according to reviews that have since hit the web, is that the RTX 5060 often fails to beat a four-year-old RTX 3060 Ti, frequently fails to beat a four-year-old 3070, and can sometimes get upstaged by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/17/24323888/intel-arc-b580-sold-out-availability">Intel’s cheaper $250 B580</a>. </p><p>And yet, the 5060’s lackluster improvements are overshadowed by a juicier story: inexplicably, Nvidia decided to threaten <em>GamersNexus’ </em>future access over its GPU coverage. Yes, the same <em>GamersNexus</em> that’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178785/asus-customer-support-gamers-nexus">developed</a> a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315781/gamers-nexus-video-reply-nzxt-defense-misleading-customers-flex-pc-rentals">staunch</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/14/24343867/gamersnexus-is-leading-a-new-class-action-lawsuit-against-paypal">reputation</a> for defending consumers from predatory behavior, and just last month published <a href="https://gamersnexus.net/gpus/great-nvidia-switcheroo-gpu-shrinkflation">a report on “GPU shrinkflation”</a> that accused Nvidia of misleading marketing. Bad move!</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiekGcwaIho">22-minute video</a>, GN claims Nvidia threatened to cut off access to Nvidia’s cooling and latency experts unless GN agreed to do the thing you see in the charts above — compare cards with fake frames to cards without. GN claims it has the recorded phone conversations to prove it, which are likely legal because Nvidia was recording them too. </p><p>“Just to be clear, Nvidia, I am prepared to release them,” GN editor-in-chief Steve Burke threatened. </p><p>Recording every conversation isn’t how companies and reviewers normally operate. There’s been a serious breakdown in trust if we find ourselves here!</p><p>Nvidia is within its rights to withhold access, of course. Nvidia doesn’t have to send out graphics cards or grant interviews. It’ll only do it if it’s good for business.</p><p>But the unspoken covenant of product reviews is that the press, <em>as a whole</em>, gets a chance to warn the public if a movie, video game, or GPU is not worth their money. It works both ways: the media also gets the chance to warn that a product is so good you might want to line up in advance. That unspoken rule is what Nvidia is trampling here.</p><div><p>Nvidia is trampling an unspoken rule</p></div><p>On Wednesday, May 14th, I asked Nvidia in a group press briefing: “Are there not going to be reviews of the RTX 5060 before our readers are able to buy it?” </p><p>Nvidia didn’t deny it. “Units will be available from May 19th,” was Nvidia GeForce PR boss Ben Berraondo’s response, seemingly implying that a lack of early supplies of the GPU, not an underhanded campaign to influence early reviews, would be to blame for the gap.</p><p>Earlier in the same briefing, <em>Hardwareluxx</em>’s Andreas Schilling wrote a similar question and got a similar answer: “Could you share your thought on why Nvidia is going to release the driver for RTX 5060 with availability and not giving us the chance to do our reviews prior to this?” </p><p>Berraondo answered, “We are focused on delivering a great day-one experience for GeForce RTX 5060 gamers with our Game Ready Driver that will be available to everyone on May 19.”</p><p>But as <em>GamersNexus</em> and other publications soon revealed, not “everyone” had to wait until the 19th to start testing. Nvidia didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment about the <em>GamersNexus</em> allegations. </p><p>It wasn’t Nvidia’s only misleading statement about the card. During that same Wednesday briefing, rather than sharing Nvidia’s benchmark charts, GeForce product management director Justin Walker claimed the new GPU would “let you play your games maxed out at over 100 frames per second,” including demanding titles as <em>Black Myth Wukong</em> at 130fps<em>, Cyberpunk 2077</em> at 148fps<em>, </em>and <em>Half-Life 2 RTX</em> at 130fps. </p><p>I laughed when I read the fine print and saw what Nvidia meant by “maxed out.” It meant a paltry 720p render resolution, DLSS-upscaled to 1080p, with up to three of every four frames imagined by AI — and even then, only when you paired Nvidia’s budget $299 GPU with a decidedly <em>not</em> budget $599 AMD CPU, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24288948/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">one of the best money can buy</a>. </p><p>One of Nvidia’s other pieces of news from that same briefing was that DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation is available in over 125 games and apps. “DLSS 4 is the fastest adopted gaming technology in our history,” Walker proclaimed. </p><p><em>Does that mean GPU reviewers can no longer ding these graphics cards for marketing features only a handful of game developers bother to use</em>? I thought to myself.</p><p>But no: as of today, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fnvidia-rtx-games-engines-apps%2F" rel="sponsored">Nvidia’s website</a> lists just 29 games with full native support for DLSS Multi Frame-Generation. The only way Nvidia can get to 125 is by counting games where players have to force it through Nvidia’s drivers, which doesn’t give any indication of adoption by game developers. </p><p>So now, I’m wondering: where else might Nvidia be trying to pull the wool over our eyes?</p><p>I can’t quite understand why Nvidia would risk fracturing trust the way it did this week. I mean, yes, Nvidia now has fuck-you money from AI, and gaming can feel like an afterthought. </p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/620314/nvidias-networking">Nvidia’s networking business is now bigger than gaming</a>, which now represents less than 10 percent of Nvidia’s total revenue. The company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/620206/nvidia-q4-2025-earnings">makes more <em>pure profit</em> from AI in a single quarter</a> than total gaming sales in a year. It’s no wonder the GPUs are in short supply at MSRP when their makers are richly rewarded for putting silicon capacity toward AI chips instead.</p></div><p>But that feels like a good argument for Nvidia to <em>stop caring</em> whether its gaming GPUs sell, not why it might feel the need to meddle with reviews. If the desktop RTX 5060 doesn’t hit sales goals, the company will be more than OK. Nvidia would be less OK if everyone started questioning its integrity.</p><p>What might help explain this push, though, is Nvidia’s seeming need to make its founder’s new vision for gaming into a reality. At CES 2025, Nvidia CEO <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price">Jensen Huang kicked off a huge debate about “fake frames” among PC gamers</a> when he suggested they were the future of graphics — effectively, that the idea your game should draw each and every scene 60, 120, or more times per second will seem antiquated. That AI not only can, but <em>should</em> fill in the gaps. </p><div><p>It’s not<em> so</em> far-fetched an idea: as my colleague Tom Warren noted in January, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price#:~:text=So%20much%20of%20modern%20gaming%20is%20already%20%E2%80%9Cfake%2C%E2%80%9D%20and%20it%20has%20been%20for%20years">“so much of modern gaming is already ‘fake,’ and it has been for years</a>.” That might be why Nvidia has been so pushy about reviewers adding such comparisons to their reviews. (Nvidia has even bugged us to include MFG results in our AMD reviews, a request <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/624423/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review-benchmarks-price#:~:text=Nvidia%20does%20pull%20ahead%20in%20raw%20numbers%20when%20you%20enable%203x%20and%204x%20frame%20gen%2C%20which%20AMD%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20have.%20But%20as%20I%E2%80%99ve%20discussed%20at%20length%20elsewhere">we’ve largely ignored</a>.) </p></div><p>But in the end, Huang’s claim that the $549 RTX 5070 would deliver $1,599 RTX 4090 performance <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/623441/nvidia-rtx-5070-review-test-benchmark">didn’t ring true</a>. The thing about Nvidia’s MFG is it needs enough real frames to begin with, or it doesn’t feel smooth, and if it already feels smooth, you may not need the extra frames. It’s not a silver bullet that can make a 1440p card feel like a 4K card and, according to Dave James with <em>PC Gamer</em>, it isn’t enough to make Nvidia’s new 1080p card feel like a 1440p one, either. </p><div><blockquote><p>You’re not going to be able to use MFG to be able to up the resolution on your low-end RTX 5060 to match your 1440p monitor, even with DLSS running. And you’re not going to be able to use MFG to enable you to run at the highest in-game settings, even sometimes at 1080p.</p><p>The extra latency and low input frame rates either make it a latency spiking nightmare or the AI generated frames end up creating a ton of unpleasant artifacts as you run around whatever gameworld you’re in.</p></blockquote></div><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e1a2-VxxvQ"><em>HardwareUnboxed</em> published a review</a> that shows the new 5060 may not be that much faster than the old 4060, even at 1080p. They found it 20 percent faster on average across 18 games, and as low as 8 percent faster in <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, 9 percent faster in<em> Stalker 2</em>, and 10 percent faster in <em>Black Ops 6</em>. At 1440p, the $250 Intel Arc B580 offered better 1 percent lows and is the superior deal if you can find it at that price.</p><p>We may never know how many PC gamers bought an RTX 5060 without seeing any such comparisons, because Nvidia kept proper reviews from arriving on time. But in many cases, it won’t be too late to return those GPUs. Maybe Nvidia’s bad behavior is enough to push us to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/670285/amd-radeon-rx-9060-xt-announcement-computex">buy AMD’s new card</a> or wait for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/intel/670037/computex-2025-intel-arc-pro-ai-b770-rumor">Intel’s next card</a> instead, challenging <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-aib-market-share-grow-90-percent-total-gpu-shipments-decline-q3-2024/">Nvidia’s 90-percent control of the market</a> and, perhaps, bringing some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/656783/gpu-prices-are-out-of-control-again">much-needed competition</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Solving puzzles and uncovering clues in this roguelite structure eventually gives way to some big mysteries and lots of backstory, with some players spending over a hundred hours navigating the deepest layers of its esoteric labyrinth. </p><p>But on PS5, some of those players were hitting a save bug long before their time in the mansion felt complete.

Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Step into the shadows as an acolyte of the Inquisition in Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy, a second narrative-driven tactical RPG set in the beloved grimdark universe. Set against the backdrop of the Noctis Aeterna and the mystery of the Tyrant Star, players will lead a warband of diverse companions in a desperate battle against heresy and corruption — from loyal Imperial subjects, such as a veteran Guardsman from the death world of Catachan, to nefarious xenos, including a bird-like Kroot mercenary. </blockquote><blockquote>With intricate investigations, a turn-based combat system, and choices that carry grave consequences, Dark Heresy is set to deliver an atmospheric dive into the brutality and mysticism of one of the Imperium’s most feared organizations. The game greatly expands on the ideas introduced in Rogue Trader and features fully voiced dialogues.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy is due out on PC (Steam, GOG, Epic Games Store) and PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S.

A new 15-hour storyline introduces the Adeptus Arbites, a faction of incorruptible enforcers, and a new companion — the grim and relentless Solomorne Anthar. With battle Familiars like cybernetic eagles and cyber-mastiffs, this DLC "enriches the gameplay and narrative layers" of Rogue Trader and will be available to all players on June 24, 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Also announced is Season Pass 2 for Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, bundling two new expansions and an appearance customization pack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The third major addition to the game will allow players to enter a Necron vault curated by fan-favorite Trazyn the Infinite, challenge ancient guardians, and uncover relics tied to the Von Valancius legacy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fourth will let players explore the Processional of the Damned — a surreal voidship graveyard, in a "descent into madness and mystery."

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-%E2%80%93-ign-first.1196742/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The first developer name that comes to your mind when I say "Souls" series is very likely Hidetaka Miyazaki, the director of the Dark Souls series, Sekiro, Bloodborne, and of course, Elden Ring. But Nightreign marks the first time in the series the director baton is being passed to another: Junya Ishizaki. During my visit to FromSoftware's office in Japan, I got to sit down to talk with Ishizaki-san about what it's like sitting in the director's chair, dig into some of the more unique design decisions Nightreign brings to the table, and learn a little more about the origins of this Elden Ring spin-off.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>In a previous interview you had said that you brought the idea for Nightreign to Miyazaki-san who gave you the green light. Was the initial pitch for Nightreign close to what was ultimately made or did anything change between the conception and the execution of the idea?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki - Director of Elden Ring: Nightreign: </strong>The general concept we planned didn't change a great deal from what we initially pitched to Miyazaki, but during the course of development we've had a lot of input from other staff, ideas and concerns and all that sort of thing, which we've managed to take and incorporate into the game in exciting ways that kind of went beyond the initial concept.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In terms of advice from Miyazaki — well this wasn't just from Miyazaki but other directors at From — the one that stuck with me and etched into my mind was that a director shouldn't hold back.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So talking about some of that feedback, you guys had a Closed Network Test. Can you talk a little bit about how that helped you inform development for Nightreign and what lessons you learned from people playing the test?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, game balance was a large part of it. Balancing and tweaking the game difficulty is always a large challenge when it comes to these games, along with responding to user feedback and incorporating that into the game as well. So we're continuing to look at that, but it was generally interesting to see player behavior, and get some good feedback from how players played the game and interacted with the systems. And also there's a lot of new rules and a lot of new systems in this new game design of Nightreign. So it was important to see how players gave us feedback to that and how we could make the onboarding process and explain those new systems better for them when the game comes out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">C<strong>an you talk about what it's been like jumping into the director's seat for this project? And did you get any advice from Miyazaki in terms of how to approach directing a video game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As director, my feeling was essentially: I've just got to do this, I've got to put my all into it. It was me who brought the initial idea forward, so it's obviously something I wanted to do, but I realized that I would need the resolve to see it through to completion or see it through to the end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of advice from Miyazaki — well this wasn't just from Miyazaki but other directors at From — the one that stuck with me and etched into my mind was that a director shouldn't hold back. So, on the day-to-day process of making games, something that maybe I would've given a pass to would not get through so easily as director. I'd have to be a bit more critical, put a bit more discipline on myself to really take a good look at these things and decide the best way forward for the whole project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Going back to that previous interview, you had said before that you can only play Nightreign either as a solo player or in a group of three. If you play in a group of two, then it matchmakes the third person. Can you talk a little bit about why there's no option for just a pair of players to drop into a match together?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we're very sorry about that. As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus and it's at the core of Nightreign. Of course, I myself as a player understand that and often want times where I'm just playing myself, so this is something that we considered from the start. And so we did put a lot of effort into creating this experience that was playable for solo players in as much as the rules and new systems allowed. So in putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect, but this is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Talking a little bit about that solo experience, can you explain how the game scales down the difficulty? Are there any unique things that happen when you're playing as a solo player versus playing in a squad?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seeing as this game is built around three players, we understand the concerns of those solo players, but essentially a lot of the time in Nightreign you will be acting and behaving on your own. Even in a group as three, you'll be going off and challenging different areas of the map and collecting different things before you accumulate together at the boss fight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So solo play is generally encouraged and is a natural part of the game loop, but also in general for those solo players — and this might be something that's difficult to notice in multiplayer — but the activeness and aggressiveness of enemies towards any one single player has been adjusted so that you don't find yourself in any unreasonable multi-foe fights. And just generally, when you're playing single player, the parameters adjust dynamically depending on the number of players in that session. So we hope that this will alleviate that feeling somewhat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course there are no revives when you're solo, there are no teammates to revive you, so it is definitely a more challenging thing for the player to face. But we have also incorporated a self-revive feature which is possible to discover around the map just to allow them some more chances to continue that learning of the patterns and learning of the bosses without having to restart all over again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Switching gears a bit to the story of Nightreign, can you set the stage and talk about how this game fits into Elden Ring's lore?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nightreign shares essentially the base setting and the world of Elden Ring, but it's played out on a different stage so to speak. So there's this concept called the Night Lord, which is a sort of abstract phenomenon or calamity that has befallen the lands between in this alternate timeline and much like a real-life calamity, it's something that it's not done by design or intention, it's just something that has occurred naturally and it's befallen the lands between and it needed some sort of opposition. It needs something to oppose it and that opposition comes in the form of the Nightfarers who are these warriors who are entrusted with the fate of opposing and defeating the Nightlord and putting a stop to this terrible calamity.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One of the things that I got to find out while I've been here is the way the story plays out over the course of a variety of remembrances. Can you talk a little bit about the decision to make the story of Nightreign come out through these individual character storylines versus a more traditional style of telling the story with a beginning, middle, and end?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So as mentioned just now of course we have this phenomenon called the Night Lord and this calamity has brought these Nightfaring warriors together for the purpose of fulfilling the prophecy of defeating the Night Lord. So these are different characters from different times and different cultures who have been brought together to face this calamity, but that's not their sole objective. They each have their own aims and their own motivations and their own anguishes that they are grappling with. We hope that players will enjoy exploring and unraveling each of these aspects, unraveling more of their character backstories and find some attachment to each character. This time of course, players aren't creating their own character, so we hopefully have incorporated a lot of elements that give them a lot of character and give them a lot of room to explore and find their favorites among them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Obviously, this was designed as a co-op PVE kind of experience, but PVP has always been a big part of the FromSoft RPG lineage. Was PVP ever something that was considered like having your squad being able to invade another squad's world or anything like that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the start, PVP was not something that we very actively considered for Nightreign. We wanted it to be a co-op multiplayer experience at its core and we found that as we developed these character actions and these unique abilities for each character, balancing them and tweaking them around PVP as well proved to be very… Not only very difficult, but took away from those ideas and that scope that we'd established for each of these characters. So we really wanted the focus to be on PVE and on co-op, and so we knew where our priorities were. So no, we didn't consider PVP in Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kind of drilling into the whole balance aspect, can you talk about how strict your approach to balancing has been and how the approach differs from something more single-player focused like base Elden Ring that also has those PVP elements?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more solo play oriented games such as Elden Ring, of course we're taking a lot of things into account such as the stages, how the enemies are laid out and designed, the wide breadth of player builds and equipment as well. So this time the approach is a little bit different and we are trying to cater to a fun experience with three people. So making sure the experience is fun at its core with a group of three, but it also doesn't collapse if it's a solo player as well. So combined with the new character actions that we brought in for each of the Nightfarers and for each of these new bosses, for example Gladius, I believe you faced yesterday or today's session, these are bosses as well that have been tuned and balanced for party play, for solo, for three play co-op. So this was an important aspect of the balancing approach for Nightreign.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Speaking of those bosses, it seems like the difficulty of the bosses compared to something like Elden Ring has kind of jumped up — the bosses deal a lot more damage, they take a lot more hits, presumably being balanced because due to the nature of having three players in a squad. Did you have an idea in mind of what might be too difficult for base Elden Ring, but just right for Nightreign?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So with the general rule set of Nightreign being this, or rather, the structure being this three day/night cycle, we wanted the boss fight at the end, this culmination of everything, to reflect the player, what they've learned and what they've established during that time. So this was an important aspect of the balance. You don't get a lot of room to breathe maybe that you do in Elden Ring where you have a lot of time to build up and go back to a boss. But instead you have this quite comparatively strict structure with the three days and nights to prepare.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>[The bosses] are supposed to be very imposing, and challenging, and fearsome when you face them.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And so that was an important aspect of balancing these bosses. They are supposed to be very imposing, and challenging, and fearsome when you face them, but after some time and some learning and some observation, you'll be able to defeat them at the end of this three day and night cycle. So that was a large part of it was creating that balance between the structure and that culminates in a fun and exciting boss fight itself.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Elden Ring Nightreign - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A big aspect of FromSoft’s prior games is the post-game: New Game Plus, and other post-game challenges that await you even after you complete the game. Does Nightreign have something like that waiting for players after they defeat the eight Nightlords?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have incorporated some post-game or end-game features for players once they've gone through all of the Nightlords. I first want to stress that to get to that point, we feel that there is enough content there to satisfy users in general, so to get through each of those Nightlords and use each of these characters and experiment with the game as a whole. But beyond that, you have the unlocking relics, new relic rites to experiment even more with the character builds. You have these elements that you will be accumulating as you proceed through the game, such as the relics and the character stories and scenarios, but there's no time limit on these at all. There's no limit to how much the player can explore and how long they take. So we hope that these elements will give them a little extra bump to go past the end game and explore a bit more of what the game has to offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Did you ever consider making Nightreign a free-to-play game instead of it being a premium priced experience? And can you talk a little bit about the decision to put a price tag on it when so much of the competition in the multiplayer space is free-to-play these days?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Free-to-play was one consideration, but given the time and the budget and the workforce that we had and the ideas that we were developing with our staff that we were cultivating, we felt that the best course of action for Nightreign was to release it as a non-full price but also not full play title. So we hope that there's enough content there that justifies this purchase and that players will get to experience everything it has to offer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And finally, is there anything that you're really happy about and are particularly proud of with regards to what you accomplished with Nightreign?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a bit of a broad summary, but I'm just generally pleased that we managed to take this game from its initial concept to its implementation and develop it as in terms of the vision that I initially had from that three day and night structure to the way that players come together and sort of converge in this condensed RPG system and to fight against that boss together, this was a strong idea that I had and I knew that it would go well that if we could implement it properly and I know that games are, when they take shape, it's a bit of a miracle in itself, so I'm extremely thankful to the team and I'm extremely pleased that we managed to realize this concept to its completion. So yes, that's definitely something I'm very proud of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

                <p>2017's Star Wars Battlefront II from Battlefield developer DICE is popular again, with player numbers jumping on Steam to near record-levels. This is happening amidst a fan campaign for EA to make another entry in the popular, multimillion-selling franchise.</p><p>The game reached 9,292 concurrent players on Steam in the past 24 hours, which is just shy of its all-time peak concurrent record of 10,489, according to data from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1237950/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. The game was hovering between 1,500 and 3,000 peak concurrent players until mid-April 2025, when player numbers began surging for the eight-year-old game.</p><p>This was around the time that the Star Wars TV series Andor came back for its second and final season on Disney+.</p><p>Exactly why the game is experiencing a big uptick is unknown, but it comes amid a campaign for a third game in the new series. Recently, actor Muhannad Ben Amor from Andor posted on his Instagram story, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-andor-actor-joins-calls-for-battlefront-3-as-battlefront-2-popularity-spikes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Star Wars gotta give us Battlefront 3 ASAP."</a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefront subreddit</a> is experiencing lots of activity and engagement lately, with fans discussing how much they're enjoying returning to the game. Battlefront II is included with EA Play, so that means Game Pass Ultimate subscribers also get it as part of their membership.</p><p>2015's Battlefront and 2017's Battlefront II combined to sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/despite-the-loot-box-controversy-eas-star-wars-bat/1100-6471006/" data-ref-id="1100-6471006">more than 33 million copies</a>, but despite that, EA has not confirmed any plans for more entries in the series. It was reported in 2024 that EA rejected a pitch from DICE for Battlefront III due to the licensing costs it would have to pay Disney. The report said a potential Battlefront III <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-rejected-star-wars-battlefront-3-pitch-report/1100-6498250/" data-ref-id="1100-6498250">would need to sell 20% more copies to justify its production budget.</a></p><p>DICE is currently working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>, so no one should expect the developer to make a third Battlefront game soon, if it ever does.</p><p>The Battlefront series debuted in 2004 with a third-person shooter from the since-shuttered Pandemic Studios. A sequel, Battlefront II, came out in 2005, and it was also developed by Pandemic. A third game was reportedly in the works, but it was said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-3-was-canceled-2-yards-from-the-finish-line-dev-says/1100-6513342/" data-ref-id="1100-6513342">canceled "two yards from the finish line."</a></p><p>The two older games were packaged together in the Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-collection-first-update-fixes-a-long-list-of-issues/1100-6521962/" data-ref-id="1100-6521962">released in 2024 to a terrible critical reception</a> due to numerous bugs and other issues.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-ref-id="1100-6531329">the second trailer</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> was finally released by Rockstar Games, and as Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick put it, it "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-broke-the-internet-take-two-boss-says/1100-6531601/" data-ref-id="1100-6531601">broke the internet</a>." To date, it has over one billion views on YouTube, so it was inevitable that fans would remix the original trailer into a new form. Now, someone has released a remake of the GTA 6 trailer with a PlayStation 2-inspired makeover.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axZp9CH8prU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/axZp9CH8prU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The PS2 Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer was posted on YouTube by a user called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axZp9CH8prU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foosmoke</a>, and there appears to be some subtle humor in this video. There's clipping when Jason robs the convenience store, which is definitely true to a PS2 experience. Jason also appears to have more trouble lifting weights in this version <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6s-jason-does-he-even-lift-bro-heres-how-much-he-can-bench/1100-6531346/" data-ref-id="1100-6531346">than he did in the actual trailer</a>.</p><p>The Vice City glimpsed in this trailer remake is also noticeably less populated than the one seen in the original trailer. The PS2-era GTA games couldn't handle subtle expressions and body language in their character models like the new game can. And without those touches, this take on the GTA 6 trailer doesn't have the same resonance as the original.</p><p>Digital Foundry recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2-was-only-30fps-and-it-may-be-too-much-for-switch-2/1100-6531393/" data-ref-id="1100-6531393">an in-depth look at the second GTA 6 trailer</a> and concluded that it won't be able to run on Nintendo Switch 2 despite the new system's greatly improved hardware. This PS2-style incarnation of the game would probably work for both incarnations of the Switch, but who would want to play this downgraded version after seeing what GTA 6 really looks like?</p><p>GTA 6 is coming to Xbox Series X|S and PS5 on May 26, 2026. That delay is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-could-wipe-out-a-jaw-dropping-amount-of-money-from-global-games-industry/1100-6531664/" data-ref-id="1100-6531664">estimated to cost the video game industry approximately $2.7 billion</a> in 2025, according to Ampere Analysis.</p>

            <p>
Relic Entertainment is giving its much-loved real-time strategy game Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War a bit of modern day makeover for a Definitive Edition that's scheduled to arrive on GOG and Steam later this year. Additionally, a Space Marine 1 re-release is on the way.
</p>
<p>
Starting with Dawn of War, it originally launched in 2004, casting players (in the single-player campaign, at least) as the Space Marines' Blood Ravens 3rd Company, charged with defending the planet Tartarus from Ork invaders. But away from the campaign, players also got to test their skills controlling the Orks, Eldar, and Chaos. "It's a perfect gaming world," Keiron Gillen wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-warhammer40kdawnofwar-pc">Eurogamer's 8/10 review back in the day</a>, "being exploited perfectly, for the first time."
</p>
<p>
Skip ahead 20 or so years, and it's time to do it all again, thanks to the newly unveiled Dawn of War - Definitive Edition. This bundles together the base game alongside its three expansions - Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, and Soulstorm - all of which equates to "four Classic Dawn of War Campaigns, nine Armies, and over 200 maps", according to Relic.

<p>
And because it's now 2025 and computers have come on a bit since Eric Prydz's Call On Me was at number one, there's also 4K support, upscaled textures (4x the originals), an enhanced battlefield camera, "optimised" HUD and screen layouts for widescreen viewing, plus improvements to world lighting, units reflections, and shadows. Additionally, the Definitive Edition remains compatible with "over 20-years of lovingly crafted community mods".
</p>
<p>
Dawn of War's Definitive Edition - which doesn't have a release date yet - isn't the only Warhammer glow-up announced as part of today's Warhammer Skulls showcase. The original Space Marine is also set to return as an enhanced Master Crafted Edition, being handled by developer SneakyBox. This "thoughtful restoration" of the 2011 PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 shooter features 4K resolution support, modernised controls, an interface overhaul, improved character models, remastered audio, all previously released DLC, and more. It costs £34.99 and launches for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass on 10th June.

"This is more than just Master Crafted Edition," publisher Sega writes in its announcement, "it's a respectful dialogue between past and present, preserving what made the original special while making it shine for a new generation of players."

			<p>During the Warhammer Skulls 2025 livestream, Owlcat Games announced its next cRPG project: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710600/Warhammer_40000_Dark_Heresy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</a>. As you can guess from the title, it's not a direct sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-charting-a-new-course/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader</a> and will instead focus on the Inquisition.</p>
<p>Players will begin their journey as an acolyte of the Inquisition, their duty to investigate heresy, command a diverse warband, and influence the destiny of the Calixis Sector. The studio promises an immersive narrative experience where every decision carries weight and the Inquisition is portrayed in-depth, with its power, bureaucracy, and inner conflicts laid bare like never before.</p>
<p>As an Inquisitor, the players' primary goal is to protect the Imperium from the taint of Xenos, the betrayal of heretics, and the scourge of mutants by any means necessary. During the game, they'll explore the mysteries of the Tyrant Star and overcome the worst horrors of the Noctis Aeterna.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mmfu_Spm-6U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As in any good cRPG previously released by Owlcat, Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy will also offer players aid in the form of companions with different expertise and backgrounds. These companions range from loyal Imperial subjects (such as a veteran Guardsman from the death world of Catacha) to nefarious Xenos, including an avian-like Kroot mercenary. Each one features distinctive gameplay and a new perspective on the story with fully voiced dialogues. The game doesn't have a release date yet, but it can already be wishlisted on Steam.</p>
<p>During the same Warhammer Skulls live stream, Owlcat also unveiled Lex Imperialis, the second big expansion coming to Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader after <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-rogue-traders-first-expansion-void-shadows-moved-to-september-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Void Shadows</a>. In Lex Imperials, players will find a new 15-hour storyline that introduces the Adeptus Arbites, a faction of incorruptible enforcers, and a new companion—the grim and relentless Solomorne Antha. The expansion is out on all platforms on June 24.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lex Imperialis Release Date Trailer | Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHDfU-iQRhI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lastly, Owlcat announced a second Season Pass for Rogue Trader, which will provide access to two additional expansions coming in the future. The third expansion will allow players to enter a Necron vault curated by the iconic Trazyn the Infinite, where they will challenge ancient guardians and uncover relics tied to the Von Valancius legacy. The fourth DLC will let players explore the Processional of the Damned, a surreal graveyard of voidships, descending into madness and mystery. Like the prior DLCs, these freshly announced expansions will introduce a new companion character, new quests deeply integrated into the main storyline, and new mechanics, delivering around 15 hours of gameplay. To celebrate all the news, the base game is discounted on all platforms.</p>

            <p>Relic Entertainment have announced Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition, an upgraded, 64-bit version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-your-50-favourite-strategy-games-of-all-time">your 29th favourite strategy game of all time</a>, which includes all of the original expansions and will be compatible with "over 20 years of lovingly crafted community mods".</p>
<p>The developers assert that "this is the iconic Dawn of War as players remember it, but optimized for modern hardware." Nonsense, Relic! In order for this to be Dawn Of War as <em>I</em> remember it, I would need to play it while subsisting entirely on cans of 20p Tesco tomato soup. Nowadays Tesco tomato soup costs 65p a can. It turns out that in the grim darkness of the far future, there is only rampant inflation. And 4K graphics. Here's the announcement trailer.</p>

<p>The Definitive Edition features four Dawn of War campaigns, encompassing nine armies and over 200 maps. You can expect upscaled textures and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image-based_lighting">image-based lighting</a>, together with an optimised HUD layout for widescreen displays and an "improved" camera. "World lighting, unit reflections, and shadows have all been improved, and new unit gloss and emissive lighting will faithfully enhance the moment-to-moment action," gushes the press release.</p>
<p>Back in February, a few months after Sega sold them to UK investment firm Emona Capital LLP, Relic unveiled plans for a fiendishly diversified mix of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/company-of-heroes-devs-relic-bounce-back-with-plans-for-big-rts-sequels-smaller-experiments-and-spiritual-revivals">big RTS sequels, smaller experiments and spiritual revivals</a>. Happy as I am that they're still in the Spice Maureen business, this does feel like a quick cash-in while they work on something brand-new. If you don't care for those Definitive technical flourishes, you can already find a Dawn Of War compendium on Steam in the shape of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4570/Warhammer_40000_Dawn_of_War__Anniversary_Edition/">Anniversary Edition</a>, which also features all the old expansions and is currently 80% off till 29th May.</p>
<p>All this confirms <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-skulls-returns-amidst-dawn-of-war-4-rumours">Nic's report</a> from earlier this week that "something Dawn Of War shaped" would turf up at this year's Warhammer Skulls event. Nic is our premier Games Workshop astropath and archivist. He knows his Great Knarlocs like I know yearly increases in the price of canned goods. Let us gather trustingly around his arcane relay in the hopes that he absently murmurs the words "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-chaos-gate-daemonhunters">Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters</a> sequel".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Ever find yourself thinking, "man, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-boltgun">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> was a good video game, it sure would be swell if they made another one of those"? If so, the headline already spoiled this for you, but I'm going to pretend like it hasn't: a sequel was just revealed at the Warhammer Skulls Showcase! The reveal trailer mostly shows off what looks like more of the first game, but with boomer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">shooters</a> that look this good, I think that's just fine.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Right now, the game is currently slated for a 2026 release, with no more specific a window than that. I'm sure it'll be nowhere near GTA 6, just like literally every other game next year. A press release explains that enemies like Nurglings and Chaos Cultists will be making a comeback alongside the introduction of new enemies like Bloodletters and Juggernauts. I'm sure this'll all mean a lot more to Warhammer 40K lore heads than it does to me, honestly there could be an enemy called Hellsuckers and I'd believe you.

<p>
On top of all that there'll be new weapons to pick up, locations to explore, and a storyline with different branches to head down, each with their own unique levels.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and there's actually another new Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun game you can play right now too, Words of Vengeance. This one's a "first person typer", so think games like The Typing of the Dead, but with a Warhammer 40,000 paintjob. Words of Vengeance looks silly as hell, and it's even completely free! Love that.
</p>
<p>
There's also a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/36406/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine_Anniversary__Boltgun__Graia_Collection/">Steam bundle</a> with the original Boltgun, alongside the first Space Marine, that's 47% off at the moment if you've not played either of them before. You can also wishlist Boltgun 2 on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3115160/Warhammer_40000_Boltgun_2/">right here</a>, and pickup Words of Vengeance on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3533730/Warhammer_40000_Boltgun__Words_of_Vengeance/">here</a>.

I love the moral conundrums it presents, the violent grief it depicts, and the games’ excellent writing that poignantly brings all of those complicated emotions to the surface. What I don’t like is listening to pretty much any of the creative team talk about the series, especially when it comes to weighing in on decade-long discourse around its complex storylines. Even when I agree with series director Neil Druckmann’s interpretation of something, we’d all rather he just let bad readings fester in the corners of the internet than tell us exactly what something means. Nevertheless, he continues to do so in interviews.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196345" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Pokémon With Guns And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="126" data-playlist="196345,196196,195776" data-current="196345"><div><p>The Week In Games: Pokémon With Guns And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21893.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In a discussion with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8tOTQhepAI&amp;ab_channel=LastStandMedia&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8tOTQhepAI&amp;ab_channel=LastStandMedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sacred Symbols</a></span> podcast (thanks, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-1-finale-question-definitively-answered-by-series-creator-upending-years-of-fan-debate&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-1-finale-question-definitively-answered-by-series-creator-upending-years-of-fan-debate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span>), Druckmann talked about the end of <em>The Last of Us Part I</em>, which was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tlou-last-of-us-recap-s1e9-finale-joel-ellie-giraffe-1850217781&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tlou-last-of-us-recap-s1e9-finale-joel-ellie-giraffe-1850217781">adapted for television</a></span> in the HBO show’s first season. In this climactic moment, Joel—a smuggler turned surrogate father to Ellie, the young girl immune to a fungal infection that has leveled the series’ post-apocalyptic world—massacres members of a revolutionary group called the Fireflies who sought to use Ellie’s immunity to create a vaccine. They could potentially have saved millions of lives and helped society rebuild again after decades of ruin. But after months of traveling across the United States to reach the group’s base in Salt Lake City, Joel wasn’t willing to lose Ellie for something as small as the possibility of a world-saving vaccine. After the player fights their way through the facility and escapes with Ellie, Joel lies to her about what happened, and they live happily ever after(?) in Jackson, Wyoming…until the sequel, at least.</p><p>It’s a nuanced situation, and ever since <em>The Last of Us </em>launched in 2013, fans have debated the ethics of pretty much every character in this finale. However, one part of the discussion that has persisted is the question of whether or not the Fireflies would have been able to successfully create a cure or vaccine in the first place. This is the post-apocalypse. They’ve got one surgeon here who claims to be able to do the job, and even if they managed to concoct a vaccine, how would they distribute it? All of that is an interesting logistical discussion, but some fans have taken that talking point a step further and tried to claim the potential success of the plan was ever part of Joel’s motivations. It’s very obvious that the man cares about Ellie’s life above all else, and didn’t stop to weigh up the vagueries of vaccine efficacy in a zombie apocalypse I’ve always read these attempts to explain away Joel’s guilt as cope, and the idea that he had a firm confidence that the Fireflies’ attempts would fail as an effort to wash away the reality of Joel’s actions.</p><p>Yet now, Druckmann has confirmed that it was always the intention for the group’s medical team to be able to create the cure, essentially nuking that talking point. Am I upset that we can now put this obviously desperate theory to bed? No. Do I wish Druckmann would stop giving definitive answers to a story that has thrived in ambiguity and interpretation? Absolutely.</p><p>“Our intent was yes, they could [make a cure],” Druckmann said. “Now, is our science a little shaky that now people are now questioning it? Sure. Our science is a little shaky and people are now questioning it. I can’t say anything. I can say our intent was that they would have made a cure. That makes the most interesting philosophical question for what Joel does.”</p><p>Sure, it’s the most interesting interpretation because it actually interrogates everything you know about Joel based on how he presents. Giving him an out is just refusing to engage with the text. Do you want to debate if the Fireflies were <em>equipped</em> to save the world with a vaccine? That’s an entirely separate discussion from Joel’s motivations. But even so, we don’t need every detail spelt out. Maybe it’s because Druckmann is being constantly interviewed about this series after two games, more remasters than I care to count, and two seasons of television, but the more we talk to this dude (and HBO series showrunner Craig Mazin) and ask him to tell us what it all meant, the less interesting the story can be. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-joel-was-right-hbo-max-finale-1851773550&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-joel-was-right-hbo-max-finale-1851773550">I don’t want to know if Druckmann thinks Joel was right</a></span>. I don’t need the author to tell me what I’m supposed to feel. It’s a major reason why <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661">the show bothers me so much</a></span>, because it loves to tell you what lessons you’re supposed to learn, rather than giving you a second to consider what you feel about it.</p><p>I wish we lived in a world where <em>The Last of Us</em>’ marketing got to be as bold as the games.

                <p>Waiting for your favorite boomer shooter to get a sequel while currently enjoying the latest Doom game? No, it's not 1993, because Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 has been officially revealed, and it looks to deliver on all the fast-paced action, bloody dismemberment, and incredibly mean taunts that fans expect.</p><p dir="ltr">Malum Caedo, the Space Marine who players controlled in the first game, will return for a sequel that promises to visit "never-before-seen locations in the Warhammer 40,000 universe." Alongside returning enemies like Nurglings, newcomers like the Bloodletters and Juggernauts will also be trying their best to turn Caedo into a pile of giblets.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG19wrCGR5g" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rG19wrCGR5g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The trailer presented during Warhammer Skulls 2025 was relatively short but showed off Caedo blasting away a variety of enemies and slicing them to tiny pieces with his chainsword. If it's half as good as the original game, it should be both a worthy homage to classic '90s shooters and a must-play game for the franchise's fans.</p><p dir="ltr">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 is scheduled to arrive in 2026 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, but developer Auroch Digital has something very different to keep fans happy until then.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l-3morfa24" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5l-3morfa24" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Available now, Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun - Words of Vengeance is essentially the 40,000 take on Typing of the Dead. Players have to type out words from the extensive Warhammer 40,000 lore to destroy enemies of the Emperor. The best part is it's completely free, though because of its core gameplay, it's only available on PC.</p><p dir="ltr">For more from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/warhammer-skulls-2025-all-the-game-announcements-and-news/2900-6608/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6608">Warhammer Skulls 2025</a>, check out everything announced during the event, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy-announced-from-rogue-trader-studio/1100-6531733/" data-ref-id="1100-6531733">Dark Heresy</a>.</p>

            <div property="schema:text"><p>The <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/15/six-one-indie-showcase-returns-next-week-with-48-games-including-mouse-pi-for-hire-and">Six One Indie Showcase</a> just wrapped, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/round-up/2025/05/21/every-game-shown-during-todays-six-one-indie-showcase">highlighting more than 40 rad indie games</a> with world premieres, exclusive reveals, and more. It was this year’s best indie game showcase and one of my favorites ever, which is why it’s exciting to see the team behind it announce its new publishing arm: Six One Publishing.</p><p>Coming from the Six One Indie team, Six One Publishing was “created for developers who need an impactful partner to help them cross the finish line.” The team describes itself as an “integrated, indie-first platform” that aims to reimagine what publishing can look like in 2025 and beyond.</p><p>“We’re here to blur the lines,” Six One Publishing creative director Mike Towndrow writes in a press release. “The number of games hitting the market grows by the day, but unfortunately, the people to cover and amplify them seem to dwindle just as fast. Six One Indie has evolved into an ecosystem that can now offer a unique opportunity to get indies in front of players through fresh, unconventional means.”</p><p>Six One Publishing says working with it means “gaining direct access to every part of the Six One ecosystem – from original video content and editorials to our growing slate of indie showcases and creator collabs. By fusing the best parts of publishing, media, and community into one agile framework, we’re rewriting the rulebook to serve developers – not shareholders.”</p><p>Towndrow concludes the press release by stating he believes indies "deserve a major push backed by authenticity, genuine enthusiasm, and a new approach for an unpredictable industry.”</p><p>If you want an idea of the types of indies Six One Indie wants to get eyes on, look no further than <a href="https://gameinformer.com/round-up/2025/05/21/every-game-shown-during-todays-six-one-indie-showcase"><em>Game Informer’s</em> round-up of every game shown during today’s Six One Indie Showcase</a>.&nbsp;</p></div>

From Stranger Things and The Lord of the Rings to Assassin's Creed and Street Fighter, Magic: The Gathering fans have had ample ways to simultaneously celebrate their fandom of both the beloved TCG and other franchises. The Magic: The Gathering – Final Fantasy set is the latest in the long-running TCG's collaborations, and it feels like one of the more popular and anticipated crossovers in recent memory.</p><p>In the lead-up to the Final Fantasy set's June launch, we've seen several reveals of iconic characters like Sephiroth, Lightning, Yuna, Clive, and others from across the entire Final Fantasy series. Today, <em>Game Informer </em>can exclusively reveal three more cards coming to the Final Fantasy set.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Reach the Horizon</strong> features art of the core cast of Final Fantasy VII staring off into the distance, with a quote from Tifa at the bottom. It allows you to search for up to two distinct basic land and/or Town cards and put them into the battlefield. Also from Final Fantasy VII is the <strong>Weapons Vendor</strong>, which lets you draw a card, and at the beginning of your turn, you can pay one Mana, allowing you to attach Equipment to a creature you control. The final card we're able to reveal comes from the original Final Fantasy, <strong>World Map</strong>. When sacrificed, you can search your library for land cards to put into your hand.</p><p><strong>You can see all three of these cards exclusively in the gallery below:</strong></p><p>Magic: The Gathering – Final Fantasy is scheduled to arrive on store shelves on June 13.

And for fans of evil robots, the upcoming 2.5 season will add Ultron to the free-to-play shooter’s ever-growing roster. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195189" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: June 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="212" data-playlist="195189,196742,195579" data-current="195189"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: June 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20647.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p> Quickly after it launched late last year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975?_gl=1*1sws9eb*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcxNjQ3MDYkbzM3NiRnMSR0MTc0NzE2NDg0MiRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975?_gl=1*1sws9eb*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcxNjQ3MDYkbzM3NiRnMSR0MTc0NzE2NDg0MiRqNjAkbDAkaDA."><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span> became a massive hit across console and PC.

And season 2.5 might be the game’s biggest shake-up yet. I’ve got good news for Punisher mains and bad news for Captain America lovers.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250522/40954_1236193.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250522/40954_1236193.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On May 22, NetEase posted a new video</a></span> featuring the developers of <em>Rivals </em>talking about the upcoming season 2.5 patch. The new update is set to arrive on May 30 across all platforms. First, the news you’ll likely care about most if you regularly play <em>Rivals</em>: Who is getting nerfed and buffed?</p><h2 id="h230065"><a id=""></a>All the buffs and nerfs in <em>Rivals </em>season 2.5</h2><p>Both <strong>Groot</strong> and <strong>Captain Americ</strong>a’s survivability will be getting toned down a bit in season 2.5. Meanwhile, <strong>Emma Frost</strong>’s “Diamond Form” will be getting nerfed, too. All members of the <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> and <strong>Namor </strong>are getting a nerf to their team-up abilities. Separately,<strong> Human Torch</strong> is getting a nerf alongside <strong>Iron Fist </strong>and<strong> Psylocke</strong>.</p><p>Meanwhile, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-punisher-marvel-rivals-dps-sorry-nerf-overwatch-ps5-1851740643&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-punisher-marvel-rivals-dps-sorry-nerf-overwatch-ps5-1851740643"><strong>Punisher</strong> (yes!)</a></span>, <strong>Squirrel Girl</strong>, and <strong>Storm </strong>are getting “modest” buffs. Hopefully, that means Punisher’s rifle will actually kill people and not harmlessly bounce off most heroes like a peashooter. <strong>Doctor Strange </strong>and <strong>Magneto </strong>are also getting similar “modest” buffs. </p><p>A bunch of team-up changes are happening in 2.5, including the removal of some popular ones. Goodbye to Iron Man and Hulk’s gamma team-up. Other team-ups being retired: Luna Snow and Jeff, Hawkeye and Black Widow, Punisher and Rocket, and also Venom and Peni. But a ton of new team-ups are coming, including ones for Iron Man and Ultron, Black Widow and Punisher, and Luna Snow and Hawkeye. The wildest new team-up is between Storm and Jeff. You’ll be able to create sharknados when combining their ultimate abilities.</p><p>2.5 is also adding a new map, which seems neat, and Ultron, who will be the game’s first new strategist since Invisible Woman was added back in update season 1. He seems to be a healer who will be able to deal out a ton of damage in addition to delivering a lot of healing. Interestingly, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller/status/1925568333165797807&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller/status/1925568333165797807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NetEase is also planning to add a full-on new mode to <em>Rivals</em></a></span>. You’ll be able to play an autochess-like game inside <em>Marvel Rivals</em> in 2.5 and will command your minions as Ultron. Weird!</p><p>Lastly, a reminder that moving forward and starting in season 3, seasons will only be two months long instead of three, and there won’t be any more .5 mid-season refreshes. <em>Marvel Rivals </em>will also get a new hero every month once this new schedule is in place. That sounds hard to balance to me, but hey, who doesn’t like new toys? </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
