You made it! Congrats!</p>
<p>Of course, we start the year off by looking at the last month of 2025, December. And boy, what a December we had — probably one of the most-stacked we've ever had, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>'s release and a bunch of surprise Nintendo Switch 2 Editions.</p>
<p>Of course, that means the eShop has been pretty busy, with some genuine surprises sneaking in before the Holiday season. So we've voted for the best of the best of the digital-only selection. The reles, as always: our writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop games from December 2025 from titles we've reviewed, and the three games with the highest scores will make the podium.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jvsktu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Alrighty then, let's have a look at the very best of December's eShop releases.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:195306,181925 @ 1767726003 -->
<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>We don't think anyone was expecting the amount of game releases we got in December 2025. Usually, the end of the year is a little quieter, but we were kept rather busy in the run up to Christmas.</p>
<p>Of course, there are two bigger games we haven't had the chance to review yet — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Stardew Valley: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> dropped on Christmas Day in the US, and we're working on covering that very soon. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cast-n-chill-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Cast n Chill</a>, which (now-former) Nintendo Lifer Felix <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/games-of-the-year-2025-nintendo-life-staff-picks">ranks among his favourite games of the year</a>, also slipped through the cracks of a busy festive period.</p>
<p>That leaves us with a total of eight games that scored an 8//10 or above that are eShop exclusives (at the time of writing this). Here's the five that didn't quite make the top in a closely-fought battle of votes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> (NS2) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">8/10</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Red Dead Redemption: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> (NS2) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition">9/10</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/simogo-legacy-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Simogo Legacy Collection</a> (NS1, NS2) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/simogo-legacy-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">9/10</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a> (NS2) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">8/10</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> (NS1, NS2) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-rogue-prince-of-persia">9/10</a></li>
</ul>
<div><div><h2 data-toc="3 to 1" id="top-3">3. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">3rd Place - Marvel Cosmic Invasion (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Trust Tribute Games to give us a near-perfect Marvel beat 'em up in the same vein as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">TMNT: Shredder's Revenge</a>. And that's exactly what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> is — not only a love letter to Marvel's rich comic book history, but a beautiful and excellent arcade side-scroller.</p>
<p>The roster is surprisingly robust and varied here, with every character feeling extremely distinct. And with the tag-team mechanic, you can play through the game multiple times with your favourite pairings and change things up as many times as you want. Add in the unlockable hard mode, and you have your new favourite co-op experience with a friend.</p>
<p>Available on both Switch 1 and 2 — and fantastic on both platforms — we scored the game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/marvel-cosmic-invasion">an 8/10</a>.</p>

</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">2. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">2nd Place - Sonic Racing CrossWorlds -(Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>Surprise! Speeding onto Switch 2 at the end of the 2025, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is <em>finally</em> fully realised on the newer console. Yes, it is getting a full physical later in 2026, but right now, this is a digital-only purchase or upgrade.</p>
<p>Thank goodness for this port, too, as CrossWorlds really struggled on the older hardware. Here, it's beautifully smooth with sharper resolutions and 60fps in both docked and handheld mode; all the other excellent bells and whistles are in tact, meaning this excellent racer can stand alongside Mario Kart World as one of the system's best, at least in the early days.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds scored an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">8/10 from us</a>, and there's more free content and DLC to come in the future.</p>

</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">1. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">1st Place - despelote (Switch 1)</a></h2>
<p>One of 2025's very best games released on other platforms earlier in 2025 — <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/12/nobodys-really-heard-of-it-but-this-is-one-of-my-xbox-games-of-the-year-for-2025">Pure Xbox</a> is among the outlets celebrating it — and it <em>just</em> managed to squeak its way onto Switch in December. And thank goodness, because <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">despelote</a> is a special one, and it barely beat out Sonic to win December's eShop Selects.</p>
<p>This short, sweet game follows Julián as he reflects on the time Ecuador qualified for the 2002 World Cup. This is not a soccer game, though — it's a beautiful narrative tale about Julián's experience growing up amidst this fervour. It's largely flown under the radar, but those who have played it have raved about it. And we're joining the chorus.</p>
<p>despelote scored <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/despelote">a well-deserved 9/10 from us</a> and takes the final eShop Selects trophy of 2025.</p>

<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-december-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <p><span>After a long, eight-year wait, players can finally escape from Tarkov in </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></i><span>. However, reaching the new end-game location, Terminal, is no easy feat, and neither is battling your way through to its conclusion. And now, following complaints from some in the</span><i><span> Escape from Tarkov</span></i><span> community who found escaping too difficult, developer Battlestate Games has decided to make things even harder.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>As part of the long-awaited 1.0.0.2 update on December 1st of last year, Battlestate Games added four unique endings to </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov’s</span></i><span> gruelling 200-ish hour-long campaign. </span><span>Battling through the chaotic wave of AI-controlled enemies is no simple task, especially since you’ve just been stripped of all your gear, </span><span>but things become all the more punishing once you reach Terminal’s final hurdle. And according to </span><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/escape-from-tarkov/terminal-ending-change"><i><span>PCGamesN</span></i></a><span>, after some players said they found it too challenging, the devs decided that it actually still sounded a bit too easy.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>If you’ve yet to complete Terminal for yourself, be warned that we’re about to get into heavy spoiler territory here.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>When </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov’s</span></i><span> full release update dropped, it added a brutal decision that players had to make: a boat had to be taken to reach the titular escape, but it only fit three. The game’s standard player formation is squads of five. Thus, two people had to stay behind, becoming engulfed in a nuclear blast while others sail away to safety (and earning themselves one of </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov’s</span></i><span> “bad” endings).</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Naturally, considering all the work it takes to get to that point, a sizable chunk of the community complained online. </span><a href="https://x.com/Velion/status/2007488455002206273"><span>This included</span></a> <i><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></i><span> streamer Velion, who wrote, “</span><span>I would really like to see this changed where everyone can escape together. Imagine being able to go into terminal and meeting 2 other players who you work together on a hard map and you survive and make it out.” </span><span>Directing his feedback squarely at Battlestate Games, he tagged studio head Nikita Buyanov in his Twitter post.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Buyanov immediately replied by simply stating “its changed already,” which would reasonably lead you to assume that leaving Tarkov with all your buddies is now an option.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Turns out that Buyanov considers himself a comedian, as he actually meant that things have “changed” for the worse. As </span><a href="https://x.com/Pestily/status/2008264876163228137?s=20"><span>other players</span></a><span> online have already pointed out, the number of players who can now escape at the end of Terminal has been whittled down to one.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Of course, you could just play through Terminal by yourself and not have to bother with the hassle of deciding which of you gets to live once it ends, but that feels like it defeats the point. </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></i><span> has always been a game about forging bonds and making friends, and watching them all get consumed by a nuclear blast while you sail off into the sunset, </span><i><span>Titanic-</span></i><span>style, just seems fitting.</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1-reloaded-starts-thursday/</link>
            <guid>1398697</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Activision has announced that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Season 1 Reloaded will begin on Thursday, January 8. The mid-season update comes just over a month after Season 1 began on December 4.</p>



<p>With the start of Season 1 Reloaded, players will get new operators, modes, maps, and more. To celebrate the launch of the first Reloaded of the year, Activision has released a look at the multiplayer maps that will be available for all players.</p>







<p>In total, there are three maps coming—one brand new, one remastered, and one returning. </p>



<p>Starting with the brand-new map, Yakei is a small 6v6/2v2 map that sits “High above the neon-soaked streets, the rooftops of a dense Japanese city become the stage for betrayal.” Players will have to “navigate a labyrinth of ducts, vents, and industrial structures under an eerie night glow, where vertical combat and relentless pursuit turn every ledge into a fight for survival.”</p>



<p>The remastered map is Meltdown. Originally from Black Ops 2, Meltdown is a medium-sized 6v6 map that has a “classic three-lane design” through a nuclear power plant. </p>



<p>Lastly, Fringe is a returning 6v6 map from Black Ops 6. </p>



<p>What do you think of the maps coming in Black Ops 7 Season 1 Reloaded? Leave your thoughts in the comments below, and stay tuned for full update details when they are announced closer to launch.</p>

                <p>If you're working your way through Stella Montis, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>' first post-launch map, you may have the Snap and Salvage quest. This multi-step quest requires you to find multiple spots of interaction, as well as recover some specific pieces of loot. It can take some time to figure all of this out on your own, so we've put together a step-by-step process to get you through it.</p><p>Note that each part of this quest can be completed across multiple runs, so there's no need to wrap it all up in a single raid. That being said, you'll need to extract with the Magnetron and Flow Controller items once you find them, so it's probably best to bring in an augment that has a safe pocket or two to ensure you don't accidentally lose these precious items if you find them during your raid.</p><p>Here's how to complete Snap and Salvage in Arc Raiders.</p><h2 id="Where_to_find_the_rovers_in_the_Sandbox_and_how_to_take_a_photo_of_them">Where to find the rovers in the Sandbox and how to take a photo of them</h2><p>To take a photo of the rovers in the Sandbox, you'll need to make your way to (surprise!) the Sandbox POI on the bottom layer of the map. This location is found in the center of the map and is easy to access, but it's worth noting that it's a fairly exposed area. As such, try to get in and get out while staying on the lookout for other raiders.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602594-19a8393c96d86-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602594" data-ratio="0.56306760847629" data-width="1982" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602594-19a8393c96d86-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602594"></a><figcaption>Here's where to find the rovers.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602594-19a8393c96d86-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>Once you reach the lower area in the Sandbox where there is a lot of sand (surprise again!), you'll spot some rovers in plain sight.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602595-19a8393d6e048-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602595" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602595-19a8393d6e048-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602595"></a><figcaption>Take a photo of a rover to complete this part of the quest.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602595-19a8393d6e048-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>Once you arrive, you can simply walk up to a rover to get a yellow prompt allowing you to photograph it.

We didn't have too much trouble finding these items while looting randomly throughout the map during our first few runs. Hopefully, they have a relatively high spawn rate so that you, too, can get your Snap and Salvage quest finished up.</p><p>Just remember to toss these items into a safe pocket in case things get hairy, then head back to Speranza at the nearest extraction point when you're ready to get out. We'd hate to see you put in all that time for nothing, raider.</p><p>For more on, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

                <p>This year marks the 15th anniversary of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-new-vegas/" data-ref-id="5000-42960">Fallout: New Vegas</a>, the beloved spin-off that was developed by Obsidian Entertainment. Bethesda hasn't entrusted the franchise to many other developers, and according to studio boss Todd Howard, Obsidian was the only choice to take on New Vegas.</p><p>"They were the only choice," Howard told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/12/16/crawl-out-through-the-fallout" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/todd-howard-says-obsidian-was-the-only-choice-for-fallout-new-vegas-aside-from-the-studios-fallout-dna-devs-did-something-similar-with-star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>). "They had done something similar with [Star Wars] Knights of the Old Republic 2, and we knew them really well. We knew we were going onto Skyrim, the franchise was back, but we knew there was going to be a long break until Fallout 4--how can we keep this going?"</p><p>Obsidian was founded by ex-Interplay and Black Isle Studios devs who previously worked on the original Fallout as well as a canceled version of Fallout 3. That made the studio a natural home for New Vegas. Howard also said that the only note Bethesda had ahead of development was to focus on the game's warring factions and the players' ability to choose between them.</p><p>"The thing that made New Vegas special was the ferocious focus on choice-and-consequence gameplay," added John Gonzalez, the lead creative designer for New Vegas. "It's all about allowing the player to have tremendous amounts of narrative impact, narrative control."</p><p>Celebrity gamer--and the voice of New Vegas' ghoul mechanic, Raul Alfonso Tejada--Danny Trejo recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/danny-trejo-wants-a-fallout-new-vegas-remaster-and-wants-it-now/1100-6535647/" data-ref-id="1100-6535647">demanded a New Vegas remaster</a>.

And that's only for PC users.</p><p>Howard has remained elusive about the status of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Fallout 5</a>, which isn't expected to arrive until well after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Back in December 2025, before <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/ces/"><strong>CES 2026</strong> really kicked off</a>, ASUS invited Wccftech and other members of the press to downtown Toronto for a sneak preview at what ASUS would be bringing to the coming show in Las Vegas. It was an afternoon packed with information and a look at ASUS's lineup of 2026 products, and as you might imagine, there were more than a few intriguing devices shown off.</p>



<p>That said, everything that was in the showroom that day and all of the tech that is currently descending on Las Vegas comes with a cloud hanging over it: <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/memory-crisis/"><strong>memory shortages</strong></a>. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-to-bring-back-geforce-rtx-3060-q1-2026-tackle-memory-shortages/">shortage is threatening</a> (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/">in some ways, already succeeding</a>) to send the entire tech world into disarray, which honestly makes it difficult to get excited about anything coming from ASUS or any other tech hardware manufacturer.</p>



<p>Even with the gloomy realities of the world creeping around every new device that was shown off, I was still able to find a few items that stood out to me as what to look forward to, and what might actually be worth saving up for, if you're in the market for some of the latest and greatest tech.</p>



<p>I also got the chance to speak with <strong>Sascha Krohn, </strong>global director of technical marketing at ASUS, about the company's 2026 lineup and what it's bringing to CES. <a href="https://wccftech.com/talking-with-asus-ahead-of-ces-2026-everybodys-going-to-have-to-increase-prices-interview/">You can check out that interview here</a>.</p>



<p>Some housekeeping, these picks are just what stood out to me based on their specs, what actually seems exciting about the device, and how I'd be interested in using it. I only got to spend an afternoon getting up close and personal with these devices, and I'm not at CES 2026 personally, so these won't be hands-on impressions. We're sure to learn more about these devices as CES 2026 kicks off, so <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/ces/">check out our full coverage of the showcase here for more</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-rog-g1000-the-outrageous">ROG G1000 - The Outrageous</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ROG-G1000-ASUS-CES-2026-Preview-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The ROG G1000 at the ASUS CES 2026 Toronto Preview.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>There are always a few products that make their way to CES that aren't ever going to make it to consumers, and are just expensive showpieces for the show floor. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-g1000-flagship-rog-gaming-desktop-anime-holo-holographic-fans-420mm-aio/"><strong>ASUS ROG G1000</strong></a> straddles the line between a product that's actually going to be available to consumers and something that is better suited as a showpiece for CES.</p>



<p>It's that duality that makes it an impressive machine that can be easy to get excited for, with holographic fans and three-zone cooling. The fact that the chassis is so big, you can fit practically any component you want in there, not to mention ASUS's mandate that only the top-of-the-line hardware gets anywhere close to meeting this tower's standards.</p>



<p>After all, what else would you expect from the flagship ROG desktop in ASUS's 2026 lineup? But unless you have the storage space and, more importantly, the wallet space, the G1000 might as well be one of those impossible products you see at CES that you know you'd never actually get to try unless you were on the show floor. </p>



<p>It's cool and exciting to have a holographic fan and to see an LED show on steroids going on in your PC at all times, but with the price of all tech products in fluctuation, the G1000 may live up to its "<em>Built to be Seen</em>" tagline more than ASUS would like, as all we can do is 'see' it through our own computer screens without a hope of actually getting to see one at our desks while playing the latest release at max settings.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ROG-Zephyrus-G16-ASUS-CES-2026-Preview-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>ROG Zephyrus G16 2026 at the ASUS CES 2026 Toronto preview.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This entry comes with a fair share of bias, because I bought an ROG Zephyrus G15 laptop back in 2021, and it's been an incredible piece of kit for me since day one. It's easy for me to get excited about the ROG Zephyrus G16 because it's a better version of a laptop I already love, so take my recommendation of it with that in mind.</p>



<p>As someone who has been working and gaming on an older model in the Zephyrus line of laptops, what stands out to me about the 2026 G16 is how ASUS redesigned the cooling structure for the device, as I've found my current model to run hotter than I'd like while gaming. That's a personal highlight based on my own experience with my older laptop, but the undeniable highlight of the 2026 G16 model is its Nebula HDR OLED display panel.</p>



<p>At 2560x1600 and 240Hz, and up to 1000 Nits, this will undoubtedly be one of the best displays on a laptop this year. It'll be so crisp it might actually distract you long enough that you forget about the memory shortages for a few fleeting moments.</p>

<p>I know devices like the Zephyrus Duo and Zenbook Duo aren't anything brand new. It's not exactly innovative to be putting out yet another version of a device we've already seen before. But to me, if the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-g16-g14-laptops-next-gen-intel-amd-upgrades-dual-3k-oled-stunning-designs/">ROG Zephyrus Duo 2026</a></strong> ended up becoming the best dual-screen laptop so far, that would be innovative enough, because I truly believe dual-screen laptops are the future of laptops overall.</p>



<p>I don't think we'll be abandoning the kinds of laptops we've all been used to for decades, but I do see Duo laptops becoming the 'everything device' for the next generation. It's a tablet when you want it to be, without losing any of the features you get from a full laptop. You can fold it any which way you need whether you're relaxing by watching something online or if you're making a presentation to a group of people. </p>



<p>It's got two standout Nebula HDR OLED displays, all the ports you'd want with little need for any adaptor dongles, and it's got power to spare, especially if you get the model that is spec'd out below with an RTX 5090 and Intel's latest Panther Lake CPUs.</p>



<p>I don't necessarily need a new laptop, but if I did, the Zephryus Duo is what I would try to save my pennies for.</p>

<p>Lastly, the ASUS ROG Flow Z13 Kojima Productions collaboration stood out because it is just plain cool. Yes, it is last year's ROG Flow Z13; the hardware inside isn't anything new, but even with that in mind, it's tough to say 'no' to a laptop designed by Yoji Shinkawa and Hideo Kojima. </p>



<p>The hardware won't take you as far as even some of ASUS's more budget-friendly laptops from its <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-zenbook-a16-fastest-qualcomms-snapdragon-x2-laptop-proart-pz14-zenbook-a14-vivobook-s16-unveiled/">Vivobook</a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-amd-ryzen-ai-max-ryzen-ai-400-mainstream-tuf-gaming-a14-laptops/">TUF Gaming </a>lines will, but those don't come with Yoji Shinkawa's brush stroke.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I don’t pay much attention to Logan Paul, the content creator turned wrestler with side hustles that involve turning </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-paul-most-valuable-pokemon-card-auction-2000656107"><span>into heartless cash grabs</span></a><span> and a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/youtube-logan-paul-cryptozoo-nft-game-refund-lawsuit-1851143787"><span>failed NFT game</span></a><span>. But the social media persona entered my field of view last night after making </span><a href="https://x.com/LoganPaul/status/2008546103965479046"><span>a now viral post</span></a><span> pitching his idea for a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><span>new </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game</span></a><span>. Well, “new” is a stretch, considering what he’s asking for is essentially another fucking remake of the original </span><i><span>Pokémon Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span> games. But having been in the series’ vicinity for almost 30 years, I know that this is the type of artless pitch lapsed and casual </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans would happily gobble down like Moomoo Milk.</span></p> <p><span>Pushing aside with all our might that this reads like a pitch to Game Freak that was probably written by ChatGPT (“nostalgic equity” is a phrase no human has ever said), let’s look at what Paul is actually asking for.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Idea for The Pokémon Company:</p> <p>I think there is a MASSIVE opportunity to capitalize on the decades of nostalgic equity that fans have with the franchise</p> <p>The same frenzy that originally propelled Pokémon into mainstream culture lives within millions of adults that yearn for the…</p> <p>— Logan Paul (@LoganPaul) <a href="https://twitter.com/LoganPaul/status/2008279181080109173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>He says that The Pokémon Company has a “massive opportunity” to bank on nostalgia, as if Pikachu and friends have ever not taken the opportunity to shove the original Kanto starters into something over the past 30 years. He also mentions how, every few years, he’ll boot up the original games on a Game Boy to find “just as much joy” playing back through them as he had as a child.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>He then admits he doesn’t have “much of a connection” to newer Pokémon, which is where he begins to give the game away. He does like Annihilape and Baxcalibur, suggesting he’s not completely out of the loop. But since he doesn’t really seem to care about anything Pokémon has done in the last 27 years, he argues it would be cool for Game Freak to create “remastered” versions of the Generation I Game Boy games, with “adaptive NPCs that evolve alongside the player.”</span></p>

 <p><span>He says they could even use modern technology to let players connect to the internet for trading and battling, something Pokémon has literally been doing for 20 years, ever since </span><i><span>Diamond</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pearl </span></i><span>on the DS. He goes on:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>This will do three things</span></p> <p><span>1.) Give older fans a chance to relive their childhood thus awakening a massive, dormant demographic&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>2.) Give newer, younger fans a taste of what originally made the franchise so special</span></p> <p><span>3.) Bridge the gap for older fans who don’t connect with newer Pokémon in a way that’s familiar to them</span></p> <p><span>If we believe that video game cycles are like a pendulum, the near-future of gaming may birth a desire for more simplified, block-based aesthetics. We already see it happening with games like Minecraft &amp; Roblox. As technology continues to advance at an alarmingly rapid pace, I personally believe the future will lean towards “retro”</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>This LinkedIn-ass post tries to intellectualize what is obvious nostalgia-pining as some kind of market inevitability; that it would just be good business sense for </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>to go back to Kanto for the people who only played those original games decades ago, outgrew them, and now think the problem is that the all-ages franchise has fallen “behind the times.” Also, crucially, Game Freak already remade those original games twice with </span><i><span>FireRed</span></i><span>/</span><i><span>LeafGreen </span></i><span>and the </span><i><span>Let’s Go </span></i><span>games on Switch, the latter of which are only seven years old.</span></p>

 <p><span>Yes, the original </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>are still the best-selling games in the franchise, and maybe some people are too young to realize that the level of Pokémania back then was far beyond the still massive success </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>enjoys right now. To insinuate that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is in danger of getting away from its base of ‘90s kids, though, is like saying the sun isn’t shining because you’re inside and can’t feel its warmth. But this is the sentiment of a lot of retired Pokémon trainers who stopped playing in elementary school and mistake their own lack of interest for the series no longer having the sauce.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s the same mentality that makes people mad that </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet </span></i><span>have “regular animals” in them like Flamigo when </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>had Seel, or who didn’t like that Gen V and VI had Pokémon made of “objects” when Grimer and Voltorb were literal sludge and a living Poké Ball. </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>made me feel something specific as a child, and now that I’m an adult and my brain has developed differently, I don’t feel that way anymore. Instead of the realities of adulthood crushing my spirit, it must be because the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games don’t have Professor Oak and Misty in them all the time.</span></p>

 <p><span>If all you’re looking at is video game sales numbers, you probably could foolishly think </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is “struggling” in the market compared to what it hit in the ‘90s, despite the absolute trashfire that was </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span> still readily selling around 27 million copies, a number any other company would kill to hit. But </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is a lifestyle brand that makes most of its money from </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pokemon-has-become-the-highest-grossing-media-franchise-of-all-time/"><span>merchandise sales</span></a><span>, and you would think someone who played a major role in inflating the value of the trading cards would know that.</span></p>

 <p><span>Honestly, if people like Paul want something that feels just like the old games did when they were five, try a ROM hack. Fans have been making retro-style </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games for decades. They’re not only great, they’ll probably also make you feel cozy-wozy with their pixelated graphics that look like what you played on your Game Boy. And hey, you can probably find plenty that don’t include all the hundreds of new Pokémon you don’t like, but which millions of younger players grew up on and hold as dear as old-timers do Pikachu or Charmander.</span></p> <p><span>This yearning for the mines of Kanto exists around the periphery of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>every day, and it’s only going to ratchet up more this year with the series’ 30th anniversary celebrations <a href="https://x.com/pokemon_cojp/status/2006379822012911872?s=46&amp;t=ELmQU9gVKk7kgACkfTFs1Q">already paying tribute to those old games</a>. ROM hacks, mock-ups from people who don’t even like the games anymore, and even fan art are constantly gesturing at the series’ old aesthetics. I still have my original copy of </span><i><span>Pokémon Yellow </span></i><span>sitting on my shelf to this day, and maybe if Game Freak releases those old games on Switch this year, I’ll play it again.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But I don’t need The Pokémon Company to keep looking back. And the company certainly doesn’t need to tap into a “massive,” untapped well of fair-weather fans who will come back to the franchise for good if they remake </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>again. I think it’ll live.</span></p>

<p>Dead by Daylight has announced its second collaboration with Stranger Things, with Chapter 2 arriving on January 27, 2026. </p>



<p>Behaviour Interactive’s popular co-op survival horror title, Dead by Daylight, is known to introduce collaborations with other franchises frequently. <span>Last year, we saw collabs with the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-the-walking-dead-crossover-confirmed-reveal-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Walking Dead</a> and Dead by Daylight&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-announces-dead-by-daylight-collaboration/" target="_blank">enter</a> th</span>e world of Assassin’s Creed. Now, they have introduced a second collab with Stranger Things as the Netflix series comes to a close. </p>



<h2 id="h-dead-by-daylight-x-stranger-things-introduces-vecna-eleven-and-dustin">Dead by Daylight x Stranger Things Introduces Vecna, Eleven, and Dustin</h2>



<p>The new Stranger Things collab introduces the series’ most popular villain, Vecna (The First), as a New Killer. Vecna has two special abilities: Vine Attack, which creates a small area of effect on the ground, and The Upside Down &amp; Undergate, which allows the Killer to enter the Upside Down and navigate the map quickly and then return to the map with an Undergate attack. The character also comes with three new Killer Perks: Turn Back the Clock, Secret Project, and Hex: Hive Mind. </p>



<p>Then we have the two new Survivors, Eleven and Dustin. Dustin comes with three new perks: Bada Bada Boom, which allows him to trap a window for 40/50/60 seconds, Change of Plans, which enables him to transform a toolbox into a Med-kit, and Teamwork: Full Circuit, which allows him to repair faster and increase the size of the Good Skill Check zone. </p>



<p>Eleven also comes with three new perks in the Dead by Daylight x Stranger Things collab. The first is Extrasensory Perception, which enables Eleven to see auras in an expanding radius and use Elusive and Obvious. Second is We See You, which provides the character with one token when the Killer reveals their aura. Last is Teamwork: Soft-Spoken, which also helps repair faster and reduces generator repair noise.</p>



<p>Lastly, a new feature called Visual Terror Radius has been added, which animates the heart to match 3D heart behaviour and has its own Lullaby version. There are a lot more new additions which you can check out below: </p>

<h4><strong>New Killer – The First</strong></h4>



<p><strong>SPECIAL ABILITY: VINE ATTACK</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Press and hold the Power button to charge a Vine Attack. When charged, press the Attack button to activate it, creating a small area of effect on the ground.</li>



<li>Any Survivors caught within the area of the Vine Attack earn a Worldbreaker token.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Killer can enter The Upside Down to navigate the map quickly by tapping the Ability button.

Survivors caught within its radius gain 2 Worldbreaker tokens.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>SPECIAL CONDITION / ITEM: WORLDBREAKER &amp; GRANDFATHER CLOCKS</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Once a Survivor has gained enough tokens, Worldbreaker activates, and the Worldbreaker Timer begins. While Worldbreaker is active, both the Vine Attack and<br>Undergate&nbsp;attacks&nbsp;do&nbsp;damage&nbsp;to&nbsp;Survivors&nbsp;instead&nbsp;of&nbsp;adding&nbsp;Worldbreaker&nbsp;tokens,&nbsp;and 4 Grandfather Clocks activate.</li>

            <title><![CDATA[Friendship Ended With Terrace House, Love Village Is My New Favorite Dating Show]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/love-village-terrace-house-netflix-japanese-dating-show/</link>
            <guid>1398658</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Last year, I lamented over how I’ve spent the worst part of five years searching for a dating show to fill the void left in the controversial wake of <a href="https://aftermath.site/terrace-houses-omurice-incident-japanese-reality-tv/"><em><u>Terrace House</u></em></a>. While Netflix is certainly not lacking for options, with many of them being derivatives of <em>Terrace House</em>’s formula, <em>Love Village</em> utilizes its inspiration’s pressure cooker environment for romance in a way that doesn’t just tug on heartstrings, it pulls the loose thread into a crumbling heap of wholesomeness.</p><p>On the surface, <em>Love Village</em> isn’t dissimilar from other dating shows of its ilk, where viewers watch a group of eligible guys and gals live in a secluded environment and await love to sprout. While <em>Love Village</em> has much of the same scaffolding as other shows, its foundation isn’t built on young, dumb, and full of cum 20-somethings inflating their social media followings by participating in a reality show, regardless of whether their romances are the genuine article or fair-weather flings for television. <em>Love Village</em> is expressly about older Japanese singles rehabilitating an old country house they’re cohabitating in as they search for the “last love of their lives.”</p><p>When I say old, I’m talking about an age range from late 30s to early 60s. <em>Love Village</em> houses a group of men and women who have never married, are divorced, or are single parents, all with humble jobs such as carpenters, doctors, baristas, illustrators, business managers, and therapists. This less hip congregation of old fogies are either settled in their ways (to their detriment or otherwise), knowing what they’re about and what they want from a relationship, or are struggling to overcome decades-long reservations about getting into a relationship, whether due to ageism, a past partner’s infidelity, bad luck when the person they’re interested in falls for someone else, or a belief that they’re not meant to find love in the first place. Regardless, they’ve all joined <em>Love Village</em> to put themselves out there.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bd2C61BeIQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Love Village | Official Teaser | Netflix"></iframe></figure><p>One of the reasons I blitzed through <em>Love Village</em>’s first season over the holiday break is its music accompaniment. Its theme song is freaking Backstreet Boys’ “Everybody (Backstreet's Back)”—a song choice that bamboozled the hell out of me when I booted up the show and delighted me to no end when the show doubled down by having “I Want It That Way” be an insert song. There are levels to Japanese dating shows, and <em>Love Village</em> is shoulders above its contemporaries.</p><p>While the inspired choice of making Backstreet Boys the theme song for<em> Love Village</em> brought me to the dance, what kept me watching was that it felt more patently honest and down-to-earth than your garden-variety Japanese dating show.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>Netflix</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Some of that has to do with the way the show’s participants confess their love. You see, atop a hill behind their shared house is a bell. Once one of the members feels ready to confess their love to a housemate, they sneak off and ring the bell. What follows is the spitting image of what happens in shojo manga: a high schooler meets their would-be partner and confesses their feelings.&nbsp; But confessing in <em>Love Village</em>, as in real life, comes at a huge gamble: Regardless of how the confession goes, the person who confesses must leave <em>Love Village</em>. But if their confession rings true to the confessee, they will leave together as a couple.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>Netflix</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Upon hearing the bell ring, everyone must line up outside the house as the confessor approaches the confessee. Then the pair spends some time chatting privately. Afterwards, the confessee has 24 hours to mull over the confession. All the while, no one in the house can discuss the matter. The following day, everyone lines up again as the confessor publicly declares their love, and the confesse either accepts or declines. Either way, there’s not a dry eye in <em>Love Village</em>, its commentary panel, or in my humble abode.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><p>It also doesn’t hurt that the backstories of <em>Love Village</em> housemates are showcased in hand-illustrated manga-style sequences narrated by them. Plus, its commentary reaction panel isn’t overcrowded, with just two hosts who have pretty great chemistry. They aren’t overbearing, and their interjections aren’t so frequent to cause an irritating syncopation between the developments at <em>Love Village</em> and its studio audience's reactions. That might not sound like much, but that’s a huge plus for these types of shows, especially when they’re editing out the boring parts and teasing developments-to-come in future 30-minute episodes, in contrast to hour-long drama-farming shows where nothing of note happens unless manufactured by the production crew.&nbsp;</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p><span>Netflix</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>In another show, even a glimpse of its production crew would be proof that it was an amateur dating show. But if anything, witnessing the black shirts of<em> Love Village</em>’s camera crew catch developments in real time, such as a person smirking at a crew member before sneaking off to ring the bell, adds to the show’s transparent nature. Older folks, just like younguns, can’t hide it when they’re giddily in love, and having the crew excitedly scramble to capture moments as they happen, grabbing at their earpieces to let their coworkers know “It’s happening!,” is cute shit every time.</p><p>In the span of <em>Love Village</em> episodes I’ve watched, I’ve witnessed both successful and failed confessions, tearful farewells, and meetcutes with new, slightly younger, and physically fit arrivals, followed by waves of regret from older housemates who question whether the cards were stacked too much against them. But what gets me every time about the show is that it feels special seeing these old folks rehabilitate the house. Knowing that some successful couples left evidence of their romance in the foundation of <em>Love Village</em> by writing their names and a heart on the deepest bricks of a fire pit in Sharpie is one of many reasons this show operates on a different level. </p><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even if romances don’t pan out, having tactile proof of the folks who once walked <em>Love Village</em>’s grounds, be it by replacing the floorboards, adding window screens, or erecting a fire pit for barbecues, is a tactile reminder of their impact on the show and encourages members to continue to fight the good fight. They’re doing so not just to improve the day-to-day lives of their housemates but for those who come after them in search of love. So, even if they have to leave alone or with the person they love, they leave little pieces of themselves in the refurbished old house that new members can enjoy.&nbsp;</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/terrace-houses-omurice-incident-japanese-reality-tv/"><div><p>Terrace House’s Omurice Incident Is Still An All-Time Reality TV Moment</p><p>The quickest way to push past a man’s bullshit is straight through his stomach</p><p><span>Isaiah Colbert</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roblox-fall-guys-speedrun-world-record-fraud-2000657154</link>
            <guid>1398622</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A player who goes by Quinten was on their way to securing a <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-new-york-times-interview-baszucki-2000646174">Guinness World Record in Roblox</a> when they were beat out at the last moment by multiple speedruns that were so good, they seemed humanly impossible. A lesser player might have gone back to gambling on the Roblox ponies, but Quinten instead set out to prove that the new records were bogus. It worked.</p> <p>As <em><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/roblox/guiness-world-record-cheat">PCGamesN</a></em><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/roblox/guiness-world-record-cheat"> reports,</a>&nbsp;Quinten was competing for the world record in a Roblox game called <em>Ultimate Easy Obby</em> that has <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/10760024537/Ultimate-Easy-Obby">over 100,000 reviews</a>. It’s a zany, single-player obstacle course similar to something you might find in <a href="https://kotaku.com/there-s-a-new-type-of-fall-guys-jackass-1846537028"><em>Fall Guys</em></a> and was published by Roblox in partnership with the Guinness World Record company. Last month, Quinten secured a time of 05:48:96 following an “insane back-and-forth battle” with another Roblox speedrunner. It was the result of tons of time spent “optimizing every corner and jump,” the 18-year-old Belgian wrote on Reddit.</p>

 <p>But then something bizarre happened. Quinten’s speedrun record was quickly beaten by three other random Roblox accounts. And not just by a little bit but six whole seconds. “For context: a 6-second gap on a speedrun this optimized is physically impossible,” they wrote. “It was heartbreaking to see a week of grinding ruined by scripts.” Undeterred, Quinten decided to speedrun an investigation into the mysterious rivals to find proof of the suspected cheating.</p>

  <p>This evidence fell into three main buckets. The first was bogus time stamps. <em>Ultimate Easy Obby</em> features a linear obstacle course consisting of 50 stages, but some of the mystery accounts’ timestamps were out of order. The new world record holder was also missing a “digital receipt” of ever having actually completed the race. “This proved he never actually touched the finish line trigger; he likely teleported a coordinate script to the end-game lobby, bypassing the verification check,” Quinten wrote.</p>

 <p>But the real nail in the coffin was painstaking frame-by-frame analysis of Quinten’s own best recorded time to show that shaving six seconds off it would be impossible. “I took my best run and calculated the theoretical maximum time save possible (perfect pixels, zero drag),” they wrote. “Even with a TAS (Tool-Assisted Speedrun) level of perfection, the times the cheaters posted were mathematically impossible within the game’s physics engine.”</p>

 <p>Surprisingly, it all worked. The evidence was submitted to Guinness which then went back, reviewed the records, and re-validated Quinten’s as the true World Record. “It felt amazing to successfully lobby a major organization to reverse verified records based on user-submitted digital forensics,” they wrote. The king of <em>Ultimate Easy Obby&nbsp;</em>can once again rest easy knowing at least one more small sliver of fraud has been carved out of Roblox.</p>

<p>That gives those individual pixels time to fully transition from one color to the next before they’re illuminated, meaning viewers don’t perceive those pixels fading from one color as they do on a traditional G-Sync monitor. It also means those old pixels don’t persist as long on the viewer’s retina, increasing the “apparent refresh rate” above the monitor’s actual refresh rate, according to Nvidia.</p>

<p>Similar “Ultra Low Motion Blur” features on other pulsing backlight monitors <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/g-sync-ultra-low-motion-blur-2/">have existed for a while</a>, but they only worked at fixed refresh rates. Pulsar monitors differentiate themselves by syncing the pulses with the variable refresh rate of a G-Sync monitor, offering what Nvidia calls a combination of “tear free frames and incredible motion clarity.”</p>
<p>Independent testers have had more varied impressions of the visual impact of the Pulsar. The Monitors Unboxed YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXwXGYhi8_I">called it</a> “clearly the best solution currently available” for limiting motion blur and “the first version of this technology that I would genuinely consider using on a regular basis.” PC Magazine, on the other hand, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidias-g-sync-pulsar-hopes-to-banish-a-form-of-motion-blur-thats-plague-pc-gaming-for-years/">said</a> the Pulsar improvements are “minor in the grand scheme of things” and would be hard to notice for a casual viewer.</p>

                <p>Highlighting an ongoing trend, the most popular games on PlayStation and Xbox are multiplayer, online, live-service titles that aren't necessarily "new," at least not in the traditional sense.</p><p>Circana's Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mbraw2dcfc2s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> that 2025's top five most-played games for PlayStation and Xbox in the US were the same as 2024's, and in the case of PS5, the ranking was exactly the same.</p><p>On PS5, the top five most-played games in the US were Fortnite, Call of Duty, GTA V, Roblox, and Minecraft, ranked in that order. That was the same as 2024, according to Circana's Player Engagement Tracker, which is ranked by an "active panel" of players.</p><p>On Xbox, the top five most-played games for 2025 in the US in order were Fortnite, Call of Duty, GTA V, Minecraft, and Roblox. For 2024, the ranking went Call of Duty, Fortnite, Minecraft, GTA V, and then Roblox.</p><p>Call of Duty's inclusion in the ranking is buoyed by the fact that multiple games are lumped into one single launcher. Currently, the launcher--COD HQ--includes the newest game, Black Ops 7, as well as last year's Black Ops 6, along with the free-to-play juggernaut Call of Duty: Warzone.</p><p>Piscatella said the takeaway here is that, "Things are a bit established at the top."</p><p>This report followed on from a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/60-of-all-playtime-in-2023-was-spent-on-live-service-games-more-than-six-years-old/1100-6522366/" data-ref-id="1100-6522366">Newzoo study from 2024</a> that showed how 60% of playtime in games for games in 2023 were attributable to games more than five years old, including Fortnite, GTA V, Call of Duty, Roblox, and Minecraft.</p><p>Some have referred to these titles as "black hole" games because they suck up time, attention, and money to a significant degree, making it challenging for newcomers to find success.</p><p>Games like Fortnite, Minecraft, and Roblox may not be "new," but they are live-service games that receive new content on a regular basis, creating opportunities for people to keep coming back to play and spend money.

            <p>The Duffer brothers, creators of Stranger Things, have said the final battle of the TV series was partially inspired by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. Matt Duffer was apparently playing the game while devising the showdown.</p>
<p>Note: there are spoilers for the final battle ahead.</p>
<p>"We were thinking about D&amp;D and I was playing Baldur's Gate 3 at the time," <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-is-eleven-alive-vecna-killed-rock-spinoff-1236621528/">Duffer told Variety</a>, "and we felt it was very important that the only way for them to defeat [the mind flayer] was for the entire party to work together. Everyone had fully realised — either through self-acceptance or they've resolved all their various issues — moving into that final battle, they're absolutely primed. They're the ultimate team, and it's the party working all together to defeat this thing.</p>
<p>"And they each have their own individual skills, right? And that's where I go back to Dungeons &amp; Dragons and something like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a>. Because that's how you take down these monsters that seem otherwise unstoppable. Lots of video game references were applied to that final battle."</p><p>The final battle of Stranger Things pits nearly the entire cast of goodies against a colossal spidery crab monster in the wasteland of Dimension X. This is the physical manifestation of the shadowy mind flayer we see repeatedly through the series, and which Henry Creel, AKA Vecna, partners with - he takes up residence literally inside the beast.</p>
<p>Links to Baldur's Gate 3 are to be expected of course, with both entertainment properties being heavily rooted in, or based upon, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and both revolving around a mind flayer plot. In Stranger Things it's more euphemistic, however, used as a kind of lingo the central characters - the kids - apply to strange enemies they face. In BG3 you face an actual mind flayer threat, coincidentally also having to destroy the mega-mind controlling it (which isn't a giant spidery crab).</p>
<p>Whether Matt Duffer played Baldur's Gate 3 for inspiration or for entertainment purposes is unclear - the interview doesn't touch upon it - but I expect it's a bit of both. The Duffer brothers have said before that they aren't, despite appearances, long-serving D&amp;D fans - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXSsXbFfwXU">they didn't grow up playing it</a>. Perhaps BG3 was a more approachable way into learning the game.</p>
<p>Matt Duffer also didn't clarify which other video game references were in the final Stranger Things battle, though if you ask me, that mind flayer spider crab thing looks a lot like a corpser from the Gears of War series. It being a giant enemy crab also brings to mind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-genjidaysofblade-ps3">Sony's infamous 'giant enemy crab' meme from Genji: Days of the Blade</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, on <strong>9th January 2025</strong> (this Friday), <strong>South Park</strong> will enter the fray, though no specific details as to what this might entail have been shared at the time of writing.</p>
<p>All we've got for the time being is a small teaser via social media:</p>

<p>It wouldn't be a new Fortnite drop without a few leaks, mind you, and word on the street is that the content will include skins for Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny, along with items relating to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/south_park_the_stick_of_truth">The Stick of Truth</a>. There may also be some South Park-themed environments, which would honestly be awesome.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see if the leaks are accurate, but we're intrigued to see exactly how this pans out.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jvsktu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

			<p>The air at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/ces/">CES 2026</a></strong> is sure to feel a lot different from that in previous years. <a href="https://wccftech.com/google-sparks-backlash-after-firing-hundreds-of-ai-workers-amid-disputes-over-poor-pay-stressful-work-and-labor-rights/">Not just because of mass layoffs</a>, or the <a href="https://wccftech.com/satya-nadella-admits-transition-into-the-ai-era-could-be-messy-but-does-not-want-microsoft-to-be-left-behind-in-the-tech-race/">continued GenAI/AI push</a> from nearly every major tech company. <a href="https://wccftech.com/wd_black-sn850x-8tb-ssd-heatsink-version-14-percent-off-on-amazon-available-for-829-99/">The memory shortage looms over everything</a>, and its impact will continue to be felt worldwide, with prices likely to rise on all the products showcased in Las Vegas this year. It was pretty much all I could think about back on December 9, 2025, when ASUS invited Wccftech and other members of the media to a preview of what the company would be showing at CES 2026 in downtown Toronto.</p>



<p>There was a lot I got to see that day, and a few things that stood out. If you want to see what those were, <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-rog-ces-2026-preview-the-outrageous-the-respectable-and-the-innovative/">you can check out my highlights round-up here</a>.</p>



<p>It was intriguing to see what ASUS was putting forward for the new year, but it was difficult to look at anything with a significant level of excitement. With the way prices are going, when buying anything from the latest 2026 lineup of tech products, you're either getting burned by overpaying now at launch, or you're burned even more by overpaying later if the shortage issues don't improve soon. Pricing was such a significant factor that when I got the chance to sit down and talk with Sascha Krohn, global director of technical marketing at ASUS, it was the first thing I wanted to address.</p>



<p>This was the second time this year I got to speak with Mr. Krohn, after first meeting him in October ahead of the launch for the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-talks-rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-the-way-forward-for-us/">You can check out that conversation if you like here</a>, and while we did get to the new handheld, and other elements of ASUS's CES 2026 lineup, the company's AI messaging, and more, we began with what was, and what continues to be the topic of the day.</p>



<p><em>Author's Note: This interview was conducted <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-announces-price-hikes-for-certain-product-combinations-starting-5th-january-2026/">before ASUS announced it would be raising the prices on certain products,</a> which is perhaps why Krohn answers the way he does when asked if ASUS will raise prices soon.</em></p>



<p><strong>We're hearing a lot about memory shortages lately. How much is this affecting ASUS on the manufacturing side, and are there certain products where you're feeling the pressure more than others?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sascha Krohn</strong>: <em>Yeah, I don't actually have any detailed insights into how we deal with our suppliers and how we allocate memory, but basically the way it happens is when you plan out a new product, whether it's a laptop or a handheld, you do have a forecast for how many you think you're going to sell over the lifetime of this product and how much per month, and then you do deals with suppliers. 'I'm going to need this many panels in this month and this month and this quarter,' and so on, and you kind of come to an agreement and make a deal about how much memory, how many panels you're going to buy.</em></p>



<p><em>So to some degree, that helps to shield vendors from sudden changes in prices for components, but there's always wiggle room, right? You never know exactly how many you're going to sell, and you usually make like a deal for a certain quantity, but you're probably going to need more, and then you just buy it, make additional deals later. I'm not really an expert in this, so I don't want to go into too much detail, but I do know that we usually make these kinds of plans ahead of time, which kind of shields us to some degree, but yeah, it is going to affect us for sure. And I know that some of our competitors have already announced that they're increasing prices.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ROG-Zephyrus-DUO-2026-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><em>I believe everybody's going to have to increase prices</em></strong>.<em> I think everything that has memory chips in it and flash memory chips in it is going to go up in price to some degree. How much is going to vary, but everything is going to increase in price, like consoles, phones, tablets. I think that's just inevitable, and I think most people haven't realized it because we all saw the news that memory chips went up in price, but then you see, 'oh, but there's still really good deals on laptops and gaming consoles and everything, and it hasn't really changed all that much.' That's because it takes several months until that shockwave travels through the supply chain and hits all the manufacturers and hits all the retailers and e-tailers. So that is probably still going to happen.</em></p>



<p><em>So yeah, I think it's going to affect everyone, but most companies are not talking about it for obvious reasons. I'm actually surprised that some of our competitors went out and announced it. I don't know why they did that.</em></p>



<p><strong>Is ASUS going to announce price increases soon? Are you expecting price changes on GPUs, laptops, or any of your product line?</strong></p>



<p><em>I haven't heard anything about this internally, so that would be something that would be, like, an official statement that travels through the company, and then we hear about it, and then we communicate it. I haven't heard anything about that, but me personally, yes, I do expect that to happen.</em></p>

<p><strong>Have you been given a potential warning from other companies like NVIDIA that prices are going to go up for products that you collaborate on?</strong></p>



<p><em>I haven't heard anything about that, but if that happened, it would not be something that I would hear about right away, so, yeah, I haven't heard anything about that.</em></p>



<p><strong>Okay, but prices will be rising across the board?</strong></p>



<p><em>That's what I personally think. That's not, like, an official company statement, but me personally, yes, based on my experience, you know, in the tech industry and based on what's happening right now, that's what I assume, yeah.</em></p>



<p><strong>Do you think prices will stabilize soon? How long do you think it will take for them to stabilize?</strong></p>



<p><em>I've been telling all my friends all the really good deals that happened lately for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, that's probably the best deals that they'll be able to get for a while. I don't know how long it's going to take. Like, I'm not an expert in this kind of stuff, but I do think it's going to take a while until prices stabilize overall.</em></p>



<p><em>I mean, just like geopolitics, right? The world is overall, you know, going in a certain direction, and, yeah, I expect that prices are going to at least stay elevated.</em></p>



<p><strong>What's 'a while?'</strong></p>



<p><em>I really don't know. I mean, I could only guess, and I don't want to get into trouble for guessing something.</em></p>



<p><strong>How has the launch of the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X been? Are you meeting expectations sales-wise, and can you share a global estimate of how many units of the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X have been sold?</strong></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ROG-Xbox-Ally.Ally-X.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. Image credit: Xbox</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>That's an easy question for me because I don't have sales figures, so I don't know. But I can tell you that the reception has been overwhelmingly positive. People really love the ROG Xbox Ally X in particular, which I expected, and I'm not surprised about it at all. I actually think it was a really good and still is a really good price.</em></p>



<p><em>And I think the ROG Xbox Ally X even sold out in a couple of places, yeah? The demand for the ROG Xbox Ally X is much higher than we as a company anticipated. I personally, from the beginning, was like, this one is going to sell really well because there are a lot of people from the original Ally X who want to upgrade, and they're going to upgrade to the ROG Xbox Ally X.</em></p>



<p><strong>I wanted to ask about this tagline here, 'AI: Always Incredible.' What made you land on this for your new line of AI products?</strong></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ASUS-Always-Incredible.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>Well, 'Incredible' is kind of like a word that our top management likes to use and we've used a lot over the years. We picked that because it's, you know, together, when you use the two letters, it's AI, always incredible. And that's kind of like our strategy for AI. We want to get to the point that no matter what you're doing, whether it's on device or cloud or on the edge, like in between, you have a great AI experience no matter what you're doing.</em></p>



<p><em>And we want to make it as seamless and as convenient as possible. The ultimate goal is very much like our Zen book. The idea is that technology just gets out of the way.</em> <em>There are a lot of concerns about AI and some people are really worried about AI and don't like AI. </em></p>



<p><em>And there's a lot of annoying stuff that is related to AI, but we also see it as a great enabler to make that happen, right? To get technology out of the way. Like this whole thing, I think there's this saying that magic is technology that you don't even notice that you're interacting with</em>,<em> or something like that, you know? And that's kind of, it feels like magic.</em></p>



<p><em>When technology works the way it should, it feels like magic. It just works, and it's seamless. You don't have to think about it, and you don't have to figure out how to do it. You don't have to learn how to tell your technology what you want, but your technology figures out what you want and does what you want. And AI has the biggest potential to make that a reality for a lot of cool features. So we are very excited about that as a company, and we're leaning very heavily into that, into trying to work on as many AI solutions as possible and use AI to make everything as seamless as possible.</em></p>



<p><strong>What do you think people should be taking away from the 2026 lineup of ASUS products? What is the best thing that ASUS is bringing to the market this year?</strong></p>



<p><em>Oof, only one? I would say the ZenBook Duo. I think the ZenBook Duo 2026. I would pick the ZenBook Duo 2026 because it's so refined, it's so much better than the ZenBook Duo 2025, which is an awesome laptop and we're still gonna sell it throughout the whole year. But the 2026 is so much more refined, lighter, longer battery life, more performance, better displays. It's so much easier to set up.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Shot_019_Zenbook_DUO_Theme_Photo_AC_101-group-1-kopie_72dpi-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>You have the two displays so close to each other now. Yeah, I think that's very refined, and it's also very ASUS. I'm a big fan of the ZenBook Duo because I think for us as a company, what separates us from other brands is that we don't have such a big risk aversion.</em></p>



<p><em>We're willing to try out things even if there's a high chance that it's not going to work out. And ZenBook Duo is a perfect example. Every once in a while, or there's a pretty big number, a pretty high percentage, it does work out, and we end up with something really cool, and then we keep refining it, and it ends up being this really unique product, and there's nothing else like it on the market.</em></p>



<p><em>And we kind of created the Duo segment, and we own that segment, and there are other companies trying to enter that segment, and they're failing; it doesn't really work. So I think, yeah, the ZenBook Duo 2026 is like a perfect example of ASUS doing new things, being innovative, refining things and listening to customer feedback and creating products that people want that are maybe not for everyone but there are a lot of people who really want a product like this and they benefit from a product like this and most companies wouldn't do it because it's not something that everybody's going to buy. You're not going to sell the highest number of devices.</em></p>



<p><em>It's not going to be a device like that. So if you only care about profits and you only care about market share, this is not necessarily something you do, but it's something that ASUS does, and I think, yeah, ZenBook Duo 2026.</em></p>



<p><strong>I would definitely agree that there are more than a few products ASUS make that are not things that everyone would do. The G1000, I think, falls into that same category. I heard outside that you can't buy the chassis separately and then build your own PC inside?</strong></p>



<p><em>Yes.</em></p>



<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p><em>Well, the way we created this desktop was, okay, we want to make ready-made gaming desktops that are appealing to people, which is challenging because we are working with some awesome partners who are building systems like that already using our components, because we also have motherboards, VGAs and all these components. You can already build that.</em></p>



<p><em>Either there's a big community of just end users who build those systems themselves, PC DIY, and there are system integrators, great partners we have, that build systems for people who just want to buy a ready-made system. So how do we compete with that? We don't really want to compete with it. We want to add something else to it.</em></p>



<p><em>We want to bring something new to the market that is different, right? So we were thinking about how we can make a ready-made desktop that isn't something that's directly competing with people building their own PC or people buying something from a system integrator. And that's what we came up with. We can do a different kind of case design that has a new way of doing system cooling, a better way of doing system cooling, and we wanted to do something that allows people to customize in a way that isn't possible right now. And that's kind of how we came up with the G1000 with the NME Holo and with the thermal atrium at the top for the all-in-one water cooler for the CPU.</em></p>

<p><em>So that's kind of the whole idea behind it. If we were to sell that as a case, it would kind of defeat the purpose. I'm not saying we would never do it, but I don't think that's the plan right now.</em></p>



<p><strong>For the Zephyrus line, ASUS has two 2026 models. They're both on Intel now and not AMD, save for the third, hybrid 2025-2026 model. Where did the idea for the hybrid come from? Why keep the 2025 chassis and stick with AMD, and what prompted the move to Intel for the other two models?</strong></p>



<p><em>The switch to Intel for 2026, it's basically every time we come up with new devices, we think about 'what's our strategy,' what's our direction, what do we want to do with this device and in which direction do we want to go? Do we want to go for more performance, or longer battery life? What's our strategy? And then we look at our silicon partners, what is their strategy, and what chips do they have available, right? Then, usually, stuff just very naturally evolves in, 'okay, there's going to be a chip that has this certain power envelope and certain performance and battery life focus, and this pretty much aligns with what we want to do for this chassis or for this device.'</em></p>



<p><em>And then we naturally just work together on having this silicon in this kind of device. But there is also a part of just strategy, where you also have to look into what's the supply situation and who's giving us a good deal and who's maybe easy to work with and can guarantee us a certain supply or a certain price point or something like that. It all plays into it together. I think in the end, it was a decision made by both sides that it just makes sense to go for Panzer Lake with G14 and G16.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-Zephyrus-G14-GA403-Scenario-Rendering_01-scaled.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>For the 2025 chassis refresh with an AMD 2026 CPU, I don't know the story behind it, to be honest. I suspect that there was a demand for it, that there was interest from our sales to have that configuration for that price point.</em></p>



<p><em>I know that people are into conspiracy theories, and it's crazy the kind of mind gymnastics some people do to come up with super complex theory to explain something that is pretty straightforward. Most of the time, it is boring, but the pretty straightforward part is: why are we doing something? It's usually because people want to buy it. It's boring, but that's usually the answer.</em></p>



<p><strong>How did the collaboration with Kojima Productions come about? How did that process go, did you work directly with Hideo Kojima and Yoji Shinkawa?</strong></p>



<p><em>I wish I knew more about it, I don't know all the backstory and all the details. Yes we worked on them directly with this, and yes the design is by both Yoji Shinkawa and Hideo Kojima. This is not something we did and proposed, and then they approved it like, 'Yeah this kind of looks like what we do.' This is a design from them and we worked very closely with them, but the exact process...I think that we approached them, but I don't actually know for sure. For these kind of collaborations, it's usually us approaching different artists we would like to collaborate with, and then we see how we could work together.</em></p>

As the Bob Dylan song goes, how many lush alien planets must a Man presumptuously land on and turn into poorly optimised Toyota plants before he finally decides he’s sick of being an extractivist piece of shit? Dylan was being rhetorical, but I studied at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY3fqF6-jyE">the school of Homer Simpson</a>, and want you to give me an actual figure. I’m going to say: four and a half. If you’ve yet to hit your personal quota, well, here’s StarRupture <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1631270/StarRupture/">out now in early access</a>. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/satisfactory">Satisfactory</a> with more of a four-player shoot-me-do element, and scenes from the battlements that recall Michael Ironside’s last stand in Starship Troopers. It’s from the developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/green-hell">Green Hell</a>, of which Nic (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/green-hell-review">wrote the following</a> back in 2019: “most of what held my attention about Green Hell was how dazzlingly beautiful and technically impressive it was, but the more traditional survival elements are all solid enough that I look forward to playing more”. History is silent as to whether Nic did, in fact, play more. That’s the last thing RPS ever published about Green Hell, actually. Ominous.
</p>
<p>
The pitch for StarRupture: you and your scalliwag convict friends have been sent to a strange new world racked by violent changes of temperature. You owe intergalactic society a debt of exotic ore, and naturally, you have a feminine chatbot overseer who is given to snarky corporate slogans. And That’s The Approximately Satirical Sci-Fi Survival Base Builder Guarantee!

Local organisms include many, many skittering bug creatures, who swarm your outposts periodically to have a conversation with your turrets about where best to explode into goo. Fortress aside, you’ll be covering your surroundings with solar panels, conveyor belts and 3D printers. Deeper in, there are narrative mysteries to uncover by, one assumes, going into the caves or ruins or whatever and blasting more/larger insects.
</p><p>
The early access build includes “the majority of gameplay mechanics we’re planning for the full release to be polished and ready to enjoy,” devs Creepy Jar observe, including “an up-to-4-player co-operation mode in which you will be able to build, fight and explore a vast part of our rich open world”. The full release “is planned to contain more biomes, enemies, buildings and mechanics, along with a compelling endgame”.

I realise I sound vaguely like this game ran over my toe while riding one of those heavier, vintage tricycles - the kind with proper metal frames. Some sugar: within its carefully delimited and soulless horizons, this seems promising enough. It makes me want Arrowhead to put base-building in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>. If you’d rather learn the ultimate fate of Green Hell, it’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/815370/Green_Hell/">90% off on Steam</a> at the time of writing.

              <p>While the first two games added to Xbox Game Pass in January might not knock your socks off, it’s what’s coming later this month that should bring some New Year cheer. By January 13, Game Pass subscribers will have access to Ubisoft’s enormously underrated <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, and just a week later the stunning&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village</em> brings our favorite tall lady to the service.</p> <p>Added today, January 6, are drunken twin-stick shooter <em>Brews &amp; Bastards&nbsp;</em>(no, me neither, but I’ll be installing it this evening) and <em>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition.&nbsp;</em>Then as soon as tomorrow, last year’s underdog first-person action game <em>Atomfall</em> will be added to the subscription platform, alongside 2025 roguelite sequel <em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</em>, online multiplayer soccer sim&nbsp;<em>Rematch</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine</em>‘s&nbsp;<em>Master Crafted Edition</em>, hopefully now fixed <a href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-master-crafted-refunds-ps5-1851785318">from all its many issues on launch</a>.</p>

 <p>Then, but another day later, we get the original&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em> in its 2024 “remodeled” version, seemingly plucked from the&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-pixel-remaster-xbox-tokyo-game-show-1851658451"><em>Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster</em></a><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-pixel-remaster-xbox-tokyo-game-show-1851658451"> bundle</a>.</p> <p>You’ll have to somehow wait another five days, until January 13, before the next update, when <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> arrives, and hopefully a whole new raft of people can discover this fantastic open-galaxy criminal ’em up, after it suffered from both a buggy launch and a concerted anti-woke campaign from the worst people on the internet. Seriously, if you were put off by any of the noise during its 2024 release, this is a great chance to put that right. The stealth is&nbsp;<em>so&nbsp;</em>much better now.</p>

 <p>After&nbsp;<em>My Little Pony: A Zephyr Heights Mystery</em> shows up Jan 15, on the 20th arrives <a href="https://kotaku.com/ikumi-nakamura-sentenced-to-horny-jail-for-lady-dimit-1846919932">Lady Dimitrescu</a> in her size 25s via 2021’s <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, alongside metroidvania platformer <em>MIO: Memories in Orbit</em>, a day-one release.</p> <p>Microsoft giveth, but Microsoft taketh away, so to get all these new games we must sacrifice a bunch too. I don’t imagine too many tears will be shed over the five titles going away on January 15, however, all listed below. Here’s everything in one handy, bullet-pointed list:</p> <h2>January 6</h2> <ul> <li><em>Brews &amp; Bastards</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> <li><em>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition</em> (Cloud, Handheld, PC, Xbox Series)</li> </ul> <h2>January 7</h2> <ul> <li><em>Atomfall</em> (Cloud, Console, Handheld, PC)</li> <li><em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</em> (Cloud, Xbox Series, Handheld, PC)</li> <li><em>Rematch</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> <li><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine – Master Crafted Edition</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> </ul> <h2>January 8</h2> <ul> <li><em>Final Fantasy</em> (Cloud, Xbox Series, PC)</li> </ul> <h2>January 15</h2> <ul> <li><em>My Little Pony: A Zephyr Heights Mystery&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, Handheld, PC)</li> </ul> <h2>January 20</h2> <p><em>Resident Evil Village</em> (Cloud, Console, PC)</p> <p><em>MIO: Memories in Orbit</em> (Cloud, Handheld, PC, Xbox Series)</p> <h2>Leaving January 15</h2> <ul> <li><em>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn </em>(Cloud, Handheld, PC, and Xbox Series X|S)</li> <li><em>Neon White&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, Handheld, and PC)</li> <li><em>Road 96&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, Handheld, and PC)</li> <li><em>The Ascent&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, Handheld, and PC)</li> <li><em>The Grinch Christmas Adventures&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, Handheld, and PC)</li> </ul>

<p>From <strong>Tarsier Studios</strong>, the twisted minds behind the first two <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/little-nightmares-ship-of-horrors/">Little Nightmares</a></em></strong> titles, comes <strong><em>Reanimal</em></strong>, a spiritual successor to the series, sporting a new setting and a <strong>co-op focus</strong> that aims to make the experience more engaging.</p>



<p>This horror adventure follows a brother and sister on a harrowing journey through a <strong>hellish, grotesque landscape</strong> to rescue their missing friends. <a href="https://wccftech.com/reanimal-gamescom-preview-a-nightmare-of-a-different-kind/"><strong>Retaining the signature "grotesque beauty" of Tarsier’s previous work</strong></a>, <strong><em>Reanimal</em></strong> takes everything up to eleven in terms of scale and creature designs, offering an experience that promises to be as <strong>unnerving</strong> as it will be to play.</p>

<p>Although fairly niche compared to series like <strong><em>Resident Evil</em></strong> and <strong><em>Silent Hill</em></strong>, the <strong><em>Fatal Frame</em></strong> franchise is widely appreciated by survival horror fans thanks to its <strong>marked Japanese feel</strong>. And in <strong>2026</strong>, both newcomers and veterans of the franchise will be able to experience the <strong>second entry in the series like never before</strong>.</p>



<p>Developed with involvement from <strong>Team NINJA</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/"><strong>which is also launching <em>Nioh 3</em> this year</strong></a>), <em>Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em> brings the tragic story of twin sisters <strong>Mio and Mayu</strong> to <a href="https://wccftech.com/fatal-frame-2-crimson-butterfly-remake-release-date-march-2026-ps5/"><strong>modern hardware</strong></a> with <strong>improved visuals</strong>, <strong>overhauled lighting</strong> and <strong>new gameplay features</strong>, such as the <strong>"Hold Hands"</strong> mechanics that use the sisters' bond to restore health and spirit power, adding a <strong>tactile layer</strong> to the exploration of the cursed <strong>Minakami Village</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Are you looking forward to first-party PlayStation games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2026-martial-artists-spies-super-heroes-and-criminals/">Marvel's Wolverine</a>? Ever wanted a game to just play itself, while you put the controller down and just watch the trophies roll in? If you hear that and wonder, 'Well, what's the point of playing the game in the first place?' then you're having the same reaction to Sony's new 'AI-generated Ghost Player' patent that most of the internet seems to be having. If you think that sounds like a great way to enjoy a game, then this patent seems to be made specifically for you.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-ai-patent-will-see-playstation-games-play-themselves-when-players-are-stuck/">VGC</a>, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025080356">published the filing publicly this week</a> after it was initially filed by Sony back in September 2024. The patent describes a "<em>ghost player</em>" appearing as an "<em>overlay</em>" to show the player how to complete a section of the game they're having trouble with. </p>



<p>"<em>During live gameplay by a player, game state data is analyzed in order to identify a scenario occurring in the context of the gameplay of the player. The scenario occurring during the live gameplay can then be processed by the Al model and an assistance Al engine in order to provide a ghost character with control inputs for animation/control to guiding the player in relevant interactivity of the game</em>," the filing reads. "<em>The relevant interactivity is for the context of the gameplay of the player, not just some prior gameplay of another player. The ghost character can therefore be controlled by the assistance Al engine during gameplay and provide the player with visual illustrations of how certain game scenarios are played in order for the character controlled by the player to be able to achieve progress in the game.</em>"</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sony-AI-Generated-Ghost-Player-Patent.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: WIPO</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The filing also describes different modes for players to pick from. The 'Guide Mode' would show you the solution to whatever is troubling you in the game you're playing, like a puzzle in Uncharted or God of War. Whereas 'Complete Mode' would just do it for you, so you can move progress further in the game and not have to deal with that section.</p>



<p>Sony already has help systems built into the PS5's console software, with its Tips and Game Help system that lets players get increasingly more detailed hints as to how they complete a section of the game, with the most detailed hint simply telling the player what they need to do. It only works when developers opt into including those hints, but when they're there, they can be helpful to players who don't want to reach for their phone or laptop to look up a guide.</p>



<p>Players already complain when NPC allies give you the answer to a puzzle before you've had the chance to solve it yourself. It doesn't sound like this AI-generated Ghost Player would jump the gun and show you a solution before you ask for one, but going as far as to beat the section for you seems like a stretch too far for anyone who actually wants to enjoy the games they buy.</p>



<p>Of course, it is just a patent, so we may never see this actually implemented. But based on the reaction players had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-launches-copilot-for-gaming-beta-on-mobile-devices/">Microsoft's Gaming Copilot</a> introduction last year, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-training-gaming-copilot-ai-watching-you-play-games-unless-you-turn-it-off/">even the idea that an AI is helping you and watching you play</a>, this doesn't seem like the kind of thing players want to have available to them.</p>



<p>You can always <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/">look up a handy guide</a>, or, of course, just try and figure it out for yourself. No one likes getting frustrated when playing a game, and getting stuck is not a good feeling. Sometimes that frustration is what makes you stop playing a game entirely. But where's the fun in watching the game play itself?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher IO Interactive has announced what kind of PC specs you're going to need if you want to run the upcoming <em>007 First Light</em>, but there's something pretty obvious missing from its rundown.</p><p>You can see the official PC specs <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/news?panel=https%3A%2F%2Fioi.dk%2F007firstlightgame%2Fnews%2F2026%2F007-first-light-unveils-pc-specs-and-nvidia-collaboration" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">over on IO's website</a>, where you'll find a measly two presets, namely Minimum and Recommended. Notably, both appear to be targeting 1080p as their resolution and don't feature any tips on what you might need to get stable performance at 1440p or 4K.</p><p>Naturally, that doesn't mean your rig won't be able to handle <em>007 First Light </em>at higher resolutions (or, indeed, higher frame rates than 60fps), but it is a little strange that IO Interactive wouldn't include this information in its infographic.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Thankfully, it looks like if you do want to run <em>007 First Light </em>at 1080p and maintain a stable 60fps, you won't need too beefy a rig to do so. Here are the two presets IO has announced for the game. Both require 64-bit installations of either Windows 10 or 11.</p><h3>Minimum (1080p at 30fps)</h3><ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5-9500K or AMD Ryzen 5 3500</li><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660, AMD Radeon RX 5700, or Intel equivalent</li><li>RAM: 16GB</li><li>VRAM: 8GB</li><li>Storage: 80GB minimum</li></ul><h3>Recommended (1080p at 60fps)</h3><ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5-13500 or AMD Ryzen 5 7600</li><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT, or Intel equivalent</li><li>RAM: 32GB</li><li>VRAM: 12GB</li><li>Storage: 80GB minimum</li></ul>
<p>If you're not familiar with <em>007 First Light</em>, it's a stealthy action-adventure game from IO Interactive, the folks behind the <em>Hitman </em>series, and you can expect a similar blend of sneaking and high-octane thrills from the game.</p><p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2642ca01-5e15-44ba-9ed9-26d9d752f67a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">slated for a March launch</a>, <em>007 First Light </em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-delayed-may-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e0d84f2a-3cf3-41a8-9a3a-eb43f66bc545" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">delayed to May</a> just before Christmas, possibly in response to Rockstar revealing that industry powerhouse <em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-november-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e57d7053-b3ca-42ed-afdb-4ef5c5958b99" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">would be moved from May to November</a>.</p><p>When it does arrive, <em>007 First Light </em>will be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3768760/007_First_Light/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/007-first-light/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/007-first-light/9PN198B459VB" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/007-First-Light-2792136.html" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.
