            <p>The new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock">Bioshock</a> game in development at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cloud-chamber">Cloud Chamber</a> Games is in difficulties, according to sources of the multiple and anonymous persuasion. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-bioshock-announced">Announced in 2019</a>, the game has reportedly failed a recent internal progress review, with its narrative found to be in particular need of revamping. </p>
<p>Publishers 2K Games aren't talking about any of this, naturally, but they <em>have</em> confirmed that they've treated Cloud Chamber to a not-at-all punitive studio reshuffle, with Kelley Gilmore losing her position as studio head, while former creative director Hogarth de la Plante has been reassigned to a publishing role.</p>
<p>The report comes care of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil">Bloomberg</a> (paywall), who cite "people familiar with the situation". Gilmore and de la Plante's reassignments may not be the worst of the fallout. According to Bloomberg, staff were told at a recent all-hands meeting that they had to become "more agile and efficient" - a phrase equivalent in balefulness to "would you kindly", and a possible indication that layoffs are on the way.</p>
<p>2K Games ain't talking about that either. Here's what they've said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-reportedly-getting-a-narrative-overhaul-amid-development-struggles">IGN</a>:</p>
<blockquote>We are working hard to set BioShock up for the best possible future. Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path.</blockquote>
<p>Little is known about the new Bioshock, which may not be titled Bioshock 4 inasmuch as reverting to numbered sequels feels a bit ridiculous after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock-infinite">Bioshock Infinite</a>. I used to win a lot of playground arguments by dint of the formula "timesed by infinity... <em>plus one</em>", but I can't see a major games publisher adopting that particular rhetorical gambit as a naming strategy. Ehhh, maybe Square Enix.</p>
<p>The little we know about the new Bioshock includes the fact that original series figurehead and videogame thespian Ken Levine isn't working on it. He's off making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judas">Judas</a> at Ghost Story Games. Beyond that, we can only speculate based on previous instalments. There will, presumably, be a man, a city and a lighthouse. It'll be an FPS with a sprinkling of imsim and some arch literary ambitions, and there will be a false utopia of some kind. You will be able to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioshock-4-should-let-you-fire-an-albatross-from-your-hand">shoot animals out of your hands</a>.</p>
<p>The Bloomberg report also alleges that 2K Games cancelled a Bioshock 1 remake earlier this year. I think I can probably do without a Bioshock remake, but I'm sorry for any developers potentially affected. Best of luck to all at Cloud Chamber bringing Nushock home.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2k-comment-on-reports-bioshock-4-is-in-trouble-we-have-a-good-game-but-we-are-committed-to-delivering-a-great-one]]></content:encoded>

Arc System Works revealed dates for a closed beta next month. It’ll take place on PS5 on September 5 through 7 and include Captain America, Iron Man, Ms. Marvel, Star Lord, Storm, and Doctor Doom. <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls/#closed-beta/">Players can sign-up here</a>.

The introverted protagonist will be available starting August 21, while season 2 of the show isn’t expected to become available until late next year or early 2027. Producer Ken Miyauchi <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/guilty-gear-strive-producer-speaks-out-on-rumors-of-canceled-follow-up-game-3233422/">shot down recent rumors</a> that a new <em>Guilty Gear</em> game had been canceled and suggested <em>Strive</em> still has a long road ahead, including the new 2.0 update coming later this month.</p> <h2><em>Street Fighter</em>‘s Ken joins the new <em>Fatal Fury</em></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="FATAL FURY: CotW × STREET FIGHTER｜KEN" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6byynkBnQOM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>He isn’t<em> Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em>‘ first cameo character but he’s by far the most exciting.

It’s the follow-up to a crossover exchange that began with Terry Bogard and Mai Shiranui coming to <em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>last year. The game itself has some strong fundamentals but is extremely content-light and hard to recommend with so much stronger competition around.</p>

In this new normal, it’s never been more important for both developers and their publishing partners to share a clear, holistic vision at the outset—not just for the game itself, but who that audience is and how they can and should be reached.”</p><p>Rochkind continued, “In the high end indie or ‘triple-i’ space, we believe we can offer among the best, if not the best, deal terms available right now. We’re not just looking for developers, but for partners who want a meaningful say in all the ways their game will be shown to the world. Developers we work with will always have ownership of their IP, and our partnerships will always value collaboration and transparency above all else.”</p><!-- AD: content -->

<p>"Game wont load now," said one player on the game's Steam forum. "Maybe it's just me, but I was playing 20 minutes before the update and now it wont launch."</p><p>Another player said, "I downloaded the 1.3.0 patch and ran the game, but it suddenly stopped working.

"Please try completely removing these files and seeing if the issue persists." However, a different player said the suggestion didn't work even after removing their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-stellar-blade-mods/2900-6696/" data-ref-id="2900-6696">Stellar Blade mods</a>.</p><p>Shift Up hasn't responded to this issue just yet, but one user on the Stellar Blade <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stellarblade/comments/1mh1oli/stellar_blade_gets_surprise_patch_on_the_weekend/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">subreddit</a> has suggested a temporary fix that requires players to edit their UE4SS files in the game's directory.</p><p>Among the list of bug fixes, patch 1.3.0 also adds an improved photo mode and players will now need to restart their game when enabling the FSR frame generation. You can check out the full patch notes below, along with the PS5 patch notes.</p><h3><strong>Stellar Blade PC Version 1.3.0 and PS5 Version 1.013 - Patch Notes</strong></h3><p><strong>PS5 &amp; PC Shared update details</strong></p><ul><li>Improved Photo Mode so that when selecting a logo, the logo control indicator is now displayed</li><li>Fixed an issue where players were unable to exit the shop after purchasing the 'Polarized Sunglasses' from Clyde’s shop</li><li>Fixed an issue where Eve’s hair would not appear during the final Elder Naytiba cutscene when wearing the 'Fluffy Bear' or 'Pink Bear' outfits</li><li>Fixed an issue where Eve's final Korean voice-over line was cut off during the 'Lost Items from Heaven' conversation with Clyde in the Great Desert</li><li>Fixed an issue where Eve’s arm would occasionally appear unnatural in Photo Mode when wearing the 'Black Pearl' or 'Red Pearl' outfits</li></ul><p><strong>PS5</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where entering the 'Demogorgon' battle with 'Ranged Auto Aim' turned OFF would cause the camera to shift away from its intended position, making it impossible to aim</li></ul><p><strong>PC</strong></p><ul><li>When using FSR upscaler, restarting the game is now required to enable frame generation</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Fusion Weapon was not visible when beginning the fight against the Airborne Squad after defeating Providence</li><li>Fixed an issue where using the numpad on the keyboard to trigger skills in the Training Room caused the training system to become unresponsive</li><li>Fixed an issue where, when fishing for the 'Betta' fish with mouse and keyboard, the gray striped pattern of the progress bar would obscure the reel-in progress bar</li><li>Fixed an issue where, when using the 'Stinger', target lock-on would not function correctly under specific input conditions</li><li>Fixed an issue where the zoom function in the Hair Salon menu would not respond to controller or keyboard input</li><li>Fixed an issue where dialogue would occasionally not display after interacting with Adam in the Eidos 9 Atelier</li><li>Fixed an issue where Dororong would occasionally not appear during their introduction scene in Xion</li><li>Fixed an issue where newly unlocked items would not immediately appear after increasing shop affinity level</li><li>Improved the save timestamp system so that time since last save is now accurately displayed based on successful saves, rather than attempted saves</li><li>Enhanced the save failure message by changing it to yellow for better visibility</li><li>Various other bug fixes</li></ul>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> has just turned two, which doesn't make any sense because there is no way that I am two years older than I was when it first came out, so I think Larian is lying.</p>
<p>But even so, the studio has released a few surprising stats about its critically acclaimed party-based RPG to mark the occasion.</p>

<p>So, it turns out that 2.07 percent of Baldur's Gate 3 players managed to defeat twenty opponents while drunk. Fair to say this will be in-game intoxication, because I am sure there have been plenty of wines and beers consumed while playing, and far more than 2.07 percent of us will have been a little tipsy while negotiating the world with Shadowheart and co (don't lie, it is not just me who does that).</p>
<p>Additionally, 3.87 percent of players managed to defeat Gortash in Wyrm's Rock without activating any traps. The developer noted those on Steam are a bit more canny with their footwork than those of us playing on Xbox or PlayStation, with 4.37 percent of players on Valve's platform successfully avoiding triggering traps (I am not one of them).</p>

<p>Also, 1.1 million players have completed Baldur's Gate 3 in Tactician Mode, one of the game's highest difficulty settings. Following that, almost half a million players "thought it would be fun" to complete Baldur's Gate 3 in Honour Mode, which builds on Tactician Mode by adding things like tougher bosses, stricter rules and a single save slot.</p>
<p>Of those half a mil, 4,647 players managed to beat Honour Mode with a Level 1 character. Meanwhile, 31,180 players beat Honour Mode as a Jack of All Trades.</p>

<p>Now, I play as a Barbarian in my own real world D&amp;D campaign, so I like this next stat because it speaks to my character (she's called Quinn). Larian has revealed 8.21 percent of players thought to use an enemy as an improvised weapon against another. These are my people!</p>
<p>350 players also respecced Minsc into a Death Domain Cleric, to which Larian asked: "Are you folks doing okay?"</p>
<p>Now, this stat is quite heartwarming. Apparently 598 players adopted a child with Wyll, which is cute.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-next-xbox-amd-zen-6-magnus-apu-11-cores-384-bit-memory-bus/">Magnus APU</a> rumored to be powering the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-codename-3nm-rdna-5-magnus-apu/">Xbox next-generation system </a>will provide, with its unique design, a lot of flexibility that will allow Microsoft to scale an entire stack of systems that are more likely to compete with pre-built PCs rather than the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-playstation-handheld-specs-leaked-rasterization-performance/">PlayStation 6</a> and other traditional consoles.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry went over the recently leaked Magnus APU said to power the next-generation Xbox, highlighting how different it is from the APUs powering the past and current generation PlayStation and Xbox consoles, not only in terms of size, but also in terms of design. Not only does this design, featuring separate CPU and GPU dies, steps away from the traditional monolithic design that balances power with costs, it will also be more powerful than anything we have seen so far, and supports a potential iterative approach to console design, giving Microsoft the ability to mix dies for more frequent upgrades than in traditional console cycles. This design could also be carried across multiple generations, falling in line with a "phases" approach, as opposed to the current "generations" approach, that Microsoft seems to be aiming for, considering recent developments.</p>



<p>Although the Xbox next-generation system's Magnus APU looks expensive, its flexibility will potentially also impact the gaming PC market, Digital Fundry speculates. From AMD's point of view, being able to ship an entire Xbox PC with this condensed, likely cheaper design could be huge, allowing them to gain a bigger share in the market and provide a cheaper alternative to pre-built PCs, which are far from being affordable. As such, there's a real possibility that the concept of the "console war" between Sony and Microsoft will change forever, as the Xbox next-generation systems will likely compete with pre-built gaming PCs, rather than the PlayStation 6.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>With Microsoft's current approach of turning everything into an Xbox, a design like that of the Magnus APU seems to fall almost perfectly in line with the company's current strategy. As the Xbox next-generation system is reportedly launching sooner than the PlayStation 6, it will likely not take much longer to know how the flexibility afforded by the APU will change the future of gaming systems.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Larian Studios is celebrating&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s second anniversary, and as part of those celebrations, the developer has released some fun statistics about the celebrated CRPG, including which of the game's cast is the most-respecced character and more.</p>

<p>As part of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s Community Update 35 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/538860954058754131" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Steam</a>, Larian reveals that the cleric Shadowheart is the game's most-respecced character, which, if you're new to CRPGs, means she's the one whose class or subclass players have changed the most.</p>

<p>According to Larian, Shadowheart was most often switched to either the Life Domain or Death Domain subclasses, so while players aren't changing her overall class, they're clearly split on which cleric path Shadowheart should follow. That makes sense, given her personal storyline.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-most-respecced-character-party.jpg?itok=l6VTBt82 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-most-respecced-character-party.jpg?itok=mx03uKYn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Shadowheart is&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s most-respecced character.</figcaption></figure><p>Wyll and Gael are in second and third place respectively, which, again, makes sense; I never quite found a place for Wyll in my party, so I turned him into a paladin, although that might fly in the face of the predicament in which he finds himself in the game.</p>

<p>Some other fun&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>stats include the 4,647 players who managed to beat the game's Honour Mode at level one, as well as the 350 players who decided that returning character Minsc would be better served as a Death Domain cleric. Hmm.</p>

<p>You can also see a bunch of fun photo mode creations that players have put together in the Steam post, as well as some info about what Larian is up to over the next few months (although that probably doesn't involve the studio announcing its next game, unfortunately).</p>




<p>The final major&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>update <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-major-baldurs-gate-3-update-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">was released back in April</a>, bringing features like a photo mode, crossplay between platforms, and cross-platform progression to allow you to continue your save across PC and console.</p>

The 26.7-inch 4K OLED display has a refresh rate of 240Hz, with just .03ms of latency (lag), so fast-paced games should look smooth instead of stuttering — so long as you have the graphics power to support it.

An anti-reflective coating on the display also improves its contrast.

If you hook your PC up to it using the DisplayPort, it’ll leave the HDMI ports open to connect a pair of consoles. Both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X top out at playing 4K games at 120Hz, while the Nintendo Switch 2 supports 4K output at 60Hz, so you can play games at their full resolution and frame rate on the AW2725Q.</p><div><p id="more-deals-to-check-out"><h2><strong>More deals to check out </strong></h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>If you want to beef up your home security, <strong>Wyze’s Cam Pan V3</strong> is $29.98 ($10 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WYZE-IP65-Rated-Security-Compatible-Assistant/dp/B0B9TWY11Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fwyze-cam-pan-v3-indoor-outdoor-wifi-1080p-pan-tilt-zoom-security-camera-white%2F6530519.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>.

                <p>Epic has revealed a new Halo-inspired Fortnite collaboration. Only this time, the focus isn’t centered solely on Master Chief but on UNSC Spartans as a whole; players will be able to gain access to these colorful skins via Fortnite’s upcoming battle pass when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-battle-pass-theme-and-everything-else-we-know/1100-6533459/" data-ref-id="1100-6533459">Season 4</a> goes live on August 7.</p><p>Epic broke the news through the Fortnite X/Twitter page. There, the company informed fans of the upcoming battle pass as well as hint at a possible Power Ranger sighting; a fan asked if the rangers were making their debut, to which the account responded with a <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1951729012071338345?t=UfRgdXu5YSJwaWbO6gFNzQ&amp;s=19" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">few promising emojis</a>.</p><p>Of course, this isn’t the first time we’ve seen a Halo x Fortnite event. Master Chief joined Fortnite’s legacy series back in 2020--he was added to the shop during Chapter 2, Season 5 as a standalone or bundled purchase. Players could don his armor in two different colors, wield his gravity hammer pickaxe, float with the UNSC Pelican Glider, and even ride a mini warthog via a special emote.</p><p>This would be the first time players will get to play as the Power Rangers though. If the rumors/leaks are true--as suggested by popular Fortnite leaker <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1951721905293242855" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shiina</a>--we’d expect them to show up as a bonus that’s unlocked through specific quests or maybe as a high-tier achievement on the battle pass. Whatever the case, Fortnite fans seem to be in for an out-of-this-world treat come August 7.</p>

It’s because Mystic’s marathon takes place on a tall ship called the <a href="https://mysticseaport.org/explore/morgan/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=13694668477&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACttEkICtto7sjYTgjSw1Wv0aboi_&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw7rbEBhB5EiwA1V49nT23UPgPqn9cQ5nrnsSYTEX12DlPTpCW96e66ynoCh_6a0xxCBJXQRoCp4EQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles W. Morgan</a>, America’s oldest still-floating commercial vessel and the last survivor of a 19th century American whaling fleet. I also went because, for much the same reasons Ishmael says he goes to sea in the book’s opening lines–"whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet"--the marathon sounded like the opposite of the way I spend most of my days camped out in front of my computer, pinned between the despairing onslaught of the news and the relentless pressure of running a business. I wanted to be with strangers I didn’t know from online, with a paper book before me; I wanted ropes and wood and water; I wanted to do something weird and silly and most likely miserable that was about as far from my daily life as I could get.</p><p>The 2025 marathon, which ran from July 31st to August 1st, was the Seaport’s 40th, making it the longest-running such event, though not as well-known as the most famous iteration in <a href="https://slate.com/life/2024/01/moby-dick-whale-book-ship-massachusetts-captain-ahab.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Bedford</a>. I imagined huge crowds, a ton of pomp and circumstance, an abundance of rules to keep attendees from wandering off into the museum grounds at night or falling into the river. I kept worrying at the Seaport’s ticket page in the week before, wondering if I should buy general entry in advance in case the museum’s sizable grounds sold out. But instead it was a small group, numbering less than 30 overnight with more during the day. Besides asking us to not eat onboard the Morgan, Seaport staff seemed to trust that anyone who showed up could take care of themselves and their temporary home. One regular participant said she felt like the Seaport doesn’t even really advertise the event; I’m not sure if that’s to keep it small since there’s only so much room, though the overnight reservations were capped at 100, or just how the Seaport operates.&nbsp;</p><p>After the event, organizer and Melville scholar <a href="https://english.uconn.edu/person/mary-k-bercaw-edwards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mary K. Bercaw Edwards</a> told me that when things started in <a href="https://myweb.uiowa.edu/ddowling/images/Dowling_CWW_intro.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1986</a>, they basically decided to do it in honor of Melville’s birthday and because Mystic had a whaling ship, eventually whittling the event down from a week (they were done with the book after three days, she said) to 25 hours. Organizer Jan Larson, inspired by <em>Ulysses</em> marathons, told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/08/02/thar-she-prose-a-moby-marathon/d0a2b733-cb39-4684-9d06-63f8c9bb06d9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Washington Post</a> in 1991 that she’d initially had trouble selling the event to the museum’s board: “a <em>Moby Dick</em> reading is not exactly something that's going to pull Mom and Pop and the kids off I-95. They thought it might actually turn people away."&nbsp;</p><hr><p>I spent a few years in my 20s living on a WW2 rescue boat turned ferry turned home for various queer punks and art weirdos. During the marathon I told several Seaport employees about the summer I called the Seaport’s <a href="https://mysticseaport.org/explore/henry-b-du-pont-preservation-shipyard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shipyard</a> for help when our boat sprung a leak, recreating the consternation on the other end of the line as I explained that no, I wasn’t in Mystic and no, the boat had no hope of getting there, ultimately admitting that I just needed to talk to anyone who wouldn’t hang up when I told them my boat was old and made of wood.&nbsp;</p><p>The employees I told this story to reacted with the same polite bafflement as those folks at the shipyard did back then, but it at least let me start a conversation with them about their own “why”s: what brought them to the Seaport, why they could recite maritime history or had strong opinions on sea shanties or knew how to row a whaleboat. Niche interests or careers in museums had brought them there, or they’d grown up going there like I had, or they just knew boats. Through the event, I admired the way employees were on hand to keep things running but also seemed happy to be part of it, maintaining the boundary between worker and attendee with professionalism without making me feel like it was my fault they were stuck so late at work, something I felt worried about because I’m me. At one point an employee showed us a spot where we could come and go from the event after hours, and they seemed unruffled when I joked that they shouldn’t give me the knowledge to basically sneak into one of my favorite childhood haunts at will.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>I was stunned by how many people at the marathon read to me as trans or queer. A trans guy <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kylelukoff.bsky.social/post/3lvdvuwn6p22f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">friend</a> attended the beginning with me, and we kept nudging each other to point out this or that person while hoping we didn’t seem like we were gawking. We wondered if they could tell we were trans too, joking that while two short bearded bald guys seemed like an unmissable indicator, especially when we opened our mouths to read from the book, maybe that doesn’t scream “trans” to younger people these days, when you don’t often see trans guys as deep into their transitions as us in media. At one point I awkwardly pressed myself into conversation with someone and, when they brought up their transition, eagerly revealed “I’m trans too,” only for them to nod and keep talking as if I’d interrupted to tell them the sky is blue. When I asked them “why are there so many trans people here?” in my most high-gossip tone, they just said that <em>Moby Dick</em> is a pretty gay book.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I was desperate to talk to anyone who looked the least bit trans or queer, but I felt like they weren’t as surprised to see me here the way I was surprised to see them. Over the course of the marathon I reflected on how maybe, for my friend and me, seeing so many trans people out in the everyday world is still a marvel and a rarity, where for folks decades younger, it might just be normal. Growing up in Connecticut, I didn’t know any queer people outside of the nascent internet; I was bullied by my peers and left to that bullying by teachers. (After I graduated high school, many of them wrote me to acknowledge my experience and explain how they could have been fired for their own identities, something I’m only slightly more sympathetic to today.) When I worked at a camp in my hometown the summer before I started testosterone, one little kid who clearly had gender stuff of their own once, when kids started arguing about whether I was a boy or a girl, solved the argument by brilliantly announcing “Duh, she’s a boy!” Through that summer I went out of my way to praise them to their mom, all while ignoring other parents who would look at me with disdain or call me “it” when they thought I couldn’t hear. Seeing so many trans people at the Seaport, I wondered what it would have been like to see them there when I was little, what would have told me there was a place for me in the world the way I hoped I had for that kid at camp.&nbsp;</p><p>It felt movingly full circle to spend time in a place that figured so big into my childhood with people who shared my identity, and it gave the event a communal feel that would come to sustain me from noon on Thursday to 1pm on Friday, when I hunkered down with all these folks to carry Melville’s entire wandering book from its start to its finish. When I’d forget my way around the museum in the dark, or couldn’t find a spot to get out of the rain, or when I’d get lost in a journeying sentence and needed someone to tell me where we were, it was beautiful to look up and have another trans person to guide me.</p><hr><p>The marathon began with a shockingly tall actor, later performing a play about Melville, reading the famed opening chapter on the deck of the Morgan. Attendees arranged ourselves wherever we could, from sheltered benches to the floor to against the masts. A sign-up sheet went around to pick a chapter to read yourself, and a large board with a magnet kept track of what chapter the group was on. Our read-aloud skills ran the gamut. I rushed and mumbled my way through Chapter 15, where Ishmael and Queequeg eat at the Try Pots. My friend, a kids’ book author and ex-librarian, loudly and legibly dispatched Chapter 18, where the pair sign up aboard the Pequod. One woman who read was utterly inaudible and had unfortunately picked a long chapter, which at least let us bond with some of our fellow attendees as we struggled politely to follow along. Someone who would read many times over the night did brilliant voices for inn-keeper Mrs. Hussey and paused to go “yikes” at one of the book’s many troubling, dated lines. I overheard some people jockeying and bargaining for their favorite chapters, while others, like me, just grabbed whatever was available.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>Since it was still museum hours, my friend and I took breaks to explore the Seaport. We missed a good chunk of the early reading, though I told myself it was OK because I’d read maybe a third of the book before. I ducked into one of the food shops minutes before it closed to cram down a sandwich; attendees were encouraged to bring their own food but had to keep it in their cars until the museum closed, and since I’d taken the train I’d come armed only with nuts and beef jerky in plastic bags.</p><p>Back on the Morgan, we alternated between reading along, listening, and getting to know the people around us. We fell in with two folks whom I later learned had just met that day by sitting next to each other; one of them was here for the fourth time and had stayed overnight twice in the past, though was spending the night in her bed in Mystic for this one. She and her husband, I learned later, had both been editors at a prominent running magazine (she told me I “looked like a marathoner” when I turned the subject to running, a thrilling compliment) who’d retired to the town. Along with some friends she’d adapted short versions of classic books, including <em>Moby Dick</em>, a copy of which she presented to the organizers at the end. During a break for people to get things from their cars, she told me, with what I read as the love of suffering of a distance runner, that there had never been breaks in the past. But I could understand the desire for it; it felt rude to wander in and out while people were reading, but it was also hard to sit quietly for that long, reading Melville’s winding prose, and the hard deck of the Morgan and the muggy weather didn’t make it much easier.&nbsp;</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>After my friend went home, with no excuse to leave the ship, I started to feel the gravity of the hours before me. I worried that my attention was too burned from the frenzy of social media to actually sit through the book; I call myself a reader but I struggle with books these days, and even sometimes have to watch something on my computer in the background to keep myself engaged. I put my phone on airplane mode, as much to keep myself from checking my email as to preserve its battery. I chastised myself when my mind wandered, though I also reminded myself that surely no one was going to spend the next 25 hours doing nothing but reading every word.</p><p>Here’s where the challenge of <em>Moby Dick</em> comes in: The actual plot is probably the thing the book spends the least pages on, with the majority of it taken up by basically whatever came into Melville’s head. When we got to the first of these parts, Chapter 32’s “Cetology” and its scientific efforts to catalogue different whales, a groaning cheer went up for the person who’d chosen to read. <a href="https://defector.com/a-year-in-pursuit-of-moby-dick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Defector</a> worries these chapters are “filler” and “pretentious,” though also writes that “what Melville achieves, what many of the best books achieve, is a consuming rhythm, an internal logic that makes it so almost any digression feels motivated, interesting, even important. Here is a novel that follows men trapped within the groove of a destructive and dying industry, one whose violence and cruelty is held up as one of the few remaining paths to glory.” The book is full of random-feeling plays and songs; there are long explanations of whales and parts of boats; there are stories about the Pequod’s crew or from passing ships that meander and circle and obscurely reference until if someone offered me a million dollars to say what was going on in them, I don’t think I could. Back in the spring I’d gone to an <a href="https://newyorkclassicalreview.com/2025/03/slow-to-get-under-sail-moby-dick-builds-to-powerful-impact-in-met-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opera</a> of <em>Moby Dick</em>, and during the reading I was glad I had; when I’d start to despair that we were lost on an ocean of meaninglessness, I could remind myself that no, really, there’s a novel in here somewhere.</p><p>It was, frankly, frequently boring. But that’s what I’d wanted; beyond the absurdity of the adventure of a book-reading marathon on a boat, I wanted to disconnect from all the noise in my head, wanted to see if I could just be here and do this, to look at what was in front of me. It felt not dissimilar to a whaling voyage; as Melville writes,</p><blockquote><p>In this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling accounts of common-places never delude you into unnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner–for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><hr><p>The museum closed at six, and with just marathon overnighters left, I realized I was <em>in it</em> now. I chatted with a Seaport employee I’d previously seen performing sea shanties, a <a href="https://anayiswright.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lifelong passion</a> of theirs. When I asked them if 2021’s sea shanty <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/music/features/sea-shanties-tiktok-history-the-longest-johns-b1789952.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boom</a> had been good for their career, they told me that actually the biggest effect they’d seen was from the soundtrack to Assassin’s Creed games, from which kids visiting the museum regularly make surprisingly obscure requests.</p><p>Night fell. Employees built little pockets of light from LED ship lanterns and lit a path to the bathroom building across the museum grounds. The cloudy skies turned to drizzles of cold rain, and I rued my last-minute choice to swap out my warm hoodie for a lighter one. I wrapped myself in my raincoat and the camping quilt I’d brought along, worried about the rest of the night if I was already chilly and damp. Meanwhile, the reading went on and on, people holding flashlights for each other and lighting up their books with their phones. I regretted not swapping out the batteries on the pocket flashlight I’d grabbed off the shelves of the hardware store before leaving town. As Ahab introduced his quest against Moby Dick in Chapter 36–“I’d strike the sun if it insulted me”--a hard wind rocked the Morgan in a moment that felt scripted.&nbsp;</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>But dramatic punctuations were few and far between–basically, it was just a little group of people reading an often-boring book in a growing rain. I started, legitimately, to panic. A flipside of the rut that drove me to the reading is that I’m pretty settled in my solitary ways, and I suddenly wondered if spending all night with strangers in what was basically some folks’ workplace wasn’t as up my alley as I’d thought. I became aware of the darker side of what had been my light-hearted quip about how I was basically stuck in the Seaport until 5pm the next day: There was nothing to be done if I got too hungry or too cold or needed a smoke or just didn’t want to be there anymore. I silently railed at Melville for writing such a long, boring book; I cursed all the weather apps for giving me <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/05/trump-administration-cuts-noaa-national-weather-service-forecasts-forecasting-less-accurate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conflicting forecasts</a>. I didn’t even <em>know</em> any of these people, and for a moment, even surrounded by other queer and trans folks, I felt stupidly alone.&nbsp;</p><p>I turned my internet back on to look up late night trains (none) or hotels (too expensive). I took an unnecessarily long walk to the bathroom. On the return I stood for a while looking down the deserted street of historic buildings that lined the water, trying to encourage myself with the fantasy of telling my childhood self they got to <em>sleep</em> here before remembering that I wouldn’t even be sleeping. I ducked into the shadows to take a couple surreptitious pulls on my vape, hating myself for breaking the rules against smoking on museum grounds but feeling both desperate and pathetic about needing to pull myself together.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>The rain started falling colder and more frequent; I anxiously counted the hours of how long it would be until I’d be back in New York in dry clothes. I was disappointed in myself for how quickly my big adventure felt like it had turned into the bad idea that caused my friends to react with horror when I first told them about it.&nbsp;</p><p>Around 10:30pm the reading paused for a performance of sea shanties by the employee I’d talked to before. I huddled close under a sheltered part of the Morgan, trying to take advantage of the reprieve in what was starting to feel like some racist dead cis guy's oppressive, self-indulgent book that I’ve never had strong feelings about anyway, trying to convince myself I hadn’t made some horrible mistake. I kept having to remind myself to <em>listen</em>. I prided myself on recognizing some of the songs they sang, accompanied by concertina and bones, and was excited to learn some new versions. I reminded myself again of what I’d come here for, pushing myself to just be in the moment instead of endlessly narrating the ways I felt somehow deficient for whatever task was ahead of me. I reminded myself that what I love about going on <a href="https://aftermath.site/failing-on-a-bike-trip-taught-me-too-much-about-myself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">big</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/high-wheel-bike-race-frederick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adventures</a> out in the world is the chance to meet other people and learn about their lives, to be in worlds different from my own. That’s happening <em>right now</em>, I growled, forcing my attention back to the music when my brain would start to gallop with some worry.</p><p>I was relieved when the organizers announced we were moving the reading inside the Morgan to get out of the weather. I navigated the narrow stairs down to the ship’s <a href="http://www.girlonawhaleship.org/jernapp/refCard.do?shortName=blubber_room" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blubber room</a>, a long squat compartment in which most everyone would bang their heads on the ceiling beams during the night, even me who was too short to reach them. It was warm down here, and well-lit, and knowing I wouldn’t be too cold or my flashlight wouldn’t die helped me chill out. I staked out a corner among some barrels, shamefully <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lvcos2ua4h23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> about it despite my vow to keep off the internet, and tried to arrange myself away from the rain burbling through the ceiling.&nbsp;</p><p>Once everyone was situated, the reading went on. I read Chapter 57, “Of Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in Stone; in Mountains; in Stars” (that’s what kind of book this is!). The chapter calls people "savages" with such frequency that I regretted not reading it through before picking it, though I got some sympathetic sounds when I groaned "good lord, Melville" at yet-another instance. Once my chapter was done, already tired though the clock was just reaching midnight, I settled down on my quilt for the middle watch.</p><hr><p>An email about the event details read that “For those who stay through the ‘middle watch’ (midnight to 4:00 a.m.) there will be a special whaling logbook stamp to commemorate the event.” I was curious what a logbook stamp was, and was also not above being bribed with goodies at this point. As an employee later said to me, this is the worst part of the night for a <em>Moby Dick</em> marathon. Beyond the fact that it’s far later than anyone should be awake <em>still </em>reading a dense classic, you’re what the employee called “deep in the book” now, hundreds of pages from the early chapters of meeting memorable characters and setting sail, but still hundreds and hundreds of pages from the Pequod’s crew finally spotting the white whale. There’s nothing before you but an open sea of what more often than not feels like bullshit, digressions into anything and everything and even stories that start with strong hooks wandering off into Melville’s ramblings. I have no doubt all of this is very rewarding to pore over and really come to grips with, but trying to digest it all for the first time when I was already exhausted from my early morning travels was a challenge.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>I built my stuff into a little nest among the barrels, using my raincoat as a levee against a growing puddle, and laid down to follow along. Eventually, I decided to nap for a chapter until the applause for a finished reader woke me, read along for a chapter, and then nap for another. These arrhythmic gulps of sleep were less restful than I expected, still believing I could stay up all night like I used to before I hit my 40s. I had to keep contorting myself into a narrowing strip of dry floor as the rain found new gaps in the ceiling. Meanwhile, <em>Moby Dick</em> just kept <em>going</em>, the pace of different people reading aloud far slower than my own reading speed and making me feel like we’d be trapped in it forever.</p><p>But through the course of the middle watch my experience changed. I’d later talk to attendees who also admitted they weren’t really able to <em>read</em> the book during the marathon and planned to read it again at home, but I eventually gave up on the idea of being studious and just let the night unfold. There became something lovely about waking up from a doze to find the book still going on without me, a handful of the most intrepid late-night readers calling out their chapters from wherever they were in the room, occasionally buoyed by staff taking a turn. I’d lift my open book from my stomach and slowly but inevitably figure out where we were from some unique phrase, then read along until the book would tip toward my face. I’d surface from sleep into someone murmuring about whales’ eyes or tails or spouts, into Pip falling overboard, into the endlessness of the Pequod’s crew processing blubber and meat and oil and spermaceti, into Ahab getting a new leg made for reasons I missed. Melville writes that “we account the whale immortal in his species, however perishable in his individuality,” and that’s how <em>Moby Dick</em> came to feel, knocking out chapters without even making a dent in the book. But it didn’t feel bad the way it did in my panic up on deck. It felt comforting, like I didn’t have to worry I’d miss anything or let anyone down. It felt like we were moving the book forward as a group, strangers carrying the moment for each other so we could all see it through together. It’s not a feeling I have often in my life these days, and it felt magical to find it in such weird circumstances, though I’m sure sleep deprivation gave it some of its weight.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>At 4am an employee announced we’d made it through the middle watch, to tired claps and cheers. They invited us to come get our stamp, and I tiptoed through sprawled bodies to find them. They pressed a little inked image of a whale adorned with the words “middle watch” onto the title page of my book. As I navigated back to my spot, the next reader began.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><hr><p>Around 5:30am I climbed above deck to find the sun starting to haze through the clouds. Despite the fact that water coming down on me inside had made any more sleep impossible, the air was hard and rainless, like the Morgan was making its own weather. I took a little walk through the crunching puddles of the shell-covered wharf, marvelling again at how it felt to be near the big ship at such an unusual hour. Below deck, the reading soldiered on, and I signed up to read another chapter. Around 7 I heard people sweeping the deck and preparing the Morgan for its regular day at the museum; at 8 we took a break for people to stow their stuff back in their cars and to move the rest of the reading to the Seaport’s <a href="https://mysticseaport.org/explore/village-old/meeting-house/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meeting house</a> so the ship could have visitors. Employees brought some coffee, a welcome alternative to my plan to make cold instant in my water bottle.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>Before the reading started again we had the opportunity to take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whaleboat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whaleboats</a> out on the water. I tend to think I’m too cool for such novelties or worry that I’m inconveniencing the people providing them, but I told myself to get over it because this was too special a chance to pass up. The sea-grizzled older man organizing things asked if anyone knew how to row, and when no one else in my group raised their hands I admitted I’d rowed some crew in college. I regretted this (I was, in the words of my coach, a “team builder,” though a shit rower) when the man put me in a key position at the front of the boat and told everyone to watch how I handled its nearly 20-foot wooden oar. But it came back to me quickly, and I did my best to follow our captain’s instructions and lead everyone in a row past the front of the Morgan into the river, where he proudly told us few people get to see the boat from this angle. He told us facts about whaleboats and how to handle them, then instructed us on how to turn around and row back. I peppered him with questions as we went–how did he know all of this, where had the Morgan sailed, what was it like to sail with it, why didn’t it sail anymore–that he politely but briskly answered. As it was surely intended to, the small boat against the size of the Morgan drove home the picture Melville paints, how frightening and flimsy whaling must have felt, with nothing but wood and metal and ropes between whalers, their quarry, and the sea.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><hr><p>Inside the meeting house, with people who hadn’t spent the night bringing new energy to the reading, the book moved along through the morning. I read Chapter 117, “The Whale Watch,” where Ahab is given prophecies about his death in such a casual way that I didn’t even realize that’s what they were until they came up again in later chapters. The back parts of the book finally return to having a plot, with the bulk of what most people know of <em>Moby Dick</em>–chasing the whale, the Pequod sinking, Ishmael becoming the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/it-repels-the-reader-tech-glitches-led-i-moby-dick-i-s-first-critics-to-pan-it/281499/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lone survivor</a>–happening in the last 50 or so pages. The writing becomes more focused and easier to follow, and everything rushes–as much as Melville can rush, anyway–to its conclusion.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pequod meets the Rachel, another whaling ship whose captain is searching for a missing crew that includes his own son; Ahab cruelly rejects the Rachel’s plea for help because its crew has seen Moby Dick. In Chapter 132, the person reading aloud cried as he recited Ahab’s speech realizing the consequences of his lifelong pursuit of the white whale:</p><blockquote><p>Forty years of continual whaling! forty years of privation, and peril, and storm-time! forty years on the pitiless sea! for forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land, for forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not spent three ashore. When I think of this life I have led; the desolation of solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a captain’s exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the green country without…</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Ahab and Starbuck have a conversation I remembered from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd244dHFjgQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opera</a>, in which Ahab movingly tells Starbuck “lower not when I do; when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick. That hazard shall not be thine. No, no! not with the faraway home I see in that eye!” Starbuck tries to convince Ahab to give up the chase and turn toward home, where they can both see their wives and children again. It’s a beautiful, tugging moment, especially when you know what’s coming. Reflecting on the sea weather, Starbuck nudges, “I think, sir, they have some such mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket,” to which Ahab replies</p><blockquote><p>They have, they have. I have seen them–some summer days in the morning. About this time–yes, it is [my son’s] noon nap now–the boy vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of cannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come back to dance him again.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>But just as soon as Ahab seems convinced, he falls back into feeling fated to hunt the whale,&nbsp;asking “Is Ahab, Ahab?” to a Starbuck who has already walked away in disgust or despair. Shortly after, the crew finally spots Moby Dick.</p><p>They chase the whale over three days. (“Ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them,” Melville writes.) Whaleboats are wrecked in the clash (“the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch”) and eventually the Pequod is irreparably damaged. In the final fight, Ahab is tangled in the ropes and is dragged off by Moby Dick, shouting his famous lines</p><blockquote><p>Toward thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit my last breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool! and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! <em>Thus</em>, I give up the spear!</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>The Pequod goes down beneath the waves, and the final line of the story chillingly reads that, after all the great drama of the Pequod’s journey and for all we’ve learned about its crew, “the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.” Together, all of us read the last line of Ishmael’s rescue, floating on a coffin in the abandoned sea, from the epilogue: ”It was the devious-cruising ‘Rachel,’ that in her retracing search after her missing children, only found another orphan.” The meeting house erupted in cheers and a standing ovation. The way the book swings back to plot felt incongruous with the cerebral, meandering journey we’d been on since yesterday, but the rush of emotion felt earned. Ahab might not have defeated Moby Dick, but we’d defeated the book.</p><hr><p>We took a celebratory group picture, and museum staff brought out a sheet cake for Melville’s birthday. Most people swiftly went home to go to sleep, but I was stuck at the Seaport for a few more hours before my train. I ate multiple pieces of cake, hoping the sugar would keep me awake. I asked museum staff more pestering questions that they answered before tactfully excusing themselves to go about their work days. I explored some exhibits I hadn’t visited yet before finally leaving the Seaport for good. In downtown Mystic, I wandered among crowds of vacationing tourists worried I was terrifying them with my dirty clothes and sleepless eyes, realized I was haunting creepily behind them at restaurant menus when I found myself too tired to navigate deciding whether to go inside for my first real food since the afternoon before. I’m not above admitting I had to hold back exhausted sobs when I found out my train was delayed, then running slowly, and it took hours longer than it should have to get back to my apartment in New York.&nbsp;</p><p>But after getting home and forcing myself to shower and (finally!) brush my teeth before crashing, I woke up Saturday morning to find myself drifting back to my copy of <em>Moby Dick</em>, now bristling with specially-made <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMNiUiEKIMq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bookmarks</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1109052117776911" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">placards</a> commemorating the event. Despite how long I’d just spent with the book, despite how much it had tormented and confused me, I didn’t feel done with it. I still wanted to be in its world, to read what I’d missed and understand what it is about <em>Moby Dick</em> that makes so many people decide to throw marathons for it. I opened it up to those familiar first pages, already knowing both the tortures and pleasures that awaited me, ready to take it all on again. &nbsp;</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-chris-plante-sandwich-post-games"><h3>You Have To Hear Chris Plante’s Sandwich Story</h3></a><p>"It’s somehow getting on us, but we’re so happy that we’re not gonna die"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-covid-lockdown-hideo-kojima"><h3>Death Stranding 2 Is A Joyful, Absurd Response To COVID</h3></a><p>Goofy, lighthearted, constantly mugging: Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is an exercise in spectacle, a rumination on lockdown, and one of the most human games Kojima has made in years</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-user-experience-ux-research"><h3>‘Dopamine Simply Doesn’t Work Like That’: An Interview With A User Experience Researcher</h3></a><p>'Part of the reason I have worked in games UXR and not, say, microwave UX, is that games can be designed to be hard'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/steam-itch-porn-censorship-collective-shout-visa-mastercard-paypal"><h3>Inside The Mass Call Campaign To Stop Video Game Censorship [Update]</h3></a><p>"This is a marathon, not a race," say organizers who plan to keep calling payment processors for months, if need be</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/moby-dick-marathon-mystic]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="game-key card survey" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/57a37548ce9af/game-key-card-survey.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has already been doing a little surveying and gathering of feedback, as we reported a few weeks back, with regards to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-is-seeking-player-feedback-on-game-key-cards-in-japan">physical and digital games, including how game-key cards are going down.</a> Spoiler alert: they aren't really going down very well at all.</p>
<p>Now, and as reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-dont-like-nintendos-controversial-game-key-cards-you-can-now-let-the-company-know-directly">Eurogamer</a>, the Big N is back at it, with a fresh survey for those interested to get busy filling in. Indeed, you can <a href="https://nintendoofamerica.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e54yuThgl5J1nnM?key=f2ff4cc19b9b3818&amp;cid=BAPSurveys&amp;eid=BAPSurvey0730_0127&amp;crmid=095575FC-0293-4888-8F7A-DD6D22045DA4">click right here</a> to go do just that.</p>
<p>This latest survey asks a whole bunch of questions related to how you feel about purchasing digital and physical media in various ways.</p>
<p>As you can see from our screens, they mostly want to know how strongly you feel about the physical game card actually having the game, whether or not you care about that, and how whether being in a store or buying online affects your thinking. Stuff like that, mate.</p>
<p>It all points to the fact that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/furukawas-defence-of-game-key-cards-aint-all-that-convincing">Nintendo know people don't really care for the game-key card situation.</a></p>

<p>Anyhow. This survey is a good chance, whatever your thoughts, to get stuck into letting them be known loud and clear. So, make sure to get clicking on those multiple choice answers (it took us about four minutes to complete, for what it's worth).</p>
<p>Of course, despite multiple complaints from Switch 2 owners, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/publishers-are-thanking-nintendo-for-game-key-cards-on-switch-2">developers have been praising Game-Key Cards</a>, so it seems unlikely they'll be going anywhere for a while now...</p>
<p>If you want some more thoughts about the physical, digital, and Gam-Key Card discussion, our lovely Zion made a video all about it following last week's Partner Showcase, so have a watch:</p>

<p><em>Have any strong opinions left about game-key cards at this point? Let us kn</em>ow in the comments!</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/717994/8bitdo-wireless-xbox-controller-rare-40th-anniversary-edition</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/8bitdo%E2%80%99s-first-wireless-xbox-controller-is-a-surprise-rare-collaboration.1261623/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>8BitDo has created its first wireless Xbox controller in partnership with Rare, a game studio acquired by Microsoft. The officially licensed controller features a gold and blue design, with plenty of Easter eggs to celebrate Rare’s 40th anniversary.</p><p>The $89.99 8BitDo Ultimate 3-mode Controller for Xbox — Rare 40th Anniversary Edition (yes, that’s the product name!) can connect to an Xbox console via a 2.4GHz wireless connection or a USB-C cable. The wireless connection works through a small USB dongle and not Microsoft’s native Xbox Wireless protocol. You can also use Bluetooth to connect the controller to mobile devices.</p><p>This Rare special edition controller is essentially a wireless version of 8BitDo’s existing Ultimate three-mode controller. 8BitDo is using the same hall effect joysticks and Xbox-style impulse triggers, but there are also two swappable silicone joystick caps included. One is a skull from <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, and the other is a jigsaw puzzle piece that Rare fans will immediately recognize from <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>. The tactile D-pad is made from zinc alloy and matches the controller’s gold aesthetic.</p><p>You’ll also be able to program three profiles on this controller, which includes configuring the two back buttons at the rear. All of the customization can be done using 8BitDo’s Ultimate software that lets you remap buttons, adjust the ranges and motor tensity of triggers, set vibration levels, and customize each stick for more precise control.</p><p>As this controller is wireless, it has a 1,000mAh battery inside, which 8BitDo suggests will deliver 20 hours of playtime. The rechargeable battery takes around 4 hours to fully charge, and there’s even an integrated charging dock included in the box that automatically reconnects the controller once you remove it from the dock.</p><p>It’s surprising to see Rare, an Xbox game studio, turn to 8BitDo to create a 40th anniversary controller instead of Microsoft just creating its own. The collaboration comes as Microsoft’s own custom Xbox Design Lab controller has been on hold for months now. You can still design custom controllers, but Microsoft hasn’t been accepting purchases since last December — with no sign of when Xbox Design Lab will return.</p><p>8BitDo’s Rare 40th anniversary Xbox controller <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-ultimate-3-mode-controller-rare-40th-anniversary-edition">goes on sale today</a>, priced at $89.99.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/717994/8bitdo-wireless-xbox-controller-rare-40th-anniversary-edition]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Electronic Arts and Battlefield Studios—a team made up of four EA-owned studios—are focused on making sure the upcoming military shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384"><em>Battlefield</em> 6</a> is extremely well-optimized, with the developers claiming the game will run on all consoles and platforms at 60FPS or more.</p> <p>Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384">EA revealed <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s multiplayer in a big event in Los Angeles</a>. A large group of journalists (myself included) and content creators were invited there and got to play over four hours of <em>BF6</em>. The game reminds me a lot of <em>Battlefield 3</em> and <em>Battlefield 4,</em> and that’s not by accident. The team of studios working on the FPS is specifically trying to create a new <em>Battlefield</em> game that harkens back to those more grounded and contemporary military shooters that were both fan favorites. From what I’ve played so far, they’ve nailed it. And another thing that I can confirm EA and Battlefield Studios have nailed is the game’s performance, which ran perfectly during my preview. That’s not shocking considering how hard the devs are working to ensure<em> Battlefield 6</em> runs well on all platforms.</p> <p><a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/106788/battlefield-6-on-ps5-60fps-fidelity-mode-90fps-performance-120fps-pro/index.html">As spotted by <em>TweakTown</em></a>, in a recent interview with <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s principal game designer Florian Le Biha during the LA event, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2VK2fCG3HI?t=78">YouTuber Tech &amp; Co asked about the game’s&nbsp;performance and optimization</a> and Le Biha confirmed that it will run at a minimum of 60FPS on all consoles and PC.</p>

 <p>“Well, optimization for us has been one of the most important things for [<em>Battlefield 6</em>],” said Le Biha. “We want to make sure that it’s not just a game that looks graphically super beautiful, but it’s also a game that runs on all configurations, whether it’s on PC or on all Xbox or PS5 [consoles] of this generation. So we put a lot of effort into optimizing the game. We guarantee 60FPS on all experiences on consoles, [higher framerates] on PC, obviously, and even more on consoles [which support] performance mode, which allows you to go even higher.”</p> <p>As further reported by <em>TweakTown</em>, a player who says they are involved in <em>BF6</em>‘s extensive early access playtesting program, known as BFLabs, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mesy9p/battlefield_6_pc_console_performance/">claims on Reddit</a> that the upcoming milsim targets 80FPS in performance mode on PlayStation 5 and also suggested that the PS5 Pro version of the game will hit 120FPS. They also explained that the Xbox Series S doesn’t have a performance mode, but still hits 60FPS, which lines up with what Le Biha told Tech &amp; Co.</p> <p>I can personally confirm that when I played <em>Battlefield 6</em> on PS5 at a party hosted by EA after the event, the game ran extremely well, looking like at least a stable and locked 60 FPS with no noticeable drops. On PC, when I played the game during the event, it ran at over 120FPS and felt buttery smooth. Of course, things could change when the game arrives in October or when people go hands-on later this month <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-battlefield-6-open-beta-nyc-teaser-trailer-gameplay-1851786700">during <em>BF6</em>‘s open beta.</a> But it does indeed seem like the devs are focused on making sure BF6 is super well-optimized on all platforms, even the Xbox Series S.</p>

The inciting incident for its unionization was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-lays-off-at-least-a-dozen-raven-software-quality-assurance-contractors">a round of layoffs back in December of 2021</a> as a part of a studio restructure instituted by then-parent company Activision Blizzard.

This dramatic emotional outburst, plus GO1’s bemusement, resulted in a number of meme-worthy shots.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I swear to God I’m not making fun of this dude but NO ONE HAS EVER LOOKED LIKE THEY SUFFERED LIKE THIS IN HUMAN HISTORY <a href="https://t.co/JekIbl1F0a" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/JekIbl1F0a</a></p>— kayos (@kayos_o) <a href="https://twitter.com/kayos_o/status/1952115459094143151?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">KojiKOG eventually snaps out of his losing pose and can be seen chatting to GO1 and tidying up. It is clear from this that he was acting. However, shorter clips on social media have caused some who are unfamiliar with KojiKOG’s antics to worry that he was having a real breakdown. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The End of EVOgelion <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EVO2025?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#EVO2025</a> <a href="https://t.co/fZOHd1HmNF" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/fZOHd1HmNF</a> <a href="https://t.co/Ht0vzmHXd3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Ht0vzmHXd3</a></p>— Keith Ace (@Keith_Ace_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Keith_Ace_/status/1952151406544339104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">KojiKOG is known for being a bit of a comedian, often doing his screaming pose and pulling funny faces in interviews (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/82PbS1khSxY?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like at EWC2025</a>). His dramatic reaction to losing this weekend was likely a reference to when he previously faced off against GO1 at EVO15. As seen in the video below, he did a similar screaming pose- puzzling the Japanese commentators as his antics weren’t well known back then.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>10 years ago, GO1 went to EVO for the first time and won 4 side games—Melty Blood, Dengeki Bunko, UNI, and AQUAPAZZA, beating KojiKOG in the finals</p><p>Today, they meet again on the EVO main stage, recreating the 'leg cutting incident' meme <a href="https://t.co/p5whu1GNLB" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/p5whu1GNLB</a> <a href="https://t.co/rfPVn2HJXg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/rfPVn2HJXg</a></p></div>— HiFight(ハイファイト) (@HiFightTH) <a href="https://twitter.com/HiFightTH/status/1952147416892981325?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Commenting on this, legendary pro fighting game player Daigo Umehara mused that KojiKOG’s reaction was like a character in the SAW movies having their leg cut off. This is why many Japanese fans colloquially refer to KojiKOG’s dramatic pained reaction as the “leg cutting incident” and the like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although KojiKOG lost against GO1 at EVO2025, he came in joint fifth place overall, winning 80% of his matches in Fatal Fury: City of Wolves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

                <p>Disney's big Fortnite project--whatever it might be--is still in the works and is said to be targeting a Fall 2026 release. That's according to a report from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/disney-ai-hollywood-movies-5982a925?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAj1WlG90hfrlndqPntMcR366Qqal9vfmaEL3j9hN4JnWUrH_70M8ucT_sHstYc%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6890bed5&amp;gaa_sig=lpo4UvT40pOKiDH3Wi8wRCBs-Zfur_-2gFEdrybB-Tpi6kvRjmJq_Gl_8MLGnqOexWLZM29y1vwGyoqDMOTQkQ%3D%3D" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Wall Street Journal</a>, which also claimed some Epic executives have complained about Disney's reportedly slow sign-off and approval process. At the same time, the report said some Disney executives have expressed concerns about the project.</p><p>The report said Disney believes gaming can be a major revenue-driver for the company, which is why it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-explains-why-its-fortnite-deal-is-so-important-we-have-to-adapt/1100-6526831/" data-ref-id="1100-6526831">invested $1.5 billion with Epic</a> to make a Disney universe inside Fortnite. Disney's Fortnite project is codenamed "Bulldog," the report said.</p><p>It remains to be seen exactly what Disney's plans are, but regarding the reported frustrations from Epic's side, the report said Disney requires sign-off from "so many different divisions."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2bRcSIUsE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Yf2bRcSIUsE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Whatever the project turns out to be, the report said Disney parks and resorts boss Josh D'Amaro is personally leading the effort to get it done. The report said he's spent time with Epic's CEO Tim Sweeney near the company's HQ in North Carolina, and they have gone on hikes together.</p><p>The report added that "some Disney executives have raised concerns" about the project regarding "who owns fan creations based on Disney's characters." The publication said if a Fortnite player created their own mashup dance featuring Darth Vader and Spider-Man, that could lead to legal questions about ownership, among other things.</p><p>Disney and Epic have of course already worked together on Star Wars and Marvel crossovers, among others, but not all of them have gone over entirely smoothly. When Disney brought an Darth Vader to Fortnite featuring the AI-powered voice of James Earl Jones, people <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darth-vader-could-say-the-f-word-in-fortnite-for-a-brief-time/1100-6531608/" data-ref-id="1100-6531608">quickly made him say questionable things and curse.</a> This was corrected quickly, but it surely has not been forgotten.</p><p>The official word is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-explains-why-its-fortnite-deal-is-so-important-we-have-to-adapt/1100-6526831/" data-ref-id="1100-6526831">Disney is working with Epic </a>to create "a place where you can play games, a place where you can be social, [and] a place where users can generate their own content." Essentially, D'Amaro said Disney's aim to create an entire "universe" where "all our stories can come to life."</p><p>"They can come to life in different forms, [like] games. They can come to life in ways that you can just interact with and play with the franchise in a way that's meaningful to you--a place where you can actually build," he said. "And we think that this is going to be a place where all fans can come and interact 365 days a year."</p><p>Characters and content from Disney's Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and Avatar brands, among others, will be represented in Fortnite. Disney and Epic have yet to officially unveil any specific projects in Fortnite tied to Disney, but many are hoping to see some kind of "virtual Disney World." Along those lines, a Disney Imagineer recently teased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-teases-theme-park-integration-with-disney-x-fortnite-project/1100-6530010/" data-ref-id="1100-6530010">some kind of theme park integration for people who visit Disney's parks and play the upcoming game.</a></p><p>As for D'Amaro, he is said to be a leading choice to replace CEO Bob Iger after he plans to retire in 2026.</p><p>Fortnite is more of a platform than a single game that gets new updates constantly, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-battle-pass-theme-and-everything-else-we-know/1100-6533459/" data-ref-id="1100-6533459">soon-to-release Season 4</a>. In addition to the main battle royale game, Fortnite hosts games like Rocket Racing, Fortnite Festival, and Lego Fortnite, along with countless other user-created games and experiences on the platform. Whatever Epic and Disney might be cooking up could be just the latest game to exist on the Fortnite platform.</p><p>Disney no longer develops big games in-house, as its own Disney Interactive Studios shut down years ago. These days, Disney works with outside teams as part of licensing arrangements. Not all of the games are successful, though, as Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">Star Wars Outlaws failed to sell up to expectations</a>. One of Disney's latest major games was Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which was developed by MachineGames in partnership with Lucasfilm. The game is <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/blog/indiana_jones_article/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">performing well, it seems.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last Friday's THQ Nordic showcase featured the reveal of Darksiders 4. The next entry in the long-running series finally pays off the ending of the 2010 original, uniting all four horsemen of the apocalypse in one game.</p><p>The teaser trailer shows War, Death, Fury, and Strife atop their mounts as they prepare to face the apocalyptic events that conclude the first game. For fans, seeing the story finally move forward is an exciting proposition as each sequel's plot has either run parallel to or taken place before the first Darksiders' narrative. Darksiders 4 is being developed by Gunfire Games, which previously made Darksiders III and is also known for its work on the Remnant franchise.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6eafBknCPcI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6eafBknCPcI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Although the trailer excludes gameplay footage, Darksiders 4 is described as a fast-paced third-person action game that blends traversal and puzzle-solving. Players will control their preferred Horsemen (how/if you can switch between them during the campaign is unclear), and the game will feature online co-op. Unfortunately, it's unknown how many players can ride together or how cooperative play will work in general.</p><p>Darksiders 4 doesn't have a release window, but it will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Workers at Raven Software, the Activision subsidiary known for its contribution to the Call of Duty series, have ratified their first union contract with Microsoft, three years after unionisation efforts began.</p>
<p>Unionisation efforts within Raven Software started in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/qa-testers-at-activision-blizzards-raven-software-announce-intent-to-unionise">January 2022</a>, following strike action protesting the firing of 12 members of the developer's QA team. Eventually, in May of that year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/qa-testers-at-activision-blizzard-studio-raven-software-successfully-vote-to-unionise">the vote to unionise was won</a>, despite Activision Blizzard's anti-unionisation manoeuvres, which included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-sent-anti-union-emails-ahead-of-pivotal-raven-software-vote">sending emails asking recipients to "please vote no"</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the Communications Workers of America (CWA) has announced workers at Raven Software have "unanimously voted" to <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/raven-software-workers-secure-first-contract-microsoft">ratify their first union contract between Game Workers Alliance-CWA (GWA-CWA) members and Xbox maker Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p>The contract guarantees a 10 percent wage increase over two years, with "additional raises through merit and promotions, after going 18 months without wage increases and 45 months without promotions".</p>
<p>In addition, the contract promises an "elimination" of crunch time. Seven days notice is now required for any mandatory overtime, and there is to be no "excessive overtime on back-to-back weeks" and "no mandatory overtime of any duration for the majority of weeks in a quarter".</p>
<p>Job descriptions will also become defined with this contract in place, while the promotions process will be made more clear.</p>
<p>"After more than three years of organising and bargaining, seeing it finally pay off feels incredible," Erin Hall, QA tester at Raven Software and member of the bargaining committee, said today. "From day one, we made it a priority to include every voice in the room, and the contract we came out with reflects what we need - better pay, real career paths, and protection from burnout. It's a contract that actually values the work QA does. I'm proud of what we accomplished, and I hope it shows other game workers that organising works - and it's worth it."</p>
<p>"Going from organising to sitting across the table from one of the largest tech corporations in the world was a huge learning curve, but we never lost sight of why we were there," added Autumn Prazuch, another QA tester at Raven Software and bargaining committee member. "We fought hard for raises and job structures that will finally make QA a sustainable career path, and we were able to negotiate limitations on mandatory crunch. Ratifying this contract is a win for game workers everywhere who are ready to take the first step toward a better future."</p>
<p>CWA District 4 Vice President Linda L. Hinton called the contract between CWA members and Microsoft "proof that when video game workers organise, they can win lasting changes in the workplace".</p>
<p>Said Hinton: "By reaching an agreement with Microsoft that puts limits on excessive sustained overtime, also known as crunch, these members are tackling one of the most exploitative practices in the industry and setting new standards for quality assurance testers and video game workers overall.</p>
<p>"We are pleased to welcome these members into the CWA District 4 family."</p>
<p>Today's news comes just a couple of months after workers at ZeniMax Media voted to ratify their first union contract with parent company Microsoft. In May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cwa-negotiates-new-contract-for-zenimax-including-substantial-wage-increases-and-a-credits-policy-for-qa-staff">the two parties reached a tentative agreement</a>, following almost two years of negotiations.</p>
<p>As for Raven Software, it is currently working on the next Call of Duty entry - Black Ops 7 - with Treyarch. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-promises-to-be-most-mind-bending-black-ops-ever">developers have promised this will be the "most mind-bending" Black Ops release yet</a>. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/raven-software-workers-celebrate-win-following-three-year-battle-for-microsoft-union-contract]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/ataris-retro-metroidvania-adventure-of-samsara-launches-next-month</link>

<article id="article">
<header><section>
<p>I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Atari has announced that its new retro-inspired metroidvania <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/adventure_of_samsara">Adventure of Samsara</a> will launch on the Switch next month on <strong>4th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Loosely based on the 2600 title <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/atari2600/adventure">Adventure</a> from creator Warren Robinett, Adventure of Samsara looks pretty awesome and we're really digging the whole retro vibe. But to be honest, we're still struggling somewhat to see the connection to the 1980 original beyond a couple of dragons and whatnot.</p>
<p>Though to be fair, Adventure's visuals were so basic at the time, you could interpret the presentation in a number of different ways, so we're going to hold off on our final judgement until next month. To reiterate, it does look really cool; lots of neat little abilities to discover and boss characters to vanquish.</p>
<p>Let's remind ourselves of the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Metroidvania Exploration</strong> – Explore 10 unique biomes, from frozen wastes to industrial labs, each filled with distinct enemies, hazards and hidden upgrades.<br>
<strong>- Classic Gameplay Feel</strong> – With classic gameplay and twisted 2D pixel art, <em>Adventure of Samsara</em> evokes the timeless feel of games like <em>Prince of Persia</em> (1989) while offering something entirely new.<br>
<strong>- Original Worldbuilding</strong> – Immerse yourself in an expansive, interdimensional fantasy world with a deep, spiritual lore.<br>

        <p>Blade joins the roster just in time for some comp balancing changes</p>

            <p>
Techno-loving hollowtooth Blade has joined the playable cast of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, but he's not what I find most interesting about the free-to-play shooter's latest update. Developers NetEase Games have introduced a new system of penalties for ragequitters, keyboard-away-frommers, and other craven scumbags who abandon a competitive mode match early on because the dishwasher's overflowing, or similar.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I find all this interesting simply because it's trying to automate Justice and determine a disconnecting player's good or bad faith, based on a bunch of dumb numbers. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2767030/view/541112753868243356?l=english">read about the update in full on Steam</a>, but here's a quick overview with fewer number tables and fewer intervening remarks about *squints* "Panther &amp; Wolverine's Sneaky Sounds".
</p>
<p>
If a player disconnects during match loading, the ban/pick phase, hero selection, or within the first 70 seconds of the match, the whole match will be deemed invalid, and the disconnecting player will receive a points penalty that scales with repeat offences.
</p>
<p>
If a player disconnects after 70 seconds, and doesn't reconnect before the match ends, they'll be Naughty Stepped as follows: 1) If the match ends within 90 seconds of their disconnection, there's no points penalty 2) If their team loses 90-150 seconds after they disconnect, they get a points penalty and competitive matchmaking ban, which both scale with repeat offences, while other players on the losing team get ranked point compensation. 3) If the match ends over 150 seconds after they quit, they'll get a larger point penalty and comp matchmaking ban. 
</p>
<p>
If the player who quit does reconnect before the match ends, and their team wins, they won't be penalised. But if they reconnect and the team loses, they'll get a points penalty... but no competitive matchmaking ban. Fickle and winding are the conduits of karma.
</p>
<p>
Similar rules apply for players who are detected as being AFK in the first 70 seconds of a match. Softer wrist-slaps are being doled out to those who pull the plug early during quickmatch multiplayer.</p>
<p>The most severe punishments are reserved for those who both go AFK and disconnect early during competitive. Damned souls indeed. But what if, what if that player was only AFK because they had to go administer the kiss of life to a postman, after the latter keeled over while delivering a crateload of community service awards, and what if that player then quit the game because they had to google appropriate post-resuscitation care? How are you going to distinguish a virtuous soul like that from somebody who came back from the kitchen with a plate of pickles and decided they'd rather watch Grand Designs anyway?
</p>
<p>
I'd love to know what kind of audience or playtesting informs the time windows, here. Why is 70 seconds the cut-off point for distinguishing between a player who noped out because their house has caught fire, and a player who has yanked out the router in fury because they got sneakishly dog-piled by Wolverine and Panther?</p>
<p>I imagine one consideration is how long it takes players to reach certain objectives or chokepoints on average. Another consideration is possibly how long it takes them to charge their Ultimate abilities - heroes passively gain 12 points of Ultimate energy a second, with different Ultimates requiring different amounts of energy. Fiddly stuff. Anyway, you are welcome to disagree with me that all of this is more interesting than Blade.

              <p>Will global warming kill your Switch 2? Is EA really never going to make a sequel to <em>The Sims 4</em>? Why is <em>Dynasty Warriors 3</em> objectively the best one in the series? These and more questions might get answered as we at <em>Kotaku</em> experiment with reviving our <a href="https://kotaku.com/culture/morning-checkpoint">old Morning Checkpoint roundup series</a> that used to run on the weekends. The idea is to briefly round up all the news and conversations that we might not otherwise have a chance to hit as individual breakout news stories but are otherwise worth knowing or fun to talk about, like the first <em>Call of Duty</em> developer union winning its first collective bargaining agreement. Here we go!</p> <h2><em>The Sims 5</em> wouldn’t be ‘player friendly’</h2> <p>That’s what EA entertainment president Laura Miele (she’s been at the company almost 30 years) <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/battlefield-6-release-date-sims-movie-ea-laura-miele-interview-1236475794/">told <em>Variety</em></a> when explaining why the hit life sim franchise has gone more than a decade without a direct sequel. “What I wouldn’t want to have happen is you to have to start from day zero and start from scratch and give up all of the things that you have created, give up all of the content that you’ve purchased over the years,” she said. “We put out over 85 content packs over the last 10 years on <em>The Sims 4</em>, and so resetting that is not player friendly and not a good idea for our community.” What fans are getting is a <em>Sims</em> movie <a href="https://kotaku.com/sims-movie-margot-robbie-barbie-ea-1851355482">with help from <em>Barbie</em>‘s Margot Robbie</a>. Which other EA franchises might get in on the current Hollywood gaming goldrush next? Miele currently has her eyes set on <em>Apex Legends</em>.</p> <h2>One sequel we are getting is <em>Darksiders 4</em></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Darksiders 4 - Announce Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T_Wx2qlbdOM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <h2><em>Call of Duty</em> testers win second Microsoft gaming union contract</h2> <p>Quality assurance devs at <em>Call of Duty</em> support studio Raven Software were the first Activision Blizzard staff to organize a union <a href="https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-employees-plan-walkout-wednesday-to-1847362030">amid the 2021 workplace fallout,</a> but then saw negotiations drag on for years as they accused the publisher of bad-faith bargaining tactics. Shannon Liao at <em>Updater</em> <a href="https://shannonliao.substack.com/p/3-years-later-they-won?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=155iz&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">now reports</a> that the Game Workers Alliance has finally ratified its contract, which among things “guarantees a 10 percent wage increase over two years.” It’s the second team at a Microsoft-owned studio to do so, with ZeniMax staff ratifying a contract in June just weeks before they were hit with mass layoffs. “If our unit of 19 people can do this, anybody can, as long as you’re committed to actually just doing the work and seeing it through to the end,” Erin Hall told Liao.</p>

 <h2>Global warming will make it harder to play Switch 2 outside</h2> <p>Tomorrow it’s going to basically be 100 degrees in Kyoto, Japan, where Nintendo is headquartered. After a July that was the hottest month on record ever for Japan, the country is <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/east-asia/heat-records-broken-japan-heatwave-climate-change-5275641">continuing to blaze through temperature records</a>. Nintendo recently took the opportunity to remind fans that playing the Switch 2 in temperatures above 95 degrees is, uh, not great. “When using a Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 in a high-temperature environment, the device’s temperature may rise,” the company <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1951116935409860651">posted</a>. “This could potentially cause malfunctions, so please use it in a location between 5–35°C.” This isn’t the first time the company has had to issue a warning like this. It did a summertime PSA for the original Switch <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-climate-change-temperature-handheld-1849168252">back in 2022</a>. Everything is <a href="https://kotaku.com/it-s-too-hot-to-play-video-games-1847410462">going great</a>, folks.</p> <h2><em>Dynasty Warriors</em> is getting a super, secret remaster</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DYNASTY WARRIORS 25th Anniversary Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-qlDkMLMoSg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Koei Tecmo indicated that a game in the <em>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</em>series is getting remastered (but not which game) in a new trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qlDkMLMoSg">celebrating the series’ 25th anniversary</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-beginner-tips-upgrade-skirmish-1851744251"><em>Dynasty Warriors Origins</em></a>, the entry that came out earlier this year, is also getting more DLC, the company revealed. But longtime fans are more interested in which games from the franchise’s past will get modern updates. <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> <em>3</em>, 4, and 5 are all top of mind for most, though a compilation of all three would probably be ideal. Hell, why not do the whole first six games?</p> <h2>Fight censorship, get free games</h2> <p>Over 1 million people claimed the <a href="https://freedomtobuy.games/">FreedomToBuy bundle</a> from GOG in its 48 hours of being available, <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1951999439024869715">the storefront reports</a>. It included <em>Postal 2</em>, <em>Agon</em>y, <em>Fetish Locator Week One</em>, and a bunch of even weirder stuff, “because if a game is legal, you should be free to buy it.” The bundle was in response to the recent crackdown on NSFW games on Steam and itch.io <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-itch-io-sex-game-nsfw-censor-visa-mastercard-1851787281">due to payment processors</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> isn’t getting delayed</h2> <p>The year is more than half over and we still don’t know when<em> Metroid Prime 4</em> is coming out. Some fans feared the game could slip to 2026 after it was a no-show during a recent Nintendo Partner Direct. But the company recently announced it will be playable at the Fan Expo Canada <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/fan-expo-canada-attendees-will-have-access-to-play-the-latest-and-upcoming-titles-on-nintendo-switch-2/">near the end of August</a>. A November release date is feeling more and more likely.</p> <h2>Happy 40th Birthday Rare</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614509" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614509"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614509">8bitdo</figcaption></figure> <p>Someone on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Controller/comments/1mh6aho/new_wireless_8bitdo_xbox_controller_leaked_on/">found a leaked Amazon listing</a> for an 8bitdo Xbox controller commemorating <a href="https://x.com/RareLtd/status/1952327433010491560">the 40th anniversary</a> of Rare, the studio best known for<em> Donkey Kong Country</em>, <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, and <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, among other iconic classics. It’s $90 and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FHQ6P7TQ?tag=kotaku01-20">looks very nice</a>.

This isn't the first time that the public has been able to go hands-on with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and Nintendo's statement confirms that the game will still launch within the next five months.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p><em>When </em>it will launch in this period still remains uncertain. Nintendo has been spacing out first-party releases for the Switch 2, starting with Mario Kart World as a Switch 2 launch game in June, Donkey Kong Bananza in July, Drag x Drive in August, and Pokemon Legends: Z-A is scheduled to arrive on October 15. If the pattern holds up, it's not unlikely that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond could arrive during the lucrative holiday season as a must-have Switch 2 game, considering that the console already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">has an install base of 6 million users and counting</a>.</p><p>This will bring a lengthy development cycle to a close for Nintendo, following the company's decision to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4s-development-restarted-with-retro-/1100-6464593/">restart development in 2019</a> after it failed to reach the standards that the company expected of it, under Bandai Namco. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-re-revealed-with-impressive-trailer-and-2025-release-date/1100-6524332/">The game was re-revealed in 2024</a>, and since then, we've seen a trickle of new gameplay showing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-on-switch-2-will-let-you-swap-to-mouse-controls-on-the-fly/1100-6530602/">off action and mouse controls</a>.</p>
