			<p>It isn't surprising that a company like Konami would want to make the game a PlayStation exclusive, especially since the original Silent Hill 2 was created for PlayStation 2 before going to Xbox the year after. In an interview with Bloober Team, they also mentioned that they had to fight hard to get the Silent Hill 2 remake on PC. While the game will have performed very well on its own if it was released exclusively on PlayStation 5, having it on additional platforms gives it even more opportunity to perform and become a financial success for both Bloober Team and Konami.</p>
<p>In regards to the financial success of the game, they say they haven't hit all of their milestones as of yet but that they are consistently changing in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Bloober-Team-spodziewa-sie-kolejnych-rozliczen-z-Konami-za-kamienie-milowe-8818376.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview with Bankier</a>.&nbsp;However, it's expected that the release of Silent Hill 2 in October will have a significant impact on their financial results in the fourth quarter. Producer Piotr Babieno has noted that most of the revenue for Silent Hill 2 will come from those who purchase it on Silent Hill 2. However, he is very aware that there is significant interest in the game from those who are PC gamers.</p>
<p>"Silent Hill 2 is definitely a game that has been associated with the PlayStation brand from the very beginning," says Babieno. However, the game has seen remakes and mods made for PC, as well as high-definition releases for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. "At the very beginning, we had to push Konami very hard to focus on the PC. For them, the main market is PlayStation, but looking at the interest on the Steam platform it seems that it should also be a successful launch."</p>
<p>While they can't say how the milestones are distributed, it's said that the company's president is able to note that Konami is very pleased with the cooperation thus far with Bloober Team, so much so that they want to continue working with Konami in the future. "You can expect that this is not the end of the adventure with Konami," says the president. This perhaps means that there will be more Silent Hill remakes in the future, as the first game in the franchise and Silent Hill 3 are all equally well-loved and are iconic games in the franchise.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-gets-hours-of-pc-gameplay-from-review-build/">release of Silent Hill 2</a> isn't far away, with the game being released on October 8, 2024, on both PC and PlayStation 5. To purchase the game, it will cost $69.99, with the Digital Deluxe version costing $79.99.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bioware-speaks-on-how-balancing-reappearing-characters-and-solas-role-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The release date for Dragon Age: The Veilguard is fast approaching, and the developers are conducting interviews with plenty of different outlets to answer their burning questions about the upcoming game and what to expect from it. This game is entirely single-player, something which people weren't sure of whether that would go ahead under EA. John Epler, the Creative Director for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, said that the one definite thing throughout the near-decade of development was Solas being at the front and center. "There was never a version of the story of Dragon Age 4 where Solas was not at the center," he says in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview with IGN</a>.</p>
<p>Solas has always been an iconic character in the franchise, despite only being in Inquisition. He has gone from being a gentle, mysterious <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-features-companions-ability-wheel-for-strategic-combat-romance-has-no-limitations/">companion</a> to a mainstay in Veilguard. The "bones" of the story were always going to come from what happened in the story of the Trespasser DLC in Dragon Age: Inquisition. Dragon Age: The Veilguard has undergone many changes and evolutions to try and perfect the story. "There were different versions of the story. There were versions of the story where maybe you didn't necessarily progress as far in your fight against Solas, but Solas has always been at the center of Dragon Age 4."</p>
<p>For this game, Rook was designed to be "almost a mirror of Solas." This design gives the player plenty of new interactions and conversations between Rook and Solas, which can help expand their relationship.</p>
<p>Dragon Age is known for having some really iconic characters throughout, and they've had to decide which ones will appear in Dragon Age: The Veilguard and how to avoid making it overwhelmingly full of cameos.</p>
<p>In another vein, during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-roundtable-qa-the-conclusion-to-this-game-needs-to-matter/">Q&amp;A</a> portion of The Veilguard's preview event earlier in the month, BioWare was asked how they decided who to include in the game as side characters or even just cameos from the existing cast.</p>
<p>"It honestly comes down to: Do they have more of a story to tell. We don't want to just bring back characters so you can be like, 'Hey, I recognize that person!' but certain characters have more to their story."</p>
<p>While many characters won't be appearing in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, some fan favorites will. For example, Morrigan, an incredibly popular character, will appear again. Not only that, but the previous protagonist will also be showing up, and players will get to see The Inquisitor show up.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> is either a high-fantasy Persona or a Shin Megami Tensei with cool fonts and a warm heart.

<p>You'll find the prologue demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2679460/Metaphor_ReFantazio/">the game's Steam page</a> or on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3130330/Metaphor_ReFantazio__Prologue_Demo/">its own dedicated Steam page</a>. You can write a review of the demo on the latter, maybe, as per Steam's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-has-made-it-easier-to-find-download-and-even-review-game-demos">recent changes for demos</a>. 
</p>
<p>The demo features the beginning of Metaphor's story, where "the protagonist sets out on a journey to save his best friend, the prince" and participates in an election to become the new king. Is that how kings work now? You'll be able to fight through the game's first four dungeons and unlock seven of its 40 character classes, here called Archetypes. Your progress will carry over to the full game, should you choose to purchase it.
</p>
<p>Metaphor has more than fonts to draw comparisons with Persona. Although not set on a school with a rigid class timetable, how you manage time remains important in the game, and you'll spend daylight hours adventurin', fightin', treasure-me-doin' and the evenings making friends. Maybe you can make friends with the tooth-with-a-face James was enamoured by, I do not know.
</p>
<p>If it's not clear, this is made by Persona and Shin Megami Tensei developers Atlus, with its design led by Personas 3-5 director Katsura Hashino. They can crib from themselves, it's fine. Recommended, even.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

BioWare’s fantasy RPG series has previously followed in the footsteps of <em>Mass Effect</em> and let you import your world state so you could have some continuity in your <em>Dragon Age II</em> and <em>Inquisition</em> playthroughs. This could include choices like if you sided with a faction in a holy war, or smaller decisions like who you smooched while trying to save the world. <em>Dragon Age II</em> read your first game’s save file, and <em>Inquisition</em> had a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://dragonagekeep.com/en_US/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://dragonagekeep.com/en_US/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">separate online app</a></span> that let you meticulously flag nearly every decision, big and small, on the off-chance that they might be relevant in a future game. <em>The Veilguard </em>is making things a bit more simple and will just ask you about a few key decisions in the character creator.<br></p><p>In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span>, creative director John Epler explained that the choice to trim things down to three key decisions was made so the team could meaningfully represent those choices. Much of <em>The Veilguard </em>takes place in northern areas of the series’ world rather than the ones in the south featured in the first three games, and the status of things in those other regions isn’t necessarily relevant to the new game’s story.</p><p>“Our philosophy when it comes to integrating past player choices and world states is wherever possible we want to avoid contradicting what has happened before. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112?_gl=1*122inm0*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzI4ODY2NC4xODEuMS4xNzI3Mjg4OTUzLjU3LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112?_gl=1*122inm0*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzI4ODY2NC4xODEuMS4xNzI3Mjg4OTUzLjU3LjAuMA..">We never want to invalidate your choices</a></span>,” he says. “For <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, among many reasons why we moved to Northern Thedas is it becomes a little bit more of a clean slate for us. There’s not as many decisions you have made up to this point that have an impact on what’s happening in Northern Thedas. And we don’t have to speak directly to things like who is the Divine? Because again, that’s happening in the South.”</p><p>“There’s never a sense of, ‘Oh, that decision doesn’t exist.’ But maybe we don’t touch on it in this particular title,” he says. “Much like <em>Inquisition</em> didn’t touch on every decision from <em>Origins</em>, much like <em>DA2</em> didn’t touch on every decision from <em>Origins</em>, it’s kind of in that same vein of we’re not going to contradict it. We just may not always reference it directly.”</p><p>We got to play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-bioware-rook-solas-rpg-1851648350&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-bioware-rook-solas-rpg-1851648350">seven hours of <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></span><em> </em>earlier this month, and part of that demo included messing around with the character creator. First, you make Rook, your new hero in <em>The Veilguard</em>. Second, you make the Inquisitor, the protagonist of <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. After you’ve finalized their appearance, you’re asked a few questions about the Inquisitor’s story so they can be properly recognized in your <em>Veilguard</em> playthrough. Here’s a rundown of the choices that carry forward:</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="86e8783d30e758b1d447d3fceb0d19d2" data-recommend-id="image://86e8783d30e758b1d447d3fceb0d19d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dorian holds the Inquisitor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dorian holds the Inquisitor." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="86e8783d30e758b1d447d3fceb0d19d2" data-recommend-id="image://86e8783d30e758b1d447d3fceb0d19d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dorian holds the Inquisitor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This one’s straightforward: Who did your Inquisitor have sexy sleepovers with while trying to stop the god-wannabe Corypheus?

So if you’re making a male Inquisitor, you won’t be able to put that he was in a relationship with Sera, or that non-elf female Inquisitor romanced Solas. There’s also an option to say the Inquisitor didn’t get with anyone, if you, for some reason, chose the lonely road.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e16c23ac15dedc254059d1536903fb1c" data-recommend-id="image://e16c23ac15dedc254059d1536903fb1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor addresses a room while holding a book." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor addresses a room while holding a book." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e16c23ac15dedc254059d1536903fb1c" data-recommend-id="image://e16c23ac15dedc254059d1536903fb1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor addresses a room while holding a book." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The next two choices specifically refer to <em>Inquisition</em>’s <em>Trespasser </em>DLC, which capped off the story two years after the events of the base game. <em>Trespasser </em>is all about a dispute between the Inquisition, the religious institution known as the Chantry, and local governments who fear the organization is becoming too powerful as an independent, militarized force. At the end of the expansion, the player is asked to either disband the Inquisition or surrender control of it to the church. There are compelling reasons for either, as disbanding would keep the Inquisitor’s inner circle small and less open to infiltration while operating under the church would give them far more resources for the incoming threat but open them up to traitors in their ranks.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c1959b60495274f24d20908087f5fcef" data-recommend-id="image://c1959b60495274f24d20908087f5fcef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor decides how to handle Solas." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor decides how to handle Solas." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c1959b60495274f24d20908087f5fcef" data-recommend-id="image://c1959b60495274f24d20908087f5fcef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor decides how to handle Solas." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In <em>Trespasser</em>, the Inquisitor meets with Solas, the party-member-turned-antagonist who was secretly an elven god called the Dread Wolf. The DLC reveals he plans to tear down the Veil, a barrier between the real world and the spirit world known as the Fade, in an effort to bring the elven race to its former glory. Doing so will result in death and destruction for the rest of the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe, but Solas believes this to be an atonement for erecting the wall in the first place to seal away the ancient, corrupt elven gods of old. In their final conversation, the Inquisitor is able to tell Solas one of two things: they will stop him by any means necessary, or they will find a way to save him from himself. How this will manifest itself in <em>The Veilguard </em>remains to be seen, but it’s ultimately determining whether or not your old hero still views Solas as a friend or just a threat to the world.</p><hr><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 31.

<p>Ubisoft stock prices have continued to fall amid apparent company turmoil. </p>



<p>At market close in the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UBI-FR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">UK and Europe</a>, Ubisoft stock prices were down 4.5% for the day down to €11.42/£11.42 per share. In the US, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UBSFY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it has fallen</a> over 10% on the day to $2.35 per share.</p>



<p>The falls mark new 52-week and 10-year lows for the company. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The trend of Ubisoft stock <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-price-falling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prices falling has been on-going</a>, and doesn’t appear to be slowing down. While they aren’t at all-time record lows, the company is looking for ways to turn things around before they approach that level. </p>



<p>For context on how much it’s fallen, on February 14, 2024 Ubisoft shares were trading at €24.39/£24.39 per share in the Europe and UK. That same day in the US, they were trading at $5.18 per share. That marks a drop off 53.2% and 54.6%, respectively, in just seven months. Looking back just four years ago and shares have fallen from 87% from October 2020’s high of $19.24.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, they <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced an investigation</a> into the workings of the company. This investigation by Ubisoft’s Executive Committee and Board of Directors will include a full review of the company, including “further improving our execution, notably in this player-centric approach, and accelerating our strategic path towards a higher performing model to the benefit of our stakeholders and shareholders.”</p>







<p>In addition to the investigation, it was confirmed that Star Wars Outlaws <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-underperformed-ubisoft-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performed below expectations</a> in terms of sales, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows was delayed</a> until February 2025. </p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Bungie is adding new ways of maintaining challenge to some of the main activities of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>, starting with new modifiers to enemies that'll start popping up randomly in its next content drop.</p><p dir="ltr">The new modifiers, called Banes, will require players to change strategy as they encounter enemies afflicted with them. Bungie detailed the Banes in a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/combatant_modifiers">blog post</a> running down <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-is-changing-destiny-2-approach-to-content-as-it-begins-a-new-multi-year-saga/1100-6526354/" data-ref-id="1100-6526354">changes coming to the game with Codename: Frontiers</a>, its next two content expansions. The developer will test at least two of those Banes in Episode: Revenant, Destiny 2's next content addition, which releases on October 8.</p><p dir="ltr">As Bungie describes them, Banes can appear randomly on enemies as you make your way through something like a Nightfall Strike. They're a bit like less- intense versions of the Champion enemies currently in the game. One Bane, Meteors, causes an enemy to randomly spawn Solar Meteors that fly through the air and track players, but can be shot down--similar to what the end boss of the Proving Grounds Strike throws at players now. Another, Shock, sees an enemy building up an electric shock that can then be discharged onto a player target within line-of-sight. If you kill the enemy with the Shock Bane, the effect can transfer to other, nearby enemies. You can see them in action in Bungie's video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMrJeez2W8g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BMrJeez2W8g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">You'll know enemies sporting a Bane based on a big, colorful crescent that hovers over their head, which also indicates what kind of Bane you're dealing with. Other Banes Bungie detailed included Punchable, where an enemy has an unbreakable shield until someone hits it with a melee attack; Berserk, where the enemy with the Bane causes nearby enemies to gain the Enrage buff and become more powerful; and Nuclear, where the Bane enemy explodes in a Solar shockwave after a certain amount of time passes once it hits low health.</p><p dir="ltr">All of the Banes are still in development, according to the blog post, so how they work in-game and what they end up looking like is still subject to change. Bungie also noted that Banes won't be applied to Champions, at least in Revenant, and that Banes won't stack on a single enemy.</p><p dir="ltr">Banes are part of Bungie's larger approach to changing PvE activities in Destiny 2 to increase their challenge and make them more fun to replay over and over, since replaying activities is a central part of Destiny 2's MMO design. In addition to Banes showing up randomly while you're fighting enemies, you can expect larger Enemy and Combat Modifiers to be applied to different content to change up how you approach it.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of these have already been in the game--Surges applied to specific element types, for example, are a Combat Modifier that can change how players approach an activity. As for Enemy Modifiers, Bungie hints that you might see some enemies dropping boobytrapped loot, an element from the Trickster boss that appeared in the Forsaken expansion's campaign.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie writes that it's looking to add new modifiers to both enemy behavior, giving them new powers or requirements to defeat, and player combat, but it wants to move away from modifiers requiring players to come into an activity with custom loadouts in order to deal with or take advantage of them. That doesn't mean it's replacing all the modifiers that are currently in the game, but it sounds like at least some of them are getting reworked or replaced by new ones in keeping with the new design goals Bungie has laid out for Codename: Frontiers.</p>

		<p>Square Enix has announced that it is releasing Triangle Strategy as a VR title, and it will be released on Meta Quest 2 and 3. You will not have to wait too long to get your hands on Triangle Strategy in VR, as it will be launching on October 31st. You can check out the announcement trailer, which shows the gameplay in VR.</p>

<p>In a description for the VR version of Triangle Strategy, Square Enix has said, <em>“You’ll get a better view of the battlefield with 360-degree movement that lets you see the conflict how you want. Controlling characters is a snap and incredibly immersive thanks to intuitive VR controls that let you place characters, take actions and define battle strategies with ease.Yes, the fate of Serenoa and his allies is now in your hands (well, in a pair of controllers technically, but you take our point).The game also supports Meta Quest’s Passthrough feature on Meta Quest 3 which lets you mesh the game’s environments with real-world surroundings. It’s fun, engaging and… well, just really cool.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/triangle-strategy/5340130476095884/">Pre-orders for Triangle Strategy</a> on Meta Quest 2 and 3 are live now, with the full price being £22.99. However, there is a pre-order discount of 13% which knocks the price down to £19.99 until it releases.</p>

<p>In our Triangle Strategy review, Dom said, <em>“Triangle Strategy is a beautiful and authentic tactical RPG. Fans of Fire Emblem in particular will love the involving narrative on top of the strategic action – just be prepared for a slow start as it sets its expansive story in motion.”</em></p>

<p>HBO is currently working on bringing the second season of The Last of Us to life, but there are still a few months before it’s ready to air. In recent weeks, we’ve seen set photos leak from inside the production, revealing costumes, locations, story points, and some of the newly casted actors in roles pulled straight from The Last of Us Part II (2020). </p>



<p>Recently, Neil Druckmann, the series’ creator and head at Naughty Dog, sat down with Variety to talk about the expectations for the second season of the award-winning live-action adaptation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-diving-deeper">Diving Deeper</h2>



<p>One thing that the first season did so well was setting up a little more meat on the bones in terms of backstories for the characters, both lead <strong>and </strong>supporting. There was an entire episode dedicated to the origin story of Bill and Frank, relatively understated characters in the game but the source of an intense and deeply emotional sub-story in the television series.</p>



<p>It was that episode that pulled in one of The Last of Us’ Emmy Awards.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/last-of-us-season-2-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-strictly-business-1236155347/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">speaking recently to Variety</a>, Druckmann suggested that the concept of diving into important backstories will surface again in the second season:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>And there’s stuff in this season that I’m really excited about — stuff that we hinted at — one scene in particular comes to mind that I think fans of the game will eat up, because it really kind of tells you a lot of backstory of this important character that there wasn’t really a way for us to even do that in the game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That could be any number of characters. The Last of Us Part II is diverse, lengthy, and brings together a wild cast of characters in a story that unravels over many hours. Many have suggested that it could be an exploration of ‘Lev’, a runaway ‘Seraphite’ in the game who forms a tight bond with Abby, one of the game’s antagonists.</p>



<p>Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin have been true to the source material of The Last of Us while at the same time pushing their creative license into new ways to portray the universe that was uncovered when the franchise began way back in 2013. There are very few faults with the first season, and the hype for the second remains consistent and high – I’m expecting great things.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Meta Quest 3S Finally Announced, Launches October 15]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/meta-quest-3s-revealed-vr/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/meta-quest-3s-finally-announced-launches-october-15.992202/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/meta-quest-3s-revealed-vr/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Mark ‘The Zuck’ Zuckerberg has taken to the stage at Meta Connect, and one of the first items on his agenda was the official reveal of the Meta Quest 3S. This all-new virtual reality headset represents a more accessible entry point into the world of VR gaming and applications. It’s hitting the market on October 15, and given the specification and price point, it could be one of the best options for anyone picking up their first VR headset.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-bit-of-this-a-bit-of-that">A Bit of This, a Bit of That</h2>



<p>The Meta Quest 3S VR headset is a bit of a mix-and-match device that incorporates elements of the Meta Quest 2 <strong>and </strong>the Meta Quest 3. It features slightly older lenses that might not offer as solid a viewing experience, but it has the same chipset as the Meta Quest 3, which means there’s parity in terms of what it can play, display, and operate.</p>



<p>However, if we put the ‘older’ technology to the side for a second, we’re presented with a VR headset that sits at a very attractive price point. It was confirmed that a 128 GB version of the headset will be released in October for just $300, while the 256 GB version will run with a $400 price tag.</p>



<p>It’ll feature full-colour passthrough technology and a battery life that’s more or less comparable with the Quest 3, it just won’t offer as solid an experience from a viewing perspective, but that’s only because of the less sophisticated lenses.</p>



<p>It also uses the same controllers as the Meta Quest 3, which are easy to get to grips with an very responsive.</p>



<p>If you’ve been hurting for a relatively affordable VR experience, you can’t go wrong with a Meta Quest headset, and now that the 3S is on the horizon, you can get involved for even less. I picked up a Meta Quest 3 a few weeks ago after experiencing the terrifying wonder of Metro Awakening at Gamescom, and I can confirm that it’s the most immersive way to play games that you’ll ever witness.</p>



<p>At least, until we’re plugging ourselves into devices –  but that’s at least a few years away yet.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft's financial disclosures this week don't have a lot of good news for investors, especially since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">Star Wars Outlaws</a> debuted to disappointing sales and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">Assassin's Creed Shadows has been delayed</a> to 2025. However, the company did offer an encouraging update about its relationship with Steam. Ubisoft has reversed its previous stance and will now release both Star Wars Outlaws and Assassin's Creed Shadows on Steam, along with other day-one releases.</p><p>In 2019, Ubisoft executive Chris Early explained why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-business-model-is-unrealistic-ubisoft-execu/1100-6469434/" data-ref-id="1100-6469434">the company had pulled back from Steam</a> and shared his thoughts on its business model. "It's unrealistic, the current business model they have," said Early. "It doesn't reflect where the world is today in terms of game distribution."</p><p>Instead of releasing games through Steam, Ubisoft dropped titles through its own online store and via the Epic Games Store. It was widely assumed that Ubisoft continued to support Epic because it takes a smaller percentage of game sales than Steam does. Ubisoft's decision to rethink its relationship with Steam may mean that the company believes it can increase its sales by utilizing that store's wider reach.</p><p>Star Wars Outlaws will hit Steam on November 21, while Assassin's Creed Shadow will be released on Steam simultaneously with its debut on consoles on February 14, 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-of-providence-sets-bigmode-up-for-another-success.992187/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/star-of-providence-sets-bigmode-up-for-another-success<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New publisher <a href="https://bigmode.com/">Bigmode</a>, owned by the YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/videogamedunkey">videogamedunkey</a>, knocked it out of the park with the company's first title, <em>Animal Well</em>. This indie developed by Billy Basso exceeded expectations from press, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/animal-well-review-icebergs-worth-of-puzzles-deep-below-surface">TechRaptor included</a>. With such an outstanding reception, many are excited to see what comes next for Bigmode, and that game is <em>Star of Providence</em>.</p>
<p>But here's the thing: <em>Star of Providence</em> is already out. It's been out since 2017, and you can buy it on Steam right now. While not unheard of for games to get a new publisher after release, Bigmode's decision to publish this title seemed like a confusing one.</p>
<p>After playing a demo for <em>Star of Providence</em> at PAX West 2024, I wanted to get to the bottom of things.</p>

<h2>What's Bigmode's Role in <em>Star of Providence</em>?</h2>
<p>As it turns out, <em>Star of Providence</em> is insanely fun. How did I miss <em>Star of Providence </em>after so long? Well, the thing to keep in mind is that <em>Star of Providence</em> once went by the title <em>Monolith</em>, which might be one source of confusion. Leah Gastrow of Bigmode was able to provide more context to the publishing decision.</p>
<p>"<em>Star of Providence</em> is a game that, despite its initial Steam release in 2017 and having a dedicated and loving fanbase, we would consider a largely hidden gem," said Gastrow. "Our goals partnering with Team D-13 are broadly - supporting a Switch console launch, localizing to many new languages, funding as the team finishes work on a major content update they have had in the works for a couple of years, and bringing more eyes to the project. We really hope that we’ll be able to translate what’s so special and fun about the game, giving it its day in the sun!"</p>

<p>Bigmode's decision to publisher <em>Star of Providence</em> is a good lesson on the role of publishers in the industry; as Gastrow mentioned, Bigmode brings support in porting the game as well as bringing in a large update for both PC and the Switch version. Having the publisher attached should also create a new fervor for the title.</p>
<p>"It’s come a long way since then and been polished into a real masterwork," said Gastrow. "Some standouts you’ll notice are the buttery smooth controls paired with heart-pounding action and epic, vast soundtrack from Garoslaw. Members of the dev team have also worked with Toby Fox contributing to <em>Deltarune</em>, and all were testers of the game <em>Void Stranger</em>, a sokoban-style puzzle game released in 2023. Basically, they’re the real deal making a real-deal game that we want to do our best to shine a spotlight on and help achieve the success it deserves."</p>

<h2>But is it Fun? Yes, <em>Star of Providence </em>is Very Fun</h2>
<p>Based on my time with the demo from PAX West, <em>Star of Providence</em> is most definitely a special game. I went so far as to buy it on PC to do some <em>brief </em>research on this very article, and found myself addicted to its core gameplay loop. I see what Bigmode sees -- <em>Star of Providence</em> is another hit for the publisher.</p>
<p>To be concise, <em>Star of Providence</em> is a retro-inspired dungeon crawler with SHMUP and roguelite elements. The synthesis between these genres creates a harmonious gameplay loop, one that seems perfect for the portable nature of the Switch.</p>

<p>You pilot this little starship, exploring dungeons room-by-room a la the original <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. With randomized elements, obstacles and enemy placement vary as you progress and get progressively harder as you navigate different floors of the dungeon. No, it's not an unheard of concept, but the way it's executed is what makes <em>Star of Providence</em> so addicting.</p>
<p>Rooms take seconds to clear, so combat is extremely fast. You're constantly awarded with new treasures in the form of weapons, health, and ammo and even stronger upgrades as you progress, making it addicting.</p>
<p>Dying isn't the end since the metaprogression of <em>Star of Providence</em> assures players will have new weapons and other upgrades to play with in subsequent runs. Perhaps the strongest element of <em>Star of Providence</em> are its weapons, with various keywords that change the characteristics of your projectiles.</p>

<p>RNG can grant you this godkilling weapon that homes in on enemies and blasts them constantly with a stream of ridiculous damage, or a not-so-great weapon that's slow and takes time to charge. When you get that big weapon and plow through the rest of your run, that's where <em>Star of Providence</em> shines.</p>
<p>If there was any worry that Bigmode would have a sophomore slump with its next game, well, <em>Star of Providence</em> assuages any fears. Though it's already out, the big content update and launch on the Switch should be the best time to dive into what is possibly your next gaming addiction -- I already know it has <em>me </em>hooked.</p>

<p>It has been revealed that Microsoft intends to shut down the Xbox Game Pass mobile application in November, instead utilising a single application – the Xbox app – to house everything under one roof. Presently, you’ll likely have installed both Xbox Game Pass and the Xbox app on your mobile device – but within a few weeks, the former application will be sunsetted.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-in-one">All In One</h2>



<p>From November, there will be just <strong>one </strong>Xbox application on mobile devices, with Microsoft opting to scrap the Game Pass app. That means that everything from interacting with friends and downloading screenshots to remotely installing content on an Xbox console will be done through the new app. It’ll be a one-stop shop for all things Xbox-related, and that includes unlocking perks and other rewards.</p>



<p>In a blog post penned by Microsoft, it was confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>These updates will be available for Xbox beta members on mobile and will be coming to everyone soon. As part of these changes, we will no longer support new downloads of the Xbox Game Pass app, starting in November.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It still won’t be possible to stream games via the cloud to your mobile device using the application, but you can still use a mobile <strong>browser </strong>to accomplish that. It’s an awkward workaround, but it’s the best you’ve got until the dust settles around debates regarding cloud streaming.</p>



<p>It’s a small change that isn’t likely to move mountains, but it’s something of a quality-of-life improvement, and that’s just fine with me.</p>

<p>After what Ubisoft says was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-underperformed-ubisoft-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an underperforming launch</a>, the developers of Star Wars Outlaws have taken <a href="https://x.com/StarWarsOutlaws/status/1838971704820801966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to social media</a> to promise players continued improvements on the game.</p>



<p>In their post, the developers started off by thanking players for the support of the game since its launch. They went on to say that the team is “hard at work” on new updates to the game that will bring a number of fixes, features, and improvements.</p>







<p>“We’re hard at work creating multiple title updates, which will bring optimization, gameplay polishing and tweaks as well as quality of life changes including adjustments to combat and stealth gameplay,” the statement reads.</p>



<p>In addition to the promises of improvement, it was confirmed that the game’s first story pack, Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card, will launch on November 21. That date coincides with the game’s release on Steam.</p>



<p>“[Wild Card] will see Kay and Nix infiltrate a high-stakes Sabacc tournament where they will face off against the legendary Lando Calrissian,” they said. “In addition, new contracts will be added free for all players.”</p>



<p>What do you think of the promises of improvement to Star Wars Outlaws by the developers? Do you think it’s too late for the game to turn things around?

                <p>Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom's release is tomorrow, where players can play as the titular character for the first time in the main series. Here, Zelda finds herself on a quest to save Link and the kingdom of Hyrule. Aiding her is the fairy Tri, who entrusts the princess with the magical Tri Rod that gives Zelda new powers for puzzle-solving and defeating enemies. The visual style is similar to that of the 2019 remake of The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening.</p><p>Available exclusively on the Nintendo Switch, Echoes of Wisdom takes players not only to Hyrule this time around but also the all-new Still World, which is connected to Hyrule through rifts that lead to a different section of it. It's a place where people, places, and objects are frozen in time. Much like many entries in the Zelda franchise, there are dungeons, each with a boss that must be defeated to progress the story. Many familiar faces of Hyrule lore appear throughout the game, including the Deku Scrubs, Gerudo, Gorons, and river and ocean Zora.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1217511310" data-promo-id="0"

            <p>
After a succession of leaks, Meta has officially unveiled its lower-priced Meta Quest 3S headset line-up, which launches on 15th October.
</p>
<p>
Meta Quest 3S starts at £289.99/$299.99 USD with 128GB of storage, but there's also a 256GB option priced at £379.99/$399.99. To put that into context, the 128GB Meta Quest 2 weighs in at around $199.99, and the 128GB Quest 3 now costs $429.99. However, Meta has confirmed it's phasing out Quest 2, the Quest Pro, and the 128GB version of Quest 3 - leaving just the 512GB Quest 3 (now slashed by $150 to $499.99) as an alternative.
</p>
<p>
As for specs, the Meta Quest 3S' innards are similar to those of the Meta Quest 3, and the inclusion of the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset means it'll be able to play previously Quest 3-exclusive games. The major differences, however - beyond a slightly larger form factor and no depth sensor - are a narrower field of view and a reduction in display resolution - with the 3S coming it in at 1832 x 1920 per eye, compared to the Meta Quest 3's 2064 x 2208.

<p>
At £290, though, the Meta Quest 3S still sounds like a strong proposition for the VR curious, particularly as it's bundled with the Quest 3's slick Touch Plus controllers, three months of Meta Quest+, and a copy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-shadow">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a>. Eurogamer's Tom Phillips was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-shadow-might-be-vr-but-its-the-first-dc-game-since-arkham-knight-im-actually-excited-for">impressed by this new canonical VR instalment</a> of Rocksteady's acclaimed Arkham series when he played it earlier this year, and Meta clearly thinks it's winner too - it's also being bundled with all new Meta Quest 3 purchases made between now and 30th April next year.
</p>
<p>
Meta Quest 3S launches on 16th October, and <a href="https://www.meta.com/gb/quest/quest-3s/">pre-orders</a> open today.

		<p>Grizzly Games has confirmed that its minimalist strategy game Thronefall will be leaving Early Access on October 11th, and that it will be released on Nintendo Switch the same day. The full release of Thronefall includes new levels, taking the total to 10, new hero units balanced by new enemies, weapons, and perks.</p>
<p><iframe title="Thronefall Full Release (Trailer) - OUT NOW!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-3EK6fbkAH4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“We’re so grateful for the attention&nbsp;Thronefall&nbsp;has gotten since we launched into Steam Access. The reception has been far beyond anything we had imagined,”</em> says Jonas Tyroller. <em>“With the most recent editions and the Nintendo Switch launch, we hope there’s something in it for everyone to enjoy and brings the game to more people; from the kid who’s playing their very first strategy game to the veteran who simply doesn’t have time to sink hundreds of hours into learning how to play something new..”</em></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/03/thronefall-review/">Thronefall Review</a></h2>
<p>Since its Early Access launch, Thronefall has sold nearly a million copies, been wishlisted over 550,000 times, and received a lot of positive reviews. I played the early access release of Thronefall last year, and in my early access review, I said, <em>“Thronefall may be a minimalist strategy title, but it is big in heart and has a lot of depth to it. It is a game that is simple to play, but will challenge you at every turn. It is incredibly tough to put Thronefall down as it has that one more turn feel down to a tee. The challenge will be offputting for some, and there is a possible bug of enemies running around a wall, but other than that Thronefall is worth your time.”</em></p>

<p>In our Metaphor: ReFantazio preview, Dom said, <em>“A mouthful in all senses, Metaphor: ReFantazio, an original IP from Studio Zero – a team made up of Persona veterans – continues to stretch the word soup of game names to its limit. But what does it mean? Well, just like part of its namesake, it’s an idea, a comparison, and an image that is designed to take your mind to unexpected places. This becomes even more clear when you actually play it, with Metaphor: ReFantazio drawing on the grotesque and off-kilter ideas of the Persona franchise and spinning them out into an all-new RPG experience…Our hands on gave us a massive taste of the world that Studio Zero are building, and it looks utterly fantastic across the board. Persona fans, or those seeking this year’s freshest RPG experience, should be salivating at the prospect.”</em></p>

<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio will be releasing October 11th for PC, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

The AssCreed faithful have waited a thousand years for a sequel set in feudal Japan, birthplace of ninjas and samurai. Woe unto ye dreamers of Ubisoft takes on Tenchu, for you must carry that candle for a little longer. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has been delayed till next year. It was due to launch on 12th November 2024 - now, it will release on 14th February 2025.

<p>
The news comes in the shape of <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/09/25/2953181/0/en/Ubisoft-updates-its-financial-targets-for-FY2024-25.html">an updating of Ubisoft's targets</a> for the financial year 2024-2025, primarily in response to the "softer than expected launch for Star Wars Outlaws". According to Uncle Ubi, Assassin's Creed Shadows is "feature complete", but needs more time in the oven to avoid a similarly dismal showing.
</p>
<p>
"While the game is feature complete, the learnings from the Star Wars Outlaws release led us to provide additional time to further polish the title," the statement reads. "This will enable the biggest entry in the franchise to fully deliver on its ambition, notably by fulfilling the promise of our dual protagonist adventure, with Naoe and Yasuke bringing two very different gameplay styles."
</p>
<p>
In news that will delight the ears of people who think live service expansion roadmaps are the Devil's downloadables, Ubisoft are also "departing from the traditional Season Pass model", though players who preorder the game will be granted the first expansion for free. Shadows will also now "mark the return of our new releases on Steam Day 1" - it'll launch there rather than being exclusive at first on Ubisoft's own storefront. Makes sense - I'm pretty sure Steam has a larger audience than Ubisoft's own store, given that I'd forgotten they had one.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft haven't washed their hands of Outlaws just yet. They're going to update it extensively ahead of the Steam launch on 21st November. "In response to player feedback, Ubisoft's development teams are currently fully mobilized to swiftly implement a series of updates to polish and improve the player experience in order to engage a large audience during the holiday season to position Star Wars Outlaws as a strong long-term performer," reads the statement. The phrasing here puts me slightly in mind of British generals promising that WW1 will be over by Christmas, but I'm probably being unkind - I hear that Outlaws is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-review">quite good</a>, for a star war.
</p>
<p>
The principal audience for these statements are the investors, of course, from whom Ubisoft have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ubisoft-investor-wants-to-dethrone-ubisofts-founders-so-ubisoft-can-lay-more-developers-off">getting it in the neck</a> lately over their slumping share price and lower-than-hoped returns on blockbuster games. In some accompanying exec commentary, CEO Yves Guillemot acknowledges that "our second quarter performance fell short of our expectations" while promising a greater focus on "player-centric, gameplay-first approach and an unwavering commitment to the long-term value of our brands". He adds that "Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences" are Ubisoft's bread and butter. 
</p>
<p>
He also makes brief reference to the on-going, ermmm, discussion about the representational politics of Ubisoft's games. In case you missed it, Outlaw's choice of a female lead who doesn't look like an AI-hallucinated Jessica Rabbit has earned it the ire of certain internet misogynists, while Shadows is getting similarly dumped on by racists for having a Black samurai protagonist (if you dislike what you've seen of either game, please don't get mad at me in the comments - there are other reasons to dislike these games!). In keeping with time-honoured company exec practice, Guillemot deals with this by lifting his eyes to the skyline and benevolently refusing to agree with anybody at all.
</p>
<p>
"Finally, let me address some of the polarized comments around Ubisoft lately," he writes. "I want to reaffirm that we are an entertainment-first company, creating games for the broadest possible audience, and our goal is not to push any specific agenda. We remain committed to creating games for fans and players that everyone can enjoy."
</p>
<p>
I saw Assassin's Creed Shadows up close at Summer Games Fest, and it seemed fine as Assassin's Creeds go, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-actually-two-games-competing-for-your-affections">an unusually hearty ratio of stealth and melee</a>. But I can definitely wait till 2025. Delaying an open world blockbusters these days is like postponing a solar eclipse, granting smaller games with no established brand presence a chance to bask in the heat a little. Enjoy the breathing room, uhhhh [checks calendar] <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slitterhead">Slitterhead</a>!

You’ll also be sent to the character select screen each time, with only one player able to choose their team, since the winning player is meant to keep using their team until they lose in arcades. It’s not at all the smooth experience that many are used to nowadays. Thankfully, there is a solution to make the process a little bit more seamless.

This is the most convenient method to get right back in the fight and even the score with your friends. If you’re going to mix the teams up now and then, make the quick save at character select. This might not be as fast, but it certainly beats one player having to stick with their team or needing to quit out of the game entirely.</p><p>A huge caveat is that there can only be one quick save at a time.
