            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-launches-next-year-in-early-access-on-pc-and-xbox-will-also-be-on-game-pass/">October 2024</a>, Krafton and Unknown Worlds announced that Subnautica 2 would be launching in Early Access sometime in 2025. But as we passed the halfway mark of the year, a flurry of unexpected events happened.</p>



<p>It's been some time since we've heard an update regarding this suit, and in between the last update and today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a> happened, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-5-million-audience-overlaps-soulslike/">Silksong was released</a>, and SEGA brought back its <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-calls-out-mario-kart-in-new-trailer-ahead-of-launch/">80s/90s-era tongue-in-cheek ad campaign</a> against Nintendo around its latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-racing-crossworlds/">Sonic Racing game</a>, to name a few things. So you'd be forgiven if you need a refresher. There's a recap at the bottom of this article if you need it, but for now, let's jump into what's current.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/founders-of-subnautica-2-studio-unknown-worlds-accuse-parent-company-krafton-of-changing-story-mid-litigation">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, two of Krafton's requests have been denied by the court: a forensic inspection request and a compelling preservation order, with both being deemed "<em>unnecessary</em>." But more importantly, the denial comes largely due to Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire claiming that Krafton has suddenly changed one of its key arguments.</p>



<p>When Krafton fired the three co-founders, one of the reasons cited in the termination notices was the claim that Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire were trying to release Subnautica 2 before it was ready. That makes sense, since Krafton has claimed time and again that the game simply wasn't ready for its early access launch.</p>



<p>Now, Krafton has changed its argument and has "<em>pivoted to a new theory that it admittedly came up with only after the fact: that it terminated the Founders and seized control because the Founders backed up files they were entitled to access in their work for Unknown Worlds</em>," says Fortis Advisors, the group representing the co-founders.</p>



<p>"<em>Krafton's disorganized retreat raises more questions than answers. To say Krafton's new theory is a Hail Mary would be an understatement - both because the downloads were not wrongful and because Krafton claims not to have learned of them until after it had fired the Founders. The downloads cannot have been the actual motivation for termination</em>."</p>



<p>So, suddenly, it seems that according to Krafton, in this lawsuit, which was filed against them around Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire, alleging, among other things, that they were wrongfully terminated, and where Krafton initially claimed they were terminated because they tried to launch Subnautica 2 before it was ready, the subject of Subnautica 2 being ready or not for launch is not relevant. </p>



<p>Adding to that, the question of Subnautica 2's readiness for launch wasn't why Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire were fired. They were fired because of something Krafton learned about after they had already fired them.</p>



<p>Per a report from <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/the-subnautica-2-lawsuit-is-getting-even-messier-with-krafton-doing-a-massive-u-turn-confusing-both-the-ousted-founders-lawyer-and-the-judge-this-is-a-little-bit-bewildering/">PC Gamer</a>, Krafton is now trying to focus on its claim that the co-founders abandoned their roles, and even the judge presiding over this case is confused by Krafton removing its argument that the co-founders tried to release the game early. "<em>Well, that's something that we definitely need to get to the bottom of today, because that is precisely what was cited as the reason in the answer</em>," said Judge Lori W. Will during a meeting between both sides to deliver a ruling on the motions presented.</p>



<p>PC Gamer also reports that Krafton hasn't been entirely cooperative as this suit kicks up, previously refusing to confer with Fortis Advisors, and only offering what Judge Lori W. Will described as a "<em>very narrow</em>" selection of emails for evidence, only offering ones where the words 'termination' and 'earnout' appeared.</p>



<p>The case is moving forward with both parties agreeing to confer, and we're back to waiting for the next major update.</p>



<p>To say that this has been a messy situation is yet another understatement to tack on to Krafton's alleged 'Hail Mary.' As I've mentioned before, it's unlikely we'll learn the whole truth of the situation, as allegations on both sides seem dire even if there's a bit of truth to them.</p>



<p>We'll continue to provide updates when new information is available. If you need a recap of what's happened before this, you can view it below.</p>



<ul>
<li>On July 2, it was reported that the founders of Unknown Worlds, Ted Gill, Max McGuire, and Charlie Cleveland, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/">were fired</a> and replaced by former Striking Distance Studios head Steve Papoutsis. No concrete explanation for their dismissal was offered at the time, with Krafton instead emphasizing its commitment to delivering a game that players deserved.</li>



<li>On July 3, a <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter">statement from the Unknown Worlds website</a> did its best to calm concerns from fans about the fact that the three original core creatives behind Subnautica were suddenly not at the studio.</li>



<li>The next day, on July 4, the situation began to grow even more confusing, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Cleveland claims</a> Subnautica 2 was "<em>ready for early access release</em>" and that his and his fellow co-founders' dismissals were "<em>quite a shock</em>."</li>



<li>Five days later, on July 9, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">report from Bloomberg</a> adds a shocking allegation to the mix: that Krafton was delaying Subnautica 2 to avoid paying Unknown Worlds a $250 million bonus the studio would have been owed if they hit particular sales goals, which they would have done with Subnautica 2's launch. The delay was <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/">confirmed</a> hours after the report went live, and Krafton held that the delay was due to Subnautica 2 not being ready, citing feedback from internal playtesting.</li>



<li>On July 10, Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/">went on the offensive</a>, blaming co-founders Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire, claiming they had "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles to pursue personal interests. Krafton also clarified that 90% of the aforementioned $250 million bonus would go directly to the co-founders, with the rest to be split among the employees. Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire held that they always intended to distribute the bonus to other employees.</li>



<li>Also on July 10, Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889109175/Fortis-Advisors-v-Krafton-via-Aftermath">filed a lawsuit</a> against Krafton. </li>



<li>On July 11, an<a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-leaked-document-shows-krafton-delay/"> internal document from a milestone review of Subnautica 2's progress leaked</a> on Reddit, seemingly showing further support to Krafton's claims that the game wasn't ready, citing a lack of content on top of previously mentioned internal playtest feedback.</li>



<li>Over the following weekend on July 13, Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">confirmed the documents to be real</a>. </li>



<li>A few days later, on July 17, when the co-founders' suit against Krafton became publicly available, we discovered allegations that Krafton had <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">been sabotaging</a> Subnautica 2 to ensure it would be delayed. There was even a claim that the CEO of Krafton met with the co-founders and admitted that having to pay out the $250 million bonus "<em>could be disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing for Krafton</em>." It also attacks every other claim Krafton had made up to this point, and that the feedback received on Subnautica 2 playtesting "<em>unequivocally proved</em>" the game was ready for an early access launch.</li>



<li>Jumping ahead to August 12, Krafton<a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-fires-back-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-subnautica-2/"> shoots back</a> at Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire's lawsuit, again arguing that the co-founders were absentee leaders who abandoned their roles, and continued to hold that the game wasn't ready for an early access launch.</li>



<li>Eight days later, Unknown Worlds <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-legal-battle-unknown-worlds-files-lawsuit-against-co-founders-krafton/">files its own separate lawsuit</a> against its co-founders, telling Wccftech in an email that this suit "<em>is a direct response to their misconduct, including the theft of confidential information and attempts to pursue personal financial gain to the detriment of the company's interest</em>s<em>."</em></li>
</ul>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-doesnt-want-you-fighting-housework-anymore-its-selling-its-latest-model-with-no-margin-2000627205</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-doesn%E2%80%99t-want-you-struggling-with-housework-it%E2%80%99s-selling-its-latest-model-with-no-margin.1302957/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Budget robot vacuum cleaners have three huge complaints. One, they’re never powerful enough so there’s always still some dust and some crumbs left behind. Two, they usually do mopping not so great so you’re left with streaks or worse still, no way to mop. And three, they need constant maintenance because you have to empty them almost every run. The <strong>Roborock Qrevo S5V</strong>, launched this summer, fixes all of that in one lean machine. Even better, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4199/">Amazon knocked it down to only $549 (from $899), its lowest price yet, which makes it a deal worth paying attention</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4199/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Solves Your Daily Hassles</h2>
<p>The new Roborock Qrevo S5V is all about sheer cleaning power: <strong>Its 12,000Pa HyperForce suction</strong> is several times stronger than many budget models which means it lifts stubborn dirt from rugs, carpets and hard floors. If you’ve struggled with pet hair tangling inside brushes, this model is certified to end that frustration. Roborock uses a floating rubber main brush designed to resist tangles, combined with an arc-shaped side brush that sweeps along edges while avoiding hair buildup.</p>



<p>Mopping is no afterthought here, either. Instead of a single plate scratching the floor, the<strong> FlexiArm design includes two turning mop pads</strong>. They turn around 200 times per minute to buff out stains, down into corners and chair legs. The arm goes so far that the pads can swing into spaces other robots cannot cover. In addition, the mop lifts automatically 10 millimeters when it drives over carpets so you never have soggy rugs. You can control water flow through 30 levels using the companion app to accommodate any floor surfaces, from delicate wood to hard tile.</p>
<p>Then there is the dock which is essentially having an assistant built-in: The device isn’t just dumping the dustbin into a large bin <strong>capable of holding seven weeks’ worth of garbage</strong>. The device also washes the mop pads with clean water and dries them with warm air so that they don’t smell. You won’t have to top it up as frequently either since the dock will charge the water tank in the robot automatically, giving it enough to clean a massive 3,500 square feet on one fill.</p>



<p>Navigation is accomplished by Roborock through LiDAR scanning: It <strong>maps rooms 360 degrees</strong> and then plans effective cleaning routes. If you have a multi-level house, it remembers up to four different floor plans and auto-switches as needed. Structured light sensors have obstacle avoidance, so it won’t chomp toy cars, run into cables, or get stuck under chair legs. In the app, you can even define no-go zones when you know a space is too messy.</p>
<p>For a record-low price of $549, the Qrevo S5V positions itself in a very desirable spot. Numerous competitors within the category either skip better mopping, compromise on suction, or lack a good self-maintenance dock. If you’ve been waiting for a vacuum and mop combo that truly reduces cleaning stress, this is the most convincing deal so far.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released an Unearthed Arcana update for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. This updated batch of playtest material incorporates player feedback and design revisions to new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-revisits-arcane-subclasses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Arcane subclasses</a> for the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG.</p>



<p>In a recent post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/2061-designer-insights-from-unearthed-arcana-arcane" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a>, Wizards of the Coast released the new Unearthed Arcana update for the new D&amp;D arcane subclasses. The post was accompanied by design insight from the development team. The team cited player feedback from the initial playtest period when the first batch of Unearthed Arcana released in June.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-unearthed-arcana-update-transmuter-text.jpg?itok=HK2wVlz0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-unearthed-arcana-update-transmuter-text.jpg?itok=6pEKTZeY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As a result, the new Unearthed Arcana is packed with design notes explaining the changes to the six different character subclasses. Some of these changes include streamlining or redesigning certain class features, adding more versatility, or even bringing back features from the previous edition.</p>

<p>A good example is the Arcane Archer Fighter. The Curving Shot feature, which lets the Fighter redirect a ranged attack to another target, now uses the same piece of ammunition but lets the Fighter make a new attack roll. As for versatility, the subclass now has Magical Ammunition, which lets the Fighter cover an area in darkness, thick vines, or tactically unlock and unbar doors and gates with a magical AoE Knock.</p>

<p>The Tattooed Monk essentially got redesigned in the new Unearthed Arcana update. Much like the refined Warrior of the Elements subclass in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Player Handbook</a>, the Tattooed Monk features aren't directly tied to spells. The Beast Tattoo feature provides some cantrip utility, and the Celestial Tattoo feature leans more into exploration bonuses. Finally new Monster Tattoos have been added like the Beholder.</p>

<p>Lastly, the the updated material revises the four new Wizard subclasses. The Conjurer can now grant temporary hit points to things summoned and, at later levels, can summon two creatures with a single cast. The Enchanter gets its Instintive Charm ability back as well as Alter Memories.</p>

<p>Necromancers now have more options on summoning and utilizing undead thralls. You can give them temporary hit points, bonus damage, and at later levels you can have them explode with necrotic energy. Lastly, Transmuter features have been streamlined. The Transmuter's Stone now grants Constitution bonuses in addition to any choices you make, and the Shapechanger feature from 5e returns.</p>

<p>The feedback survey for this new Unearthed Arcana will be going live on September 25.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-online-multiplayer-witcher-4-sequel-cdpr-2000627198</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-experimenting-with-multiplayer-as-cdpr-embraces-online-gameplay.1302924/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Asymmetric mercenary leaderboards? Co-op heists? A full-blown<em> GTA Online</em>-style live-service component? The multiplayer possibilities for <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-release-date-witcher-4-rpg-cdpr-1851782750">a <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> sequel</a> are easy to imagine, even if they’re hard to implement. A new job posting at CD Projekt Red suggests the studio is at least flirting with some sort of online component for its next sci-fi open-world RPG. It’s a small and noncommittal data point that’s nevertheless part of a larger trend.</p> <p>“Lead your team to develop and optimize multiplayer systems, including matchmaking, and address challenges related to latency, bandwidth usage, and server performance,” reads <a href="https://www.cdprojektred.com/en/jobs/20217-lead-network-engineer">part of the job description</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-looks-set-to-include-multiplayer-years-after-cyberpunk-2077-online-mode-scrapped">first spotted by <em>IGN,</em></a>&nbsp;for a new engineering role at CDPR’s Boston-based satellite studio leading development on <em>Cyberpunk 2</em>. That ambition gestures toward plans the studio originally had for adding multiplayer to the first game. Plans for that content were later set aside or abandoned as CDPR rushed to prioritize the stability and long-term viability of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> after a disastrous 2020 launch.</p> <p>Will history repeat itself, or is multiplayer coming to the world of <em>Cyberpunk </em>for real this time? With the big-budget blockbuster still in pre-production as CDPR focuses on <em>The Witcher 4</em>, it’s impossible to say. But it’s clear the Poland-based company has been looking to experiment with multiplayer for some time now. CDPR told investors it was looking to bring “online gameplay” to more of its franchises in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIAiGI-v6Y8">strategy briefing</a> four years ago, and co-CEO Michał Nowakowski <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-orion-multiplayer-1851190429#:~:text=Kotaku%20reached%20out%20to%20CDPR%20for%20comment.&amp;text=Badowski%20and%20Nowakowski's%20comments%20on,works%20that%20we%20know%20of.">told<em> Reuters</em> last year</a> the team was “considering” bringing multiplayer to the next <em>Cyberpunk</em>.</p>

 <p>CDPR has also already confirmed at least one multiplayer project: a <em>Witcher</em> spin-off codenamed <em>Project</em> <em>Sirius</em>. That game has been in prolonged development at what used to be called The Molasses Flood, with layoffs, departures, and design pivots reportedly all taking their toll. The studio was officially absorbed into the rest of CDPR earlier this year. “Overall, it shows a very bright future for Project Sirius (aka ‘the multiplayer Witcher game,’ of which I was the Design Director for three years),” Molasses Flood co-founder Damian Isla wrote upon leaving <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/damian-isla-815a46_well-its-the-end-of-an-era-tucked-away-activity-7315404560620044288-Qazy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAoO_OkB-VfPR7dhiZ-PZ-9sf_EfWliEy1k">back in March</a>. “It’s going to be an amazing game, one for the books, and I cannot wait until the rest of the world learns about what we’ve been working on.”</p> <p>One does not simply pivot to making an online multiplayer game any more than one simply walks into Mordor. CDPR’s own struggles with going from the third-person perspective of <em>Witcher 3</em> to the first-person<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> speak to the tech and design difficulties inherent in taking on new development challenges. But it would be cool to see what CDPR can achieve if it takes that next leap. It ultimately worked out in the end for the studio’s last game, even if it took an extra three years after it came out.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-iphone-gimbal-costs-peanuts-amazon-is-clearing-out-djis-budget-model-2000627191</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-iphone-gimbal-costs-peanuts-amazon-is-clearing-out-dji%E2%80%99s-budget-model.1302918/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Smartphones are incredible cameras in our pockets with the capability of capturing crisp snaps and 4K video, but there’s a further issue: <strong>shaky footage</strong>. If you’ve ever tried to film a birthday moment, a journey moment or a TikTok dance, then you’ll know how frustrating shaky video is. So, that’s why gimbals exist.</p>
<p>The DJI Osmo Mobile SE gets rid of that problem and you’re able to turn ordinary recordings into professional-quality videos that look as if they’re shot by pros. And since <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4198/">Amazon has dropped the price to just $58 (down from a previous low of $69)</a> — its lowest price ever — this is the perfect time to pick one up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4198/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Gimbal Is Worth It</h2>
<p>The Osmo Mobile SE is <strong>DJI’s lowest-priced stabilizer</strong> but cheap doesn’t have to mean bare bones. In real life, it’s the category leader simply because it distills pro-level video stabilization into an accessible package. Its folding design means you can shove it neatly into a backpack but when you unfold it and clip your phone onto the magnetic clamp, you’re getting that liquid-smooth footage artists adore right away. It’s <strong>compatible with both iPhones and Androids</strong>, so compatibility issues are out of the question.</p>



<p>One of the real game changers in this regard is ActiveTrack 6.0: In essence, this <strong>permits the gimbal to automatically follow your subject</strong>. If you’re filming your children playing in the park or your dog running around on the beach, the Osmo Mobile SE holds them in frame without you scrambling for controls. It even works well for solo creators: just set the phone up, get in frame and let the gimbal take center stage in your own video. The DJI Mimo app also adds to those capabilities and offers Smart templates and shot ideas that help you get more cinematic with less effort.</p>
<p>Another intelligent aspect is that it allows pairing with an Apple Watch and gives you a remote in your wrist. Tilt, pan, or begin recording without needing to rush back to your phone. For vloggers, that is a real boost for how you record hands‑free. Throw in quick editing using the LightCut app which contains easy-to-use templates and your raw shots start looking like mini-movies to share in minutes.</p>



<p>And then the real magic: <strong>3-axis stabilization</strong>. DJI’s algorithm reacts in real time to eliminate jitters and bumps that ruin handheld video. Walking down urban streets, backpacking a path or merely shooting a travel blog at an airport, the video is stable and watchable. You can even switch between landscape shooting for cinematic use or portrait mode for social media updates with a single click of a button. And if you wish to get creative, the gimbal comes with<strong> various modes including Follow, Tilt Lock, FPV and Spin Shot</strong>&nbsp;which each unlock various artistic possibilities.</p>
<p>For a paltry $58, this deal is hard to hype. Most gimbals with this much stabilization and tracking tech run more, but DJI somehow crammed it all into a lightweight, tiny device for creators. Over 10,000 people bought it last month alone, and <strong>over 10,000 reviewers left it an average 4.5‑star rating</strong>. That should tell you everything you need to know about how dependable and adaptable it is.</p>

Gearbox has promised more fixes are on the way, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-september-18-update-improves-stability-on-pc-and-smooths-out-progression-but-according-to-the-patch-notes-balance-changes-will-have-to-wait">after yesterday’s patch tackled PC crashes</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Borderlands 4 justifies the six-year wait since the last entry with some big technical upgrades via Unreal Engine 5,” Morgan said. “Despite the team's huge ambition here, though, the game's performance at launch is struggling on console if 60fps is the goal, and a patch cannot come soon enough. The gradually worsening framerates on PS5, Pro, and Series X lead to some dire mid-30fps passages of play after a while. And resetting the game every hour should really not be an expected solution for players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This lack in polish at launch also shows in its bugs where broken NPC pathfinding and flickering lighting are just a couple of issues I've experienced. The promise of Borderlands 4 is compelling, but following on from MGS Delta and Oblivion Remastered, we're once again looking at a major UE5 release with framerate issues on every format. And once again, we're having to hang tight for an update to save the day.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what's causing the problem? As Morgan points out, the situation with Borderlands 4 rekindles memories of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-say-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-camera-breaks-the-longer-you-play-and-eventually-crashes-when-loading-a-save-call-for-emergency-patch">another Unreal Engine 5 title where performance degraded over time on console and also improved with a fresh boot</a>. It's unconfirmed for now, but the leading theory for Borderlands 4, as with Oblivion, is there's some form of memory leak at play, or, as Morgan put it, "a cache of data not being flushed from system memory that eventually catches up on the player."</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What about the PC version?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Gamescom 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cb741be92b82d/nintendo-gamescom-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ant Dickens / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new report states that Nintendo of America is cutting loose around 200 long-time contractor jobs as it has decided to outsource its customer support services ahead of the Switch 2's first holiday season.</p>
<p>This report comes from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-customer-support-concern-following-outsourcing-decision-ahead-of-switch-2s-first-holiday-season">IGN's Rebekah Valentine</a>, who spoke to numerous customer support staff and sources under anonymity. Many confirmed to the outlet that they were told back in March 2025 that their contracts were being cut and gradually being phased out. None of the contractors have received direct communication from Nintendo itself, hearing instead through their agencies about the news.</p>
<p>Now these contractors are expected to train their replacements, many of whom are based in South American countries, primarily in Brazil, Argentina, and Nicaragua. These have previously been limited to first-line contacts who act as representatives to send the information and problem on to the main team in the US.</p>
<p>There are concerns from the sources that there will, "in the immediate term" be a drop in quality of support, particularly once the fully-trained agents leave, with the Big N seeming to prioritise saving.</p>
<p>While the new contractors all speak English, some IGN spoke to said there were "a number of communication issues internally" with an "increase in customers becoming irate, belligerent, and even racially abusive".</p>
<p>Nintendo of America, in a response to IGN, has stated that "the claims shared with IGN include inaccurate information" and that "our top priority is to provide excellent customer support, and we are pleased that customer satisfaction with the service provided by all our partners remains positive." The company did not respond to requests on which claims were inaccurate.</p>
<p>Here is NoA's full response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"While we have nothing to announce about our internal business activities, the claims shared with IGN include inaccurate information. At Nintendo of America, we are extremely thankful to have partnered with several companies and their talented contractors over the years to deliver high-quality customer service experiences. We continue to evolve and expand our customer service model with external partners that have deep experience in all the markets we serve across the Americas. This approach allows us to support the full scope of our customer service mission in both North America and our growing Latin American markets, and better scale to seasonal needs for consistent support. As always, our top priority is to provide excellent customer support, and we are pleased that customer satisfaction with the service provided by all our partners remains positive."</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>One source told IGN that Nintendo of America normally works with two US-based agencies to fill customer support roles, including fraud, chargebacks, chatlogs, phone and email support, refunds, repair support and more. "There are a few people remaining on-site overseeing it, but essentially it’s all going away.”</p>
<p>A former employee acknowledges the nature of being a contractor and that "there was no guarantee to return after contract breaks", but feels that Nintendo could have approached things differently. "I personally feel as though Nintendo could have easily hired on a bunch of the contractors as FTE and had better results while still saving money from having to use the agencies."</p>
<p>"It's also such a volatile economy to be dumping all of us out into", with others echoing similar concerns, especially with the rise of generative AI in the customer support field: "“A lot of us are feeling betrayed, empty, like almost led-on in a way."</p>
<p>This is sadly not the first time Nintendo has cut contractor jobs suddenly. Back in 2024, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/03/nintendo-of-america-restructuring-testing-department-over-100-contractor-jobs-reportedly-eliminated">NoA downsized and restructured its testing department</a>, with a reported 100+ contractors losing their jobs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During today's Sync Presentation, Shanghai-based VR manufacturer <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/pimax/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pimax</a> has unveiled three new Virtual Reality headsets based on its new Micro-OLED product line.</p>



<p>Micro-OLED technology is considered by some to be the future of virtual reality thanks to its ultra-high pixel density, near-infinite contrast, and deep blacks. However, it has so far presented significant challenges, including heat management, optical compatibility, and scaling to high resolutions. Pimax claims to have overcome these challenges with its proprietary three-element ConcaveView pancake optics, which enable Micro-OLED to deliver clarity and immersion without compromise.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The widest FOV in micro-OLED VR Headsets | Pimax Sync" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vpSIZy_VZrg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The most accessible headset of this trio is the Pimax Dream Air SE, which offers premium clarity with its 2560 x 2560 resolution per eye and ultra-sharp Micro-OLED panels. It is also extremely light at 140 grams, making it one of the lightest VR headsets ever manufactured. Its full-featured package includes built-in 6DOF SLAM tracking, Tobii eye-tracking, dynamic foveated rendering, and integrated spatial audio, making it ideal for everyday VR. The Dream Air SE is priced at $899 and can be pre-ordered <a href="https://pimax.com/products/pimax-dream-air-se" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on this page</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Its larger sibling, the Pimax Dream Air, was presented by the manufacturer as their compact flagship featuring 3,840 x 3,552 resolution per eye — over 27 million pixels combined — with Sony Micro-OLED panels for unrivaled sharpness. Thanks to Pimax's ConcaveView pancake optics, the Dream Air achieves an unprecedented 110° horizontal and 120°+ diagonal field of view (FOV) for such a portable form factor. Weighing under 170 g, it is optimized for both gaming and professional applications with stereo overlap that enhances depth perception. It is far more expensive, though, at $1999. Pre-orders can be submitted <a href="https://pimax.com/products/pimax-dream-air" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Finally, the Pimax Crystal Super goes even further with its 116° horizontal and 128°+ diagonal field of view (FOV) with Sony Micro-OLED panels and ConcaveView optics—the widest FOV ever achieved with Micro-OLED VR technology. As part of the modular Crystal ecosystem, it supports interchangeable optical engines, including Ultrawide, 57 PPD clarity-focused, and Micro-OLED. This gives users the flexibility to switch between maximum immersion and maximum sharpness. The price is $2199 and the VR headset can be purchased <a href="https://pimax.com/products/pimax-crystal-super-sony-8k-micro-oled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Early adopters will receive exclusive bonus accessories from Pimax, including prescription lens frames and a free copy of Le Mans Ultimate. The products are scheduled to be released later in 2025.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-review-underground-excess</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-review-underground-excess.1302876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em> is less sequel, more spinoff to the original 2018 FPS, and it boldly bursts into a new genre: the "bullet heaven," also known as "walk around while your guy automatically attacks." In a gameplay style that seems be getting increasingly saturated day-by-day, does <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>'s foray do enough to separate itself from the pack?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A Survivors Classic...</h2>



<p>As you might expect,&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor&nbsp;</em>plays much like the 2022 smash hit&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-survivors-castlevania-crossover-dlc" rel="nofollow"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>. You walk around, gain experience, level up, and use those levels to upgrade and acquire new weapons. Enemies swarm around you and with some exceptions for projectile-spitting foes, about the only way to take damage from them is to be overwhelmed by sheer numbers.</p>

<p>The sheer numbers show in the scale of content, too. 300 achievements, for one, as well as a bevy a missions with different mutators and twists to take on. It's a completionist's dream, or nightmare, depending on how you look at it.</p>

<p>You start with one weapon and gain your next three at set levels. This means that you're definitely going to want to be comfortable with your starting weapon, as it and one other random draw may be all you have for a while.</p>

<p>The formula of combat is pretty familiar for this, with weapons offering various upgrades as you level up. The weapon upgrades differ a little bit, thanks to the addition of milestones called "overclocks" at certain levels.</p>

<p>Overclocks give significant boosts to power in many different ways, from something as simple as a damage boost, to an overclock for a grenade that splits into three weaker versions of the same grenade. These upgrades change the already interesting weapons variety, giving even runs with similar weapons the possibility to feel different.</p>

<p>As for traversal, each stage consists of 5 sort of mini-stages, each culminating in a boss fight. After the boss fight, you'll have 30 seconds to get to a drop pod and escape to the next layer, or risk being abandoned.</p>

<p>This mechanic in particular gives a lot of fun risk-reward management, as you debate if it's worth going back for that sweet XP pile before getting to the drop pod. It also contributes to the general fast pace of the game, leading half-hour runs to feel like they're done in the blink of an eye. "One more run" was rarely just one.</p>

<h2>...With Some Miner Changes</h2>



<p>Speaking of risk-reward, the biggest innovation that <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>'s survivor spin brings is the addition of, of course, mining. In addition to using your weapons to fight off enemies to gain experience points and level up, you can dig for materials, in particular Gold and Nitra, that help you buy upgrades between stages.</p>

<p>The addition of mining is a very welcome one, and gives a lot of incentive to thoroughly explore each layer as you visit it. With how brisk the game moves you along, it's rare that you'll get to see everything in a stage, so it's up to you to decide what's worth mining for, and what's better off ignored.</p>

<p>I found this to be a great addition to the known formula. It's a good compromise, giving me more to do, while also keeping attacks automatic like the titans of the bullet heaven genre.</p>

<p>In addition to mining for Gold and Nitra, you'll be tasked with secondary objectives, tasking you with finding anything from flowers to mushrooms. Collecting your quota of these will reward you with a healthy chunk of Gold and XP, adding a scavenger hunt element to your runs.</p>

<p>I enjoyed hunting for these materials, but wish they also served more of a purpose. Unlike Gold and Nitra, which help purchase upgrades for your run, and other minerals, which unlock permanent upgrades from the main menu, materials like Morokite that secondary objectives request seemingly disappear into the ether after you leave the layer.</p>

<p>These secondary objectives seem like they could have been even better if they helped steer me towards materials that also worked towards permanent unlocks, but as it stands, are just fun temporary distractions for each stage.</p>

<h2>Grinding My Gears</h2>



<p>The headline addition that arrived in the 1.0 version of&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor&nbsp;</em>is the gear system. Gear is equipment that enemies have a chance to drop throughout your run, which you can then equip to your characters before a run, offering stat buffs in a variety of areas.</p>

<p>Despite its headline billing, the gear was one of the more disappointing aspects. The random enemy drops combined with the miniscule benefits led me to mostly just use the handy automatic "smart equip" feature and just go back into another run instead.</p>

<p>This meta progression was the overall weakest part of my time with <em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em>. Unlocks felt like they came at a slow pace, and first runs with each class especially felt almost scripted with how few options you were able to choose from for your arsenal.</p>

<p>And as for those aforementioned minerals, they serve mostly to gate off certain upgrades. For instance, you'll need pearls to increase your XP gain, but a different kind of gem to increase your critical hit rate.</p>

<p>While I understand the whole system is built to encourage mining, it feels like the whole thing would've been a lot more streamlined if I could've sold the treasure and bought any upgrade with the primary currency, instead of sorting through 7 currencies to see what upgrades I can maybe afford.</p>

<p>Despite my minor meta progression and unlock complaints, it's undeniable that the moment-to-moment gameplay of&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor&nbsp;</em>is an excellent distillation of the bullet heaven genre.</p>

<p>It's come a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-preview" rel="nofollow">long way since early access</a>, and the mining and small-stage format gives it a breakneck pace that makes that intoxicating "one more run" promise that the best of this genre should tempt you with.</p>

<p><em><strong>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</strong> was reviewed on PC and Steam Deck using a copy provided by the publisher over the course of 10 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p>

The player can be seen running around a warehouse, dodging bullets from enemy players as they collect weapons, armor plates, and other tools from nearby loot chests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other clips have also spilled onto platforms like X, including footage of how things like <a href="https://x.com/BattlPULSE/status/1969074216872890471" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>upgrade kits</u></a> and <a href="https://x.com/BF6Meta/status/1969034590879695149" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>custom weapon drops work</u></a>. It’s important to note that none of what we’ve seen so far is final.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 itself still has a few weeks to go before its October 10 release date for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S arrives. BF Studios hasn’t officially announced when exactly the Battlefield 6 battle royale mode will launch, though <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1968006588784058548" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ModernWarzone</u></a> reported earlier this week that its sources expect its release date to be October 28, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and BF Studios are no strangers to leaks, especially when it comes to Battlefield 6.

<p>Not quite an own goal, at least</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>With the Switch 2 getting many <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/fc-26-on-switch-2-on-parity-basically-with-ps5-according-to-ea-sports-dev">more feature-parity</a> sports games, and looking visually <em>much</em> improved over their Switch 2 predecessors, we've been more excited than usual to take to the field and go for a good ol' kickabout.</p>
<p>And, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA SPORTS FC 26</a> out in early access (ahead of its full release next week, on 26th September), we've put the kit on once again to see just how this latest iteration of EA's football (or, yes, <em>soccer</em>) series fares.</p>
<p>The results are... <em>mixed</em> to say the least. The lovely Felix has played a few games already and, as you can probably tell from the gameplay video up top, EA Sports FC 26 is locked at 30fps on Switch 2. That isn't ideal, especially when the game runs at 60fps on other consoles, including the Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>Another issue that Felix has spotted is after the second half kicks-off, some NPCs just remain on the pitch, unmoving, standing in the path of the goal. It happens a few times — watch the screen on the right at around <a href="https://youtu.be/zEeK-8I84eI?si=f--HcIXF9zWxroql&amp;t=392">6:32</a> minutes in and you'll see what we mean.</p>

<p>Well, it's still early days, and the full release isn't due out for another week, so maybe EA will iron some of those issues out. But the 30fps is probably here to stay, which is a shame given the Switch 2 version has some nice visual upgrades.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ready-or-not-community-manager-fired-for-responding-to-charlie-kirk-assassination-with-%E2%80%98nothing-was-lost%E2%80%99.1302843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The community manager for the popular and controversial online SWAT simulator <em>Ready Or Not </em>was fired after posting in the game’s official Discord server that “nothing of value was lost” following the <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-steam-library-valve-discord-radicalization-2000626897">recent assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk</a>.</p> <p>On or around September 17, <em>Ready Or Not’s</em> community manager, known online as Kaminsky, was asked to add “Charlie Kirk” and a few variations of the name to the server’s list of filtered words. Kaminsky confirmed they had done so, but then shared their own personal thoughts about Kirk, who was murdered at a speaking event on September 10 in Utah. The community manager posted:</p> <blockquote><p>“Funny you mention that because me and my roomate are literally just talking about him getting shot. All I have to say is: Nothing of value was lost.”</p></blockquote> <p>Screenshots and posts of this comment <a href="https://x.com/KayfabeMediaYT/status/1968548146398609603/photo/1">were quickly shared online</a> by fans of Kirk and right-wing content creators, with many demanding that Void Interactive fire the manager.&nbsp; And that’s exactly what Void did.</p>

 <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/airbagged.bsky.social/post/3lz7e5vzadc2w">On Friday</a>, a Void Interactive representative confirmed in<em> Ready Or Not</em>‘s official Discord server that the studio had “ended” its “relationship” with Kaminsky. It’s unclear if the community manager was a full-time employee or a volunteer.&nbsp; Before the news was official, fans had spotted that Kaminisky, often referred to as Kam online, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/airbagged.bsky.social/post/3lz5esqafws2e">was no longer listed</a> as being a part of the server. One Discord user in the game’s server <a href="https://discord.com/channels/310075021882294272/452425840274309120/1418631175823687750">claimed</a> that a sticker emoji featuring Kaminsky had also been removed.</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> reached out to Void Interactive for comment. Kaminsky could not immediately be contacted.</p>

 <p>“To Our <em>Ready or Not</em> Community, We are aware of comments made by our community manager about a recent tragic event,” posted Void Interactive rep Gerby on Discord.&nbsp; “These statements do not reflect our values or represent our company. We have ended our relationship with this individual and reminded our team of the responsibility we all share when communicating on public platforms. Our focus remains on fostering a respectful and professional community around <em>Ready or Not.</em>”</p> <p>This isn’t the first video game industry employee to lose their job after saying the wrong thing about Kirk’s recent murder. Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478">a developer working on<em> Ghost of Yotei</em> was fired by Sony</a> after making a joke about Kirk’s alleged assassin. <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-discord-politics-helldivers-memes-2000626029">The alleged killer’s connection to video games</a> has become a big part of the story around Kirk’s murder, with reports that some of the assassin’s bullets had messages etched into them <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-helldivers-bullet-engraving-2000625439">referencing <em>Helldivers 2</em>.</a> Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/charlie-kirk-jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney.html">ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel is also facing pressure</a> to apologize after comments he made about Kirk got his show pulled “indefinitely” on Thursday.</p> <p><em><strong>Updated: 9/19/2025, 3:30 p.m. ET:</strong></em>&nbsp;When asked for further comment, Void Interactive PR pointed <em>Kotaku</em> to the studio’s previously mentioned statement, which has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/517473296253453455">also been posted on <em>Ready or Not</em>‘s Steam page</a>.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/steam-will-drop-support-for-the-last-32-bit-windows-systems-in-january-2026/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-will-wind-down-support-for-32-bit-windows-as-that-version-of-windows-fades.1302837/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Though the 32-bit versions of Windows were widely used from the mid-90s all the way through to the early 2010s, this change is coming so late that it should only actually affect a statistically insignificant number of Steam users. Valve already pulled Steam support for all versions of Windows 7 and Windows 8 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/steam-will-end-support-for-windows-7-and-8-in-january-of-2024/">in January 2024</a>, and 2021's Windows 11 was the first in decades not to ship a 32-bit version. That leaves only the 32-bit version of Windows 10, which is old enough that it will stop getting security updates in either October 2025 or October 2026, depending on how you count it.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/directx/">According to Steam Hardware Survey data</a> from August, usage of the 32-bit version of Windows 10 (and any other 32-bit version of Windows) is so small that it's lumped in with "other" on the page that tracks Windows version usage. All "other" versions of Windows combined represent roughly 0.05 percent of all Steam users. The 64-bit version of Windows 10 still runs on just over a third of all Steam-using Windows PCs, while the 64-bit version of Windows 11 accounts for just under two-thirds.</p>
<p>The change to the Steam client shouldn't have any effects on game availability or compatibility. Any older 32-bit games that you can currently run in 64-bit versions of Windows will continue to work fine because, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/steam-drops-macos-mojave-support-effectively-ending-life-for-many-32-bit-games/">unlike modern macOS versions</a>, new 64-bit versions of Windows still maintain compatibility with most 32-bit apps.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-says-game-mods-dont-count-as-prior-art-palworld-lawsuit/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo is well known for the litigious lengths it will go to, and its legal battle against Palworld developer PocketPair is just the latest major example of the company's legal team pushing things as far as they can. </p>



<p>It <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/">launched its suit almost exactly a year ago</a> at the time of this writing, and as the battle has ensued, Nintendo has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/">changed the patents</a> it claims PocketPair is infringing to try to better align them with its arguments, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-new-patent-should-not-have-happened-says-lawyer-palworld/">successfully acquired new patents</a> to better stack its claims, and now, the latest argument being made to answer PocketPair's attempt to use game mods as part of their defense, is that game mods don't count as "<em>prior art</em>."</p>



<p>This report comes from <a href="https://gamesfray.com/gross-in-palworld-patent-case-nintendo-tells-japanese-judge-mods-should-not-count-as-prior-art-because-they-cant-run-without-underlying-games/">Gamesfray</a>, which has followed the suit closely for months now. Essentially, PocketPair pointed to game mods as a way of trying to cut the legs off of Nintendo's claims. Nintendo responded by arguing that game mods are not prior art, because a mod for a game only works with that game, and doesn't run independently from it.</p>



<p>Nintendo would have the judge see mods as patentable by other parties, making Nintendo vulnerable to others taking ideas from Nintendo titles, patenting them, and using them in other games. That's why Nintendo wants the judge to believe mods don't count as "<em>prior art</em>."</p>



<p>The potential ramifications of Nintendo securing a win with these arguments are pretty scary when you consider how far it could take such a precedent. We'd likely see even more legal action from Nintendo going after people who just wanted to make a cool mod, who put hours of their time and effort into creating an original mod for others to enjoy. And that's just on a smaller, individual scale. </p>



<p>Of course, that's if Nintendo is successful with these arguments. We've yet to hear what the judge presiding over the case has to say about what has been presented so far, and Gamesfray predicts that we won't hear any major updates for the remainder of the year.</p>



<p>Still, what's certain is that the outcome of this suit will have a major impact on the videogame industry, whichever way it goes.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-patch-notes-depth-derank-2000627170</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign%E2%80%98s-new-hard-mode-is-kicking-players-asses-so-much-they-can-now-demote-themselves-to-a-lower-difficulty.1302813/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s only been a week since <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-hard-mode-time-changes-2000624664">new hard mode was added</a> to the multiplayer roguelike, and FromSoftware is already patching in some relief after even the most stalwart fans found themselves brutally beaten down. The mode has five depths, with the goal being to eventually complete enough successful runs to reach the deepest and most difficult one. Now, however, players will have the option to arbitrarily boot themselves back up to upper levels so they can stop dying and actually have fun again.</p> <p>Depth 1 is straightforward enough. While some <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-libra-nerf-deep-night-2000624624">harder enemies and new item debuffs</a> force players to adapt to the game in new ways, most were able to make short work of it. Then came Depth 2. For my team it was like hitting a brick wall, but others successfully made it to Depth 3. Past that, the game basically becomes a no-hit run mode in disguise. Within a few days some fans were already begging for an option to play on the lower difficulties again just for fun. With a shockingly quick turnaround, FromSoftware has now obliged.</p> <p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-upcoming-deep-of-night-adjustments">An update that went live today adds</a> “a new feature to voluntarily decrease your Depth ranking by one level.” It also gives loss protection to players at lower Depths, so that your first loss on Depth 3, 4, or 5 won’t immediately lose you points and kick you back to the previous one. This protection even applies if you’re returning to Depth 3 or 4 for the dozenth time. This is mostly for players at the final Depths who lose more points from a loss than they earn for each win.</p>

   <p>“Lets go voluntary derank,” one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1nl4hun/elden_ring_nightreign_upcoming_deep_of_night/">wrote</a> on the subreddit. “This is based,” wrote another. “But we really just need more bosses.”</p> <p>The new system allows more casual players the option to enjoy the mechanics in the new mode without having to run something they just keep dying in. At the same time, some players are wondering why FromSoftware doesn’t just nuke the whole ranking up system altogether and just let players choose which Depth they want to play on from the jump. Some fans were also hoping for <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-difficulty-mode-when-2000620989">a true “endless” mode,</a> which was rumored based on original datamines for the Deep of Night update but which appear to have been based on a mistranslation.</p> <p>Deep of Night is cool overall, but the progression system has been a bit of a bust. It’s also not a replacement for new bosses, maps, or random events during runs. The new difficulty mode will need more tweaks if it’s going to keep<em> Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> in the multiplayer rotation for a lot of current players, especially with so many other big games coming out this fall. But in the meantime, at least everyone can go back and farm the broken Deep Relics they need from easier Depths.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review.1302810/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been six years since the last mainline </span><i><span>Borderlands </span></i><span>game. (No, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-borderlands-spinoff-impressions-1848705496"><i><span>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</span></i></a> <span>doesn’t count.) A lot has changed in the last six years, both in the land of video games and in the real world. Players expect a lot more from co-op shooters. And the people in charge are power-hungry losers. </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>tries to change with the times, with mixed results.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While it’s a damn fine shooter, the best Gearbox has made, and one which lets the franchise now stand comfortably next to genre titans like </span><i><span>Destiny</span></i><span>, its attempts to address life living under a fascist regime don’t work out as well. But you’ll probably be too busy talking and joking with your friends to notice.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span>, in a lot of ways, feels like a soft reboot of the series. The past games still happened and are referenced in big and small ways throughout the story, but the sequel is set on the new planet of Kairos and features new villains, allies, and things to kill. <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-3-the-kotaku-review-1838290570">And unlike </a></span><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-3-the-kotaku-review-1838290570"><i><span>Borderlands 3</span></i></a><span>’s story, which revolved around saving the universe and hopping across the galaxy, </span><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> is a smaller, more contained yarn mostly focused on what happens when powerful people take control and never let go.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>A New World To Be Saved</b></h2> <p><span>While I won’t spoil any specific details in this review, I’ll let you know ahead of time that if you are coming to </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>to enjoy a satisfying tale of people rising up under fascism to defeat evil, you’ll get that—right up until the end of the main campaign. Then it kind of falls apart.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A twist in the game’s finale turns its main villain, the Timekeeper, into a far less compelling character. But before that, I really enjoyed the amount of time Gearbox devoted to showing how evil the Timekeeper and his cronies are, and how characters deal with the question of how much they’re willing to sacrifice for freedom. And what happens when some go too far, or not far enough? Don’t expect </span><i><span>Andor</span></i><span>-like depth and writing about genocidal leaders here. Still, I was pleasantly surprised by how often I cared about what was happening to both new and returning characters alike. Gearbox’s writers do a fantastic job of really making you hate the Timekeeper and his various underlings. Don’t get </span><i><span>too </span></i><span>attached to anyone in this story. That’s all I’m saying…&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>Of course, if you play </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>with a group of your rowdy, silly friends, a lot of its writing will get buried under your pals screaming about loot drops or laughing about inside jokes. If you care at all about the tale Gearbox is telling here, do a run through the story by yourself and take your time to interact with characters and listen to audio logs.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Regardless of whether you play alone or with others, to defeat the Timekeeper and break his ironclad hold over Karios and its suffering populace, you’ll need to kill thousands of troopers, aliens, monsters, and robots using some of the billions of guns available to loot in</span><i><span> Borderlands 4.&nbsp;</span></i></p>

 <h2><b>Killin’ In The Name…Of Fun</b></h2> <p><span>What’s going to keep me coming back to </span><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> for (likely) years is the gunplay and movement. I’ve never outright hated the combat in past </span><i><span>Borderlands</span></i><span> games, but this is the first one where I think Gearbox has truly nailed it. And not just because they tossed in more guns than ever before.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> lets players double jump, glide, grapple, and wall climb around the open world of Kairos. This, combined with guns that, overall, feel more distinct and punchier, really helps elevate </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>into the upper echelon of first-person shooters.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Further elevating combat in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-finishes-decade-old-quest-pre-sequel-dunks-watson-explained-2000624918"><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i></a><span>are the shooter’s four distinct and new playable Vault Hunters. Each one shakes up how combat encounters play out thanks to their different powers and abilities. Playing alongside a powerful Rafa, a cybersoldier, will lead to combat encounters that feel very different than when you play alone or next to other hunters.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Really, you get like</span><i><span> 12 characters,</span></i><span> because each hunter has three skill trees that each feature mini-skill trees inside. Perhaps you and a pal both play Vex, the new Siren character. Well, you’ll likely be very different versions of Vex by the time you both reach level 50, thanks to all the different skill and ability options available to each of you.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627162" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627162"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627162">©Gearbox</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As I leveled up, found great guns I liked, and got more comfortable with the new movement options, I would often get into flow states where I’d lost track of time. I’d end up losing 10 minutes to a random encounter on my way to a big quest simply because I just love shooting shit in this game so much.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I did find, though, that </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>has a nasty habit of throwing a few too many waves of enemies at you during a lot of encounters. I’d wipe out the fourth or fifth wave of angry psychos or space buffalo, and then another wave would arrive. And then another. It often felt like too much, and made some missions and activities drag on. Still, I wasn’t too mad because once I’d wiped every enemy out, I was left with piles of loot.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Crappy Green Pistols For As Far As The Eye Can See</b></h2> <p><span>The loot in </span><i><span>Borderlands 4,</span></i><span> like in past games, is the real secret sauce. It’s what keeps you going through a boring mission, or makes it hard to stop playing despite feeling tired and needing to go to bed. That promise that the next gun, shield, or grenade that drops will be better than anything you have.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Sure, most of the time, what drops is garbage you won’t use, but thanks to</span><i><span> Bord</span></i><i><span>e</span></i><i><span>rlands 4</span></i><span>’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-11-best-changes-borderlands-4-junk-loot-menus-legendary-guns-2000624953">improved loot management options</a>, collecting and selling truckloads of terrible rifles and shotguns is easier than ever. And when that amazing piece of loot </span><i><span>does </span></i><span>pop out of a dead enemy or chest with a distinct ping noise, it’s one of the best feelings ever. If I could bottle it and sell it, I’d be a very rich man. It feels even better in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-includes-direct-jab-joke-gearbox-former-owner-embracer-bluff-2000624815"><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i></a><span>because some of the best loot, Legendary guns, are much rarer than in the last game.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And because nearly everything you do around the open world of Karios rewards you with loot, it can be hard not to just keep playing for hours and hours. Kairos is a big map, chockablock with small activities to complete–like activating a radio tower and defending it from baddies–as well as bigger or sillier side quests, world bosses, collectibles to hunt down, secrets to find, and random events to complete.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box-quote</p>                 <p>"Billions of guns, four friends, one meh ending."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Gearbox</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC (Played on both PS5 and PC) </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>First-person co-op focused sci-fi looter shooter</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Combat better than ever, great traversal options, QoL changes, open world.  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Bugs and performance problems, less-than-satisfying ending, some fights feel too big.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>September 12, 2025 </p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>As a result, the open world of </span><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> is more active and alive than in any previous entry in the franchise, and all of this content rewards you with more loot. Thank god you can junk most of it in seconds. Otherwise, I’d have drowned in all the green pistols that the game dumped on me over my 60 or so hours with it across PS5 and PC.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Loot also becomes a currency among friends. Get a cool sniper, but you don’t snipe? Drop it for your friend. And then, if they find a badass shield that suits your character build better, they’ll share it with you, or you can at least guilt-trip them into giving it over. And because guns can spawn with all sorts of wild extra parts that turn SMGs into rocket snipers or whatever, hunting for loot and sharing it with pals is more exciting than ever.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Well, assuming you can </span><i><span>see </span></i><span>the guns you have. A nasty bug affected one of my friends and made all his guns invisible. Which leads me to my biggest disappointment with</span><i><span> Borderlands 4: </span></i><span>the technical problems.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Excuse Me, There’s Some Bugs In My Looter Shooter</b></h2> <p><span>On PlayStation 5 Pro, I routinely had to restart the game due to the performance tanking <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">after a few hours of play</a>. I also encountered a few bugged quests that required restarts, too. Over on PC, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">many players and I have experienced optimization and performance problems</a>. Even on my RTX 5080, which can run everything I throw at it, </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>demands I turn on DLSS and frame gen while also turning down visual settings. And despite getting the game to run at a mostly stable 120FPS, I still encounter microstutters.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>On both platforms, I’ve also found empty vending machines, seen characters hovering off the ground, had animations break, events not start, and encountered audio lines cutting out randomly.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>None of this has completely ruined my enjoyment of </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-patch-console-crash-pitchford-2000626826">Borderlands</a> 4</span></i><span>, and I’ve had some sessions in which it all worked pretty flawlessly, minus some hitches or stutters. But it would be irresponsible not to mention these technical flaws and annoyances in a review o</span><i><span>f Borderlands 4,</span></i><span> as they are just as much a part of the game as the loot, combat, and story. Hopefully, Gearbox can patch the game over the next few weeks and months to create a better experience, and this part of my review will then become a weird artifact from the past.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627163" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627163"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627163">©Gearbox</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Still, despite some annoying bugs and performance problems, </span><i><span>Borderlands 4,</span></i><span> in many ways, is the best game Gearbox has ever made.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It takes what the studio has learned about creating looter shooters and builds upon that in a way that feels like a big moment for the franchise. A large leap forward in both gameplay and narrative. I joked with colleagues that critics and players would suggest this is where the series “finally grew up,” but really, that’s what it feels like.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The story isn’t as cringeworthy, with far fewer memes, more character-driven jokes, and a sense that you might not get out of this adventure with all your friends in one piece. The combat and movement are more refined and expanded, no longer feeling like an afterthought as was the case in past games. And the world of Kairos is visually varied and packed with good reasons to explore it alone or with friends.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Bugs, performance problems, a less-than-memorable villain, and a grindy endgame are disappointing for sure, but what Gearbox has put together is still a mostly fun, action-packed, and hand-crafted looter shooter that proves once again that this studio is still the best at making these kinds of over-the-top FPS RPGs. </span></p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/hautepad-x-arcade-controller-for-switch-and-switch-2-a-modular-masterclass-at-a-premium-price</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-hautepad-x-arcade-controller-for-switch-switch-2-a-modular-masterclass-at-a-premium-price.1302789/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="HautePad X 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bd8949de626ff/hautepad-x-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Cosmox Gaming is best known for its Haute Pad range of arcade controllers, many of which can be considered budget options for fight fans, while pretty much all of them are immediately compatible with the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>The HautePad X wired controller is a slightly different proposition, and it’s a <em>wild</em> one. It’s comfortably the most premium of Cosmox Gaming’s controllers at a base price of <strong>$229.99</strong>, and there's a good reason for that. Unlike most arcade controllers which just have one main function, the X boasts several thanks to its modular design.</p>
<p>If you opt for every available module (which ramps up the price even more; the low-profile suite alone costs $69.99), you can completely customise the X to your liking, swapping out the full-profile ‘Ice Cream’ switches for low-profile ‘Wind Engine’ switches, inserting a pair of analogue sticks, or even completely ditching the leverless approach for a more traditional joystick. It’s a remarkable design, and I could definitely see other manufacturers attempt something similar in the future.</p>

<p>The X comes with its own carrying case, and it's worth highlighting this right off the bat. It looks like an average laptop bag from the outside, but opening it up reveals two main compartments. The top houses the controller itself, while the bottom contains compartments for any additional modules and tools you might want to keep handy. There’s no dedicated slot for the joystick module, which launched later, so you’ll need to figure out how best to transport this if you’re taking the controller out and about.</p>
<p>Closing the case also reveals an indentation around the edge that displays the Cosmox Gaming logo, and this is perfectly placed to act as a makeshift ‘cushion’ of sorts if you happen to play on your lap. This gives the controller more height and may prove more comfortable for some players, while the indentation prevents it from moving during more intense gaming sessions.</p>
<p>The controller itself is exceptionally well-made, with the majority of the body constructed from aluminium with RGB lighting around the entire edge. It weighs in at 1.32kg (or 2.92lbs) with an elegant, minimalist design with two subtle logos in each lower corner. Across the bottom, meanwhile, is a full non-slip cover to keep it nice and secure when playing on a desk. Even if you don't get any additional modules, this is a superb leverless arcade controller on its own.</p>

<p>Despite the brushed finish of the aluminium, I did notice that it still picks up the odd fingerprint here and there. They mostly fade away, but heavy usage over time may result in some unsightly marks. Keep it clean with a microfibre cloth, and you’ll be fine.</p>
<p>A function bar at the top contrasts the main body with a glossy finish, and contains the home button, +, –, back, and turbo (in Switch mode, '–' actually functions as the 'Capture' button). On the left, you’ll find a tournament lock toggle, while a small OLED screen is situated in the middle. This displays your button presses in real-time while also providing information on which profile you’re using along with any <a href="https://glossary.infil.net/?t=SOCD">SOCD</a> cleaning modes.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, you’ll need to make sure to set the controller to the correct profile to use it with Switch or Switch 2. This is easy: looking at the module on the top right, these contain your action buttons, and all you need to do is hold in the bottom left button (labelled ‘A’) while plugging the device into the Switch. Done!</p>

<p>The controller will remember your profile, too, so you won’t need to faff about with this whenever you want to play; just plug it in and off you go. Those on PS5 and Xbox will need to purchase a separate authenticator to plug into the top right USB slot, but Switch owners needn't worry about this at all. Happy days.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind, however, is that the HautePad X comes with built-in LED lights to label the buttons; similar to those found on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-arcade-controller-for-switch-plus-switch-2-the-best-way-to-play-street-fighter-6">8BitDo Arcade Controller</a>. This isn't dynamic, though, so when you set the device to Switch mode, the button functions won’t match up with the labels. So ‘A’ becomes ‘B’, ‘X’ becomes ‘Y’, and so on. Once you’ve played a few games, you’ll soon become accustomed to the layout and you won’t even need to consult the labels, but it’s something to watch out for if you’re just getting started.</p>
<p>Now onto the modules. Starting with the left directional buttons, you can customise this with high-profile switches, low-profile switches, WASD keyboard switches, or a joystick. Excluding the joystick for a moment, the other three modules can also be angled up to 30° by loosening the two screws and turning the module while it’s in place. It’s worth just placing your fingers over the buttons and seeing what feels most comfortable, then simply angle the module accordingly.</p>

<p>The screws are crucial to swapping out the modules, and the HautePad X comes with the correct screwdriver to remove and install each piece. With the Switch 2 showing just how convenient magnets can be, there’s a small part of me that wishes the X utilised this technology for convenience. On the flip side, waggling the joystick module about would make me quite nervous about yanking it out entirely, so having the screws in place to keep everything secure feels like the right move.</p>
<p>With the bottom module, you can customise this with analogue sticks and an optional blank module if you happen to be using the joystick, plus the usual high/low profile switches. The analogue sticks are the one part of the entire controller that caused me quite a lot of hassle, and it’s because they’re simply not plug and play.</p>
<p>Using them correctly requires a fair bit of remapping via the configuration tool (which is accessed by plugging the device into a PC), merely thanks to the nature of using sticks vs. standard buttons. Even when you’ve got everything working, playing the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> isn’t ideal or comfortable. I suspect that something like JunkFood Arcade’s new <a href="https://junkfoodarcades.com/products/sworl-multiconsole">SWORL controller</a> might be better suited for these types of games, since it’s built with this configuration right out of the box.</p>

<p>The right module comes with just two options: high-profile and low-profile switches – easy, so let’s move on to the joystick module. This thing is awesome and, unlike the analogue sticks, works straight away. This is because there are four Ice Cream switches housed in the base, so the movement of the stick hits these switches accordingly, thus creating the correct input.</p>
<p>It also comes with three optional input gates, so if you’re not keen on the curved square gate, you can swap this out for circular or octagonal options. Similarly, the module even comes with two additional springs for the joystick, so you can customise the tension. I found the default was pretty much spot on. Finally, the joystick topper screws off, so if you want to purchase something a bit flashier than the basic black model, then that’s an option. All in all, as accurate as leverless controllers are, there’s just something inherently <em>fun</em> about a more traditional joystick, and it works wonderfully.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, you could get this controller as it is, no modules, and have a grand ol' time with it. The default high-profile switches are great and are perfect for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear -Strive-</a>, but I personally stick to the low-profile suite as my go-to. There's slightly less travel required for each button press, and I'd say they're slightly quieter too. Whichever option you go for, the spacing of the switches is slightly closer together compared to 8BitDo's offering, so this is especially beneficial for those with smaller hands; you're not going to be stretching all over the place to pull off those sick combos.</p>
<p>As for the WASD module, this is a particularly great option for 2D platformers. Things like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/contra_anniversary_collection">Contra Anniversary Collection</a> or even the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Super Mario World</a> on NSO feel really satisfying, and unlike a lot of d-pads these days which can sometimes register incorrect inputs, having each direction on a separate key naturally renders this particular issue null and void.</p>
<figure><a title="HautePad X 19" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/266477684c981/hautepad-x-19.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The HautePad X is a marvel of modular design. The fact that most of the modules can simply be slotted into place without having to faff around with wires is mad, and whether you're into low-profile, high-profile, or WASD switches, or you prefer a more traditional joystick, most options here are simply excellent.</p>
<p>The downside is that the (optional) analogue stick module is a bit of a hassle to set up, and even when you're good to go, it can't replace the comfort of a standard controller. With this in mind, while the HautePad X is striving to be more than just a fight pad, its overall appeal may still be limited to the fighting game community. If you fit into that group, then what you've got here is one of the best options available for Switch and Switch 2 right now – just so long as you can stomach the premium price point.</p>

            <p>Whenever possible, I like to sucker-punch everybody's weekend plans by blogging the release of a huge 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game, factory sim or other managerial timesink last thing on Friday. In this case, I'm ambushing you with the avid rodent carpentry of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/whiskerwood">Whiskerwood</a>, the new city builder from Railgrade developers Minakata Dynamics and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> publishers Hooded Horse. It's got 40 different commodities, an elaborate weather simulation, and a demo out now on Steam. Haha, yes! You are welcome.
</p>
<p>In Whiskerwood, you are a mouse mayor setting up island colonies on behalf of some bastard fat cats. Yes, this one's a straight-shooting allegory, but going by the release date trailer, any transferable learnings about the plight of the mouse proletariat come a distinct second to the joy of plaiting conveyor belts.

<p>"Though your ship arrives with an initial supply of resources and a starting band of mice, you must quickly establish core structures, essential services, and production capabilities to ensure continued growth and prosperity," comments <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/">the Steam page</a>. "Establish waste management and healthcare facilities, ensure buildings are properly heated and maintained, and send forth your mice to fell trees, mine mountains, and tend to the fields and fish. 
</p><p>"The cats will demand their due," it goes on, "and your own citizens will abandon the colony if their needs aren't met on a daily basis - you must strike a perfect balance between the needs of the mouse and the demands of the cat." Cue opening bars of the Circle of Life.
</p>
<p>Other bulletpoints stress the role of verticality. Given that you're building on fairly titchy islands, you'll soon need to layer them up by either plunging underground or stretching your production facilities up mountainsides. It doesn't seem quite as extreme as All Wall Fall, in which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-kind-of-diseased-mind-makes-a-city-builder-with-actual-building-physics">your teetering metropoli are subject to actual real-time physics</a>, but those mice factories do look rather cramped and precarious.

<p>Your mice colonists have distinct attributes that fit certain tasks, together with preferences and weaknesses. Some are cool with labouring underground, others are all fine and dandy with air pollution. Up to a point, anyway. In good news for the bleeding hearts who feel bad about forcing virtual animals to breath smog for 100 hours, the Steam page suggests that you can one day overthrow the cats. 
</p>
<p>"Come rain or shine, the shipments must be fulfilled to feline satisfaction lest they call upon their henchmen to violently remind you of your duties," it thunders. "Will you forever serve this oppressive paw? Or will you raise your whiskers in defiance?"
</p><p>The game simulates a whole kaboodle of things. Different growing conditions per crop, for instance: you'll want damp caves for mushrooms, good soil and sunlight for wheat, and high ground for potatoes. (I grow potatoes. I wasn't aware they were best planted on hilltops.) If starting terrain conditions are suboptimal, you can lay hot water pipes to create greenhouse environments. All this and: naval combat! You'll be able to send forth galleons of nautical nibblers to scout new islands and hopefully not get the shit kicked out of them by pirates.</p>
<p>One comparison is the beaver-powered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/timberborn">Timberborn</a>, one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">best building games</a>, but I'm also slightly reminded of fellow Hooded Horse production <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/against-the-storm">Against The Storm</a>, sans roguelike elements. Whiskerwood launches into early access on 6th November, and you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3126370/Whiskerwood_Demo/">find that demo on Steam</a>.</p>

              <p><span>There’s a lot to love about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-crossover-review-hatsune-miku-2000626583"><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</span></i></a><span>. The kart racer is just under a week away from launch, and I’ve been playing it and really enjoying Sonic and friends’ latest run around the racetrack. It’s got a surprising amount of depth with its customizable builds, a wide spread of tracks referencing </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>history, and its races are chaotic, fast-paced fun. But one of the best things the game does happens just before the races. In single-player modes, you’re pitted against a specific Rival racer, and before the first race, they’ll exchange some words with whoever you’re playing as. These brief back-and-forths are absolutely delightful, and show that everyone in the </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>cast is a professional trash talker.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/CNSbEod2FF">pic.twitter.com/CNSbEod2FF</a></p> <p>— Mlick (@Mlickles) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mlickles/status/1968720889840562281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>When I play </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span>, I play almost exclusively as Shadow the Hedgehog, so I’ve seen just how vicious Sonic Team has made my boy when talking to pretty much everyone on the roster. Now that reviews are out and more coverage is circulating, I’m seeing a lot more of this banter and realizing that there’s some grade-A smack talk happening in this game. </span><i><span>Crossworlds&nbsp; </span></i><span>doesn’t really have a story like previous </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>racing games, so most of the character interactions come from these pre-race rap battles. Everyone in the roster has a little bit of attitude, and it means that if you put them in a competitive situation, they’re gonna try to rustle their opponents’ feathers.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Not all of these interactions are hostile, though. These races are all in good fun, so if characters who vibe get paired up as rivals, they’re usually pretty chill, and it’s sometimes illuminating to hear them talk, especially if they haven’t really had much screentime together over the years. So sit back and enjoy some of the best exchanges I’ve seen online thus far.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">OMEGA REALLY SAID YOU HAVE  NO MONEY, NO LEADS NO BITCHES</p> <p>OH MY GOD😭😭😭😭😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/n97aAGjRxF">https://t.co/n97aAGjRxF</a></p> <p>— Chonzo (COMMS OPEN) (@chonzodraws) <a href="https://twitter.com/chonzodraws/status/1968712490281287904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I get the feeling Shadow might not like Charmy.</p> <p>Though to be fair he doesn't seem to like a lot of people. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SonicRacingCrossWorlds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SonicRacingCrossWorlds</a> <a href="https://t.co/ZhyKA60fqu">pic.twitter.com/ZhyKA60fqu</a></p> <p>— The Sonic Stadium ✪ 25 YEARS OF SONIC NEWS (@sonicstadium) <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicstadium/status/1968672404940451959?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don't think you can blame Shadow for this TBH they've barely even interacted beyond that one recent <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IDWSonic?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IDWSonic</a> issue. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SonicRacingCrossWorlds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SonicRacingCrossWorlds</a> <a href="https://t.co/C1ubko6qvn">pic.twitter.com/C1ubko6qvn</a></p> <p>— The Sonic Stadium ✪ 25 YEARS OF SONIC NEWS (@sonicstadium) <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicstadium/status/1968745172587471248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Damn, Jet is really mad at Big <a href="https://t.co/8u3lIcKwzz">pic.twitter.com/8u3lIcKwzz</a></p> <p>— Funkin 🦉🐓 (@funkin03) <a href="https://twitter.com/funkin03/status/1968711269621383350?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is why Shadow is the best Sonic character.
