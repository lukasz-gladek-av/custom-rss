He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Hades II</em>’s second major update today, dubbed “The Warsong Update,” is available now, and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1145350%2Fview%2F503942841152569404" rel="sponsored">it adds</a> a new final boss, another hot god to receive boons from, and a bunch of other changes, according to developer Supergiant Games.</p><p>Supergiant is keeping the identity of the new boss a mystery, but they will be the final confrontation at the end of the game’s second route, which takes you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271897/hades-ii-2-major-update-olympic">to Mount Olympus</a>. The added god is Ares, who returns from the first <em>Hades</em>: “gain his varied and vicious Boons to see if you can satisfy his thirst for blood,” Supergiant says <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/blog/hades2-warsong-update">in a blog post</a>. You’ll also be able to meet another animal familiar and hear more than 2,000 new voice lines.</p><p>Supergiant has touched on some of its plans for the game’s early access development process, too. The studio is working on a third major update for <em>Hades II</em>, which “we intend to deliver some months from now,” Supergiant says in its blog post. Supergiant is remaining mum on when the eventual 1.0 launch might happen.</p><p>But even though <em>Hades II</em> technically isn’t finished yet, if you’re at all interested in it, I highly recommend checking it out. I’ve already put in more than 30 hours to the PC early access version, and I can’t wait to dig into everything added in this new update.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Supergiant's Hades 2 just received its second major update, which brings in a familiar face, but adds in so much more. Melinoë, Princess of the Underworld and sister to Zagreus, the protagonist of the first game, will be aided by the ultra-violent Ares and can now be granted his boons. There's also the addition of animal familiars, and several boons that have been reworked.</p><p>The Warsong Update is a free, automatic download as part of the early access development of Hades 2. Players may need to restart their Steam client to initiate the download. So let's break down what's new and improved for the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrpGYTlCjNQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yrpGYTlCjNQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><ul><li>The Final Confrontation: Battle to the summit of Mount Olympus and discover what awaits...</li><li>New Olympian: Meet the god of war himself, and choose from his many Boons</li><li>New Familiar: Find one last animal companion to join your journey and aid you in battle</li><li>Revamped Boons: Gain many powerful new and improved blessings from various Olympians</li><li>Revamped Altar of Ashes: Activate several reworked effects, and each Card now has all-new artwork</li><li>Revamped Resource Gathering: Worry no more about which resources you can collect</li><li>Revamped Menus: Look for new and improved animations across many menu screens</li><li>Expanded Story: Discuss the final confrontation and more with many different characters</li></ul><p>As for general gameplay, players no longer prioritize Gathering Tools in the Training Grounds, but they can still harvest any type of resource as long as they have unlocked each Tool. Psyche can no longer be found as a Location Reward; Bones may now be found sooner, instead.</p><p>In addition, all Guardians and Wardens with Guardian-style Life Bars are now resistant to the slowing effect of your Casts; previously this applied only to some of them, so watch out for that. Defenses have also been retooled, as any damage resistance effects you have no longer affect any Armor you have. Finally, Supergiant adjusted the requirements for certain key events early on. So, theoretically, it should be possible to reach the surface earlier than before.</p><p>You can check out the full list of reworked Boons <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/503942841152569404" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>, including Chaos' Barren which, after community feedback, now reduces your Curse duration.</p><p>"Early Access continues to be an essential part of Hades II development, and we hope you can feel this reflected in our Major Updates and other patches so far," Supergiant said. "With the core structure of both the Underworld and Surface routes now fully intact, we're excited to turn our attention to filling out more of the game's content categories, finishing more and more of what we started...until we're done!"</p><p>With this update now available, Supergiant says a third major update is on the way "some months from now." There's no word on when the 1.0 release will happen.</p>

			<p>Today, Supergiant Games <a href="https://x.com/SupergiantGames/status/1892272985962402180" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new major <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-early-access-launch-full-release-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hades II</a> update called Warsong. The patch introduces the game's final confrontation, allowing protagonist Melinoë to fight all the way to the top of Mount Olympus and discover what awaits there. There's a new Olympian (the God of War) to meet, who has many blessings to bestow upon Melinoë; and the new (and final) animal companion that will help her in battle.</p>
<p>The developers introduced several powerful new boons and improved many existing ones. The Altar of Ashes has been overhauled, though, featuring updated effects and brand new artwork. Resource gathering has been revamped, too. Players can gather any type of resource as long as they have unlocked each tool; resource appearance rates have been adjusted as well.</p>
<p>Menu screens will feature new and enhanced animations. More importantly, the story has been greatly expanded thanks to over 2,000 new voice lines, including new dialogue events for many characters.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, Psyche can no longer be found as a location reward; bones can now be found earlier instead. All Guardians and Wardens with Guardian-style health bars are now resistant to the slowing effect of the player's spells. Any damage resistance effects the player has will no longer affect any armor they have. Furthermore, the requirements for certain key events have been adjusted; as a result, it should be possible to reach the surface earlier than before.</p>
<p>The Warsong update also adds new foes, locations, and Chaos Trials (the Trial of Thunder, a Zeus-themed Trial set in Erebus; the Trial of Glory: a Hera-themed Trial set on Olympus; the Trial of the Fall: a Demeter-themed Trial set in the Mourning Fields; the Trial of Slaughter: an Ares-themed Trial set in Ephyra; the Trial of Destiny: a Chaos-themed Trial set on Olympus; and the Trial of Strife: an Eris-themed Trial set in Thessaly) to Hades II.</p>
<p>Supergiant Games confirmed that plans are already underway for the third big update, and the 1.0 launch, while still some time away, is getting closer.</p>

So it’s funny that Hazelight’s upcoming co-op game, <em>Split Fiction</em>, also feels timely, this one due to its obvious disdain for corporate slop and art theft at a time when nearly every creative field, including the one I work in now, is dealing with the fallout of AI.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>That was my read on it, at least.

What [the protagonists’] relationship is, how they evolve, what happens, and how they go forward. But it’s definitely there.”</p><p>In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ai-game-development-split-fictions-josef-fares-says-developers-should-work-with-and-not-against-technology/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ai-game-development-split-fictions-josef-fares-says-developers-should-work-with-and-not-against-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VGC</em></a></span>, Fares talked more on the subject of AI and its use in video games, and gave an answer that surprised me given <em>Split Fiction</em>’s obvious and admitted inspirations.</p><p>“We need to adapt to it,” Fares told <em>VGC</em>. “If it’s part of the industry we should see how to implement it to see how we get better games. I can understand the fact that some people could lose their jobs but that goes for every new technology.</p><p>“Bad stuff and good stuff will come out of it,” he continued. “You can’t just close your eyes. I believe AI will have a bigger impact on the world than the internet had, eventually. It’s a long time until you can use it in an actual development, at least not at our place, maybe others can do it.”</p><p>I would have preferred a more robust rejection of AI from Fares, and this quote does make me wonder just how boldly <em>Split Fiction </em>will make pro-art declarations when the full game launches. Ultimately, though, the game will succeed or fail on its own merits, and the three hours I played were quite promising. If you played <em>It Takes Two</em>, you probably have a good idea of what you’re getting into with <em>Split Fiction</em>. You and a co-op partner hop back and forth between different fantasy and science fiction worlds, each with their own bespoke mechanics. </p><p>In one level we fought through a cyberpunk city in which I—as sci-fi writer Mio—could manipulate gravity while my partner— playing as fantasy author Zoe—could use an energy whip to grab objects in the air and toss them at enemies and obstacles. Later, we both rode dragons through one of Zoe’s fantasy stories and flew through ruins searching for a way forward. <em>Split Fiction </em>riffs on fantasy and sci-fi tropes in each level, and even the most frustrating segments are whip-smart and delightfully intuitive. I played several levels without having to say a word to my co-op partner because the clarity of <em>Split Fiction</em>’s level design mitigates the potential disorientation that can occur when a game changes up your mechanics at a moment’s notice.</p><p>Hazelight has always excelled at designing multiplayer games that require constant adaptation and cooperation. As I sped from one level to the next to the next, none of the segments felt the same, even as they oscillated between the fantasy and science fiction genres of both heroes’ stories. Some made use of the same basic aesthetics, but that’s where the similarities ended. Not every level is a grand adventure, as <em>Split Fiction </em>delves into the absurd just as much as the epic. One level had me and my partner playing as pigs, and here I had the ability to launch myself forward with rainbow-colored farts. Eventually, we ended up as sentient hot dogs that had to cover ourselves in condiments and get inside a bun. <em>Split Fiction </em>is often silly, joyful, and too creative to stick with one idea for long.</p><p>I was only able to play about three hours of what Fares says is a 12-14 hour experience. Even if it doesn’t end up having a scathing commentary about the state of AI, I hope it is at least inventive enough to remind us that we don’t need AI to make something magical when it launches on March 6.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p>For <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/googles-genie-model-creates-interactive-2d-worlds-from-a-single-image/">a while now</a>, many AI researchers have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/new-ai-model-can-hallucinate-a-game-of-1993s-doom-in-real-time/">working</a> to integrate a so-called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/googles-genie-2-world-model-reveal-leaves-more-questions-than-answers/">"world model"</a> into their systems. Ideally, these models could infer a simulated understanding of how in-game objects and characters should behave based on video footage alone, then create fully interactive video that instantly simulates new playable worlds based on that understanding.</p>
<p>Microsoft Research's new World and Human Action Model (WHAM), <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/">revealed today</a> in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08600-3">a paper published in the journal Nature</a>, shows how quickly those models have advanced in a short time. But it also shows how much further we have to go before the dream of AI crafting complete, playable gameplay footage from just some basic prompts and sample video footage becomes a reality.</p>
<h2>More consistent, more persistent</h2>
<p>Much like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/googles-genie-2-world-model-reveal-leaves-more-questions-than-answers/">Google's Genie model</a> before it, WHAM starts by training on "ground truth" gameplay video and input data provided by actual players. In this case, that data comes from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1189800/Bleeding_Edge/"><em>Bleeding Edge</em></a>, a four-on-four online brawler released in 2020 by Microsoft subsidiary Ninja Theory. By collecting actual player footage since launch (as allowed under the game's user agreement), Microsoft gathered the equivalent of seven player-years' worth of gameplay video paired with real player inputs.</p>
<p>Early in that training process, Microsoft Research's Katja Hoffman said the model would get easily confused, generating inconsistent clips that would "deteriorate [into] these blocks of color." After 1 million training updates, though, the WHAM model started showing basic understanding of complex gameplay interactions, such as a power cell item exploding after three hits from the player or the movements of a specific character's flight abilities. The results continued to improve as the researchers threw more computing resources and larger models at the problem, according to the Nature paper.</p>
<p>To see just how well the WHAM model generated new gameplay sequences, Microsoft tested the model by giving it up to one second's worth of real gameplay footage and asking it to generate what subsequent frames would look like based on new simulated inputs. To test the model's consistency, Microsoft used actual human input strings to generate up to two minutes of new AI-generated footage, which was then compared to actual gameplay results using <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16124">the Frechet Video Distance metric</a>.</p>

That, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-someone-far-more-dangerous-than-handsome-jack-waiting-to-be-revealed/1100-6526054/">and he's apparently far more dangerous than Handsome Jack ever was</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445630-borderlands4%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445630" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445630-borderlands4%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445630"></a><figcaption>One of the new locales you'll explore in Borderlands 4</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445630-borderlands4%287%29.jpg"></figure><p>While Borderlands 3 expanded beyond Pandora to several other worlds, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-seamless-world-and-movement-mechanics-will-make-it-hard-for-players-to-go-back/1100-6528427/">Borderlands 4 will take place on the planet of Kairos</a>. Because the game has been designed for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5, this makes Kairos a seamless and "expansive" location to explore. According to Gearbox Software CEO Randy Pitchford, if you see an area of the world that interests you, you'll be free to explore it.</p><p>"One of the challenges with the term 'open world' is other games have done different things with that and there's things that we're doing that none of them have done," Pitchford said. "But there are things that we, specifically, don't do because we are Borderlands. And we care so deeply about combat dynamics and care so deeply about that moment-to-moment feeling. We craft this [world]. Everything that unfolds has [purpose]. You can feel the heart of the designer behind it. You can tell, people that care a lot made this shit."</p><p>"They're putting this here for [the player]. This isn't all just a systemic, algorithmically filled world. So be careful when you're talking about this. I wouldn't say 'open world' because that [term] will come with baggage. That isn't what we are. But it is seamless, and it is expansive, and it is larger than anything we've ever done, and it is filled like nothing we've ever done."</p><p>As for the world itself, Gearbox describes it as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-new-planet-is-shown-off-in-concept-art/1100-6526221/">high-tech but lo-fi location</a> full of interesting opportunities for players to experiment with gameplay and weapons.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445629-borderlands4%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445629" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445629-borderlands4%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445629"></a><figcaption>Meet the new Vault Hunters of Borderlands 4</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445629-borderlands4%286%29.jpg"></figure><p>Now let's talk about what we know about the game's playable characters so far.</p><p>Vault Hunters are the bread and butter of Borderlands games, as each unique character allows you to experience the main campaign from a different angle. There'll be four Vault Hunters to choose from on launch day--a tradition that dates back to the first Borderlands game--and each one will offer a specific archetype role. Gearbox hasn't elaborated on the Vault Hunter classes yet, but judging from the early gameplay trailers, it looks like we'll get to play as a hulking gunslinger, powerful Siren, and melee-focused swordsman in Borderlands 4.</p><h2 id="Borderlands_4_development_news">Borderlands 4 development news</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445631-borderlands4%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445631" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445631-borderlands4%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445631"></a><figcaption>This new Vault Hunter is an absolute unit</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445631-borderlands4%285%29.jpg"></figure><p>Like the previous games, Borderlands is a looter-shooter that mixes an exotic selection of weapons with unique action skills. The previous game shook up its bread-and-butter gunplay by making each weapon family--Dahl, Hyperion, Maliwan, Atlas, Vladof, Tediore, and Torgue--feel even more distinct from each other, so it'll be interesting to see if this idea carries through to Borderlands 4.</p><p>Gearbox has added that it wants to find a balance between approachability and complexity with the gameplay, both with the core first-person-shooting action and the RPG skill-trees that could be customized to create powerful Vault Hunter builds. At the same time, you can expect billions of different weapons to collect on your journey and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-narrative-director-doesnt-want-skibidi-or-hawk-tuah-jokes-in-game/1100-6528514/" data-ref-id="1100-6528514">Gearbox wants to cut back on</a> the "overabundance of toilet humor" that Borderlands 3 heavily relied on.</p><p>It also wouldn't be a Borderlands game without an option to catch a ride! So far, we've seen a chunky hoverbike and a high-tech chariot straight out of the pod-racing scene from Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, and it'll be interesting to see what else we can get behind the wheel of in the full game.</p><p>While you'll be able to get around Kairos with one of several new vehicles, a big upgrade to the gameplay is a grappling hook that can be used to reach areas and help you out in combat.</p><p>The other big question we're still waiting to see answered relates to what we can expect <em>after </em>Borderlands 4 launches.</p><p>In a tradition dating back to the very first Borderlands game, Gearbox has regularly supported its looter-shooters with post-launch DLC expansions. The developer has yet to confirm if this will be the case for Borderlands 4, but we wouldn't be too surprised to see history repeat itself here.</p><p>Some of the best Borderlands stories have come from these expansions after all--like Assault on Dragonkeep, The Claptastic Voyage, and Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot--so here's hoping we get a few more post-launch episodes.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-announced-coming-in-september/1100-6529459/" data-ref-id="1100-6529459">Borderlands 4 State of Play event</a> is set for this spring, so it might not be much longer until Gearbox shows off and discusses the game even more.</p>

For the launch of the season, Blizzard has sweetened the deal with some limited-time event challenges that reward even more loot boxes than will be normal. Plus, Discord is getting in on the loot box action as well, offering five of them as a reward for a new quest.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZR6lbjMFnk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mZR6lbjMFnk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">For the Discord quest, all players will need to do is accept the quest via the app and then play Overwatch 2 for 15 minutes. After completing and claiming the quest, players can redeem the code via Battle.net to receive their five free loot boxes. Quests can be found and accepted in the Discord app via the Discover tab. Players will have until February 25 to accept and complete the quest.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the Overwatch 2 weekly event challenges, players will need to first complete five matches (with wins counting as two) and then 15 matches to earn another five loot boxes per challenge. Since wins count as two, these can be done in just a few matches if your team comes out on top.</p><p dir="ltr">Combined with the Discord quest, and that's a total of 15 loot boxes for very little overall playtime. Players will have until February 25 to complete the in-game challenges, which also feature other rewards like the Rainy Day skin for Mercy.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-bringing-back-loot-boxes-very-soon-with-some-changes/1100-6529450/" data-ref-id="1100-6529450">Loot boxes work a little differently now</a> from when they first debuted in the original Overwatch. For starters, players can't buy them outright, though they are included as part of the game's free and paid battle pass. An item of Rare or better quality is guaranteed to drop from each box. After opening five boxes, players are guaranteed an Epic-quality item, with a guaranteed Legendary drop after opening 20 boxes.</p><p dir="ltr">The return of loot boxes isn't the only big change as part of Overwatch 2 Season 15, Honor and Glory.

<p>The MSI MPG Z890 Carbon WiFi is MSI’s latest motherboard geared towards that mid-to-lower premium range of gamers and power users who need a board that can handle top-tier components and future upgrades. Featuring the new LGA 1851 designed for the new Intel Arrow Lake processors, MSI put in one of its best efforts when it comes to features, ease of use, an overall look. But is there enough here to justify the $400-plus price point?</p>



<h2 id="h-msi-mpg-z890-carbon-wifi-review">MSI MPG Z890 Carbon WiFi Review</h2>



<p>Despite what people might tell you, a quality motherboard can be just as important as the CPU going in your system. In many ways, it’s the backbone of your gaming rig, and <a href="https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/MPG-Z890-CARBON-WIFI/Overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">picking the right one</a> can make or break your experience. What MSI has with the MPG Z890 Carbon WiFi is a product aimed at making that experience as easy as possible, no matter how well versed you are in building your own machine.</p>



<p>It all starts with the overall design.</p>



<p>Building a PC can sometimes feel like a test of patience, but this motherboard makes it as painless as possible. The pre-mounted I/O shield is a small but welcome touch, saving you from the hassle of aligning it just right and possibly snapping or bending the shield. Labels on the board itself are clear and beginner-friendly, making it easier to slot everything into place without second-guessing yourself.</p>



<p>Installing components is refreshingly simple. The tool-less PCIe x16 slot release is a game-changer for those rocking a massive GPU like the RTX 4090 as there’s no more wrestling with tiny latches or putting an obnoxious amount of pressure just to unlock the card from the board. And the screwless M.2 installation? A dream. Pop the drive in, click it down, and you’re done.</p>

<h3 id="h-layout-amp-accessibility">Layout &amp; Accessibility</h3>



<p>MSI does a solid job with the board’s overall layout. Everything feels well-placed on this ATX board, making cable management and clean builds way more achievable.</p>



<p>There are three PCIe slots for components. The top is PCIe 5.0 x16, perfect for modern graphics cards. The middle slot is PCIe 5.0 x8 while the third is PCIe 4.0 x4.</p>



<p>For storage, there are plenty of options. Five M.2 slots give you plenty of space to make sure you always have enough storage on your machine. My only problem is that only one supports PCIe 5.,0 speeds. For a motherboard in this price range, you’d expect at least two or three. If you’re planning a full Gen 5 build, that could be a letdown.</p>



<p>With cooling and RGB, there are 7 fan headers, 4 RGB headers, a 3-pin water flow sensor, and a 2-pin thermal sensor that gives you a lot of flexibility.</p>



<h3 id="h-connectivity-galore-and-then-some">Connectivity Galore (And Then Some)</h3>



<p>When you are spending, possibly, as much as your CPU on the motherboard, one thing you’ll want to make sure of is that what you buy has the connections you need. And one thing the MPG Z890 Carbon WiFi doesn’t skimp on is connectivity.</p>



<p>On the rear I/O, there are 13 total USB ports—10 USB-A 3.2 and 3 USB-C. The 10 USB-A ports support up to 10Gbps while one of the USB-C ports also supports 10Gbps. The other two USB-C are Thunderbolt 4 with DisplayPort output that have speeds up to 40Gbps.</p>



<p>If you need more USB functionality, there are four USB 2.0 headers, four USB 5Gbps Type-A headers, and even a single 20Gbps USB Type C header. Again, if you need connections, this board <em>has </em>connections. With everything I use on a daily basis—Stream Deck, capture card, audio interface, and multiple external drives, just  to name a few—I have found no issue with speeds or connection quality in the months I’ve used this motherboard. For full transparency, there were times with the last-gen Z790 Carbon WiFi where you could sense a noticeable slowdown when trying to move files across external drives even with a high-end CPU. That hasn’t happened once with the Z890.</p>



<p>For the wireless user, the motherboard supports Wi-Fi 7 with speeds up to 5.8Gbps as well as Bluetooth 5.4. There are still some issues with Bluetooth audio cutting in and out, but I have yet to find a motherboard that works perfectly on that front. Two LAN ports support 2.5Gbps and 5Gbps.</p>



<p>On the audio front, the board has built-in optical output with 7.1 channel audio.</p>



<h3 id="h-bios-amp-customization">BIOS &amp; Customization</h3>



<p>It’s long been my opinion that MSI has one of the most user-friendly BIOS there is. With the Z890 Chipset, this becomes even more so with a new look that makes it even easier to find and adjust the settings you’d like. It’s as straightforward as it can be in my opinion, even if you’re not a seasoned overclocker.</p>



<p>As you’d expect from any BIOS, MSI’s offers users the ability for custom fan control, overclocking, boot order, and more. What makes it stand out, however, is how simple they make it. </p>



<p>The  EZ Mode works as expected, which isn’t always the case with some BIOS. From boosting the CPU to NPU to Memory, everything is one click away, which helps take the worry out of your hands. If you want to get more in the weeds, however, even the Advanced Settings are laid out in a way to prevent you from getting overwhelmed.</p>



<p>Everything from PCIe settings to P-Core and E-Core ratios to CPU and Memory Frequency and more is available for your adjustment. Just be careful. If you do decide to try your hand at overclocking, or messing with the settings at all, take it slowly and in increments. Making too large of a change could lead to stability problems and damage your machine.</p>



<p>Lastly, there’s the MSI proprietary software like MSI Center, Mystic Light, and others. Personally, I find these programs to weigh down a system more than help it. Mystic Light for RGB management is kind of a neccessity if that’s what you need to pair with other programs, but for hardware monitoring, there are other lightweight options.</p>



<h3 id="h-msi-mpg-z890-carbon-wifi-review-verdict">MSI MPG Z890 Carbon WiFi Review Verdict</h3>



<p>The MSI MPG Z890 Carbon WiFi is one motherboard with a ton going for it.  It has plenty of connectivity options, a great-looking design, and is one of the easiest borders to build in for the DIY PC enthusiast. It’s price can scare people away, especially with the belief that the LGA 1851 socket will only be supported with new CPUs until 2026. That said, if you are looking at picking up this board, it’s likely you won’t be upgrading again for quite some time. </p>



<p>The support for DDR5 RAM and PCIe 5.0 helps future proof the board as much as you can with how fast technology moves. Again, it would’ve been nice for more PCIe 5.0 M.2 slots, but I don’t think it’s a deal breaker. If the $400-plus price tag doesn’t scare you away, you’d honestly be hard-pressed to find a more well-rounded motherboard.</p>

The area is covered in graffiti, including the following areas:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The graffiti marks on the fence's Do Not Enter sign</li><li dir="ltr">Graffiti on the green dumpster near the Yooper Scooper</li><li dir="ltr">There are six different graffiti opportunities on the park benches by Yooper Scooper</li><li dir="ltr">Graffiti on the side of the white van</li><li dir="ltr">Spray paint on the right side of the Movie Palace</li><li dir="ltr">Even more graffiti can be found on the rooftop if you take the ladder on the right side</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Spotlights__Kat__Nora__Autumn___10_collectibles_each">Spotlights: Kat, Nora, Autumn - 10 collectibles each</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446604-spotlight.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446604" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446604-spotlight.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446604"></a><figcaption>Character spotlights</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446604-spotlight.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's really no trick to these spotlight collectibles. Simply record 10 moments for each character. This can all be done during the chapter titled <strong>The First Night</strong>, or you can collect moments more organically throughout the entirety of Tape 1. You can work on this anytime Swann is able to record while with the girls.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Forgotten_Playground___6_collectibles_needed">Forgotten Playground - 6 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446605-forgottenplayground.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446605" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446605-forgottenplayground.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446605"></a><figcaption>Forgotten Playground</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446605-forgottenplayground.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Forgotten Playground collectibles can be earned during the chapter called <strong>The First Night</strong>. If you miss any, they can also be collected in later scenes where you visit the park, such as during Kat's memoir.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a few more collectibles than you need here, but here are the main ones you'll likely find:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The seesaw</li><li dir="ltr">The marbles on the ground</li><li dir="ltr">The giant rocketship</li><li dir="ltr">The jungle gym</li><li dir="ltr">The animal-shaped spring riders</li><li dir="ltr">Swing set</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Bullies___7_collectibles_needed">Bullies - 7 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446606-bullies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446606" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446606-bullies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446606"></a><figcaption>Filming Dylan after confrontation</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446606-bullies.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The bullies category can be started early on in the game, with the very first encounter with Dylan and Corey during the chapter titled <strong>The Day We Met</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Mild Spoilers: </strong>If you make the same apologetic and non confrontational dialogue choices as I did when dealing with Dylan and Corey, you'll need to <strong>replay this scene in Collectible mode</strong> to get more of these. You need to pick the taunting choices, where you taunt and film Dylan, and then agree to film Corey and his bike.</p><p dir="ltr">The final bully collectibles come from an opportunity to film Corey again later in the game. This comes after near the end of the chapter titled the <strong>Abyss</strong>. This is also optional and missable. Nora will prompt you to film Corey, but the choice is yours.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Water_Tower___4_collectibles_needed">Water Tower - 4 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446607-watertower.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446607" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446607-watertower.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446607"></a><figcaption>Velvet Cove water tower</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446607-watertower.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This is another easy category. You're basically filming the same Velvet Cove water tower throughout various scenes in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the opportunities are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Film while standing in the Movie Palace parking lot</li><li dir="ltr">Film from Swann's bedroom window in various chapters</li><li dir="ltr">Can be filmed from the park in various chapters</li><li dir="ltr">Can be seen from the bar parking lot</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Mothgirl_Chronicles___6_collectibles_needed">Mothgirl Chronicles - 6 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446608-mothgirlfinal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446608" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446608-mothgirlfinal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446608"></a><figcaption>Mothgirl placement at the end of Riot Grrrl</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446608-mothgirlfinal.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Mothgirl Chronicles collectible category starts during the chapter called <strong>Packing Up</strong>. This is an unmissable part of the story that takes place in Swann's bedroom, and filming Mothgirl for the first time unlocks this collectible category.</p><p dir="ltr">The remaining five collectibles require you to find a special spot where you can place Mothgirl and film. There don't seem to be any extra locations, so you'll need to replay sections if you miss these.</p><p dir="ltr">These hidden locations are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Later, during<strong> Packing Up</strong>, there is a scene with the girls at the lake, and you can place Mothgirl on a nearby rock and film her</li><li dir="ltr">During the chapter called <strong>Double Dare</strong>, go up into the attic. You'll want to <strong>do this before you light the fireplace</strong>. Place Mothgirl on the ledge of the open section of the attic. (This collectible appears to be glitched. It lets me place Mothgirl here, but the game marks this as a location I've already recorded even though it wasn't previously recorded or in the footage.)</li><li dir="ltr">In the chapter titled <strong>Kat</strong>, you'll film an interview with her. You'll have the option to explore around the park afterwards, so make sure you <strong>grab your collectibles before telling her you're done</strong>. There are two Mothgirl locations here. Place Mothgirl on both the swing and the slide for two more collectible opportunities</li><li dir="ltr">During the chapter called <strong>Riot Grrrls</strong>, you'll break into the fenced-off area of the bar. Immediately look right and place Mothgirl in the lounge chair on the right</li><li dir="ltr">After turning on the power during Riot Grrrls, run back to Nora's band setup and place Mothgirl on one of the speakers</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Terrible_Toys___6_collectibles_needed">Terrible Toys - 6 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446609-terribletoysbunnycar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446609" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446609-terribletoysbunnycar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446609"></a><figcaption>Bunny car pictured with the moo box on top of it for optional trophy</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446609-terribletoysbunnycar.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Terrible Toys memoir category requires you to film weird toys you find while on your adventures. Not all of these are available at this time, as Don't Nod told GameSpot that one of them is only found in Tape 2, coming this April, but here are the five known locations so far:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">During the chapter called The First Night, you can find a collectible when helping Kat look for the keys. You'll see a <strong>troll doll</strong></li><li dir="ltr">Another toy can be found during The First Night chapter. When looking for something to knock down the keys, you follow Autumn into a junkyard. Here you'll find a <strong>creepy doll</strong> to film at the campsite</li><li dir="ltr">The third one you'll encounter is during the chapter called Garage Band. Inside Nora's garage you'll find a weird <strong>bunny car</strong> to film</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Grab the item sitting on top of the bunny car and inspect it. Rotating the item until it moos like a cow will <strong>unlock the hidden MOO! trophy/achievement</strong> to "Make the moo box moo."</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The next is found during chapter - Lights, Camera, Action! Before you follow your friends across the tree bridge, turn right towards the lake to find another <strong>creepy doll</strong></li><li dir="ltr">The next is a <strong>voodoo doll</strong> that can be found in various times and locations. The best times to look are either during Don't Be Afraid of the Dark or This Old House. Head up into the cabin's attic to find a voodoo doll. The doll can also be found later in the story on a trail leading away from the cabin, or in a small cave entrance. It can only be counted once, though</li></ul><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that since not all Terrible Toys can be found yet, it may also be the case that some other collectible categories can be finished in Tape 2, likely making those easier to complete.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Strangers___7_collectibles_needed">Strangers - 7 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446610-strangers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446610" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446610-strangers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446610"></a><figcaption>Strangers at the bar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446610-strangers.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are seven collectibles needed for the Strangers memoir category. The entire category is really easy to miss, depending on how you approach specific moments in the game.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The first four can be discovered during the chapter called <strong>The Day We Met</strong>. Before interacting with any characters, use the ladder on the right side of the Movie Palace. You can climb up and get a view of two sets of characters. Corey and Dylan are at the back, and Nora and Autumn are at the Yooper Scooper ice cream shack. Use the camcorder to view them and then record each one as strangers</li></ul><p dir="ltr">There's a <strong>trophy/achievement you can unlock called "Dub and Dubber"</strong> by imitating the strangers as you film them. I had to imitate Corey, Dylan, and Nora before the trophy popped.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">There might be early opportunities I missed, but I got the last three strangers needed for the category recorded before the last part of the <strong>Riot Grrrls</strong> chapter. Once you're tasked with placing the stickers, head to the front of the bar to find three men walking out. Record each of them to complete the Strangers category</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Scenic_Views___4_collectibles_needed">Scenic Views - 4 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446611-scenicviews.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446611" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446611-scenicviews.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446611"></a><figcaption>Scenic View captured at the lake during Lights, Camera, Action!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446611-scenicviews.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Scenic views is a category that only requires four game environments to be recorded, but you'll have several opportunities to do so.</p><p dir="ltr">The first of the scenic views can be captured during the chapter called <strong>Welcome to Velvet Cove</strong>. There will be a pretty scene by the lake that Swann will want to film.</p><p dir="ltr">While this isn't all of the locations, some other scenic options include:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">A scenic view near the picnic tables at the Yooper Scooper during <strong>The Day We Met</strong></li><li dir="ltr">Looking across the road from the Yooper Scooper during<strong> The Day We Met</strong></li><li dir="ltr">A view of the river during <strong>Lights, Camera, Action!</strong></li><li dir="ltr">Another is found during<strong> Lights, Camera, Action </strong>while visiting the lake with your friends</li><li dir="ltr">Before crossing the tree bridge, turn right to capture another scenic view of the lake in <strong>Lights, Camera, Action!</strong></li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Hunting___8_collectibles_needed">Hunting - 8 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446612-hunting.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446612" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446612-hunting.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446612"></a><figcaption>Hunting stand near padlock fence</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446612-hunting.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are only eight Hunting collectibles needed, and these are easy items that can be found throughout much of the story.</p><p dir="ltr">Here are some you'll encounter early in the game:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">During Swann's first walk through the nature trails during <strong>Welcome to Velvet Cove</strong>, you come across opportunities to film a doe, stag, some animal tracks, and bones</li><li dir="ltr">More hunting collectibles are given during the trail walk with friends during <strong>Lights, Camera, Action!</strong> This includes more deer walking around, arrows, and deer antlers found on the path</li><li dir="ltr">In <strong>Lights, Camera, Action</strong>, during the scene at the padlock fence, where Kat pretends to shock herself, there is a hunting stand</li><li dir="ltr">Just past the hunting stand mentioned above are more animal tracks to record</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Additionally, there is a trophy/achievement unlock that you can get here at the fence.

This first-person horror game, which follows the final days of a shipwrecked space freighter crew, goes to some truly unsettling places.

Now that the game is a proven success, the developers are bringing Mouthwashing to consoles and even giving it a physical release.</p><p>While a specific date has not been shared yet, Mouthwashing will become available on Nintendo Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S before the end of 2025. Physical editions of Mouthwashing PS5 and Nintendo Switch are also in the works, with preorders via Fangamer going live soon.</p><p>If you don't want to wait for Mouthwashing to come to consoles before playing it, you can buy it for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2475490/Mouthwashing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$13 right now on Steam</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nightreign-is-shaping-up-to-be-a-fast-and-frantic-take-on-elden-ring.1113627/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A bunch of <em>Verge</em> staffers came back from the weekend chatting about our experiences with <em>Elden Ring Nightreign’s</em> network tests. We generally enjoyed the fast-paced, co-op-focused spin on <em>Elden Ring</em> that takes cues from roguelikes and battle royale games — and when things were good, they were <em>really</em> good. But we also ran into some frustrating connection issues that we worry could dampen the experience of the full game if they’re not worked out.</p><p>Read more about what we thought below. The game will be officially released on May 30th.</p><p>While playing the <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> network test, the word that kept coming to mind to describe it was “frantic.”</p><p>I played the original <em>Elden Ring</em> at a plodding pace. For every possible encounter, I cast spells from a distance as an astrologer to avoid the scary baddies, and I took advantage of numerous guides to find great gear and easy leveling spots.</p><p>I couldn’t do that with <em>Nightreign</em>; its constant, looming, battle royale-style closing ring of danger forces you to stay moving. The persistent threat of the storm meant I had to make quick decisions about which weapons to experiment with. To get runes to level up, I had to fight enemies head-on, and if I didn’t level up enough, I’d be useless against the fearsome bosses.</p><p>But despite <em>Nightreign</em> forcing me to play differently, I came to love the breakneck speed because of how it pushed me out of my comfort zone. And when I matched up with two other solid players, <em>Nightreign</em> was just awesome: I had a blast mowing through baddies and bosses with a coordinated group, especially when one team I played with easily took down a surprise Fell Omen spawn on the roof of a small keep.</p><p>I only just started to get the hang of <em>Nightreign</em> at the end of the network test. I can’t wait to jump into the full game and experiment with everything it has to offer, even if it means I have to keep being uncomfortable. <em>— Jay Peters, news editor</em></p><p>Like Jay, <em>Elden Ring Nightreign’s</em> pacing pushed me to play with haste and act braver than I normally do in The Lands Between. But I don’t always<em> want</em> to go that fast. </p><p>I enjoyed my drops into Limveld enough to play over five hours in total. The bulk of this came during the final play session when I partied up with two friends for three nonstop hours. We communicated via Discord to overcome the game’s lack of voice chat (an odd omission, though if the goal is to avoid player toxicity, I can understand it).</p><p>I really like the idea of a co-op <em>Elden Ring</em> that works well in short sessions. The battle royale format forces you to rush and encourages experimentation; with some buddies, it was an absolute thrill. At the same time, this game has no chill. There’s no casually hanging with the boys.</p><p>The trappings of a battle royale in a scaled-down <em>Elden Ring</em> world means you won’t be methodically exploring lengthy, exquisitely designed dungeons. That’s a bummer because to play with seamless co-op in the original game requires dealing with FromSoftware’s <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/is-elden-ring-co-op-multiplayer/">draconian restrictions</a> or <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510">installing a mod on PC</a>. <em>Nightreign</em> is obviously <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/612715/elden-ring-nightreign-game-director-interview">designed with something else in mind</a>. <em>– Antonio G. Di Benedetto, reviewer</em></p><p>I went into the <em>Nightreign</em> network test with no material history of playing <em>Elden Ring</em> and a bitter taste from my previous attempts at playing Soulslike games. But I was intrigued by the idea of playing the game with a team so we could carry each other through the unforgivably challenging hordes of monsters and bosses.</p><p>It turns out, I was always the one who needed the carrying.</p><p>My kind of fun usually doesn’t involve timely dodges and strategic spellcasting, but I did have a blast following people I’ve matched with who seemed to know what the hell they were doing. They took me all the way to the second day, and we died together against the Fell Omen. They must have revived my sad Wylder no less than 20 times.</p><p>I played the final network test window Sunday night with my colleague Sean Hollister, who is a pretty decent <em>Demon’s / Dark Souls </em>player and beat <em>Elden Ring</em>. We did have fun joking about how you need to smack a player while they’re down to revive them, frantically running away from those damn Flame Chariots, and wondering what our poor third teammate thought of us since they weren’t in our Discord.</p><p>I’m not sure if I’ll come back and play <em>Nightreign</em>. Maybe the menu system could be revamped so that it’s better designed for the fast-paced missions the game puts you through. But really, I just need to figure out how to duck, dip, dive, and dodge. <em>— Umar Shakir, news writer</em></p><p>I’ll admit: I don’t quite get it. Bite-sized co-op <em>Elden Ring</em>, yes, that sounds like an amazing idea. But why force it to fit inside the tired trappings of a battle royale game? The joy of <em>Souls</em> has always been cautious exploration, but now there’s a blue ring of creeping deadly fire keeping me from exploring it meaningfully and a “where we dropping boys?”-style intro to every mission rather than the mystical teleportation that has defined FromSoftware’s worlds. I just can’t feel that immersion when I’m inexplicably hacking at my buddy’s body to raise them when they’re downed — another trope of battle royale that just doesn’t make quite as much sense in a <em>Souls</em> world.</p><p>I <em>did</em> enjoy getting utterly trashed by the game with my colleague Umar — but if I could just as easily play co-op <em>Shadow of the Erdtree, </em>I’d be happier. — <em>Sean Hollister, senior editor</em></p><p>I’m really concerned about potential network stability and the overall communication issues in <em>Nightreign</em>. Though I didn’t get to play the network tests, during <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/610585/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview">my playtests ahead of that</a>, connectivity issues were frequent and terrible. Based on what I’ve seen from players <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612986/elden-ring-nightreigns-network-test-be-testing-those-networks">and FromSoftware itself</a>, it seems like some of those issues have persisted.</p><p>Because we could never maintain a stable enough connection for all three members of the party, my team never managed to make it to the boss on the third day. It got so bad that, at one point, after I lost connection for the umpteenth time, I simply quit playing, contenting myself with walking around the testing area to watch others try to do what we couldn’t (and suffering connection issues as well).</p><p>On top of that, there’s no party chat in the game itself. I got around it because I could just talk to the two other players at my table. However, I wondered how randos would get over the lack of communication tools beyond emoting. You really don’t have time to pull up the emote wheel and select “Help me!” when the Fell Omen is chewing on your ass. <em>— Ash Parrish, games reporter</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And while there have been several mods since Team Fortress 2 was launched in 2007, Valve has now released the game's entire source code, which may open the door to a lot of fan creations.</p><p>Valve made the announcement on <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=238809" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Team Fortress 2's official page</a>, while noting that the source code gives mods builders "the ability to change, extend or rewrite TF2, making anything from small tweaks to complete conversions." However, this code is being shared on a non-commercial basis. This means that programmers won't be able to sell creations that were made from Team Fortress 2's foundations. However, the new fan-made mods can be listed in the Steam Store as free releases.</p><p>The line between professional game makers and modders has blurred over the years, and there are definitely talented fans who can probably work wonders, even with an 18-year-old game engine. In 2021, a group of modders took it upon themselves to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-modders-are-recreating-a-version-with-better-graphics-in-source-2/1100-6495075/" data-ref-id="1100-6495075">recreate Team Fortress 2 in Valve's Source 2 game engine</a>. It should be interesting to see if modders can push the Team Fortress 2 code into something that goes far beyond the scope of the original game.</p><p>Last year, players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-hit-with-thousands-of-negative-steam-reviews-protesting-bot-issues/1100-6523926/" data-ref-id="1100-6523926">review-bombed Team Fortress 2</a> over the game's ongoing issues with bots, which go back a few years. Regardless, Valve has continued to offer some additional content for the game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-gets-14-new-maps-as-part-of-major-summer-update/1100-6515934/" data-ref-id="1100-6515934">including new maps</a>, well after most publishers would have declared the title to be finished.</p>

                <p>Former Sony Interactive Entertainment president Shuhei Yoshida has been speaking out about his time at PlayStation on podcasts, and he recently commented about the closure of PlayStation's Japan Studio. Specifically, he said that the disappearance of the "double-A" game market was a major reason for the downfall of the studio.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking on the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/sacred-symbols-122597374" rel="nofollow ">Sacred Symbols podcast</a>, Yoshida stated that during his time with PlayStation, Japan Studio had "great products," but didn't have many "AAA-level successful products," other than Gran Turismo. "That became more and more important as the big games became bigger. The indies filled the gap and the double-A market seems to have disappeared. Most of the IPs that Japan Studio had were in that smaller double-A sized group, and the market became really difficult for these kinds of games."</p><p dir="ltr">He cited Gravity Rush 2 as an example, noting that its director Keiichiro Toyama pitched several ideas for a follow-up, but Japan Studio was not able to greenlight any of them due to market conditions. Yoshida noted that the closure of Japan Studio did allow Toyama to create his own studio, which eventually produced the 2024 release Slitterhead. Sony shut down Japan Studio back in April 2021. Some of the studio's best-known games include Ape Escape, the Knack series, and the Demon's Souls remake.</p><p>The remnants of Japan Studio can still be seen at Team Asobi, however. The studio, which spun off from Japan Studio, recently developed the acclaimed Astro Bot, which won The Game Awards' 2024 game of the year, among other accolades.</p>

			<p>Techland has announced that starting today, the Tower Raid roguelite co-op mode that <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-tower-raid-open-beta-is-out-now-introducing-a-brand-new-co-op-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been tested since mid-2024</a> is now available permanently in Dying Light 2: Stay Human. This is part of the franchise's 10th anniversary celebrations and roadmap, which we dived into during <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-10th-anniversary-qa-with-franchise-director-tymon-smektala/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our recent interview with Techland's Tymon Smektala</a>.</p>
<p>In Tower Raid, Dying Light 2 players won't be playing as the game's regular protagonist, Aiden Caldwell. They will instead choose from four different characters, each belonging to a specific class archetype: Tank, Brawler, Ranger or Specialist. Each comes with their own unique set of skills. Players who really want a challenge may choose to go with a smaller squad than four, or even solo if they want to test themselves against the zombies.</p>
<p>There are three difficulty modes available: Quick, Normal and Elite. This choice affects the length of the session. Each run features a new mix of floors and challenges, ensuring a dynamic experience at every attempt at climbing the Tower.</p>
<p>The developers are also introducing a new progression system that was engineered to reward persistence through runs. With each failure, players unlock new skills and equipment to improve their chances on the challenging run. In the Tower Raid hub, players will also find Sola, a trader offering unique rewards such as the Office Day Outfit, the Kuai Dagger and the Silenced Pistol.</p>

<p>While this is a full release of Tower Raid in Dying Light 2: Stay Human, Techland said it's actively seeking player feedback through the franchise's official social media channels (Facebook, X, Instagram), Discord and Reddit communities to further refine the gameplay experience. In addition, a special survey will be released in a few days to gather further insights from players.</p>
<p>As we learned in the aforementioned interview, the Polish developer still has big plans to update this game despite the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-confirmed-for-this-summer-as-franchise-celebrates-10th-anniversary-with-new-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Summer launch window for the spin-off Dying Light: The Beast. Throughout 2025, Dying Light 2 is getting coop gameplay and matchmaking improvements, Community Map support improvements, new Tower Raid characters, new firearms and melee weapons, a new weapon class, further Prologue improvements, and graphical/technical improvements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-sales-1m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ironwood Games and publisher Kepler Interactive have announced that their survival drive-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>has managed to hit a brand new sales milestone.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the game has officially passed the one million sales mark. That means it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-sales-update" rel="nofollow">picked up another 400,000 sales</a> for itself since July last year, which definitely isn't too shabby for an indie studio like Ironwood.</p>

<p>As Ironwood itself says in the aforementioned press release, the studio has "less than 20 staff", and&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>is its first game, which I think makes the game passing the million mark even more impressive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pacific-drive-sales-1m-night.jpg?itok=lxix-O8t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pacific-drive-sales-1m-night.jpg?itok=xYMS8_GL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>has passed the million mark in terms of sales.</figcaption></figure><p>Lest you think Ironwood Studios is done with&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, though, think again. The game has already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-update-customization" rel="nofollow">received</a> three major updates since release, and the developer is teasing that the "fourth and most substantial update" will launch soon.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Ironwood doesn't provide a specific release window for that update, so we could be waiting quite a while for it. Still, given that this isn't a live service game, it's nice to see the studio supporting it with any kind of post-launch plan.</p>

<p><em>Pacific Drive</em>'s success means it's also caught the eye of Hollywood filmmaker James Wan, best known for the likes of&nbsp;<em>Insidious&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Saw</em>. His <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-tv-series-rights-james-wan" rel="nofollow">production company acquired the rights</a> to a&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>TV show back in December.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, it's an indie survival game in which you must drive your car across the Olympic Exclusion Zone, foraging for resources and dodging anomalies as you go. If you can imagine&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<em>Driver</em>, you're not far off.</p>




<p>The game is as much about repairing your car and making sure it runs alright as it is dodging the horrors of the Zone, so if you're in the market for a game that mixes vehicle maintenance with desperate struggles for your life, this is the one for you.</p>

<p><em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/pacific-drive/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.
