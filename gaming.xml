            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/japanese-nintendo-switch-eshop-payment-crackdown-bans-overseas-cards-and-paypal.1095855/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/japanese-nintendo-switch-eshop-payment-crackdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that starting later this year, you'll no longer be able to use overseas-issued payment cards or PayPal accounts in order to pay for content from the Japanese Switch eShop.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2025/0130.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">notice</a> on the Japanese Nintendo website (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switchs-japan-eshop-will-no-longer-accept-foreign-cards-or-paypal-to-prevent-fraudulent-use/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), the gaming giant says that in order to "prevent fraudulent use" (we're using machine translation for the post, which is originally in Japanese", overseas-issued cards and PayPal accounts will be banned.</p>

<p>It looks as though PayPal accounts opened in Japan, as well as Japan-issued credit cards, will still be valid. Unfortunately, though, if you've been using the Japanese eShop from outside Japan, it looks like you might have to find a new payment method.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-eshop-japanese-payment-crackdown.jpg?itok=RWrI0Juv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-eshop-japanese-payment-crackdown.jpg?itok=uUO1bQMx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll have to pick a different payment method for the Japanese eShop in future.</figcaption></figure><p>It's common for Switch players to buy their games from the Japanese eShop, either to circumvent what they see as poor exchange rates or to get games that they can't get in their native countries.</p>

<p>Nintendo's reference to "fraudulent" behavior might be a veiled nod to this practice; it might seem relatively harmless to me, but Nintendo is well-known for what could charitably called <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">"fiercely protecting its products"</a>, so I wouldn't be surprised if that was the reasoning.</p>

<p>So, what does this mean for you if you're a frequent user of the Japanese eShop? Well, it means you'll need to find some way of using a Japan-issued payment method if you want to continue, unfortunately.</p>

<p>This decision shouldn't affect your country's native eShop, and it also likely won't change anything if you're already using a Japanese payment method to access the eShop.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-handheld-mode.jpg?itok=Oa1ZSUGg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-handheld-mode.jpg?itok=numsHrxt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo is currently gearing up for the release of the Switch 2.</figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this month, Nintendo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">officially announced the Switch's successor</a>, putting an end to months of speculation and leaks regarding the device's appearance.</p>

<p>We still don't know what kind of specs the machine will have, though; we'll have to wait until April's forthcoming Nintendo Direct in order to learn that.</p>

<p>Still, with a new device coming, perhaps it's no wonder Nintendo is tightening its rules a little. Stay tuned for more. In the meantime, the Japanese eShop payment crackdown takes effect on March 25th.</p>

Although this way you’ll be getting a regular model, and not a pre-release Space World 2000 version of the machine.</p><p>Of all the various special edition GameCubes that appeared during the console’s heyday 24 years ago, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/25-year-old-prototype-space-world-gamecube-listed-on-ebay-for-100000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/25-year-old-prototype-space-world-gamecube-listed-on-ebay-for-100000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as <em>IGN</em> reports</a></span>, the Space World is the rarest. Hence the astonishing (and yet still rather hopeful) price tag.</p><p>This particular model was a prototype design, one of five, that appeared at Nintendo’s annual Space World trade show in Japan in the year 2000. It was to be the penultimate Space World, but the beginning of the adorable machine’s life, unveiled at the event—alongside the Game Boy Advance. It was lost for a couple of decades, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-gamecube-space-world-direct-japan-2000-zelda-1850402685&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-gamecube-space-world-direct-japan-2000-zelda-1850402685">and then rediscovered in 2023</a></span>. It is apparently 1mm bigger in all dimensions than the final retail GameCube, has a different-shaped vent at the back, and, well, didn’t have a CPU or GPU inside.</p><p>Which is to say, yes, this is a $100,000 GameCube that can’t play games. As the eBay description reads, “This is a display unit. The only thing that works is the little LED on top.” And honestly, I’m impressed the light still turns on quarter of a century later.</p><p>The current owner says they’re selling the model in order to fund a place where people can gather to play games, “where the entire family can enjoy, people can meet other people, talk with people who feel uncomfortable with other people, and make the visitors feel young again.” Which sounds lovely.</p><p>But be sure before you buy. The sales page makes clear there’s no-takes-backsies.</p><p>“I do not run a shop, please, no refunds if the console is not to your liking.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-2-swings-onto-steam-with-forgiving-pc-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s Marvel Spider-Man 2 swings onto PC today, January 30, and while the intrepid webslinger’s port plans have been in the works for a while, we didn’t know exactly how well it might run on PCs until now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-features-and-ray-tracing-options-detailed-out-tomorrow/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation Blog</u></a>, developer Nixxes Software shared all the fancy PC features available in the port, which has been developed to “finetune performance and fidelity across a broad range of hardware configurations."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Accompanying a new trailer, below, Spider-Man 2 on PC <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-you-wont-have-to-link-a-psn-account-to-play-some-of-its-pc-games-anymore"><u>drops the hard PSN requirement</u></a> for PC players and adds advanced raytracing features such as DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“In Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 on PC with ray reconstruction enabled, we see more detailed ray-traced reflections and better-defined ray-traced shadows, especially when viewing raytracing effects at steep angles," said Nixxes graphics programmer Menno Bil. "We also see improvements in the ray-traced interiors and less ghosting and noise in the ray-traced ambient occlusion.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also available are DLSS 3 and FSR 3.1 Upscaling and Frame generation technologies, with Intel’s XeSS upscaler also available. DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation is not supported out of the box, but using the Nvidia app you may be able to swap out to the newer transformer model to enhance DLSS 3’s Frame Generation image quality. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those looking to play using wider monitors, ultrawide support is available up to a staggering 48:9 aspect ratio, with all cinematics viewable up to 32:9. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/30/spider-man-specs-1738238762975.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Spider-Man 2 PC specs. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The requirements themselves are split between ray-traced and non-ray-traced configurations, which reveals that if you aren’t bothered about fancy reflections you can run the title at 720p and 30 FPS using a very modest older system with low-end parts like an Nvidia GTX 1650 alongside an Intel Core i3 8100 and 16 GB of RAM.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For gamers running higher-end rigs, you’ll also be able to make full use of your hardware, with the 4K 60 FPS configuration at “Ray Tracing Ultimate” requiring an RTX 4090, AMD Ryzen 7800X3D, and 32 GB of RAM.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But can Spider-Man 2 run on Steam Deck? Given the high RAM requirements and need for a relatively modern graphics card, it might be possible, but don’t hold your breath for Steam Deck verification. Spider-Man and Spider-Man: Miles Morales both had PS4 ports, which meant that the titles were a touch more scalable, whereas the previously PS5-exclusive Spider-Man 2 may demand more out of the hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, the wide number of configurations on the requirements have been praised online. One user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1id7g4t/comment/m9wy1fz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commented</u></a> on Reddit: “This must be the best hardware requirements sheet I’ve seen so far." "Honestly, great job," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1id7g4t/comment/m9xjlc8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ItsMeIcebear4 added</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Developer BetaDwarf has announced its newest game, Vaultbreakers. Previously known under the codename "Project F4E," Vaultbreakers is described by its developer as a "hardcore top-down PvPvE ARPG," and select players will be able to access a closed playtest at the end of the week.</p><p dir="ltr">"The game is set in an evolving world that challenges players to think tactically, adapt dynamically, and battle fiercely," game director and BetaDwarf CEO Steffen Kabbelgaard said in a press release announcing the game. "With unpredictable events triggered by Changelings or other players, and with a focus on player skill and knowledge, I believe we are offering a fresh new multiplayer ARPG experience."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OgdcqiVQgA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2OgdcqiVQgA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">BetaDwarf also shared a reveal trailer, which shows Vaultbreakers' gameplay along with a cinematic animation. In it, two players are shown battling a pair of enemies. One player falls, while the other escapes through a portal, which serves as the game's extraction point.</p><p dir="ltr">"Many of us in the team love the extraction game's mechanics, but all of them are currently shooters," lead game designer Nikolaj Wendt said of the choice to blend extraction with a top-down ARPG. "Unfortunately, we are also very bad at shooters, but there wasn’t any alternative on the market, so we decided to make our own!”</p><p dir="ltr">A closed Vaultbreakers playtest encompassing the first and second chapters of the game's narrative campaign will begin on January 31. Players who want to get their hands on the current build can request access via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/306910/" rel="nofollow ">Steam</a> or the <a href="http://vaultbreakers.com/" rel="nofollow ">official Vaultbreakers website</a>. Access keys will also be available through Twitch Drops from select content creators, and according to BetaDwarf, playtest participants will also earn Legacy Points, an in-game currency players can use to unlock rewards that will carry over to the game's final build when it officially launches.</p><p>Vaultbreakers' official release date has not yet been announced, but it's currently available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/306910/Project_F4E/" rel="nofollow ">wishlist on Steam</a>.</p>

		<p>Sony’s plan to launch twelve ‘Games As Services’ titles has been a complete disaster by any standards, fuelled by mismanagement and poor business decisions to the point that almost all of the titles have been cancelled.&nbsp; Naughty Dog spent years making The Last of Us 2 multiplayer before <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/15/the-last-of-us-online-has-been-cancelled/">someone pointed out that they’d needed a full time team</a> to work on ongoing content, staff that Naughty Dog simple did not have. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/sony-permanently-shuts-down-concord-and-developer-firewalk-studios/">Concord’s demise has been widely covered</a>, the game was good but launching a colourful team shooter and not making it free-to-play meant it was dead on arrival.</p>
<p>Most recently, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/report-sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-at-bluepoint-bend-studio/">live service games at Bluepoint and Bend Studio</a> have been cancelled, both had been in development for at least four years. This leaves just&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/haven-studios-fairgame-playstation-exlcusive/">Fairgame$ from Jade Raymond’s studio Haven</a>, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/09/a-horizon-mmorpg-is-reportedly-in-development-by-ncsoft/">Horizon MMORPG</a>, and an unknown live service game from Jason Blundell.</p>
<p>All of this has cost Sony hundreds of millions of dollars, and they’ve had very little success with this strategy.&nbsp;Some of this could have easily been predicted, as launching a game that is competing with the likes of Overwatch was always going to be a massive battle. To do that, you need to generate huge interest in your game and market the socks off it, something Sony failed to do with Concord. Spending millions on a game that looks and feels like ten other free-to-play titles is never going to work – players need a unique hook such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2’s</a> award-winning take on Starship Troopers, or the surefire success of a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>. Those are Sony’s only live service successes so far.</p>


<p>If only Sony had something in its back catalogue, a well-known franchise that has sold millions of copies in the last couple of generations, already has a track record with multiplayer, and runs on an engine that means a PC version could be made. Oh wait, they do: it’s Killzone.</p>


<p>The Killzone franchise began back in the days of the PlayStation 2 with Sony looking for a shooter to rival Microsoft’s massive hit, Halo. It did not quite reach those heights but a sequel was soon green-lit and developer Guerrilla Games was purchased by Sony.&nbsp; Killzone 2 was released in 2009 and is widely agreed to be the best of the franchise with a Metacritic score of 91, with Killzone 3 following on in 2011. The next game, Killzone: Shadow Fall was a showcase launch title for Sony’s next-gen console, the PS4, while Killzone: Mercenary was a boundary-pushing title on the PS Vita.</p>
<p>The franchise has sold well over six million copies which these days doesn’t sound that good, Shadow Fall certainly fell short of sales expectations, but the fan base still exists and calls for a new game are heard regularly. Guerrilla Games has moved on to the Horizon franchise, which has now sold over 32 million copies and no one can blame them for wanting to do something different, but Killzone is still recent enough that it could be revived.</p>
<p>One of the best things about these games were their multiplayer modes, built around complimentary classes, large 32-player battles in Killzone 2, and shifting game objectives in the main Warzone mode. From Killzone 2 through to Shadow Fall, there’s more than enough maps, modes and ideas to draw upon that would stand out against the main multiplayer games of the last few years. Even just having a grounded, militaristic sci-fi style would contrast to the over-the-top cosmetics of Call of Duty.</p>

<p>Now, I am not a game developer and will make this sound much easier than it actually is, but ripping out the multiplayer from Killzone: Shadow Fall and using this as the foundation for a new game would be much more cost-effective than creating a brand new game from scratch. It’s still one of the best-looking games on PS4, and with eleven years of updates to the Decima engine, on which it runs, there should be some straightforward technical improvements to make beyond that.</p>
<p>Warming up the Shadow Fall servers probably wouldn’t be flashy or new enough, and it could be desirable to roll back to having more classes and roles, as in Killzone 2 and 3. Even starting from scratch, Killzone could easily provide the basis for a new game in the free-to-play market, and it’s far more obvious to greenlight a shooter than to keep trying to bring back Twisted Metal or God of War multiplayer, as Bend and Bluepoint were rumoured to be doing.</p>
<p>There’s even easy wins when looking for ongoing content. There are plenty of maps from older Killzone games that could be rebuilt, and a seasonal story could be wrapped around it, maybe retelling the franchise’s main narrative as maps are added. For cosmetics, Sony could raid their back catalogue with skins. There’s the recent Killzone cosmetics for Helldivers 2, so it’s only fair that they repay the favour, and stylised Resistance: Fall of Man cosmetics would go down a treat without breaking the sci-fi military tone too much. Halo Infinite has had some pretty out-there cosmetics, like the samurai armour and other alternate universe designs, but always manages to keep the sci-fi tone running throughout.</p>
<p>The main question would be who could take this project on? Guerrilla themselves have no real interest in returning to Killzone – they’re busy making a Horizon multiplayer game, anyway – but there’s obviously idle hands at Bend Studios and Bluepoint. Maybe they don’t have the specific expertise for a first person shooter, but Bluepoint has excelled in the past at remaking games, and with some guidance from Guerrilla to get the right feel, or Bungie who are pretty great at shooters themselves, this could be a good fit.</p>
<p>Sadly the obvious path is rarely the one Sony follows lately, but perhaps after being burned to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars a cheaper, almost ready made F2P title could be just what they need.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-sold-1-3-million-units-in-its-first-year.1095783/</guid>

<p>An Associate Marketing Director at Ubisoft has claimed that Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown sold 1.3 million units in its first year.</p>



<p>First spotted by X user <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Timur222</a>, the Associate Marketing Director’s LinkedIn profile says that the game sold 1.3 million units in its first year, a number not too surprising as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming reported in October 2024</a> that the game had sold approximately 1 million units in its first 9 months. The game<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-ubisoft-from-low-morale-to-internal-tensions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> sold 300,000 copies</a> in its first month.</p>



<p>As reported then, the game failed to meet Ubisoft’s internal expectations, and a Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown sequel was not greenlit. Its team would move over to other Ubisoft projects, including Beyond Good and Evil 2, Project Over (a next mainline Ghost Recon game), and Project Steambot, and a Rayman Remake in development at Ubisoft Milan.</p>



<p>The game received generally favourable reviews on launch across all versions of the game on review aggregator Metacritic and while the game failed to miss internal expectations is unknown, it’s likely attributed to Ubisoft’s recent public perception, which has dwindled in recent years due to poor decisions and a lack of understanding the current gaming landscape. </p>



<p>As for other Prince of Persia projects, the Sands of Time Remake continues development after being rebooted and is slated for 2026. Ubisoft has opted to completely remove everything we know about the remake, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recasting the original actor Yuri Lowenthal</a>.</p>

Dragon Age and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> veteran Trick Weekes is among a group of BioWare veterans who have announced they are now looking for work, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-confirms-many-staff-moved-elsewhere-in-ea-as-core-team-focuses-on-mass-effect-5-in-downsized-studio">following the news that BioWare is downsizing</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Posting on social media, Weekes <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trickweekes.bsky.social/post/3lgw2zbjhfc2v">said</a> they were now seeking a fresh writing position after two decades at BioWare, culminating in work on last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, BioWare publicly confirmed what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-isnt-ready-to-suddenly-have-a-team-of-250-300-people-working-on-it-now-dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-done">former studio veteran Mark Darrah had previously noted</a> - that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a> was still early in development and that the studio had therefore shifted a large number of its staff onto other projects within publisher EA while a small "core team" continued to build the project up. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams">IGN</a> later reported that a smaller group of BioWare employees had been told their roles had been terminated, and been given time to apply for new positions within EA.
</p>
<p>
This was reflected in half a dozen posts on social media from staff impacted by the redundancies, who had held senior positions on Dragon Age: The Veilguard.
</p>
<p>
"I'm now looking for a new writing/narrative position," Weekes wrote. "It's been a privilege to work with so many amazing devs over my 20 years at BioWare, and I will cherish the memories of the wonderful folks in the community I've met along the way. Thank you all."
</p><p>
Weekes served as a writer on Mass Effect 1 and 2, before being promoted to a senior writer on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a>. Weekes contributed to that game's brilliant genophage story arc, and also wrote for many of the series' best DLCs, including Lair of the Shadow Broker, Leviathan and Citadel.
</p>
<p>
More recently, Weekes served as a writer on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, and then as a lead writer on Dragon Age: The Veilguard.
</p>
<p>
Other BioWare staff who have publicly said they are looking for work include editor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/karinww.bsky.social/post/3lgw2z5u3js2z">Karin West-Weekes</a> and narrative designer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ryancorm.bsky.social/post/3lgw7ga2li22x">Ryan Cormier</a>, as well as producer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jencheverie.bsky.social/post/3lgw5mb2srs27">Jen Cheverie</a> and systems designer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kaieta.bsky.social/post/3lgvksfm67k2v">Michelle Flamm</a>. 
</p>
<p>
According to a social media <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:tflvwodepuhh3xoi43fvvjua/post/3lgw5bffuqc26">post</a> by former BioWare writer Ann Lemay, who worked at the studio between 2011 and 2016, the studio now no longer employs any writers or editors from that period, following this week's cuts and a number of previous departures.
</p>
<p>
For better or worse, then, it looks like Mass Effect 5 will be written by a completely separate team of people from those who worked on Dragon Age: The Veilguard.
</p>
<p>
BioWare's next big project is being helmed by Mass Effect veteran Mike Gamble, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-developer-bioware-highlights-crack-team-of-trilogy-veterans">alongside a team of returning staff who worked on the original Mass Effect trilogy</a> such as Preston Watamaniuk, Derek Watts and Parrish Ley.
</p>
<p>
This group is now set to continue BioWare's early work on Mass Effect 5, which - despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-title-plus-answers-to-trilogy-ending-questions">numerous teases of what's in store</a> - is still several years away.

            <p>
The layoff train has come for BioWare. A number of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-top-tips-beginners">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> staff are leaving the celebrated RPG company in the course of plans to become "a more agile, focused studio", as BioWare move ahead with the next <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> game. Posting on Bluesky, senior systems designer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kaieta.bsky.social/post/3lgvksfm67k2v">Michelle Flamm</a>, producer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jencheverie.bsky.social/post/3lgw5mb2srs27">Jen Cheverie</a>, editor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/karinww.bsky.social/post/3lgw2z5u3js2z">Karin West-Weekes</a>, lead writer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trickweekes.bsky.social/post/3lgw2zbjhfc2v">Trick Weekes</a> and narrative designer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ryancorm.bsky.social/post/3lgw7ga2li22x">Ryan Cormier</a> have all announced that they're looking for work.
</p>
<p>
All of which feels like it warrants a mention in general manager George McKay's recent blog about BioWare's future, but he comments only that they're "taking the opportunity to reimagine" how BioWare operate between projects, and "have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit." Which is a very slippery way to say that you're making a load of people redundant. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"Today, we are turning towards the future and preparing for the next chapter in BioWare's story," reads the full post from McKay, which was <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/01/29/bioware-studio-update/">published yesterday</a>. "As we announced in August 2023, we are changing how we build games to meet the needs of our upcoming projects and hold ourselves to the highest quality standards."
</p>
<p>For context, the August 2023 announcement was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-lays-off-around-50-employees-as-work-on-mass-effect-and-dragon-age-dreadwolf-continues">this one</a>, in which McKay revealed that BioWare would chop 50 roles in the course of "reorganizing our team to match the studio’s changing needs."</p>
<p>
BioWare are now doing some more reorganising, after ending production of a massive RPG. According to McKay, a "core team" led by Mass Effect trilogy veterans, including Mike Gamble, Preston Watamaniuk, Derek Watts and Parrish Ley, are currently working on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>, or whatever they end up calling it. Other people have been transferred to other EA projects, with the quiet part being that they face redundancy if suitable roles are not to be found.
</p><p>
"In keeping with our fierce commitment to innovating during the development and delivery of Mass Effect, we have challenged ourselves to think deeply about delivering the best experience to our fans," McKay continues in this week's blog post. "We are taking this opportunity between full development cycles to reimagine how we work at BioWare.
</p>
<p>
"Given this stage of development, we don't require support from the full studio," he continues. "We have incredible talent here at BioWare, and so we have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit."
</p>
<p>
Our fellow Zifflings at Ian Games have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams">asked</a> BioWare and EA how many people have been laid off or retained in the course of the above "reimagining". According to a spokesperson, "while we're not sharing numbers, the studio has the right number of people in the right roles to work on Mass Effect at this stage of development." Which, again, is a very slippery way to say that a bunch of people are now unemployed.
</p>
<p>
Some more context for these decisions. Firstly, Dragon Age: The Veilguard hasn't sold enough for EA. The RPG "engaged approximately 1.5 million players" in the publisher's <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx">last reported financial quarter</a>, which was "down nearly 50% from the company's expectations". The game's most recent update was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-dragon-age-the-veilguard-just-received-its-final-major-update">worded in such a way as to suggest there wouldn't be any more</a>. Game director Corinne Busche left BioWare earlier this month, though she has said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-game-director-leaving-bioware">this departure was voluntary</a>.
</p><p>
Secondly, the fourth main <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> game appears to have been quite a complicated production, even by blockbuster RPG standards. It began life in 2015 as a smaller, narrative-focussed project called "Joplin". Then EA and BioWare tried to turn it into a live service game, based on the code for ill-fated mechsuit bonanza Anthem. When Anthem flopped, they dumped the new Dragon Age project's multiplayer elements. That's around 10 years of decisions and indecisions, with key staff leaving in the interval - Joplin's original team lead Mike Laidlaw is now founder and director of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eternal-strands">Eternal Strands</a> developers Yellow Brick Games.
</p>
<p>
You can understand why EA and BioWare might want to avoid such a situation again. And while it may not be defensible - EA earned billions of dollars last year, and appear to be profitable - it's sadly not unusual for studios to scale back once they've shipped a big game, even when it has sold relatively well. I don't particularly doubt McKay's assertion that sincere efforts have been made to place people elsewhere. Still, if you're going to let a bunch of people go, you could at least do them the courtesy of saying that out loud.

Path of Exile 1's last league release was Settlers of Kalguur in July 2024. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://youtu.be/wF4rqnPoo80?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video message</a>, Path of Exile 2 game director and GGG co-founder Jonathan Rogers explained that the studio brought the Path of Exile 1 team across to help get Path of Exile 2’s endgame into shape ahead of the December launch, but thought that they would be able to return to get 3.26 ready for its mid-February launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It turned out that was impossible, given the myriad problems Path of Exile 2 has. “We were fooling ourselves,” Rogers admitted. Not only was Path of Exile 2 itself delayed a few weeks, but it suffered from crashes and balance problems that needed to be addressed immediately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“How could I justify taking some of the most experienced developers we have off PoE2 when it’s on fire?” Rogers said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is the Path of Exile 1 team is still working on Path of Exile 2, and will continue until Path of Exile 2 0.2.0 has shipped and probably a couple of weeks after that. “Unfortunately, I just can’t promise a date right now,” Rogers added. Path of Exile 2 is currently at 0.1.1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m really sorry for how this went down,” he continued. “Honestly, I should have predicted the fact that taking the Path of Exile 1 team off Path of Exile 1 would lead to this outcome, and I probably should have resisted doing it. But at every stage I just kept thinking, we still have time, we still have time. And then we didn’t have time any more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We still have a lot to learn about how to run two games simultaneously. We were overconfident. We still need to work out how to structure our studio to make this possible. But we do have a solid plan for what we want to do with 3.26.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The long wait for the Path of Exile 2 early access launch finally came to an end when it released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on December 6, 2024.

            <p>
The Japanese Nintendo eShop and My Nintendo Store will stop accepting card payments and Paypal from foreign accounts next month.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo made the announcement today, and said the decision had been taken "in order to prevent fraudulent use". 
</p>
<p>
As of 25th March, overseas customers who wish to continue using the Japanese eShop or My Nintendo Store will need to use an alternative payment method.

<p>
"Thank you very much for your continued patronage of our products," Nintendo wrote in a <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2025/0130.html">statement</a> on its customer support website.
</p>
<p>
"For customers who have previously used overseas-issued credit cards or PayPal accounts opened overseas, we ask that you please use other payment methods, such as credit cards issued in Japan, from now on."
</p>
<p>
The removal of foreign cards and Paypal payments makes for a significant barrier for anyone wishing to make purchases from the Japanese eShop - for instance to buy a game not released elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo may be looking to cut down on the number of people with multiple accounts on their console, with the ability to then browse different country's eShops and compare prices, ahead of the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
An easier option than obtaining a Japanese credit card remains the ability to purchase pre-paid Nintendo eShop vouchers - although these will need to also be for use in Japan.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-loses-trademark-fight-against-super-mario-supermarket">Nintendo had failed to stop a supermarket named Super Mario</a> from officially registering its name.

						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>In just a few hours, NVIDIA will officially launch its next flagship graphics card, the GeForce RTX 5090 Founder's Edition. There might well be shortages or price hikes, but that's another matter entirely. Hardcore PC gamers have been waiting for more than usual (the GeForce RTX 4090 launched in October 2022) to get a new GPU, and they're eager for it despite the high price (the graphics card's official MSRP is $1,999), as shown by the queues that have already started forming outside some stores. Should you be paying that much, though, even if you can afford it? In this article, I'll tackle that question after testing the graphics card strictly from a gamer's point of view.</p>
<p>First of all, some pictures of the hardware component and the package it came in. The GeForce RTX 5090's design is certainly very sleek, and I appreciate that it takes up two slots rather than three.</p>

<p>If you're a regular Wccftech reader, you're probably well-informed on all the specs and features of the GeForce RTX 5090 through <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5090-suprim-soc-32-gb-gpu-review-enter-the-realm-of-ai-charged-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our hardware coverage</a>. Still, a quick recap is in order. This is a monster GPU with 21760 CUDA Cores, 32 GB GDDR7 VRAM, 512-bit memory interface, 3352 AI TOPS for Tensor Cores operations, and 318 TFLOPS for Ray Tracing operations. With all that, it's no wonder it requires 1000W of system power, drawing up to 575W for itself.</p>
<p>On the productivity side, the RTX 50 Series includes hardware support for encoding and decoding the 4:2:2 pro-grade color format, as well as 9th Gen NVENC video encoders and a 6th Gen NVIDIA decoder. NVIDIA also added support for the latest DisplayPort 2.1b UHBR20 specification, which can go up to 8K@165Hz with Display Stream Compression (DSC).</p>

<p>The GPU is the pinnacle of the brand-new Blackwell architecture, which NVIDIA says is optimized for neural rendering. Doubling down on AI, NVIDIA has created the so-called RTX Neural Shaders (part of the larger <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-kit-shows-how-neural-rendering-will-power-the-next-visual-leap-in-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Kit suite</a>), small neural networks that can be embedded into programmable shaders. An RTX Neural Shaders SDK lets developers train their game data and shader code on an RTX AI PC and accelerate their neural representations and model weights at run-time with NVIDIA Tensor Cores.</p>
<p>So far, NVIDIA has identified three key applications: RTX Neural Texture Compression, RTX Neural Materials, and RTX Neural Radiance Cache. However, all those will require support from the graphics APIs; Microsoft has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-directx-neural-rendering-ai-focused-graphics-nvidia-rtx-50-tensor-core-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the Cooperative Vectors are coming soon to DirectX 12. The Khronos Group will undoubtedly come up with a similar solution for Vulkan. Afterward, though, it will be up to game developers to implement these features in their games. Long story short, it might be a while before we see RTX Neural Shaders applied to actual games, making it automatically not a focus of the GeForce RTX 5090 launch reviews.</p>
<p>The same goes for NVIDIA Reflex 2; the new Frame Warp technology promises to cut down PC latency by up to 75% (the original Reflex reduced latency by up to 50%), which sounds great, especially for Multi Frame Generation since it slightly increases latency. But Reflex 2 isn't available yet - and it won't be exclusive to RTX 50 graphics cards anyway.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/21-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>What is necessarily at the front and center of every conversation surrounding the new RTX 50 GPUs is, of course, NVIDIA DLSS 4. Now, there's two parts to that: on one hand, NVIDIA has released a new, more advanced upscaling model based on vision transformer technology. So far, DLSS has been based on traditional CNN (convolutional neural network) models. According to NVIDIA, though, these models simply aren't smart enough to make the best choices, which sometimes translates into visual artifacts or ghosting. The new DLSS 4 transformer models are trained on twice the amount of parameters and, according to NVIDIA, already provide better results than CNN models, not to mention they can be further improved over the coming years, whereas CNNs have pretty much reached their maximum capabilities.</p>
<p>The new Ray Reconstruction model already improves image quality, while the Super Resolution model is being released as a beta.</p>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>The new models are available to every GeForce RTX user. Similarly, the new Frame Generation model<span>, which&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-boss-doesnt-rule-out-possible-frame-generation-support-for-rtx-30-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaces the hardware Optical Flow accelerator</a> with a faster and more efficient AI-based model,</span>&nbsp;is available on both RTX 40 and 50 GPUs.</p>
<p>What's exclusive to Blackwell architecture graphic cards like the GeForce RTX 5090 is DLSS Multi Frame Generation. According to NVIDIA, there's a number of hardware advancements making generating multiple frames possible. The main one is the 5th Gen Tensor Cores, which reportedly offer up to 2.5X more AI processing performance. Moreover, the new graphics cards have been enhanced with hardware Flip Metering capabilities for optimal frame pacing. Previously, Frame Generation relied on traditional CPU-based pacing, which can introduce variability that affects smoothness. With the arrival of DLSS 4, NVIDIA has updated Frame Generation and Multi Frame Generation to use Flip Metering instead of CPU-based pacing, allowing the display engine for 40 and 50 Series GPUs to precisely control display timing.</p>
<p>With DLSS Multi Frame Generation, NVIDIA is promising absolutely massive performance gains of up to 8x in the heaviest games, like Alan Wake 2, Black Myth: Wukong, and Cyberpunk 2077.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-up-to-8x-faster-performance-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>However, those best-case scenario frame rate uplifts are measured with the DLSS Performance Mode; in this review, I've instead put the GeForce RTX 5090 through the grinder when using the highest quality DLSS setting available in any game, DLAA or, if that's not an option, Quality Mode.&nbsp; In all cases, I've enabled the maximum in-game settings without resorting to out-of-game tweaks or mods. 4K resolution has been selected in all instances.</p>
<p>The testing rig is:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D</li>
<li>MSI MAG B650 TOMAHAWK WIFI</li>
<li>32GB DDR5 6000 MHz</li>
<li>2TB NVMe SSD Western Digital Black SN850X</li>
</ul>
<p>Before starting, it's worth clarifying that all testing was conducted with the latest (not public yet) version of NVIDIA's FrameView software. There's a very good reason for that, as it is presently the only benchmarking software that accurately reports the MsBetweenDisplayChange metrics. With the aforementioned new Flip Metering, NVIDIA says that MsBetweenDisplayChange, rather than MsBetweenPresents, is the best metric to represent what the user actually sees. That's because it is reported near the end of the render pipeline after flip metering has occurred, whereas the measurement of MsBetweenPresents takes place earlier when flip metering hasn't yet paced the frames.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/86-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>As advised by NVIDIA, I exported FrameView data to be visualized with <a href="https://www.gpureport.cz/windows/FLAT/flat.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FLAT</a> (Frame Latency Analytics Tool), which was then used to create the frame time pie charts.</p>

						<section>
				<p>With the release of the GeForce RTX 5090 Founder's Edition, NVIDIA has once again proved why it's the leader in the desktop GPU segment. The new graphics card features potentially groundbreaking new future-facing technologies like RTX Neural Shaders, but even in the here and now, it delivers extremely high performance even when testing the most taxing PC games with the maximum settings. DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation is another great advancement that is sure to keep the upscaler well ahead of the increasing competition, though perhaps the most impactful improvement is the hardware flip metering that greatly improves frame pacing and, therefore, smoothness. 

Once again, the only real downside is the pricing, which has received a sizable bump over the Ada generation, when the RTX 4090 cost $1,599. If money is no object, though, this is the GPU to get to realize all your 4K@200+Hz path traced gamer's dreams.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>The GeForce RTX 5090 delivers excellent performance in all tested PC games, even without DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation
</li><li>The hardware Flip Metering is a game-changer for how much it improves smoothness
</li><li>The RTX Neural Shaders ensure the graphics card will remain relevant for years to come</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>The pricing is unfortunately quite a bit higher than last generation</li>						</ul>

            <p>
A TV series based on Quantic Dream's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/beyond-two-souls">Beyond: Two Souls</a> is in development, with Elliot Page's production company attached.
</p>
<p>
Despite the swathe of film and TV projects based on video games in the works right now, this one is something of a surprise. 
</p>
<p>
First released for PlayStation 3 way back in 2013, Beyond: Two Souls is another stylish but somewhat nonsensical narrative adventure by the maker of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/heavy-rain">Heavy Rain</a> and, later, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a>.

<p>
Page starred in the game as Jodie, a girl with special powers and a mysterious connection to a ghostly presence, alongside Willem Dafoe, who plays a creepy government researcher/father figure.
</p>
<p>
Behind the scenes, Page's time working on the project was notable for the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ellen-page-explored-legal-action-154256357.html">legal action lodged in response to Beyond: Two Souls' gratuitous shower scene</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Upon the game's launch, it was discovered that Quantic Dream had made a detailed nude model of Jodie's character for use in this scene (to the apparent surprise of Page, as the scene itself does not show any actual nudity). 
</p>
<p>
The model was quickly found  within the game's files and then spread online, prompting Page to explore the possibility of a lawsuit. Sony, the game's publisher, later sent takedown notices to websites hosting images of the character model.
</p>
<p>
"Filming the game was one of the most challenging and fulfilling acting experiences of my career," Page said in a fresh statement to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/beyond-two-souls-video-game-television-series-elliot-page-pageboy-1236267129/">Deadline</a>, which was first to report news of the game's TV adaptation. 
</p>
<p>
"The story's rich narrative and emotional depth offer us a fantastic foundation. We want to create a unique vision of the characters and their journeys that resonates with fans and newcomers."
</p>
<p>
Beyond: Two Souls writer and director David Cage said he was "absolutely thrilled to collaborate again" with Page. "I know that Elliot has all the talent and instinct to make it something really unique on TV," he added.
</p>
<p>
"Beyond has epic scope, preposterous premise and high-octane action," former editor Oli Welsh wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-two-souls-review">Eurogamer's Beyond: Two Souls review</a>. "But perhaps what David Cage and his dream need are limitations - limitations that Sony's blank cheque has singularly failed to impose on this sprawling, over-reaching game."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/30/space-marine-2-february-update-brings-the-datavault-tyranid-biovore/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The next big <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> update has been previewed ahead of its February release, with Patch 6.0 set to introduce a new PvP map, Datavault, Tyranid Biovore and more.</p>
<p>There’s also the dangled thread that support for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> could continue after the end of the current roadmap. As we head into Season 3 of content for Winter 2025, there’s just Season 4 and Spring 2025 left to come, but the team writes, “Worry not, even if this roadmap ends in 2025, that doesn’t mean the game will not receive new content after that!”</p>


<p>But back to the (almost) here and now, the 6.0 update has got a fresh batch of new content for players to take on:</p>
<ul>
<li>New PvP Map – Tomb</li>
<li>New PvE Enemy – Tyranid Biovore</li>
<li>New Battle Barge Feature – Datavault</li>
<li>Aboslute Difficulty</li>
<li>Perks Rework</li>
<li>FoV Slider for PC</li>
<li>Season Pass Cosmetics – Salamander Champion</li>
<li>Season Pass Cosmetics – Raven Guard Pack</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s dig in a little deeper.</p>


<p>The new PvP map, Tomb, takes place under the surface of Demerium, digging into the creepy environs of a Necron tomb. It’s a map that is closed off with narrow passages, so there’s plenty of blind spots to be aware of, though there is also a more open arena for a change of combat range.</p>
<p>In PvE, the Tyranid Biovore can now appear in all Operations featuring the Tyranids. This is an Extremis enemy that shoots out Spore Mines that you need to dodge and destroy before they impact, but it can also be deadly at close range.</p>

<p>The Datavault on the Battle Barge is a new area to give unlockable information on different parts of the game and cosmetic rewards. You’ll nead to earn special currency from completing the in-game Ordeals achievements across all modes. These could be thinks like making a Carnifex stun itself, knocking back Spore Mines to kill Tyranids, or completing missions in Operations at specific threat levels.</p>
<p>Through the rest of the update, there will be a perks rework, though Saber didn’t go into details here, an FOV slider on PC – useful for ultra-wide monitors – an Absolute difficulty level, and the following smaller improvements and additions:</p>
<ul>
<li>New finisher animations on Zoanthropes, Scarab Occult Terminators and Rubric Marines.</li>
<li>A new functionality will be added, allowing you to upgrade your Master-Crafted and Artificer Armoury Data to Relic by trading them. You can also sell your Armoury Data to get Requisition Points.</li>
<li>Absolute Difficulty (unlocked after completing 1 Operation in Lethal Difficulty) will unlock a bloodstained Knife Combat and a new pauldron.</li>
<li>Base Decals available for Right Pauldrons</li>
<li>A new option to share your skin between PvE and PvP modes will be added. This option also allows you to share your patterns between classes.</li>
<li>PvP Crossplay Toggle On/Off: allows console players to play with PC players. You now have the option to be matched with either PC players or Console players independently.</li>
<li>New Emotes – Strengthen the bond with your fellow Brothers with the new emotes! So go ahead and use them without moderation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rounding things out for Season Pass holders, the Salamanders Champion will be available for the Sniper class, and the Ravens Guard cosmetic pack will bring the classic MK VI ‘Corvus’ helmet design, a fan-favourite beaky look that dates back to the earliest versions of Warhammer 40,000.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI and Grand Theft Auto Online will be sold separately at launch, with a potential upgrade for the full game available for those who only purchase the online component of the next entry in the Rockstar series, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1000113-gta-vi-speculation-discussion-part-%E2%88%9E-the-leonida-drought/page/73/#findComment-1072491760" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTA Forums</a>, known Rockstar leaker Tez2 said that the release of the sixth main entry in the series will coincide with the first time the full package and the online component will be sold separately at launch. According to the leaker, Rockstar Games will have to factor the price of the online component into the total cost of the game, but could benefit from pricing the online standalone lower to provide access to players who cannot afford the full price, who could, eventually, upgrade to the full game including the main story campaign. At the same time, if the online component is priced low, it could help Rockstar Games keep the price of the full experience low, which is something many in the industry wouldn't want to see, as there are expectations that a potential $80 price tag for Grand Theft Auto VI could <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-growth-engine-pricing/">normalize video game pricing</a>, which hasn't increased much in the past few years despite rising costs.</p>
<p>The rumors of Grand Theft Auto Online possibly being sold separately from the full Grand Theft Auto VI package isn't the only news related to the highly-anticipated game that's come in the past few hours.&nbsp;<span>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/gta-6-will-run-at-30fps-on-console-former-gta-5-and-red-dead-redemption-2-animator-expects-and-your-best-shot-at-60fps-may-be-hoping-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesRadar</a>, former Rockstar Games animator, Mike York commented on what console players should expect in terms of performance, saying that the developer is likely going to go for a steady 30 FPS, optimizing the game as much as possible to make sure it will never dip below the target.</span> On PlayStation 5 Pro, using the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, the game could hit 60 FPS, according to the former Rockstar developer, but 60 FPS shouldn't be expected on base hardware at launch. From their experience, the former animator is sure Rockstar is going to squeeze as much performance from consoles as possible to make the game run at 30 FPS, and then later optimize for 60 FPS, as the higher framerate is not as important as making the game amazing at 30.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later this year. A precise release date has yet to be confirmed.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Looks like they finally got the message. "An account for PlayStation Network will become optional for these titles on PC," said PlayStation in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/">a short and quiet blog post</a> that includes the upcoming PC release for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-spider-man-2">Spider-Man 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last Of Us Part II</a>. It's been eight months since PlayStation provoked mass annoyance among PC players by making a PSN account mandatory to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, and later <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>. They soon walked back the decision for Helldivers 2 after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-has-received-100000-negative-reviews-since-announcing-players-must-link-steam-to-a-psn-account">a rough review-bombing</a> but the company didn't seem to fully take the hint. It looks like they've now conceded that, yes, the obligatory sign-up was an unpopular move.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The post itself is brief and plain, and spins the decision as a way for PlayStation to offer "in-game content incentives" to any PC player who decides to sign in not as a requirement but as an option. "Players who still opt to sign into a PlayStation Network account will also enjoy added benefits like trophies and friend management," they say, before showing a table of the extra goodies account linkers will get for each game.</p>
<p>This is similar to what the company did for open world sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Zero Dawn: Forbidden West</a>, which offered players a bonus outfit and spear for protagonist Aloy if they linked their Steam and PSN accounts. It looks like that may be the approach from now on. Although PlayStation don't explicitly say so outright. They only say that all the games which so far required the account are having that requirement dropped. I guess we'll see when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> comes out. </p>
<p>The whole saga has been quite stupid. PlayStation <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">dropped the requirement for Helldivers 2</a> after players (and the game's developers) got supremely annoyed with the decision, but the hullaballoo resulted in a community manager <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disgruntled-helldivers-2-fans-start-petition-to-bring-back-fired-community-manager">losing his job</a>. Following that, the account requirement was instituted on the above mentioned games, which many players pointed out were single player adventures, with no requirement to be online (aside from unspoken DRM reasons, that is). </p><p>The decision made the games unavailable to PC players in over 100 countries where it is currently not possible to sign up for Sony's service (not to mention slightly annoying anyone else who doesn't even own a PlayStation console). Most recently, they said the account <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-will-require-a-psn-account-to-play-on-pc-making-it-unplayable-in-over-100-countries">would be required on the upcoming PC release of Last Of Us Part II</a>, due out in April. But now that too won't need a PSN account. Instead, if you sign on optionally, you'll get an in-game jacket inspired by Naughty Dog's new upcoming sci-fi adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. </p>
<p>God, let this be the end of it. It was a stupid decision, irritated a ton of players, and probably only benefited some number crunchers in a department buried deep in Sony's corporate bowels. Now that it's just an option, we can all get back to deciding if the games are actually good or not.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Marvel's Spider-Man 2 PC system requirements have been confirmed ahead of today's launch, detailing what system configuration the user will need to achieve certain resolution and performance targets.</p>
<p>Unlike some other recent games, the PC version of the second entry in the series developed by Insomniac Games will not require a ray tracing capable GPU to run even at the lowest resolution and frame rate, as old GPUs like the NVIDIA GTX 1650 or AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT will be able to run the game at 720p, 30 frames per second with the very low graphics preset. To enjoy the game at its very best at 4K resolution, 60 frames per second, and Ultimate Ray Tracing, however, an RTX 4090 will be required. The full requirements for other resolutions and frame rate targets can be found below.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft is celebrating having the best-selling game on both Xbox and PlayStation platforms over the last quarter, thanks to its new ownership of the Call of Duty franchise.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> launched last October and has been a success for Microsoft, which namechecked the title during its latest financial results.
</p>
<p>
"Black Ops 6... saw more players in its launch quarter than any other paid release in franchise history," Microsoft boss Satya Nadella boasted during a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q2">call</a> with investors.

<p>
"We also continue to see strong momentum for Xbox Cloud Gaming, with a record 140m hours streamed this quarter," he continued.
</p>
<p>
Nadella also called out the brilliant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, and gave our first indication of how well MachineGames' globe-trotting adventure is doing.
</p>
<p>
"We saw rave reviews of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which has already been played by more than four million people," Nadella said.
</p>
<p>
Both of these statistics will reflect players who bought either game outright, as well as those who have played via Game Pass on both PC and Xbox.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, of course, the PS5 launch of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is still to come - sometime in the first half of this year.
</p>
<p>
Revenue for Xbox's gaming and content division, which includes Game Pass, rose two percent over three months of 2024 thanks to a surge of subscribers on PC. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-hardware-sales-slump-but-game-pass-is-surging">Microsoft's wider gaming revenue was still down year-on-year overall, offset by the continued slump of Xbox hardware sales</a>.
