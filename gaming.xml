			<p>I love a good escape room, heading to an often rather innocuous door or shopfront in a less-than-prominent position in town, and then heading into a themed room that’s filled with themed puzzles and secrets to unpick. Since 2020, there’s been more than a few attempts to translate this experience to one you can enjoy at home, and between escape room envelopes, advent calendars, and online portals, it’s video games that manage to capture the tone best of all. Escape Simulator 2 is the latest, thoroughly enjoyable escape room puzzler.</p>
<p><iframe title="Escape Simulator 2 - Coming October 27th to Steam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rRqKQMewWy8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s an immediacy to Escape Simulator 2’s puzzle rooms, as you simply appear in a space and start running around, finding puzzles and clues, and putting the pieces together. There’s no preamble, no big cutscenes and drama, you’re just chucked into the three distinct settings and themes –&nbsp;Dracula’s Castle, the sci-fi themed Starship EOS and the piratical The Cursed Treasure. That said, there is a throughline to each setting’s collection of four puzzle rooms, the rooms connecting well from the end of one to the start of the next.</p>


<p>There’s a really pleasing interactivity to all the environments, letting you pick up so many incidental items, inspecting books and scraps of paper, dragging crates across the floor, spinning and sitting around in chairs, filling your inventory with all manner of tools, and the like. Anything you grab that’s important is generally quite obvious, with giant gems, special keys and statue pieces, but they are marked with an icon just to be clear. It is important to mess around in these spaces, though, as there’s a lot of visual clues tucked away in corners and on ceilings –&nbsp;not to mention puzzle pieces that are hidden everywhere for pictures back in the lobby.</p>


<p>Oh, and this can all be played in co-op, and I played through the whole game with my better half. So much of the escape room feel comes from playing them with friends and family, where you can all go off and work on your own puzzles, compare discoveries, ask for and offer help, and you have that exact same feel in Escape Simulator 2. Right down to not really having a clue what your teammates have found and done half the time! That said, Pine Studio say that you can play with up to 8 players online, and while that might be possible, I’d say that the included rooms are going to be best with 2-4 players. You can often all look at a puzzle together, with everyone’s cursors floating around together.</p>
<p>So far, so similar to the original game, but Escape Simulator 2 does push in a new visual direction. There’s more darkness, there’s more detailed environments and characters compared to the more cartoony original, and it generally looks good, but there are plenty of quirks and rougher edges to the game’s presentation in general.</p>

<p>There’s no clipping with other people that you’re playing with –&nbsp;quite necessary if there’s going to be eight running around –&nbsp;and that leads to plenty of looking through unintentionally bald heads, or being half through someone’s head. There’s some odd or missing animations both in first and third person. Things like climbing out of a cryo bed or shifting from a ladder, or a puzzle suddenly shifting you to a completely different perspective with no explanation, and a bunch of other examples. It just takes a few seconds to figure out what’s happened, but it takes you out of the moment as you go “wait, what just happened?” I also wish that, since you can share a view of a puzzle screen, you could also share the clues you’re trying to use –&nbsp;these you can pin on screen, which is rather handy.</p>
<p>Similarly, the hints system is a little odd sometimes. It has to cater to a lot of freeform puzzling, and on the few occasions that we used it, it did generally do well – it spawns a paper diagram so you can pass this and share it with others –&nbsp;but there were a couple points where it wasn’t offering us any hints. That was particularly annoying at the end of the Starship EOS series, with what’s likely the penultimate puzzle being a pure puzzle with no hints. We’ll have to go back and finish this another time.</p>

<p>So it’s a little bit ropey in some ways, but then, what escape room isn’t? This takes you to more fantastical locations than an in person escape room could possibly hope to, and there’s a bright future for this game with both DLC from Pine Studios and a second generation of the Room Editor – I’ve not experimented with this, but over 4,000 rooms were built in the first game, and the tools here are more extensive again.</p>

			<p>The current generation of Xbox and PlayStation consoles is now more than five years old, making it well past the time we would start hearing about what the next generation of consoles will look like. We've <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-magnus-bill-of-materials-may-push-its-price-well-beyond-1000/">seen several rumours</a> on what the next-generation Xbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">hardware will include</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">on top of comments</a> from <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-president-says-game-exclusives-are-antiquated/">Xbox president Sarah Bond</a>, a picture of Xbox's next console is starting to form. Now, a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-ambitious-new-xbox-your-entire-console-library-the-full-power-of-windows-pc-gaming-and-more">Windows Central</a> seems to piece it together a bit more clearly, framing the next Microsoft console as a best of both worlds between the PC and console experience.</p>



<p>The report leans both on comments from Microsoft executives like Sarah Bond and Phil Spencer and sources who spoke to Windows Central, so understand that nothing about this is finalized, but it does paint a picture that makes sense as to what the next console from Microsoft will look like.</p>



<p>Both Phil Spencer and Sarah Bond have alluded to the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X handhelds</a> as a peek at Microsoft's thinking for its next generation of hardware, with the Xbox Play Anywhere becoming more of the focus with all Xbox games being playable on the Xbox PC app and Xbox consoles moving forward.</p>



<p>According to Windows Central's report, what those allusions mean is that the next-generation Xbox console will provide a console experience with its UI and the ability to natively play console games, though its foundation will be that of "<em>a curated Windows gaming PC</em>."</p>



<p>Basically, you'll be able to access your Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG, and Battle.net games just like you're able to on a PC, with the Xbox Full-Screen Experience that's currently live on the ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Ally handhelds acting as the home base for the device. On top of all those libraries, you'll also be able to access and play all the games currently playable on your Xbox Series X/S consoles, including original Xbox titles, Xbox 360 games, and your full catalogue of backwards compatible titles already available on Series X/S.</p>



<p>Another part of what'll make this device a 'best of both worlds' between console and PC is that the paywall for playing online multiplayer games will be removed for the next generation. Since the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 days, console players have had to pay for the ability to play multiplayer games online, whereas that has never been the case for PC players. That paywall will finally be removed with Microsoft's next console, according to this report, to further align itself with the PC gaming experience this new device is allegedly trying to provide.</p>



<p>Of course, this will also come with more changes to the structure of Microsoft's Game Pass service, though those details aren't clear, and likely won't be until we're much closer to the actual release of next-generation hardware.</p>



<p>It's an interesting proposal, to say the least, that we'll finally see a combination of PC perks like having access to multiple gaming libraries and not having to pay for online multiplayer on top of the ease-of-use that consoles provide. If Microsoft can execute on it all, that is.</p>

New games arrive every month (recent additions include the spooky <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake and <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>’s remake), and you can continue to play them so long as you maintain a subscription. Not only that, the service enables online multiplayer, and gives you access to a large roster of games, from current-gen titles and dating back to the PS1-era.</p><p>While the original version of the PlayStation 5 has been succeeded by the slimmer, slightly more power-efficient revision, the hardware differences as it pertains to any performance-related advantages the newer model has over the launch edition are nil. You can still add on an affordable PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSD to boost the storage space, you can customize it with snap-on shells, and it can run any PS5 game out there.</p><div><p id="some-other-verge-approved-deals"><h2>Some other Verge-approved deals</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>The <strong>last-gen Google Pixel Watch 3 in the 45mm Wi-Fi configuration</strong> is $100 off at <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D91268TH/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, resulting in its lowest price yet.

Whether you’re upgrading from a previous version of the Pixel Watch, or jumping right in with Google’s ecosystem, you’re picking a good smartwatch that’s $150 cheaper than the superb <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/795383/google-pixel-watch-4-review-android-smartwatch-gemini-wearable">Pixel Watch 4</a>. <em>Verge </em>reviewer Victoria Song praised the brighter screens, better battery life, and the smaller bezels of the entire Pixel Watch 3 line. She also singled out the 45mm model because “it wears small,” and because its larger size means that its 35-percent bigger battery (compared to the 41mm edition) lets it last longer. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24239115/google-pixel-watch-3-review-smartwatch-wear-os-wearable">Read our review.</a></span></li><li><span>It’s not common for <strong>Nintendo’s Joy-Con controllers</strong> for the Switch to get any sort of meaningful discount, but you can get a set of neon pink and green ones at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fjoy-con-l-r-wireless-controllers-for-nintendo-switch-neon-pink-neon-green%2FJ7GSL57SJ7" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> for $64.99 (was $89.99).

These are built to be a ready-for-anything companion, with an IP68 rating that ensures that they’re waterproof, dustproof, and sweatproof. In terms of fit, these stand out compared to other similarly-priced options because of their rotatable and extendable ear hooks. Personally, I don’t trust earbuds to stay in my ears (my ear fin-equipped Pixel Buds Pro 2 struggle to stay put), but the hooks make them seem like a great, no-fuss option.

              <p>The right speaker can bring life to any party, and even make those weekend solo sessions way more enjoyable. But you don’t have to spend big to get quality, room-filling sound paired with a solid battery life. If you’re in the market for a good Bluetooth speaker that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5022/">The Anker Soundcore 2 portable Bluetooth speaker is now down to just $28 on Amazon, after a massive 38% discount.</a> This deal only applies to the Black color, but some other options are discounted as well. Just note that the discount is a limited-time one, so we recommend acting fast to grab it. The retailer might be pushing the price back up sooner than you think!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5022/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Richer Sound, Both Indoor and Outdoor</h2>
<p>The build is truly portable and comes with a basic, no-fuss design. You’ll find all the controls at the top, so getting the party started is fairly simple. You’re getting dual 6W neodymium drivers that blast rich sound that captures all the highs and lows well. The BassUp technology offers more depth at all volume levels. You can crank it all the way up or keep it low-key for a self-care night. Either way, you’ll get clear sound without distortion.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity offers a stable 66-foot range, which translates into clearer sound even when you’re not super close to the speaker. Prefer keeping things wired? There’s a built-in AUX port for plugging your devices. The battery life is just as solid; you’re looking at about 24 hours of playtime on a single charge. For reference, that’s going roughly 500 songs without worrying about plugging it in. Everyone’s favorite playlists get a chance!</p>



<p>The speaker is also rated for IPX7 waterproof, so it can handle a few splashes and light rain easily. You can take it to the beach, hang by the pool, or even bring it into the bathroom for a private shower concert. It also supports wireless stereo pairing, meaning you can pair two of these for bigger, wider sound if you’re planning to host larger gatherings.</p>
<p>All things considered, this is a great speaker for anyone looking to boost sound on a budget. It’s compact and easy to carry, plus it offers superior sound. Anker has made it outdoor-friendly, so it can handle dust and water quite well. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5022/">It’s down to just $28 right now, and definitely worth grabbing while the deal’s still live.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5022/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>A new report says a new Xbox Partner Preview is scheduled for November and will focus heavily on Xbox Play Anywhere games. </p>



<p>Xbox has been in the news recently due to fresh details about its next-gen consoles. The president has already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-president-confirms-series-x-s-successors-are-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the successors to the Series X/S consoles are in development, and a new report also says that games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-insomniacs-spider-man-will-be-playable-on-next-xbox-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War and Insomniac’s Spider-Man will be playable</a> on them.

<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A has sucked in trainers from across the world, and Season 2 of Ranked is now right around the corner with a fresh batch of rewards to claim.</p>



<p>The first Pokémon release on Nintendo Switch 2, albeit still available on the original console, Pokémon Legends: Z-A has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-first-week-sales-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached some impressive sales milestones</a>, and the four-player PvP offerings have sucked plenty in for the grind.</p>



<p>If you’re ready to dive back into Ranked in pursuit of the next batch of rewards in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>

<p><strong>Season 2 of Ranked in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A begins on November 4, immediately following the conclusion of Season 1 Ranked.</strong></p>



<p>It may seem like it has come around swiftly, with it only being a few weeks since the release of Legends: Z-A, but it appears, at least initially, that Ranked seasons in the title will transition rather quickly.</p>



<p>Based on the information we have from Season 1, each season in Ranked will last for around four weeks. However, this may be extended later in the game’s lifespan, depending on what else Game Freak have cooking.</p>







<p><strong>Although not officially announced, we expect Season 2 of Ranked in <strong>Pokémon</strong></strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A to begin at 6 AM UTC on November 4—the same time that Season 1 began.</strong></p>



<p>The table below shows a breakdown of when you can expect Season 2 of Ranked in Legends: Z-A to begin in your time zone.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Season 2 Ranked Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">11 PM – Nov. 3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">1 AM – Nov. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">2 AM – Nov. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">6 AM – Nov. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">4 PM – Nov. 4</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p><strong>The biggest reward available in Legends: Z-A’s Season 2 of Ranked is Delphoxite, which is required to unlock Mega Delphox in the game.</strong></p>



<p>Just like Greninjite in Season 1, Delphoxite is exclusively available in Ranked play during Season 2, meaning you’ll have to delve into online play against players around the world to unlock the reward.</p>



<p>It’s yet to be confirmed, but we expect the requirements to be the same as earning Greninjite in Season 1, meaning you’ll have to reach at least Rank K to obtain the item.</p>



<p>Other rewards include Rare Candies, EXP. Candies, and items will also be distributed as rewards for reaching the various levels of ranked, but full details will be shared upon release.</p>

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Evil Empire [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/evil-empire">Evil Empire</a> has released its first update for <em><a title="Games > Brotato [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/brotato">Brotato</a></em> since <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/brotato-post-launch-development-moved-to-evil-empire">taking over</a> the game’s post-launch development. Titled “New Dawn,” the update is available now for <a title="Platforms > PC [24,646 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>, with consoles and mobile versions to follow in approximately one month. <span id="more-1002814"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via Evil Empire:</p><blockquote><p>The “New Dawn” update is the first new content update for <em>Brotato</em> since late 2024 and focuses on extensive quality of life changes—including an all-new ban system. Though, in true Evil Empire fashion, players will also find new items and a new weapon in there, too.</p><ul><li><strong>New Items</strong> – Leading the update are six new items which include Fresh Meat, Fruit Basket, Candy Bag, Ghost Outfit, Will-o’-Wisp and Hourglass—all of which provide various benefits to players skillsets and strengths while they take on wave after wave of gross little aliens.</li><li><strong>New Weapon</strong> – Also joining the fray is a new weapon fans can wield if they so choose, the Vorpal Sword, which alternates between thrusting and sweeping attacks and grants players the ability to one-shot an enemy for the first time.</li><li><strong>Ban System</strong> – Additional extras in today’s update includes the Ban system, a much-requested community feature that will allow players to ban up to eight items during a run. Win a run in Danger 3 or more to unlock the Ban system. Note: the Ban system does not include weapons.</li><li><strong>New Saves</strong> – The New Dawn update also introduces three new save slots which gives players the option to copy progress onto another profile (or reset the save). Unlocking every item, character, weapon and Danger level on a save will deactivate the earning of achievements, so use with caution as you will still have to earn them the hard way.</li><li><strong>Codex</strong> – The Codex introduces a new wiki-esque feature to the game, with information about Items, Weapons and Enemies (for example: How many times you killed a specific alien, etc.). Evil Empire plans to continue to build this feature out based on player feedback.</li></ul></blockquote><p>A longer and fully detailed list of updates can be found <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1942280/eventcomments/600792156684433940/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>Next month's PlayStation Plus games for November 2025 are expected to be revealed on October 29, but it looks like one of them may have leaked early. <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-essential-on-connait-le-titre-phare-des-jeux-mensuels-de-novembre-2025-60690" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to Dealabs' billbil-kun</a>, PS Plus subscribers who missed out on grabbing Stray the last time it was available through the subscription service will have a new chance to do so from next week.</p><p>The Annapurna Interactive-published game was a day-one release for PS Plus Extra in July 2022, and it was removed from the PS Plus library one year later.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-m4-macbook-pro-is-being-pushed-onto-the-sales-rack-go-grab-one-now-2000639133</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-quietly-clears-out-the-m4-macbook-pro-with-hundreds-off-after-the-m5-launch.1335784/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s new-product drops are huge events, and understandably so. The debut of a new Apple device like the M5 laptop sends thousands and perhaps millions of people to stores to be the first to have it. But the more economical reaction is to start watching the price of the device it’s replacing: in this case, the M4 line of laptops. Sure enough, those prices are coming down — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5023/">Amazon is now selling the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro for just $1,600</a>.</p>
<p>It’s not like the M4 MacBook Pro is some kind of dated or outmoded device — it debuted exactly one year ago, with all the bells, whistles, and accompanying hype we’re now seeing for the M5 models. And that hype has been totally justified — the average Amazon review of the M4 MacBook Pro is a stellar 4.8 out of 5 stars.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5023/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Thing of Beauty</h2>
<p>Apple products in general and MacBooks in particular have made their bones for years thanks in no small part to their exceptional design. Frankly, they’re just really good-looking machines. That of course would wear off quickly if they didn’t have anything going for them under the hood, but that’s never been the case with the MacBooks.</p>
<p>The display is where the true beauty lies with the M4 MacBook Pro, because it’s a 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR screen with up to 1600 nits of peak brightness that is simply stunning. Creative work like photo and video editing will never look better, nor will your streaming or video calls. There’s also never any worry about lag or glitching out, because the M4 chip and its integrated graphics driver are designed to deliver peak visuals.</p>



<h2>(Almost) the Latest</h2>
<p>Everything else in and about the M4 MacBook Pro is either Apple’s very latest tech and features, or close enough to it to still be about the best laptops on the market. First and foremost is Apple Intelligence, the advanced artificial intelligence assistant that is the perfect combination of power, speed, and security — not even Apple can see your searches or search history. When you start exploring Apple Intelligence, you won’t want to stop, and with the M4 MacBook Pro’s battery life extending almost 24 hours on a single charge, you won’t have to.</p>
<p>There’s no shame in your game if you’re a one-generation-ago shopper, especially when that previous-gen tech is only a year old and possessing nearly all of the features of its successor model. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5023/">That’s the deal that presents itself with the M4 MacBook Pro, because it’s worth every penny of its newly reduced $1,600 Amazon price.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Xbox players will be able to access PlayStation exclusives like God of War and Insomniac’s Spider-Man series on the next console, the latest reports state.</p>



<p>The next-gen era for Microsoft and Sony is on the horizon, despite the fact that many developers continue to support last-gen consoles like the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and there looks to be a titanic shift in terms of exclusive titles.</p>



<p>Xbox has already manoeuvred away from first-party exclusives, bringing the likes of Starfield, Forza Horizon 5, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo to PlayStation</a>, while Sony has eased slightly, as indicated by the release of Helldivers 2 on Xbox earlier this year.</p>



<p>There are still some big exceptions, notably on PlayStation’s side with the likes of God of War, Insomniac’s Spider-Man, and Ghost of Tsushima, but that’s set to change in the new era.</p>



<h2 id="h-playstation-exclusives-coming-to-xbox-in-new-era">PlayStation Exclusives Coming to Xbox in New Era</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming to Xbox? Image via Sony</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-ambitious-new-xbox-your-entire-console-library-the-full-power-of-windows-pc-gaming-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows Central’s Jez Cordon</a>, Microsoft’s plans for the next era of Xbox will bring the console more in line with PC, including the addition of various storefronts onto the console. Here’s what he wrote on the matter:</p>



<p>“You will be able to run PlayStation’s PC titles like God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, and Spider-Man on the next Xbox, purchased via Steam or Epic Games. You will be able to play&nbsp;World of Warcraft&nbsp;on the next Xbox, via Battle.net. You’ll also be able to install practically any game that runs on Windows, giving you access to decades upon decades of content all on a single device.”</p>



<p>Some steps toward that goal have already been taken with the ROG Ally X, which includes support for the likes of Steam and Epic Games Store, and the next Xbox console will have similar support.</p>



<p>With the addition of Steam and Epic storefronts onto the console, the door will be opened for titles that were previously PlayStation console exclusives, like God of War and Spider-Man, onto the Xbox platform—even though it won’t be a direct release and will lack established Xbox features, like Gamerscore and Achievements, for example.</p>



<p>The blurring of the waters in regards to exclusives has been difficult for players to get their head around, with the term exclusive now being looser than ever, but, in general, it’s good news for consumers.</p>

            <p>All this news about a new, next-gen PlayStation handheld just won't go away will it? We first started hearing reports about all this about a year ago, when Sony reportedly began prepping <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-prepping-playstation-5-portable-plans-to-battle-nintendos-handheld-dominance">a PlayStation 5 portable</a>, amid rumours that the company planned to battle Nintendo's handheld dominance.</p>
<p>Then, back in June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-the-first-plausible-sony-handheld-specs-leaks-emerge-but-how-capable-can-it-be">plausible technical specifications for Sony's next-gen handheld came to light</a> via KeplerL2, kicking off some serious chatter about how realistic an idea a new PS handheld would be.</p>
<p>Then, in a recent firmware update, Sony added a new Power Saver mode to the PS5 - the latest actual contribution to Sony's long-term eco-friendly initiative that we've seen evidence of in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-new-ps5-model-uses-less-power-during-games">various PS5 models</a> to date, with each iteration <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-adding-way-to-save-power-when-charging-controllers-but-only-for-latest-ps5-model">adding new ways</a> to conserve power.

<figcaption>DF on the Power Saver profile.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTcgIGLXpQg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>But this Power Saving mode is a bit different: it's something supported across the whole PS5 family, and targets specific games - such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, Demon's Souls and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> Remastered - to reduce the power draw the console demands whilst playing. Social media was abuzz last week that this Power Saving mode was a suggestion that Sony is demoing something for the PS6, or related next-gen handheld, but a new video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTcgIGLXpQg">Digital Foundry</a> pours water on that idea.</p><p>"This eco-friendly mode is part of Sony's drive to reduce greenhouse emissions first and foremost, and involves each developer custom-tuning each game to run at a lower power profile - often chopping power usage by 50% as a result," says DF. "However, curiously, this mode's throttled CPU, GPU and memory bandwidth puts PS5 in a similar state - spec-wise - to some aspects of the rumoured upcoming PlayStation handheld."</p>
<p>Per the friends of Eurogamer at DF, the Power Saver profile does, indeed, reduce energy draw by as much as 50% or more for some games, the team outlines that the resultant ~100W being used by the machine is still far too high for any handheld running on suspected specs (below). In order to actually get within a tolerable range for handheld power draw, the machine would actually need to be somewhere around the 15W range to work with the majority of handheld batteries. That's still pretty impressive, though: Days Gone Remastered manages to run at a fraction of the power it was running at before - both in performance and quality profiles - and achieves that with not too much impact to the final experience. Demon's Souls, notably, has to be reduced from 60fps to 30fps.</p>
<p>What does that mean, in simple terms? That any potential portable device or power profile would require something else entirely - that this Power Saver profile is not enough, in and of itself, to make PS5 games suitable for handheld play. This profile, Rich Leadbetter of DF suggests, is a means by which developers "can get to grips with the key limitations of what this handheld will require". Maybe this is a staging ground for the rumoured tech, but, at this moment, nothing more.</p>
<p>Last week, when approached about the idea that Sony may be working on a theorised handheld device, former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida noted that the idea of such a device <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-ps6-sony-cannot-do-the-same-thing-they-have-been-doing-says-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida">"may be very attractive to all these people who have libraries of games on PS4 and PS5"</a>. Indeed. </p>

<p>But it's not just handhelds in Sony's future, it would seem. There's been a fair amount of chatter about the future of PlayStation lately, with PS5 system architect Mark Cerny and AMD senior vice president Jack Huynh presenting a video (above) on new technology, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-2025-new-playstation-6-tech-all-but-confirmed-by-sony-and-amd">all but confirming what we can expect from the PlayStation 6</a>.</p>
<p>In the same interview referenced above, Shuhei Yoshida also noted that Sony cannot simply "do the same thing [it has] been doing "to find success with the new hardware.</p>
<p>PlayStation and Sony have yet to share anything official about either the PS6 or a next-gen handheld device.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-driving-adventure-rv-there-yet-crosses-1-3m-sales-in-just-one-week.1335766/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Nuggets Entertainment has revealed that its co-op driving adventure&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?</em> has hit a very impressive sales milestone less than a week after its release.</p>

<p>On Friday, Nuggets <a href="https://x.com/RVThereYetGame/status/1982121374002168034" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> that the game had crossed a million sales with a rather endearingly lo-fi picture of a character pushing an RV up a hill, and over the weekend, sales reached almost 1.3 million (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cooperative-indie-darling-rv-there-yet-cruises-past-13-million-sales" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>).</p>

<p>In a video on the official Nuggets YouTube channel, "winch operator" Jace Varlet says that he and his team are aware that players have reported some bugs in&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?</em>, and he says those bugs are being worked on by the development team.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rv-there-yet-sales-rock.jpg?itok=ZTT8TpEF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rv-there-yet-sales-rock.jpg?itok=t3YsR1Ml 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Indie "friendslop"-style adventure&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?&nbsp;</em>has crossed an impressive sales barrier.</figcaption></figure><p>Varlet also acknowledges that players are complaining of some features, like multi-language support and key rebinding, being unavailable in&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?</em>, with some even going as far as to suggest that the game should have been released in Early Access.</p>

<p>According to Varlet, the reason these features aren't present in the game is that "it was a game jam game", with the kind of strict deadline that implies, and the team "had no expectation" that&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?&nbsp;</em>would become as popular as it has.</p>

<p>As for why&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?&nbsp;</em>didn't launch in Early Access, Varlet says the game "by and large is there", even if some features are missing, and that no other features were planned, thus making the Early Access label unsuitable for Nuggets' effort.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?</em>, it's a co-op adventure game in which you and your friends must take an unconventional route home after a vacation. It's in a similar vein to games like indie hits&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/peak-2m-sales" rel="nofollow">Peak</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chained-together-steam-surprise-hit" rel="nofollow"><em>Chained Together</em></a>.</p>

              <p>We all use multiple devices every day; for both work and play. Our phones keep us connected, laptops handle the typical 9-to-5, and tablets come in handy for some on-the-go productivity. But juggling chargers for everything? That’s where it can get messy.</p>
<p>Carrying separate blocks and wires for all your devices is inconvenient. Things get bulky fast, and there’s no guarantee you’ll find a spare outlet for each device when you’re not at home. The solution? An efficient, but safe-to-use multi-port charger that works well with a range of devices.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5020/"> The 3-port Anker Prime charger does a great job at that, and you can now grab it for just $110 on Amazon, after a nice $40 discount.</a> The only catch? This deal is limited to Prime members. Non-Prime members can still get it at the regular price of $150, or wait it out for another future drop.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5020/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Charge Multiple Devices at Once</h2>
<p>You’re getting three charging ports and a total output of 160W. It can deliver up to 140W from a single port, which is great for power-hungry devices like MacBooks. When using all three, the power gets split up depending on the devices you’re juicing up. For example, it can deliver 70W + 70W + 20W when you’re charging two laptops at once, or 100W + 30W + 30W if you want to prioritize one main device, while also powering two more.</p>
<p>There’s a smart display on top, which gives you an insight into exactly how much power is being delivered to each device in real time. For more custom modes, you can connect the charger to the Anker app via Bluetooth. It lets you customize your control, plus switch charging modes as per your needs.</p>



<p>Compactibility is impressive. It plays nicely with just about everything, including iPhones (12 through 17 Series), iPads, MacBooks, AirPods, Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy phones, and even Steam Deck, ThinkPad X1, etc. And despite all this power, the charger stays compact and lightweight. It’s no larger than an AirPods Pro case, meaning you can toss it into your backpack and carry it around without feeling like you’re carrying something heavy. ActiveShield 4.0 monitors temperature 120 times per second to prevent overheating, so safety won’t be a concern either.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5020/">Altogether, this efficient charger replaces three with one. It fits into your hand, and still packs enough power to juice all your essentials quickly at the same time.</a></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368"><i>The Outer Worlds 2</i></a> is available for all starting on October 29, 2025. Those who’ve purchased the premium edition, however, can get in on the action early with “advanced access.” And if you do, you’ll get treated to a unique “Flaw” for your character (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/the-outer-worlds-2-fans-punished-by-obsidian-with-hilarious-debuffs-for-everything-from-dialogue-skipping-to-consumerism-if-they-purchase-the-usd100-premium-edition/">h/t <i>GamesRadar</i></a>) literally titled “Consumerism.” Flaws grant the player a double-edged sword of buffs and debuffs that can impact certain in-game actions or decisions, or specific character builds. And “Consumerism’s” description amusingly reads, “You’re the reason our marketing works. Promotions and sales have riddled your brain, and you’re more interested in buying the next big thing than financial planning.”</p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>: The&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></p> <p>Well, while it might double as a subtle reminder for some of us (re: me) to dig into that “financial planning,” at the very least the Flaw nets the player a permanent 15-percent discount on all vendors in the game, at the cost of earning 10 percent less for any item sold.</p>

    <p>But that’s not the only amusing Flaw Obsidian packed into the game. Racing through all the dialogue in the game will earn you “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/1og6q38/skipping_through_dialogue_in_rpgs_finally_bit_me/">Foot-in-Mouth Syndrome</a>,” where you’ll earn 15-percent extra experience on everything at the cost of having your dialogue choices made for you at random.</p>

 <p>Another amusing Flaw triggers when you invest in your skill points a little too evenly. “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/1ogm9cd/is_this_a_good_flaw/">Easily Distracted</a>” seems to trigger when you spread out your skill points across five different skills. This Flaw lets you raise skills more quickly, though it’s much harder to invest in one skill over any others as it only lets you “add skill points into your lowest non-zero Skill or any Skill you have no points in already.”</p> <p>I’m sure these are far from the only nuggets of meta-humor Obsidian has packed into this game.</p>

<p>Kratos Actor Christopher Judge has expressed his thoughts about going to Egypt for the next God of War game.</p>



<p>We keep hearing updates on spin-off and mainline God of War games, but we have yet to receive an official announcement. We recently saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-cancelled-multiplayer-screenshots-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screenshots</a> of the canceled multiplayer game emerge online, and now Kratos’ actor has expressed interest in traveling to Egypt for the next mainline release. </p>



<h2 id="h-going-to-egypt-for-the-next-god-of-war-would-be-a-completion-of-my-circle">Going to Egypt for the Next God of War “Would be a Completion of My Circle’ </h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/god-of-war-actor-christopher-judge-says-he-hopes-a-potential-sequel-will-take-place-in-egypt-but-i-have-no-doubt-that-no-matter-what-pantheon-it-is-it-will-be-great/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, Kratos actor Christopher Judge spoke about going to Egypt for the next God of War game at a panel at MCM London Comic Con. Judge stated that travelling to this location “would be a completion of my circle”, as he is highly popular for playing Teal’c from Stargate. Judge said “but whatever is decided”, before tracking back and stating “if there is another game”, he has “no doubt that no matter what pantheon it is, it will be great.”</p>



<p>Egypt, as the next location for a God of War game, has been a topic that has surfaced online many times in the past. And it makes sense to do so as well, as Kratos has already conquered Greek and Norse pantheons, it’s time for him to face off against a new set of gods. There was also a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-god-of-war-game-is-reportedly-centered-around-egyptian-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> earlier this year that Sony was casting Middle Eastern actors for an unknown AAA game, which could be the next God of War title set in Egypt. </p>



<p>In other news, Amazon’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-tv-amazon-casting-call-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">casting call</a> for its God of War TV series has leaked. Additionally, the long-rumored Greek God of War game has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/greek-god-of-war-game-pushed-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly delayed to 2026</a>.

<p>EA's internal chatbot, ReefGPT, is making life harder, not easier</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="7714a909d6b5d"><a title="EA Staff Are Reportedly Less Than Happy With Their Much-Hyped AI &quot;Helpers&quot; 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7714a909d6b5d/ea-staff-are-reportedly-less-than-happy-with-their-much-hyped-ai-helpers-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: EA Sports</em></figcaption></figure><p>Despite <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0m17d8827ko">the negative press</a> and questions surrounding the <a href="https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2025/05/copyright-office-report">ethical use of training data</a>, Generative AI is making a significant impact on game development, with many of the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/3d/video-game-design/why-the-games-industrys-ai-revolution-is-its-biggest-battle-yet">industry's major players</a> now utilising the technology to help create and enhance their products.</p>
<p>Electronic Arts has made no secret of the fact that it's betting the farm on AI; <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/opinion-electronic-arts-used-to-empower-developers-now-it-looks-to-replace-them-with-ai">last year, the company talked openly about its plans to leverage the tech</a>, and, more recently, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/ea-is-diving-headfirst-into-generative-ai-with-new-partnership">it has inked a deal with Stability AI</a> to "co-develop transformative generative AI models, tools, and workflows that empower EA’s artists, designers, and developers to reimagine how games are made".</p>
<p>Not everything the AI hype machine touches is turning to gold, however. We're now seeing reports from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10">Business Insider</a> (via <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/108403/report-eas-internal-ai-is-causing-issues-with-games-development/index.html">Tweak Town</a>) that EA's internal chatbot, ReefGPT, is making life more challenging for the company's beleaguered human developers.</p>
<p>Sources have told Business Insider that ReefGPT is actually <em>increasing</em> the amount of work EA's staff have to contend with, as it is responsible for creating faulty code that then needs to be manually fixed. Other sources claim that EA's AI tools are susceptible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)">hallucinations</a> (a common issue with AI agents); again, these need to be fixed by hand, which slows everything down and nullifies any time-saving benefit AI would have introduced.</p>
<p>On top of all of this is the feeling among EA staff that these AI tools are effectively going to replace them in time, which, as you can imagine, is hardly good for morale. Following the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ea-goes-private-after-usd55-billion-acquisition-by-saudi-arabias-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners">announcement</a> that EA has been acquired by the PIF (Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund), Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners for $55 billion, it's easy to see why the company's 'fleshbag' staff are less than happy right now.</p>
<p>One of the few companies out there which is resisting the use of Generative AI in its workflow is Nintendo – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/dont-worry-nintendo-likely-wont-utilise-generative-ai-in-its-game-development">at least that's what the official line was last year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-development-virtuos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several months of rumors</a> about a remake of Halo: Combat Evolved, the game that started one of Xbox's most successful franchises, Halo Studios (formerly 343 Interactive) <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> Halo: Campaign Evolved during this year's Halo World Championship event. The remake, powered by Unreal Engine 5 visuals (with the original game's code running beneath), will be released next year on PC, Xbox Series S and X, and even PlayStation 5 for the first time in the series.</p>



<p>As with all remakes, some fans immediately started dissecting the gameplay footage to see what was changed from the original. Even more interesting, though, is the point of view of one of the original developers, Jaime Griesemer, who was a designer on the first three Halo games. <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1981959132082274764" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking on X</a>, he criticized some level design changes from Halo: Combat Evolved and eventually likened the remake to the dance remix of a classic song that goes straight to the chorus.</p>



<p><em>You aren’t supposed to be able to take the Warthog up to steamroll the Hunters. I intentionally placed rocks in the way so you had to fight them on foot. When you can just smash the crates out of the way, it wrecks the encounters. But the worst part? They put trees in the landing area of the WooHoo Jump. Lame.</em></p>



<p><em>Yes, everybody, I know you can FORCE the Warthog through the gap in a variety of ways. I literally spent most of a day making it discouraging and difficult, but not impossible. You’re welcome!</em></p>



<p><em>On further analysis, I’m sure it’s because the vehicles take damage, and so you’re just as likely to destroy the hog as get it over the rocks. If anything that makes it -worse- because -none- of the vehicle tricks are going to work anymore. It’s like the dance remix of a classic song that skips the intro and the bridge and just thumps the chorus over and over.</em></p>



<p>His perspective isn't shared by one of the co-creators of the Halo franchise, Marcus Lehto (who was recently in the news because he criticized Electronic Arts for not crediting all of his team at Ridgeline Games in Battlefield 6). Lehto was at the Halo World Championship and, <a href="https://x.com/game_fabricator/status/1982523556320948338" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via X</a>, relayed a very positive first impression:</p>



<p><em>My honest impression of seeing the new Halo: Campaign Evolved is this:</em></p>



<p><em>I absolutely love where this is going. The game looks and feels genuine. It's gorgeous in a way I wish we could have built it originally back in 2001. It warms my heart to see Halo: Combat Evolved like this.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>PC upgrades don’t have to be bulky or complicated. Those looking for a no-fuss, low-profile desktop setup for their everyday work and play sessions should consider investing in a mini PC. These blocks quite literally fit in your hand, take practically no space at all, and even travel with you.</p>
<p>Like traditional PCs, these compact options also come in a range of configurations. If you’re mainly focused on everyday use (browsing, streaming, regular office work, studies), you don’t need anything over the top.<strong> A mini PC with at least an Intel N-series processor, 8GB of RAM, and a solid-state drive (SSD) will do the job well,</strong> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5019/">which is exactly what Kamrui AK1PLUS Mini PC offers, and it’s now available for just $146 on Amazon.</a> That’s a straightforward 19% discount on this powerhouse, but this deal is only available to Prime members. Non-Prime members can get it at its retail price of $190. And since Prime members also get free delivery, you’re saving a good chunk on both the price and the shipping.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5019/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Modest Specs for Day-to-Day Use</h2>
<p>This mini PC is powered by a 12th Gen Intel N95 processor with a clock speed of up to 3.4GHz. It offers a 30% performance bump over earlier chips like the N5095 and N5105, so it’s fast enough for most day-to-day tasks. There’s 8GB of DDR4 RAM for speedy multitasking, plus a 256GB M.2 SSD that offers sufficient space to store all your important files. The memory isn’t exactly massive, so it won’t be able to handle heavy gaming or resource-intensive creative tasks, but should be enough for regular usage. And if your storage needs grow over time, you can add a second 2.5-inch SATA SSD or HDD, or upgrade the existing M.2 SSD to as much as 2TB.</p>



<p>It also supports 4K at 60Hz via Intel UHD Graphics, and lets you connect up to two monitors simultaneously with dual HDMI ports for a bigger setup. Other connectivity options include two USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, two USB 2.0 ports, a Gigabit Ethernet port, dual-band WiFi (2.4GHz + 5GHz), and Bluetooth.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5019/">Despite all this power, the Kamrui mini PC stays fairly quiet while working, thanks to its built-in smart cooling fan.</a> It also includes a VESA mount, so you can attach it to the back of your monitor for a cleaner setup. Just be sure to get your orders in fast, since the deal might end any moment now.</p>

Asked if he agreed with the feedback that "certain sections" in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a> felt a little long, he disagreed, saying: "Regarding time management in certain sections, especially in FF7 Rebirth, I honestly don’t believe that they were longer than necessary. I feel like nowadays, players just have too much to do and too much to play; so they often feel the urge that something has to be concluded quickly."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/its-not-about-cutting-content-final-fantasy-7-remake-director-explains-concise-part-3-comments/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VGC</u></a>, Hamaguchi expanded further on this, saying: "Just to explain, the original question I was asked there was, they said that there are some people who played Rebirth, the second game in the series, and they felt that because we’ve added in new story content, which wasn’t in the original Final Fantasy 7, to them it felt like the story was being stretched out," he explained. "So they asked whether we were considering doing anything related to that in the third game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I feel that the pacing, the content, and the balance in Rebirth is exactly as I wanted it. I personally don’t feel it’s been stretched out; it doesn’t feel unnecessarily long. To me, I think I got that right, and I think a lot of people would agree with me."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hamaguchi explained that while he is looking at pacing and ensuring "that the story developments move forward in a fairly speedy manner and with the right pace essentially, rather than feeling slow and drawn out," his comment may have been "misconstrued."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think that may have been misconstrued by people; they may have said, ‘Okay, that means they’re going to cut down on the volume and they’re going to remove story content, it’s going to be a shorter game, they’re going to cut it down’, and that’s not what I’m saying at all," he added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s about making sure the pacing feels right, it’s not about cutting out content, it’s making sure that it feels right, the speed that the story progresses at feels right, and it is fairly quick and feels like you can get through it at a reasonable pace. But it has to feel right, so that’s what I mainly intended to say there."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Weirdest Things That Happened in the Original Final Fantasy 7</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">RPG fans have been on the hunt for news about the next entry in the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy since its last installment, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a>, launched in early 2024.

        <p>When we first opened the streets of Prague to you, we could only hope that the nights you spent there would create the memories they did. From the battles fought on the rooftops to the friendships made in the chaos, <em>Bloodhunt</em> has lived through you in countless unforgettable ways.</p><p>During these past four years, we have been thrilled to see your passion and dedication to <em>Bloodhunt</em>. Your feedback, creativity, and enthusiasm for our game has meant the world to us. However, despite you, our amazing community, the current player population has reached a level where keeping the servers running is no longer sustainable.</p><p>This has led us to make the difficult decision to take <em>Bloodhunt</em> offline.</p><p>The sun is now going to rise over Prague. We will be taking down the <em>Bloodhunt</em> servers on April 28, 2026, after which the game will no longer be available.</p><p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p><p>The game will remain fully playable until April 28, 2026. After this date, the servers will be taken offline, and the game will no longer be available on either PC or PlayStation 5.</p><p>As of today, token purchases have been disabled. However, the in-game store will still be open, allowing you to spend any tokens you may have until the servers go down. Once the game goes offline, any remaining tokens will not be usable.</p><p>All account and gameplay data will be deleted after closure in accordance with GDPR and/or equivalent.</p><p>This announcement does not affect your statutory rights. <em>Bloodhunt</em> and all related services are provided under the Privacy Policy and EULA available here.</p><p>If you have questions about your account, data or other inquiries please reach out to <a href="https://support.sharkmob.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharkmob Support</a>.</p><p>We encourage everyone to enjoy the time that remains in Prague and to keep playing, making the most of these final months together.</p><p>Thank you for being with us on this journey.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Halo: Campaign Evolved vs Halo Combat Evolved Side by Side Graphics Comparison</p>
      </div>
<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved will mark the sci-fi franchise's debut on a PlayStation platform, and people have a lot of strong feelings about this. One of the original Halo developers is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-warms-my-heart-original-dev-says/1100-6535722/" data-ref-id="1100-6535722">embracing the remake</a>, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-halo-developer-slams-campaign-evolveds-changes/1100-6535720/" data-ref-id="1100-6535720">another says it has issues</a>. The response has gone all the way to the White House, with the office posting a <a href="https://x.com/whitehouse/status/1982638578913206632?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">meme of Donald Trump as Master Chief wielding an Energy sword.</a> Trump has jokingly taken credit for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-declares-the-console-wars-officially-over-with-halo-on-ps5/1100-6535718/" data-ref-id="1100-6535718">ending the so-called "console war,"</a> with Halo now finally coming to PlayStation.</p><p>Halo: Campaign Evolved features "reborn" visuals, new prequel missions, more guns, and the ability to sprint.

                <p>Activision has released a new entry in its "Replacer" series of Call of Duty ads, this one featuring Terry Crews and Nikki Glaser play forensic agents who attend a crime scene because the real forensic teams is off playing Black Ops 7.

<p>"All claims to exclusivity are hereby dissolved. Console loyalists are instructed to cease hostilities, disband militias, and enjoy this new era of gaming," the directive from GameStop reads.</p><p>While the Halo: Campaign Evolved release isn't quite as definitive an end to console exclusivity as the GameStop post suggests, it is a major move away from exclusivity for Xbox. While the company has previously released some of its other major exclusive franchises to PlayStation, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-remaster-coming-this-august-to-xbox-playstation-and-pc/1100-6531314/" data-ref-id="1100-6531314">Gears of War</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/forza-horizon-5/" data-ref-id="5000-533238">Forza Horizon 5</a>, Halo has long been a flagship franchise for Xbox. But <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-games-will-be-on-playstation-going-forward-says-microsoft/1100-6535712/" data-ref-id="1100-6535712">Halo will be on PlayStation</a> moving forward.</p><p>Xbox exec <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-competes-more-with-tiktok-than-with-other-consoles-exec-says/1100-6535715/" data-ref-id="1100-6535715">Matt Booty explained</a> that Xbox is looking to go where the players are, even if that means releasing games on rival consoles. The strategy has been working out for Xbox so far, with its formerly exclusive franchises seeing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-sales-charts-thanks-to-ps5/2900-6605/" data-ref-id="2900-6605">great sales on the PlayStation</a>.</p>

The cause of the outage has now been identified, revealing that the massive outage was the result of a single software bug.</p><p>As initially reported while Amazon was trying to figure out the cause of the 15-hour outage, the problem originated in DynamoDB, AWS's DNS management system. As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/the-multi-billion-dollar-15-hour-aws-outage-that-brought-the-internet-to-its-knees-last-week-was-apparently-caused-by-a-single-software-bug/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, the issue originated with DNS Enactor, a component of DynamoDB that constantly updates domain lookup tables to stay on top of load balancing as conditions change.</p>

<p>The bug started when the DNS Enactor started to lag, and "experienced unusually high delays needing to retry its update on several of the DNS endpoints." The DNS Planner continued to generate new plans, and while the first Enactor was delayed, a second DNS Enactor began to implement those plans.</p><p>Once the second Enactor had implemented the new plans, it began the clean-up process, which deletes all plans older than the one it had just implemented. At the same time, the first Enactor finally caught up and overwrote the newer plan, with a check that should have prevented that from happening also failing due to the high delays. The clean-up from the second Enactor then deleted the older plan, which had become the active plan. "As this plan was deleted, all IP addresses for the regional endpoint were immediately removed," Amazon engineers explained, with the deletion of the active plan causing an "inconsistent state" that required manual intervention from an operator to eventually correct.</p><p>The cascade of bugs eventually led to a 15-hour outage, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/101925/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon reported</a>, and network intelligence company Ookla, which runs Downdetector, <a href="https://www.ookla.com/articles/aws-outage-q4-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">estimated</a> that it was one of its largest outages on record. The outage took out gaming services including Roblox, Fortnite, Pokemon Go, PlayStation Network, Rocket League, and Wordle, along with a huge number of non-gaming services and platforms.</p>
