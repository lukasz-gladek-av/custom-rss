			<p>Today, ZeniMax Online Studios announced the release of a new premium DLC and free update for the PC/Mac version of the MMORPG The Elder Scrolls Online (consoles will have to wait a couple of weeks as usual).</p>
<p>The premium DLC is called Fallen Banners and introduces two new dungeons to the game: Lep Seclusa and Exiled Redoubt. In Lep Seclusa, the Moth Priests who inhabit the location are under siege, and the cunning Orpheon the Tactician is determined to seize the power of the Elder Scroll they guard. The Elder Scrolls Online players must help Sister Chana defend the sanctuary from an army of deserters, protect its people and secrets, and confront Orpheon before he can use the scroll's power to change the face of Cyrodiil forever.</p>
<p>In Exiled Redoubt, soldiers of the Alliance War (regardless of their faction) are disappearing, and all traces lead to the namesake Imperial fortress. In this case, players will team up with Battlemage Lucilla to infiltrate this mysterious stronghold and put an end to the plans of a once noble Imperial House before the chaos spreads beyond its stone walls and across Tamriel.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Players who succeed in emerging victorious Lep Seclusa and the Exile Redoubt will also have the chance to loot and unlock a host of special rewards, including new collectibles, item sets, and Achievements. These include the Tactician's Gold Grate Skin, which can be earned by completing both dungeons on Veteran difficulty.</p>
<p>Fallen Banners is currently available to active ESO Plus subscribers. However, there's also a free update, the game's 45th. ZeniMax Online Studios has introduced a visual overhaul to the Starter Zones (Bleakrock Isle, Bal Foyen, Stros M'kai, Betnikh, and Khenarthi's Roost), including improved lighting, improved ground and water textures, updated structures, and the addition of more clutter or props.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Update 45 adds much more, though, between various balance changes, the first stages of console add-on support (which is scheduled to go live in its entirety later this year), and new player response options when talking to story NPCs, in an effort to improve the roleplaying factor in dialogue. For the full patch notes, head over <a href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/674341/pc-mac-patch-notes-v10-3-5-update-45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, earlier this year, ZeniMax <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-switch-from-yearly-chapters-to-seasonal-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that The Elder Scrolls Online would switch from yearly Chapters to seasonal content. The studio has already scheduled an ESO Direct for April 10 where more information about what's coming this year will be unveiled.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/627006/infinity-nikki-interactive-map-update-infold-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The developers of <em>Infinity Nikki</em> have finally solved one of the game’s biggest problems: where the hell is everything? Piggybacking off similar efforts in other gacha games like <em>Genshin Impact</em>, the developers at Infold Games have created an interactive map that’ll guide you to all the bits and bobs littered throughout the game’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/14/24320757/infinity-nikki-review-gacha-dress-up-game">impressively expansive world</a>.</p><p>Because <em>Infinity Nikki</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/605811/infinity-nikki-gacha-mechanics">is a gacha game</a>, there are fifty ‘leven different kinds of <em>things</em> to collect and trade for resources, currencies, and clothes. You can map some of the collectibles in <em>Infinity Nikki </em>to the ones in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and it works out pretty well. Some of them are easier to find than others. The whimstars are like spirit orbs you earn from shrines and they’re pretty easy to find as the game has a built-in system to help you locate them. The dews of inspiration are like korok seeds; there’s ten and a half million of them and your best chance of finding them is through sheer luck and determination – i.e. impossible. </p><p>It kinda sucks that they’re so hard to find because dews can be exchanged for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619372/infinity-nikki-eerie-season-event-march-2025">really cool outfits</a> that can help out if you’re stuck in one of the styling boss battles. The <em>Infinity Nikki</em> community has clamored for the developers to put a tracking system for them in the game similar to the way your bi-pedal cat companion Momo can guide you to nearby whimstars. The developers have fulfilled other community wishes like expanding the number of outfit slots from four to seven (thanks!) and now they’ve answered this ask in a big way.</p><p>Visiting <a href="https://pearpal.infoldgames.com/en/home">this site</a> will grant access to an interactive map whereby you can finally locate all those damnable dews of inspiration. If you use your <em>Infinity Nikki</em> log in information, the map will be personalized to show what items you’ve picked up and what you’re still missing. Best yet, this map can be used for literally everything – missing treasure chests, secret clothing vendors, hidden caves, and more. It’s not as convenient as an in-game map would be but it updates in real time to make checking things off your list a little easier.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A bunch of playtester footage for the next, modern-day-set Battlefield game has slipped past EA's non-disclosure agreements and erupted all over social media. The footage stems from the company's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-crumbling-warzones-are-teased-in-a-promo-vid-calling-for-playtesters">Battlefield Labs community testing program</a>, and consists of multiple consecutive minutes of burly shootyfolks running down alleyways through showers of grit, firing very briefly at enemy troopers, and getting themselves bullet-bonked back to the lobby screen. 
</p>
<p>
EA had been taking the videos down, but have seemingly now decided to let them roll. It's the kind of tactical withdrawal in the face of overwhelming numbers that seldom occurs to me when I play Battlefield, because I always play Battlefield in the character of a movie extra. I am here to cultivate the ambience for other players by prancing around yodelling "INCOMING", not contribute to our victory.
</p><!--more-->
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>
From the footage, we glean a few bits of information about the new game, which has yet to be formally revealed (or titled). In good news for people who hated Battlefield's specialist system, it looks like the old Assault, Engineer, Recon, and Medic classes are back. So are those picture-in-picture spawn select views that once allowed you to watch your squadmate running directly towards an enemy tank, then decide to spawn on them anyway. 
</p>
<p>
There are new squad animations for victory screens, which seem well-placed to help with sales of cosmetics. There's also the ability to drag downed team mates to cover rather than trying to defib them in a raging crossfire (see also: how I like to play Battlefield). And there are glimpses of the new destruction systems, with whole buildings falling over at the behest of rocket-propelled grenades.</p>
<p>If I have one request for nu-Battlefield, it's destruction physics of sufficient granularity and improbability that I can engineer really silly terrain traps. The tech has surely caught up with the blue sky thinking by now. I want to whittle buildings down to a single load-bearing doorway, then open it with a sniper bullet and drop the whole skyscraper on somebody's head. Less Spielbergian gravitas, more Looney Tunes, please!
</p>
<p>
The new Battlefield is the work of series creators DICE and long-haul Battlefield support studio Ripple Effect, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-have-delayed-need-for-speed-so-criterion-can-support-battlefield-6">together with Need For Speed outfit Criterion</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a> rebooters EA Motive. Ridgeline Games were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefields-next-campaign-being-developed-by-halo-co-creators-new-studio">working on the campaign at one point</a>, but EA <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shuts-down-ridgeline-games">closed them down</a>.

In the videos we can clearly see a neon-lit slice of the iconic strip, complete with a Lucky 38 casino sign. If you’ve played<em> Fallout: New Vegas</em> you know that’s the resort of Mr. House, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-amazon-tv-mr-house-new-vegas-1851559169&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-amazon-tv-mr-house-new-vegas-1851559169">a character who was teased in the first season of the show</a></span>. </p><p>Some online speculate that the sets seen in Onzo1313's videos were built for pre-war flashback moments, which is possible as everything does look a bit too neat for the post-apocalypse and there seem to be clean, drivable cars on the street. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@onzo1313/video/7479256356608888107&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@onzo1313/video/7479256356608888107" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another video</a></span> seems to give us our first look at New Vegas as it appears in the video games. You can see a rusty, cobbled-together sign that says “Welcome to the strip.” This is the nicer area of New Vegas in the video games, and getting in isn’t cheap. </p><p>Of course, it’s hard to discern much more from these shaky videos and leaks and we don’t know precisely how New Vegas will be featured in <em>Fallout’s </em>next season. But regardless, I’m excited to see such an iconic and famous piece of <em>Fallout </em>turned into real sets. <em>Fallout’s </em>dedication to real, hand-built sets and not just relying on CG backgrounds is something I really appreciated about season one, and it seems we’ll be getting more of that in season 2 when it arrives at some yet-to-be-announced date in the future. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I think it’s very primal in the way it invades your own body,” Mazin said in an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/last-of-us-clickers-flour-theory-game-changes-explained-1235495180/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Variety</u></a> about the decision to swap spores for tendrils, particularly in the final scene where Tess receives what can only be described as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-most-devastating-tv-deaths-of-all-time"><u>world’s worst goodbye kiss</u></a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/10/infected-1741624851517.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The latest The Last of Us Season 2 trailer confirms the return of spores.

And then one shot you see in this trailer, there are things in the air."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mazin later confirmed "spores are back," before Druckmann added: "The reason [we’re doing it now], I mean, we really wanted to figure it out, and again, everything has to be drama. There had to be a dramatic reason of introducing it now.

The appropriately named celebration always features announcements and treats for fans of the iconic plumber, and this year is no different. Although we’ve not yet seen anything quite on the level of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mar10-day-2024-everything-announced-including-a-new-super-mario-bros-movie"><u>2024’s reveals</u></a>, which included the promise that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-new-super-mario-bros-movie-is-officially-in-development-and-will-arrive-in-april-2026-mar10-day"><u>The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2 will arrive next year</u></a>, 2025 has already delivered some exciting Mario news.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Mario Offerings for Nintendo Switch Online Subscribers</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Just hours before MAR10 Day officially kicked off, Nintendo announced that the Super Mario Bros. 3 original soundtrack had been added to its Nintendo Music application for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. That means earworms like the World 1 Map tune Ground BGM are only a tap away, but there are even more deal sweeteners now available for Mario fans. Last Thursday, as an early surprise, Nintendo added the Game Boy releases of Mario’s Picross and Donkey to its library of Switch Online titles. It’s all available to help make MAR10 Day feel a bit more special right now.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Lego Mario Kat Set Drifts Into Stores This May</h3><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Here we go! 🏆 Launching May 15th 🏁 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LEGOSuperMario?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#LEGOSuperMario</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarioKart?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MarioKart</a> <a href="https://t.co/NZ13sCIFHo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/NZ13sCIFHo</a></p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1899083988142092785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo hasn’t been shy when it comes to adding more Lego sets based on its iconic cast of characters. While Mario has gotten plenty of love in this department in the past, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-reveals-170-mario-kart-set-specifically-designed-for-adult-builders"><u>new Mario Kart build</u></a> revealed as part of today’s festivities might be one of the toy line’s coolest yet. It’ll cost a whopping $170 when it drops May 15, 2025, but it also manages to pack in quite a bit of detail into the 1,972-piece kit.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Super Nintendo World Sweepstakes Offers 4-Night Stay for Lucky Fans</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking for every way you could possibly celebrate Mario Day, this new sweepstakes has you covered. As seen on the <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/rewards/16f5d5df11e8ee69" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>My Nintendo website</u></a>, Nintendo account holders can now spend Platinum points to enter into a sweepstakes that will offer select users the chance to win a four-night stay at Universal Orlando Resort that includes access to each of its four theme parks.

Image courtesy of JetBlue.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">JetBlue has partnered with Nintendo to create the Cloudtop Cruiser, a sky-blue aircraft featuring Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, and Bowser that will be used to transport fans. If flights aren’t your thing, you can enjoy more from Mario Day by participating in a Mario Kart 8 Deluxe community challenge that gives players until March 17 to complete 1 million in-game laps, collectively. A reward of 310 Platinum points will be gifted to those who participate in the challenge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Mario fans located in New York can visit the Nintendo store from 1pm – 4pm ET today to chat with Mario via an LED wall. Then, from 4pm – 7pm ET, the same location will offer meet-and-greet opportunities with Mario and Luigi. Those who can’t make the trek to New York may still be in luck, as starting March 15 from 12pm – 4pm. local time, <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/events" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>select GameStop locations</u></a> will allow players to demo Nintendo Switch titles such as Super Mario Party Jamboree, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and more. The GameStop events will also include Nintendo-themed giveaways.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Save Money on Select Mario Titles</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Mario Day tradition involves respectable discounts for some of the video game plumber's most iconic titles, and 2025 is no different. On the My Nintendo Store and eShop alone are a bevy of deals for games like Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Super Mario RPG, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, and more. You can see a list of a few of the MAR10 Day deals we spotted <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mar10-day-sales-2025"><u>here</u></a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mario Day Is Just Getting Started</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While die-hard Mario Bros. fans do what they can to celebrate Mario’s big day, others are simply taking the time to celebrate on social media. You’ll be hard pressed to make it out of today without seeing enough fan creations to stop an army of Koopa Troopas in their tracks, but we’ve gone through the trouble to include some of our favorites below.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>HAPPY <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MAR10?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MAR10</a> DAY!</p><p>In honor of it, here are some of my favorite Mario references from Cartoons!

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>'s "spring" arrival on PS5 has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">been known for a good few months now</a>, but with the season of daffodils and egg box art now almost upon us, we might finally have a specific release date to chew on. According to ultra-reliable leaker Billbil-kun, The Great Circle comes to Sony's consoles on 17th April, with pre-orders set to open soon.
</p>
<p>
Writing on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-les-dates-de-sortie-de-indiana-jones-et-le-cercle-ancien-sur-ps5-60055">Deallabs</a>, Billbil-kun (who has an excellent track record with PlayStation leaks) claimed their "recent investigations" had revealed the Standard edition of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will launch for PS5 on 17th April. However, Microsoft is reportedly also releasing a Premium version - just as it did on Xbox and PC - granting two days early access, from 15th April. Billbil-kun says they were unable to confirm if a PS5 Collector's Edition is in the works.
</p>
<p>
Billbil-kun claims The Great Circle's Standard and Premium editions will both be available as a physical release, with prices reportedly matching their Xbox equivalents. That means £69.99 / €79.99 / $69.99 USD for the Standard edition on PS5 and £99.99 / €109.99 / $99.99 for the Premium release. Pre-orders for both versions expected to go live on 25th March in Europe.

<p>
"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones," Eurogamer's Katharine Castle <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">wrote in her five star review of The Great Circle</a> last year, "[this] is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames." And if you're somehow still on the fence after all the praise its received since its release, perhaps you might like to know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-eurogamers-game-of-2024">we loved The Great Circle enough that it was named Eurogamer's Game of the Year in 2024.</a>
</p>
<p>
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's PlayStation 5 release follows Microsoft's decision last year to bring select first-party Xbox releases to other platforms. And after a tentative first 12 months - which saw <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, Grounded, Pentiment, and Hi-fi Rush make the jump to either PS5 or Switch - 2025 looks to be a busy one. Microsoft has already confirmed the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-age-of-mythology-and-age-of-empires-2-remasters-heading-to-ps5-this-year">Age of Empires 2</a>, Age of Mythology Retold, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-forza-horizon-5-officially-heading-to-playstation-5-this-spring">Forza Horizon 5</a>, Doom: The Dark Ages, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2 are heading to PS5 - with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Halo">Halo and Flight Simulator 2024 reportedly also on the way</a>.

			<p>Microsoft's Xbox next-generation plans include a premium successor to the Xbox Series X and a handheld that will reportedly launch in 2027.</p>
<p>In a new report shared today on <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027">WindowsCentral</a>, it has been revealed that the internal successor to the Series X|S platform has been fully greenlit. As of now, Xbox next generation hardware plans include a premium successor to the Xbox Series X console that will launch in 2027, alongside a gaming handheld and multiple new controller options which will have direct-to-cloud connectivity and allow users to switch them between different devices. As previously rumored, next-generation consoles will be closer to PCs than ever before and will make it much easier for developers to port games from PC. Backward compatibility will also be available.</p>
<p>While the handheld system that will be part of Xbox next generation plans is still two years away from release, we will get a first taste of a portable experience later this year with an Xbox-branded handheld codenamed Keenan that is in the works with a PC gaming OEM. This handheld, according to WindowsCentral's report, will look markedly Xbox with the typical guide button and design sensibilities, and will likely run full Windows with the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass as one of its main focuses.</p>
<p>Ever since Microsoft started releasing their former exclusives to other consoles, many have wondered if there are real Xbox next-generation plans. Judging from this report, it definitely looks like the company is not going to leave the hardware market anytime soon. If the new systems will indeed launch in 2027, it won't take long to see how they will deliver the largest technical leap <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/">teased</a> a while back.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/626952/sony-fsr-4-upscaler-coming-to-ps5-pro-reimplementation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Today, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">the $700 PlayStation 5 Pro</a> can already produce crisper, sharper, smoother, and more stable graphics than a PS5, if you sit close enough to appreciate them. But starting in 2026, the company hopes to imbue games with a new AI upscaling formula that’ll make them even crisper, based on the AMD FSR 4 technique that’s now shipping with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/624423/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review-benchmarks-price">AMD’s new RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards</a> and appears to be competitive against Nvidia’s latest DLSS as well.</p><p>“Our target is to have something very similar to FSR 4’s upscaler available on PS5 Pro for 2026 titles as the next evolution of PSSR,” PlayStation lead architect Mark Cerny <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-mark-cerny-fsr-4-to-play-a-key-part-in-the-next-evolution-of-pssr-upscaling">tells <em>Digital Foundry</em></a>.</p><p>Many new PS5 Pro games already use an AI upscaler called “PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution” on their AMD-based chips. PSSR can turn 720p images into 4K ones on the fly while adding extra particle effects, and we’ve been relatively impressed by its quality compared to, say, FSR 3.</p><p>But Sony and AMD’s relationship didn’t stop there — it turns out that the neural network that underpins AMD’s new FSR 4 upscaler was part of a collaboration with Sony, too, and Sony now plans to backport some of that work to its flagship PlayStation.</p><p>In December, Sony and AMD announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324317/amd-playstation-ai-work-better-graphics-project-amethyst">a multi-year collaboration called Project Amethyst</a>, one that we’re now learning actually began back in 2023, and Cerny tells <em>Digital Foundry</em> that FSR 4 was the first fruit of those labors. “The neural network (and training recipe) in FSR 4’s upscaler are the first results of the Amethyst collaboration,” he says, calling it “a more advanced approach that can exceed the crispness of PSSR.”</p><p>For now, though, Cerny says it’s still encouraging developers to use PSSR, as it will take time to “reimplement” FSR 4’s upscaling network into the PS5 Pro and its games.</p><p>Cerny suggests that Sony will have “its own implementations” of each algorithm it develops with AMD from here on out. He also hints Project Amethyst may be about more than home consoles, though: “Now to be clear, this technology has uses beyond PlayStation, and it’s about supporting broad work in machine learning across a variety of devices – the biggest win is when developers can freely move their code from device to device,” he tells <em>Digital Foundry.</em></p><p>You can watch <em>Digital Foundry</em>’s comparison of FSR 4, and its deep dive on PSSR, below.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Solid damage which is influenced by how far it flies before it hits your enemy.</p><p><strong>Meteor M</strong> (Ultimate - L3+R3) - Magneto flies up into the air, drawing in all projectiles to feed “the sphere,” hit the button again to unleash it on your enemies and make them rue the day they crossed the Master of Magnetism. It will explode if you charge it too long, but it’s not a big problem as you’ll often be trying to use the ability quickly.</p><p><strong>Metallic Curtain</strong> (LT) - Creates a large wall of magnetic force that blocks projectiles. Use it when your health is getting low to protect yourself and nearby allies. Your main damage-mitigating ability, use it often, particularly if you and your allies need breathing room.</p><p><strong>Metal Bulwark</strong> (Right Click / RB) - A shield Magneto can give to his…less sturdy allies. Use it to save a key Dualist or Strategist from being knocked out, and claim any damage they take to feed the rings on your back, empowering Mag-Cannon.</p><p><strong>Iron Bulwark</strong> (B / Circle) - Magneto creates a shield around himself, and converts any damage taken during its duration into metal for the rings on his back. A great way to prepare your Mag-Cannon and mitigate damage. Use it every time it’s available during combat to make life easier for your healers (and yourself).</p><p><strong>Mag-Cannon</strong> (LB) - After charging up the rings on his back, Mag-Cannon unleashes them in a targeted attack, dealing more damage the more rings there are. The fully-powered version knocks enemies back several yards as well. Great for picking off enemies with low health, particularly Strategist characters and Dualists.</p><p><strong>Magnetic Descent</strong> (Passive) - Hold the jump button to float down instead of falling.</p><p><strong>Metallic Fusion</strong> (Team-Up Ability: Y / Triangle) - Teaming up with his daughter, the Scarlet Witch, Magneto gains the ability to power his Iron Volley with a massive sword, dealing more damage.</p><h2 id="h3156"><a id=""></a><strong>How Should I Play Magneto?</strong></h2><p>Magneto is a solid, all-around tank who moves slowly and more deliberately, but who also has several special moves that help him protect himself and his allies, as well as prepare to deal small bursts of damage afterwards.

If they are in a good state, you can use the shield on yourself to give the healers more breathing room—particularly if they are Mantis or Loki, who benefit greatly from the extra time to set up damage buffs, deal damage, and create clones, respectively.</p><figure id="" data-id="c5ceb09a66e97289a5ab74307fad799c" data-recommend-id="image://c5ceb09a66e97289a5ab74307fad799c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magneto using his ultimate." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magneto using his ultimate." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NetEase / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c5ceb09a66e97289a5ab74307fad799c" data-recommend-id="image://c5ceb09a66e97289a5ab74307fad799c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magneto using his ultimate." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Use your ultimate when you want to scatter the enemy group, or as a counter to powerful ultimates like Cloak and Dagger, Invisible Woman, or Punisher.

<p>The Counter-Strike 2 competitive scene is known for its dauntingly stacked calendar, but one team is racking up official maps played at a breakneck pace. Unsurprisingly, it’s a tier two team that has to play a marathon of matches just to qualify for events like the illustrious Majors.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tier-two-bc-game-could-break-the-cs2-record-for-most-official-maps-played-in-a-year">Tier Two BC.Game Could Break the CS2 Record for Most Official Maps Played in a Year</h2>



<p>It’s not even halfway through March, and the European veteran roster playing for BC.Game has already <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/teams/12878/bcgame?startDate=2025-01-01&amp;endDate=2025-12-31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">played 107 official maps</a> of professional Counter-Strike in 2025. BC.Game, a crypto casino website, entered CS2 in the summer of 2024. In the second half of that year, the team played 94 maps, but they have already beaten that number this year in less than half the time.</p>



<p>107 official maps played so far averages out to more than 1.55 maps per day. While that doesn’t sound like a lot to a casual player, that’s only taking into account official matches as part of a tournament or qualifier. It doesn’t include the hours spent practicing, scrimming, or traveling. In 2024, the team that played the most official maps was Polish team Permitta, who played 467. But at their current rate, BC.Game could pass 500 official maps played before the end of the year.</p>



<p>Tier two teams like BC.Game are burdened with having to play far more maps of Counter-Strike than the higher ranked tier one teams. In comparison, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reigning Major champions Team Spirit</a> have only played 35 maps so far this year, less than a third of the total that BC.Game has accrued. Tier two teams such as BC.Game consistently have to play through open qualifiers to reach prestigious CS2 events, as they don’t have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-vrs-in-cs2-valve-regional-standings-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Valve-determined ranking</a> to receive a direct invite to playoffs or later stages of certain events. Even Fnatic, who once dominated Counter-Strike a decade ago, had to play <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/4991/fnatic#tab-matchesBox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seven best-of-three series</a> across the past two days.</p>



<p>Will BC.Game, or any CS2 team, reach 500 official maps played in 2025? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The next-generation Xbox console is two years away from release. According to a new report from Windows Central’s Jez Corden, Microsoft is currently targeting 2027 for release of its next mainline Xbox consoles.</p>



<p>Per <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the report</a>, the new systems are in full production at Microsoft. </p>



<p>“[Our] sources also indicate that Microsoft’s internal successor to the Xbox Series X|S platform has been fully greenlit all the way up to CEO Satya Nadella,” Corden writes.</p>



<p>He adds that it’s believed that the current plans for the next generation of Xbox include a “premium successor” to the Xbox Series X along with its own in-house developed handheld console. There are also plans for “several” new controllers.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-the-future-of-call-of-duty-insider-gaming-weekly">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-call-of-duty-insider-gaming-weekly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Future Of Call of Duty—Insider Gaming Weekly</a></h6>



<p>Corden’s report also follows up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-not-a-console-at-all-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his earlier claims</a> that new Xbox consoles will be “closer to Windows than ever before”.  The new systems will also still support backwards compatibility to allow older games to be played.</p>



<p>In addition to the new consoles, Microsoft is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-launching-partner-gaming-handheld-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly planning to launch</a> an Xbox-partnered handheld gaming system later in 2025.</p>



<p>None of these plans have been officially announced by Microsoft. Until that happens—and even after they become public—, understand that targets can always change. Insider Gaming has reached out to Xbox for comment on the claims. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

<p>Xbox is finally getting into the gaming handheld space. According to a new report from Jez Corden of Windows Central, Microsoft is working to launch an Xbox-branded handheld later in 2025.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report states</a> that it won’t be a Microsoft produced device. Instead, the company is working with a partner OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer).</p>



<p>The device, under the codename “Keenan”, “will look unmistakably Xbox”, the report says. The device will even feature an Xbox Guide button that is featured on Xbox controllers.</p>



<p>Not much was given regarding features. However, there was speculation from the report.</p>



<p>“Given that this is a partner device, similar to&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lenovo-legion-go-s-is-the-first-third-party-steamos-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lenovo’s SteamOS partnership with Valve</a>, I expect this handheld to be more PC-oriented,” Corden says. “It’ll most likely run full Windows, putting the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass front and center, alongside the ability to install things like Steam.”</p>



<p>In addition to the plans for an Xbox-themed handheld this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-gen-xbox-console-release-planned-for-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft is targeting 2027</a> for its next-gen console.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Xbox for comment on the claims. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> Season 8 will be all about taking on the game's endgame bosses and channeling their powers, Blizzard revealed, along the way confirming the return of one of the franchise's biggest bosses ever.</p><p dir="ltr">As part of a recent Campfire Chat livestream, Blizzard discussed what players can expect from Season 8. Alongside a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-will-get-harder-next-season-with-both-a-difficulty-increase-and-xp-gain-decrease/1100-6530009/" data-ref-id="1100-6530009">slower pace, difficulty changes</a>, and class balance updates, the theme of Season 8 will revolve around a revamped endgame boss system that will make channeling them more straightforward and rewarding.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgzOVLtAWLI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kgzOVLtAWLI?start=1" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Three new endgame bosses in total will be added as part of Season 8: Urivar and the Harbinger of Hatred from Diablo 4's Vessel of Hatred campaign, and a third that will be familiar to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-25658">Diablo 3</a> players. That boss is none other than Belial, the Lord of Lies, who will serve as the game's new pinnacle boss. Players may remember him from his multi-phase Act-2 battle in Diablo 3, the final phase of which his massive form took up the majority of the screen.</p><p dir="ltr">"Belial is back in Sanctuary," Diablo 4 lead season designer Deric Nuñez said during the livestream. "He is climbing his way to the top of the lair boss ladder. He is the new exalted, pinnacle challenge within the ladder. He is the highest challenge, the highest reward."</p><p dir="ltr">Defeating the endgame bosses during Season 8 will unlock that boss' powers for players to use. There will be a total of 24 boss powers to collect and experiment with as part of Season 8, Blizzard said. There will additionally be a new boss-rush style open world event, Apparition Incursions, that players can take part in as part of the Season. Defeating and looting any endgame boss will have a small chance to initiate an ambush by Belial (in his smaller, less screen-covering form). If players can then take out Belial too, the loot rewards will double.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is really cool, because it's like a two-for-the-price-of-one payout," Nuñez said.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside the new bosses and the ability to channel some of their iconic powers, Blizzard is vastly simplifying the boss summoning process. Currently, players collect a number of different items required to summon different bosses, resulting in inventory clutter and a constant state of having some items needed to summon a boss but not the others.</p><p dir="ltr">Come Season 8, that system will be done away with and replaced by a much simpler Lair Key system. Each endgame boss will require their own Lair Key, but those keys are only used to unlock their hoard of loot upon being defeated. Players will actually be able to challenge the endgame bosses at any time in order to see how their character stacks up and to practice and learn each bosses mechanics, without the risk of losing precious boss summoning materials as is currently the case.</p><p dir="ltr">The public test realm for Diablo 4 Season 8 will start on March 11. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-8-delayed-but-will-feature-return-of-an-old-friend/1100-6529803/" data-ref-id="1100-6529803">Season 8 proper, meanwhile, was recently delayed</a> and is expected to arrive April 29.</p>

            <p>When the second season of The Last of Us airs this April, viewers will be introduced to the character of Abby.</p>
<p>Those who know the games will be aware of the conversation around this character, with some already expressing concern about the toxicity actress Kaitlyn Dever will likely receive through proxy of playing Abby. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/abby-actress-kaitlyn-dever-protected-by-extra-security-while-filming-the-last-of-us-season-two">Dever required extra security on set because of the role</a>.</p>
<p>But, while Dever has admitted it's "hard not to see those things on the internet", she has worked to "do this character justice" in The Last of Us' second season.</p>

<p>When asked by <a href="https://screenrant.com/last-us-season-2-abby-backlash-kaitlyn-dever-response/">ScreenRant</a> if she pays attention to how people anticipate a character such as The Last of Us Part 2's Abby, Dever replied:</p>
<p>"Well, it's hard not to see those things on the internet. It's hard not to stop myself from looking at it every once in a while, especially going into this, for sure. And I want to do this character justice and make the fans proud by bringing her to life in this kind of way."</p>
<p>Dever added her "main focus was just the collaboration between Neil [Druckmann] and Craig [Mazin], and making sure I was really getting to the core of who she is and what drives her and her emotional state; her anger and her frustration and her grief and all of that," before closing: </p>
<p>"I wanted to make sure that that was what I was focusing most of my energy on."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amd-fsr-4-will-be-used-in-ps5-pro-games-next-year-reveals-sony%E2%80%99s-mark-cerny.1130244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-will-be-used-in-ps5-pro-games-next-year-reveals-sonys-mark-cerny/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-confirmed-to-have-been-co-developed-with-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmation</a> that AMD FSR 4 had been co-developed with Sony as part of the wider machine learning Project Amethyst collaboration, PlayStation 5 Pro System Architect Mark Cerny revealed today <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-mark-cerny-fsr-4-to-play-a-key-part-in-the-next-evolution-of-pssr-upscaling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an interview with Digital Foundry</a> that AMD's latest upscaling technology will be introduced to the most powerful console currently on the market in 2026.</p>
<p>This year, Sony plans to focus on helping developers implement the current version of PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR), but they are already working on the future implementation of AMD FSR 4, or rather, its equivalent tailored for the PS5 Pro console:</p>
<p><em>Our target is to have something very similar to FSR 4's upscaler available on PS5 Pro for 2026 titles as the next evolution of PSSR; it should take the same inputs and produce essentially the same outputs. Doing that implementation is rather ambitious and time consuming, which is why you haven't already seen this new upscaler on PS5 Pro.</em></p>
<p><em>RDNA 4 and the hardware in PS5 Pro are completely separate designs, which is why I speak in terms of 'reimplementation' on PS5 Pro when I talk about the new upscaling network used in AMD FSR 4. I’m definitely looking forward to a future with co-developed hardware features for machine learning that will dramatically increase the interoperability.</em></p>
<p>When questioned about whether the console could handle the increased computational cost of AMD FSR 4, Cerny expressed confidence that the PS5 Pro's 300 8-bit TOPS would make it work. Later in the Q&amp;A, the programmer and game designer returned to discuss both short-term and long-term objectives that are part of Project Amethyst (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-lead-architect-mark-cerny-unveils-codename-amethyst-ml-collaboration-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed a few months ago</a>):</p>
<p><em>The shorter-term goal is to co-develop neural network architectures and training strategies for game graphics. The longer-term goal is to work together to create a more ideal hardware architecture for machine learning, something capable of processing the neural networks needed for game graphics at high speed. PS5 Pro was a wonderful learning experience for us here at SIE, and of course, AMD has an incredible amount of knowledge from its multi-generation RDNA roadmap. Again, it just makes sense to combine those expertises. [...] AMD FSR 4 and this next evolution of PSSR are a paradigm for our future. Going forward, we expect to have our own implementations of each of the algorithms developed through the collaboration.</em></p>
<p>Closing up, he added there might be quite a few tweaks because technical targets for console and PC games are quite different. For example, 60FPS is still believed to be the golden standard for consoles, while PC games aim much higher nowadays.</p>
<p>With FSR 4, AMD definitely <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-better-fsr3-dlss-cnn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed the gap with NVIDIA</a>, although the latest DLSS 4 transformer model and the GeForce RTX 50's Multi Frame Generation keep the Green Team ahead. Still, NVIDIA will have to continue investing in advancements, something that users should be thankful for.</p>

From 2D to 3D, on good hardware and bad, Mario running, jumping, and collecting coins has been a constant not just for Nintendo, but in the fabric of the medium itself, driving it forward, inspiring it, reacting to what’s worked, and pushing back against what hasn’t. </p><p>Trying to rank the<em> Super Mario</em> games is like trying to rank flavors of ice cream.

It’s comforting, but short, breezy, and at times insultingly easy and simplistic. The soundtrack is largely one song on repeat that will make you want to mute your 3DS sooner than later.

Consider this: 11 whole years (!) had passed since the <em>Super Mario</em> series’ last original side-scroller, <em>Yoshi’s Island</em>. You can see why folks were twitchy. As such, Nintendo announcing <em>New Super Mario Bros.</em> for its DS handheld made for a welcome surprise.<br></p><p>The game’s title alone was intriguing: no numbers, no subtitles, just the word “New” attached to the name of the side-scroller that changed everything back in ‘85. Indeed, this “new” <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> attempted something of a return to baseline, jettisoning some of the series’ later complications in favor of more basic <em>Mario</em> action. I wondered if it’d rekindle the deep enjoyment I had derived from the original NES trilogy.</p><p>It did not. While GameCube’s slightly troubled <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> had exposed some cracks in the edifice, <em>New Super Mario Bros.</em> ended up being the first mainline <em>Mario</em> that felt inessential. Its straightforward level designs and basic run-jump-bop action came off as bland, and its new ideas proved a mixed lot. </p><p>The wall-jumping maneuver was inoffensive, but the new power-ups ranged from “who cares?” to actively detrimental: The mega-mushroom rampages were just mindless spectacle, the mini mushroom was simultaneously too powerful and a frustrating prerequisite for important shortcuts, and the unwieldy blue shell suit actively tried to send you careening off cliffs. I grew bored, and stopped playing around the sixth or seventh world.</p><p><em>New Super Mario Bros.</em> was a solid platform game by most standards and the start of a welcome revival for side-scrolling <em>Mario</em>. But it didn’t measure up to the very high standard of its predecessors. — Alexandra Hall</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-chief-mario-is-part-of-gamers-dna-5935721&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-chief-mario-is-part-of-gamers-dna-5935721">Nintendo Chief: Mario Is Part Of Gamers’ DNA</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="131cbabf6f3c2595d8a247c4818a6a4a" data-recommend-id="image://131cbabf6f3c2595d8a247c4818a6a4a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Game Boy screen displays Mario jumping through a spider tunnel.

For Nintendo’s next trick it introduced the Game Boy, a category-defining new portable cartridge system. The NES had rocketed to success, in part, on the strength of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, so Game Boy naturally launched with <em>Super Mario Land</em>, a bite-sized take on the platforming plumber.<br></p><p>Luckily <em>Super Mario Land</em> was quite good—heck, it eventually became the fourth best-selling Game Boy game (18 million!). The physics were kinda wonky, but the tiny Mario ran about nimbly, tossing ricocheting “superballs” at a strange new cast of bomb-shelled turtles, oversized insects, hopping kyonshi zombies, and a literal alien. It even had two mild but pleasant shoot ‘em up stages, in which Mario piloted subs and airplanes in hopes of rescuing a new princess, Daisy.</p><p>It turns out the weirdness was not just from the new platform, but because development was handled by Nintendo producer Gunpei Yokoi’s R&amp;D1 group rather than Shigeru Miyamoto’s EAD. (R&amp;D1 later made <em>Super Mario Land 2</em> and branched off into the <em>Wario</em> series.) <em>Super Mario Land</em> is as off-brand as <em>Mario</em> would ever get, and I’d say the better for it.

That doesn’t mean Mario’s charming visit to Sarasaland wasn’t a great way to burn through another set of four double-As, though. — Alexandra Hall</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-boy-color-advance-nintendo-switch-online-direct-1850090977?rev=1675895622264&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-boy-color-advance-nintendo-switch-online-direct-1850090977?rev=1675895622264">Game Boy Games Have Arrived On The Switch </a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="73c08af6abfce95da11a2c1b7a306426" data-recommend-id="image://73c08af6abfce95da11a2c1b7a306426" data-format="jpg" data-width="1621" data-height="912" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Toads scurry between Piranha plants to catch up with Mario" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Toads scurry between Piranha plants to catch up with Mario" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="73c08af6abfce95da11a2c1b7a306426" data-recommend-id="image://73c08af6abfce95da11a2c1b7a306426" data-format="jpg" data-width="1621" data-height="912" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Toads scurry between Piranha plants to catch up with Mario" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Wedged in-between the release of two of the best 3D Mario games ever, 2009’s <em>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</em> offered console players their first full-fledged return to 2D <em>Super Mario</em> action in well over a decade. This second entry in the <em>New Super Mario Bros.</em> series was beefy compared to its handheld predecessor.. The new jump-spin technique added more nuance to navigation and wild, four-player co-op (or was it?) offered a completely different way to enjoy the carefully paced, but sometimes rote levels. If <em>New Super Mario Bros.

But when it arrived in 2011, <em>3D Land </em>was one of the best titles for Nintendo’s gimmicky dual-screen handheld.<br></p><p>A game of small but satisfying stages perfect for play on the go, it took a refreshingly different approach to 3D <em>Mario</em> platforming than games like <em>Sunshine </em>and <em>Galaxy </em>had, one rooted more in the design principles of early 2D <em>Mario</em> games. Today in some ways it feels like a strong proof of concept, establishing ideas that would be more fully realized in <em>3D World</em>.

Their largely uninspired level design made the whole series feel like a soulless attempt to cash in on nostalgia for earlier <em>Super Mario</em> side-scrollers, with little understanding of what made people love those games in the first place.<br></p><p>That all went out the window with <em>New Super Mario Bros. U </em>(which, thankfully, is not relegated to the Wii U on which it was first released, having gotten a Switch incarnation in the form of <em>New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</em>). Here, at last, was new (and <em>New</em>) <em>Mario</em> platforming with lively, varied levels that also did one of the things Nintendo does best, presenting a fairly easy (but still fun and inventive) challenge that most players of different skill levels can complete to get the satisfaction of “beating Bowser,” while also providing an intensely challenging and rewarding quest for those who wanted to 100% the game and truly test their platforming skills. </p><p>If you overlooked this game because you thought the <em>New </em>series just wasn’t delivering on its promise, you may want to give it a chance. It’s a terrific 2D thrill ride that actually understands what makes the best <em>Mario </em>level design so good, and sometimes even offers up some exciting surprises of its own. — Carolyn Petit</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-super-mario-bros-u-deluxe-the-kotaku-review-1831680503&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-super-mario-bros-u-deluxe-the-kotaku-review-1831680503"><em>New Super Mario Bros.

Its cute little disk seems to taunt, “Oh, you think you’re hot stuff for rescuing the princess? Well, try these levels on for size.” Except here in the west we couldn’t, because the folks at Nintendo apparently deemed this sequel too difficult for foreign markets.<br></p><p>It’s easy to see why. Compared to the challenging but relatively chill original, the Japanese <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em> is kind of mean. It sets the tone immediately by making the first “power-up” a poison mushroom which kills you. Or a few worlds in, you might find a beanstalk that leads to the sky. In the first game this was cause for celebration, but here your reward is a reverse “warp zone” that sends you all the way back to world 1-1. But don’t fret: In a hilarious example of the game’s twisted version of “mercy,” a small chasm next to the unwanted warp pipe offers the opportunity to dispose of your current Mario should you wish to avoid being sent back. Aw, those softies.</p><div><p>Sadism aside, <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em> really is more a <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> expansion than a wholly original sequel. A lot of the tile graphics are redone to be uglier, there aren’t many new items or foes, and you need to beat worlds one through eight a whopping eight times to unlock the even harder worlds A through D. Oh, and now Luigi has his different physics.</p><p>Is it good? Sure, in that it’s more <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, the landmark action game that changed everything. But the west never saw this sequel until it was part of the 1993 SNES remake package <em>Super Mario All-Stars</em>, by which point we’d also experienced the first two <em>Super Mario Land</em> games, <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>, and <em>Super Mario World</em>. So many folks, myself included, didn’t get a chance to experience this one fresh out of the oven, and I know I don’t quite appreciate it as much as a result.

The content creator playground remains alive and vibrant, for one, which already puts it head and shoulders above the 3DS and Wii U originals. No, the UI experience isn’t quite as good as on the Wii U, whose tablet felt custom-made for crafting new <em>Mario</em> levels. And there are weird oversights and missing features, like no 100-man challenge mode and no ways to track stats or help players easily discover cool creations. The sheer number of new design elements helps make up for that, however. And the new story mode is a drastically better teaching tool that has neat levels of its own. — Ethan Gach<br></p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-maker-2-the-kotaku-review-1835857984&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-maker-2-the-kotaku-review-1835857984"><em>Super Mario Maker 2</em>: The <em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e90ac81a8c54228d88f888dc9e48b1c3" data-recommend-id="image://e90ac81a8c54228d88f888dc9e48b1c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mario smashes Koopa shells underground.

Taito’s <em>Jungle King /</em> <em>Jungle Hunt </em>had it as early as 1982, and gaming’s first true superstar, Pac-Man, got his own cartoonish side-scroller in 1984’s <em>Pac-Land</em>. But nonetheless, to play <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. in 1985 was to know that everything had changed.<br></p><p>It was an absolute revelation to see Mario, previously the star of <em>Donkey Kong </em>and <em>Mario Bros.</em>, bust free from the single-screen confines of the past and run toward the right. A whole world of adventure awaited him, packed with immediately iconic power-ups, unforgettable secrets, a real sense of vastness and depth thanks to subterranean stages, and bonus coin zones hidden in the clouds. </p><p>But of course, none of that would have mattered if <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. didn’t feel so damn good to play. The option to hold down a button to run, the way Mario soared through the air, the sheer bliss of getting an invincibility star and plowing right through rows of goombas and koopas, all of it elevated <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>far beyond any side-scroller that had come before. </p><p>It’s also, for my money, the first game in which Nintendo’s signature, subtly intuitive level design is on display. There’s a reason why world 1-1 remains iconic to this day: Shigeru Miyamoto knew exactly what he was doing, telling you everything you needed to know with just a goomba and one super mushroom. And yet, for all its fundamental simplicity, the game continues to surprise as you progress, introducing nefarious new challenges (those damn hammer bros.!) and capping off each world with a castle so treacherous that surviving leaves you feeling both triumphant and relieved. </p><p>Some might argue that although it kicked off an action-gaming dynasty, the original <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>isn’t worth going back to today. I disagree. I think its level design is timelessly great (unlike that of some games in the <em>New Super Mario Bros. </em>series), its music and visuals are enduringly charming, and its controls as pleasurable and intuitive today as ever. Games that change the landscape of gaming forever are rare, but this is one of them, no question about it. — Carolyn Petit</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/when-we-show-a-power-up-to-mr-miyamoto-we-get-a-bit-n-5861970&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/when-we-show-a-power-up-to-mr-miyamoto-we-get-a-bit-n-5861970">‘When We Show A Power-Up To Mr. Miyamoto, We Get A Bit Nervous.’</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2e27914998a8564ee871971d8f7e8543" data-recommend-id="image://2e27914998a8564ee871971d8f7e8543" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luigi prepares to jump too far in Super Mario Bros. 2.

The result isn’t always perfect, but it can still often manage to feel revelatory. Mario’s vacation to Isle Delfino Island sees him strap a robotic water pump to his back to clean up goop and rescue Princess Peach from the consequences of Bowser’s poor parenting. Between detailed, open-ended levels and Mario’s new water jetpack, <em>Sunshine</em> transforms where Mario can go and how he gets there. It’s not quite an open world, but it feels almost as liberating.<br></p><p>The story beats and sporadic voice acting don’t always land, and the Pianta and Noki islanders haven’t etched themselves into the series’ lore the way other, more beloved creatures have. In fact, <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> has a lot of rough edges, not the least of which are the finicky camera controls. Halfway between a<em> Super Mario 64</em> sequel and a completely new type of 3D <em>Mario</em> game, <em>Sunshine</em> still managed to rise above its flaws thanks to some clever puzzle mechanics and imaginative map designs.

While other 3D Mario games like <em>Super Mario 64 </em>and <em>Super Mario Odyssey </em>have focused on more expansive environments for us to explore, <em>Super Mario 3D World</em>’s narrower, more propulsive stages<em> </em>chart a categorically different course, one that keeps the spirit of early <em>Super Mario</em> alive while also investing it with wonderful new ideas. — Carolyn Petit</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-3d-world-the-kotaku-review-1467128494&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-3d-world-the-kotaku-review-1467128494"><em>Super Mario 3D World</em>: The <em>Kotaku </em>Review</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8fb7250ce739ca5139310dfb166ac447" data-recommend-id="image://8fb7250ce739ca5139310dfb166ac447" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mario faces down a giant penguin atop an icy road." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mario faces down a giant penguin atop an icy road." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8fb7250ce739ca5139310dfb166ac447" data-recommend-id="image://8fb7250ce739ca5139310dfb166ac447" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mario faces down a giant penguin atop an icy road." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Did you think this was gonna be number one?

Watching Mario break the 2D plane for the first time changed a generation of players, creating one of the defining “next-gen” epiphanies current leaps in technology struggle to live up to.<br></p><p>Just the movement and physics alone were breathtaking, harnessing the Nintendo 64’s new analog control stick to both set new standards in player-character expressiveness and instantly make the digital-only controls of competing games feel antiquated. So enthused were the designers that they went a little overboard, giving Mario the single largest and most complex moveset he’s ever enjoyed. It can be a little hard to fully get to grips with, but the high skill ceiling for mastery is a big part of the fun.</p><p><em>Super Mario 64</em> is also pound for pound one of the best 3D <em>Super Mario</em> games, bursting at the seams with mischievous platforming and satisfying puzzles. From Cool, Cool Mountain to Dire, Dire Docks and Rainbow Ride, the game features iconic maps and some of the most satisfying collectible challenges in the series. Tick Tock Clock haunts me to this day. </p><p>The game straddles a difficult inflection point for the series, showcasing top-tier course designs built around Mario’s multitude of new jumps, while also being hampered by compromises made to take advantage of then cutting-edge technology. Those weigh it down, keeping it from ranking higher, but in some ways it’s a testament to just how strong its fundamentals are that the overall package remains one of the best platform games ever.

What new frontiers were there for Mario, and for 3D platforming, to conquer?<br></p><p>Oh, how wrong we were to doubt. <em>Super Mario Galaxy </em>was yet another massive imaginative leap forward for the series, playing with gravity, with the shape of environments, with a cosmic theme that took the series to bold new places and reinforced the feeling that Mario really has no limits. Buoyed by a gently melancholy story that introduced the character of Rosalina and by the most mind-bending and profound ending in the series, <em>Super Mario Galaxy </em>is all the things we want <em>Mario </em>to be: challenging, inventive, vibrant, intuitive, beautiful, and epic. — Carolyn Petit</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-s-opening-is-still-terrifying-1845095341&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-s-opening-is-still-terrifying-1845095341"><em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>’s Opening Is Still Terrifying</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f52c80603cc251476db8eb4bd49a034b" data-recommend-id="image://f52c80603cc251476db8eb4bd49a034b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1624" data-height="912" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mario flies to some ancient ruins.

Yes it’s more, but it’s also better, in every way, than its already groundbreaking predecessor. The 2010 Wii game is the definitive 3D <em>Super Mario</em>, complete with gorgeous worlds to explore, ambitious puzzle designs, and one of the most satisfying versions of Mario to control in any game. It somehow has even more planets than the first game, with an even greater level of variation and experimentation. Perhaps buoyed by previous success and the Wii’s blockbuster sales, Nintendo’s designers seemed to take even more chances—and, I suspect, had more fun—making <em>Galaxy 2</em>. </p><p><em>Super Mario</em> has always fundamentally been a series about gravity. You can’t jump if you don’t eventually fall, and Nintendo spent decades exploring that in 2D and 3D. <em>Galaxy</em> explored it from the inside out, using Wii motion controls to help you tease it out and feel it deep in your bones, and <em>Galaxy 2</em> took that to another level. — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-threw-super-mario-galaxy-2-down-the-memor-1844947959&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-threw-super-mario-galaxy-2-down-the-memor-1844947959">Nintendo Just Threw <em>Super Mario Galaxy 2</em> Down The Memory Hole</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1eb826fa6d22709018a4fd1d50842861" data-recommend-id="image://1eb826fa6d22709018a4fd1d50842861" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tanooki Mario dodges Bullet Bills.

Getting to see King Koopa’s military might represented across the landscape by forts and castles as your quest took you from the bucolic Grass Land (world 1) all the way to the foreboding, Mordor-like Dark Land (world 8) conjured the sense of a true quest against a vast force of evil, while little touches like the ways the hammer bros. moved around between stages brought that map to life–a real, living world. </p><p>But the game also represented another massive leap for the series (and for platforming games in general) in its level design, with slopes you could slide down, autoscrolling airships lending a formidable new feel to Bowser’s forces, and gimmicks that still surprise and delight to this day, like Giant Land (world 4), in which enemies and environmental features alike are suddenly many times their normal size. </p><p>To top it all off, Mario’s momentum is newly refined—run interrupted for a bit and you attain P-speed, moving faster, leaping farther, and even able to take flight—and he’s got a slew of new power-ups to play with, from the oddball Kuribo’s shoe to the iconic tanooki suit. <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> is just bursting with ingenuity and generosity from top to bottom, and upon release utterly destroyed the existing standards for games of this type with all of its inventiveness and fun, seamlessly weaving dozens of great new ideas into one epic adventure. — Carolyn Petit</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-making-and-legacy-of-super-mario-bros-3-1773499946&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-making-and-legacy-of-super-mario-bros-3-1773499946">The Making (And Legacy) Of<em> Super Mario Bros. 3</em></a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="90786d10d539fa373cd872917bf7dca1" data-recommend-id="image://90786d10d539fa373cd872917bf7dca1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mario rides some dolphins.

The best 2D <em>Mario</em> game Nintendo ever made is thus the best Mario game overall. Elegant and simple yet challenging and complex, the 1990 pack-in launch game for the SNES has aged like a fine Bordeaux: silky smooth and exquisitely harmonized. It controls like a dream. The pixel art still looks great. And each of its 73 levels offers something unique, with puzzles that evolve as new block types are unlocked and even a  visual overhaul once you reach a certain point.<br></p><p>It’s not as daring as <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> or as ambitious as <em>Super Mario Galaxy 2</em>, but it’s undoubtedly the most balanced and well-rounded package in the series. Feathers transform Mario into a gravity-defying superhero. Different-colored Yoshi harness various magical abilities from fire balls to mini-earthquakes. And ingenious hidden exists culminate in Star Road, an immaculate series of secret levels whose level of challenge is exceeded only by the amount of imagination on display. </p><p>Each zone on the map tells a story, and each one connects to the next, weaving an adventure that’s minimalistic but evocative, taking Mario over hills, underground, through foggy forests, and across prehistoric mountains. An underappreciated aspect of <em>Super Mario World</em> is how each new level, and new zone, slowly builds upon the last, not just mechanically but thematically as well. There’s no real backstory and hardly any dialogue, and yet each new step and every enemy jumped on carries you along a bit further through the most polished and quintessential <em>Mario </em>adventure ever made. </p><p>At least, for now. — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/unearthed-1990-interview-reveals-great-insights-about-s-1748732983&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/unearthed-1990-interview-reveals-great-insights-about-s-1748732983">Unearthed 1990 Interview Reveals Great Insights About <em>Super Mario World</em></a></span></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>There's a hot new machine from Nintendo that everybody's talking about that just received a major update, and you know we don't mean the Switch 2.

These scenes are the first from a retro Nintendo game, as the rest of those with scenes featured are all on the Switch. Those games include Super Mario Odyssey, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Splatoon 3, Pikmin 4, and Ring Fit Adventure. Connecting your Nintendo account will also give you access to scenes from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p><p dir="ltr">Retailing for $100, the Alarmo is a motion-activated alarm clock with sleep tracking features. It offers a variety of alarms, including "Gentle," which keeps the tone at one set volume, and "Steady," which makes the alarm increasingly louder.

            <p>In just 48 hours, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> has sold an impressive 1m units.</p>
<p>Developer Hazelight celebrated today's milestone on social media.</p>
<p>"The love you all show for our game is overwhelming," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hazelightgames.bsky.social/post/3ljztto3sws2v">it wrote on Bluesky</a>. "Everyone here at Hazelight are beyond happy - and we can't stop enjoying your amazing reactions!"</p>

<figcaption>Here's Eurogamer's video team giving Split Fiction a whirl with the game's first 90 minutes. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aHKxuDEDtg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Again, these are all sales. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-isnt-included-in-eas-play-subscription-at-launch">Split Fiction isn't currently included in the EA Play subscription</a>, nor is it on Game Pass or PS Plus. It's also worth noting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fictions-free-copy-offer-includes-crossplay-on-all-platforms-a-first-for-it-takes-two-developer">Split Fiction includes crossplay for the first time across all platforms</a> via the Friend's Pass function.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Split Fiction has had a great debut. Along with scores of praise across the industry, Hazellight's latest co-op caper currently boasts a peak concurrent player number of 259,003 on Steam.</p>
<p>To compare, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a>'s all time concurrent player peak is 71,039, which it reached three months ago as anticipation for Split Fiction grew. In October last year, Hazelight announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marital-platformer-it-takes-two-sales-pass-20m">It Takes Two had sold over 20m copies</a> since its own debut in 2021. That number will no doubt be even higher now. </p>
<p>A film adaptation of It Takes Two was also said to be in the works, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-josef-fares-doesnt-know-whats-happening-with-the-it-takes-two-film-adaptation">even Hazelight founder Josef Fares isn't sure what's happening with that right now</a>. </p>

<p>But, I digress! Back to the here and now. We awarded Split Fiction five stars on its release last week.</p>
<p>"Fantastic from start to finish, Split Fiction is one of the most inventive and joyful co-op games to date, and a testament to the power of human imagination," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">Eurogamer's Split Fiction review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
