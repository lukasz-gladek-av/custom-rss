		<p>As we get back up to speed in 2025, our first What We Played of the year is more about 2024 and all the holiday gaming we snuck in over the past fortnight. Visiting family for Christmas meant I didn’t have the big consoles to play on, but that just meant I got completely hooked on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/19/game-of-the-year-2024-best-independent/">Balatro</a> for about a week. I clearly wasn’t the best boy in 2024, because Santa gave me the flu for Christmas, and along with the tail end of the NFL season, Retro Bowl was the perfect minimal thought game. I’ve now taken the Seahawks on a three-peat and am looking to right the wrongs of Atlanta Falcons history in my current season.</p>
<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> holiday gaming has included a review of Threefold Recital and some more of The Witcher 3. There was also some more Football Manager 24, where he’s mounting a title challenge with Valencia and into the knockouts of the Champions League.</p>

<p><strong>Steve’s</strong> now on the hunt for a new headset, but that hasn’t stopped him from playing a bunch of games over the past couple weeks. He finished off the excellent Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, completing all of the side quests and achievements, and has moved on to Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, “which is great but feels a lot less expansive than the first one as most action taking place in the one big open world planet so far.” He’s also finished 9 Sols, though this did mean dropping the difficulty down about two thirds of the way through.</p>
<p>While he’s got Cuisineer and Behemoth on the go for review, <strong>Gamoc’s</strong> Christmas &amp; New Year gaming has also included Black Ops 6 and started Dragon Age The Veilguard – “The latter is as magenta as it gets, but still seems good. The former is, indeed, a Call of Duty game.”</p>


<p>It was a very Bohemian Christmas for <strong>Jim</strong>, who’s continued on his playthrough of Kingdom Come: Deliverance. He did a bunch of errands and local mysteries, and has found that everything from eating food, to maintaining Henry’s gear and sparring with a weapons trainer is a bit of a time sink, but he’s enjoying it and is now pushing on with the main quest because he knows there’s a lot of new games coming soon!</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> played Skull &amp; Bones and….. he didn’t like it – “It looks and plays like someone knock off studio tried to make Black Flag, I really couldn’t believe a full priced game could look that ugly in 2024.” So he tried to have a better time with some Transformers: Galactic Trials, but this part racing game and part shooter “should live up to it’s name and be put on trial, sentenced and thrown in to a pit of Sharkticons. […] By far the worse game I have played in 2024 and thankfully, the last one.”</p>
<p>Oh dear.</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> bought Animal Crossing New Horizons for his wife and they’ve been playing it together. “It’s not my usual speed of game, but it’s really cute and a nice thing to do together,” he said, though he’s no doubt a bit befuddled why they’re catching all these bugs and fish and then not turning them into armour.</p>
<p>Rounding us out, <strong>Reuben’s</strong> absolutely hooked on Marvel Rivals and is foaming at the mouth for Season 1 to start, and <strong>Dom’s</strong> basically just found time for some Overwatch 2, Snow Bros. Wonderland and Songs of Silence.</p>
<p>Now then, what did you play over the holidays?</p>

			<p><span>A new&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-mind-blowing-8k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grand Theft Auto V mod</a> released this week introduces an extremely accurate recreation of GTA IV's Liberty City, complete with all the elements that make it feel like a living, breathing city.</span></p>
<p>The Liberty City Preservation Project isn't the first modding project that attempts to recreate Liberty City in the latest main entry in the series, but it's definitely the most accomplished, as the recreated map features NPCs, vehicles, and sound effects from the original game. In addition, the recreated city also features a fully functional subway system, map, radar, and radio stations. As if all this wasn't enough, the mod also supports an HD texture pack that improves the visual quality of the map and makes it almost feel like the proper Grand Theft Auto IV remaster that has yet to be released. You can check out the mod in action in the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Liberty City Preservation Project - Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Ot_iuEb-ok?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The first release of the Grand Theft Auto V Liberty City Preservation Project is only the beginning for the development team. As revealed in a fresh interview posted on <a href="https://rockstarintel.com/how-world-travel-created-the-liberty-city-preservation-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rockstar Intel</a>, the team is looking to restore the majority of the interiors to be identical to those in GTA IV, destructible props, and completely redo the entire maps vertex paintings to make them look even better in Grand Theft Auto V. Once the project is done, the team is also looking to start a similar one, so there may be some amazing recreations of older games' maps in the future.</p>
<p>The Grand Theft Auto V Liberty City Preservation Project mod can be downloaded from the modding project's official <a href="https://discord.gg/worldtravel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord server.</a></p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch helped the Japanese company to rebound spectacularly after the WiiU’s underwhelming tenure. The hybrid console has sold millions in hardware and software and is responsible for some of the highest-reviewed titles of all time. But I think it’s high time the Nintendo Switch 2 scoots its way into 2025.</p>



<p>I’ve always been a “PlayStation” guy, ever since I was a kid. I’ve had the odd Game Boy and DS, but they were fleeting and flirtatious moments—outside of excessive Pokémon&nbsp;binges. I missed out on Metroid, the best Mario games, Zelda, etc, you name it. This all changed the day I decided to invest in a Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>As a proud Switch owner, I’ve spent the last few years catching up, and I think the Nintendo Switch is a monstrous marvel. However, it feels like it’s outstayed its welcome—despite the addition of the OLED line—and I want something new to play with.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-nintendo-switch-has-has-a-good-run">The Nintendo Switch Has Has a Good Run</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Simple and superb. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s get the obvious downer out of the way—<strong>the Nintendo Switch isn’t very powerful and never has been</strong>. This hasn’t been much of a problem for its colorful and cartoony, first-party titles though. Super Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 3, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-super-mario-mario-kart-sets-announced-for-january-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart</a> 8 Deluxe, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-best-super-smash-bros-stages-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> have sold a couple of hundred million copies between them, and they aren’t games designed to stretch a console to its limit—<em>maybe</em> for the Switch.</p>



<p>The optimized performance and sheer smoothness of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom feel like a minor miracle. But most games can’t hit 60 FPS, and performance varies from title to title—even if the unit is docked. The Switch has reportedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-sells-over-146-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over 146 million units</a>—apparently making it the third-best-selling console behind the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo DS—but consumers deserve the best.</p>



<p>I may come across as entitled, but after years of enjoying crispy 4K HDR, 60 FPS gameplay on my PlayStation 5, I want the same for the Switch. I didn’t want to do this, but Pokémon&nbsp;Scarlet and Violet was the final straw. What should’ve been Game Freak’s magnum opus, turned into a performance PR nightmare. I bought Pokémon&nbsp;Scarlet on day one, and it doesn’t matter how many times Sprigatito bats its precious eyelids at me, I can’t ignore the ugliness of Scarlet and Violet’s choppy frame rate, endless bugs, and lackluster performance across the board.</p>



<p>Nintendo’s array of exclusives is second to none. This is highlighted by the returning <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-announced-for-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> in 2025, and a new 3D Mario would benefit massively from a Switch 2. First-party content isn’t an issue for Nintendo and never has been. However, one of Nintendo’s biggest problems could be solved by a Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-s-third-party-isn-t-bouncing-enough">Nintendo’s Third Party Isn’t Bouncing Enough</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I count two pixels here. Credit to IGN’s Mortal Kombat 1 For Switch Review.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When you have exclusives selling like hotcakes, I get third-party isn’t much of a concern. I do find it puzzling Nintendo is happy to overlook this segment of the market though. Many third-party titles never see the light of day on Switch, and this is presumably due to technical limitations.</p>



<p>Those that do release have to make serious reductions. Take <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-1-switch-hate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat 1 on Switch</a> and the image of Johnny Cage above. 2023’s fighter is an unbelievable beat ’em up on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, with some of the most lifelike graphics and rapid response times. Its Switch port is a shell of its next-gen contemporaries with laughably long load times, blurry graphics, and a huge reduction in textures and performance.</p>



<p>On the other hand, bigger open-world titles don’t perform too badly on Switch. Hogwarts Legacy is still quite rough around the edges but manages to hold up, and The Witcher 3 miraculously plays well—again, at the expense of huge graphical and performance-related downgrades. It’s less a case of “if it can,” and more “should it?” It earns Nintendo more money, but these are titles deserving to be experienced as they were intended.</p>



<p>If the Nintendo Switch 2 can improve its performance, even more consumers might favor the portability and dual accessibility of the Switch 2 over a PlayStation or Xbox. More sales mean revenue and happier shareholders. The next console is rumored to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced before April 2025</a>—possibly to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-releasing-march-2025-rumor-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release in March 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Providing Nintendo nails it, the long-awaited follow-up could eclipse its younger sibling, and eventually become the top-selling Nintendo hardware in history.</p>



<hr>



<p>The Nintendo Switch’s run is one of the most successful and prolific in gaming history. But are you ready to see what Nintendo has in store with the Switch 2? Which potential titles and franchises would benefit the most?</p>

            <p>If you, like me, rather enjoyed The Rise of the Golden Idol - a game we called "a compelling modern mystery thriller that's bigger, better and more ambitious than its already brilliant predecessor" - then this news may be right up your alley.</p>
<p>Will Ackermann, one of The Rise of the Golden Idol's game designers, has today unveiled his next game: City of Voices. He's working on it in collaboration with pixel artist Matt Frith through his own studio Kini Games.</p>
<p>Described as a "Golden Idol-like" release, City of Voices takes place in suburban England, and focuses on a young girl who on her first day at secondary school gets bullied. If that wasn't enough to deal with, she is soon "thrust into a fantastical adventure", putting even more on her plate.</p>

<p>Like the Golden Idol games, City of Voices will similarly challenge players to "investigate a series of moments frozen in time, examining clues and solving deduction puzzles to uncover a rich story". However, in a change from the Golden Idol games, players will instead need to answer questions by choosing from a selection of images (see below), rather than dragging and dropping words into place.</p>
<p>If this sounds like City of Voices is still treading <em>a little too closely</em> to the Golden Idol formula, don't worry. Ackermann made sure he got the blessing from their creators before cracking on with his own game.</p>
<p>"I was quite nervous about asking Andrejs and Ernests, who co-created those games, for permission to essentially steal their mechanics," Ackermann admitted, "but luckily, they were flattered!"</p>
<p>Frith added: "Since then, they've both been really supportive, and have even said they 'loved every minute of the demo' we've made, which means so much to us. We hope other players will feel the same way."</p>
<p>There isn't currently a release date for City of Voices, but it is available to wishlist now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3342470/City_of_Voices/">Steam</a>. You can check out a trailer for it above.</p>

<p>As for The Rise of the Golden Idol, we awarded it four out of five stars on its release.</p>
<p>"This is a brilliantly plotted thriller story stuffed with an enormous cast of memorable scoundrels, buffoons and quietly tragic onlookers, and it's all backed up by wonderfully devised puzzles that really give your brain a good runaround before you're able to prise open its hard-won secrets," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-review">Eurogamer's Rise of the Golden Idol review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Apple has reportedly ceased production of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-unveils-3499-augmented-reality-vision-pro-headset">expensive £3500 Vision Pro headset</a>, as unsold stock has piled up.

According to sources, Apple component manufacturers had supplied enough parts for at least 500k Vision Pro headsets by October 2024, but had only actually sold around 370k. This had left "tens of thousands of undelivered parts" still awaiting use.
</p>
<p>
Apple reportedly believes it has now manufactured enough components to meet the Vision Pro's overall expected lifetime sales, which are lower than expected.
</p>
<p>
These numbers roughly tally with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-reportedly-scales-back-sales-target-for-3499-vision-pro-headset-due-to-production-difficulties">report published by the UK's Financial Times last summer</a>, in which components suppliers claimed they expected to produce fewer than 400k units of the Vision Pro by the end of last year.

<p>
That same report claimed Apple had significantly scaled back its internal sales targets for the headset due to production difficulties, after previously expecting at least 1m sales in 2024.
</p>
<p>
Apple has reportedly struggled to easily produce the Vision Pro's two micro-OLED displays for each eye, as well as the device's outward facing lens. 
</p>
<p>
The Vision Pro's cost - around 10 times that of Meta Quest VR headsets - has likely also been a factor, placing the device out of reach of many VR enthusiasts. And while Apple still reportedly has plans to follow the Vision Pro with further devices, the company is still to make its usage case clear.
</p><p>
Apple describes The Vision Pro as a "spatial computer" that "seamlessly blends digital content with your physical space" and navigate apps or media via voice commands, eye tracking, and hand tracking. Some "spatial games" are also supported, including What the Golf?, Game Room, and Super Fruit Ninja - you can see that in action above.

            <p>The Fantastic Four are on their way to Marvel Rivals.</p>
<p>Whilst it's yet to be formally confirmed when Mister Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, the Human Torch, and the Thing will arrive in the free-to-play hero PvP shooter, a teaser posted to X told fans to expect more in a new trailer dropping on Monday, 6th January, just ahead of Season 1's launch on 9th January.</p>

<p>Also included in the promo art is H.E.R.B.I.E., Marvel's Humanoid Experimental Robot, B-Type, Integrated Electronics.</p>
<p>This may not be a surprise for some given The Fantastic Four have long been rumoured to be on the way following datamines that even precede the game's full launch. It's fair to say, however, that some didn't expect their arrival quite so soon.</p> <div>

<p>The timing also ties in nicely with the release of the next Marvel movie, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, which is slated to release on 25th July, 2025.</p>
<p>Expect more information when the trailer drops next week.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-review">Eurogamer's Marvel Rivals review</a>, Chris awarded it two stars out of five, saying, "NetEase's spin on the hero battler is complex and moreish, but rarely much actual fun. Its biggest impact is a renewed appreciation for the rivals that do it better".</p><p>"I like the invention of special character team-ups, which feels perfectly Marvel in itself. I like the enduring sense of competition it inspires. I just don't truly like much else. The end result is a game that, above all, makes the success of its own rivals much more clear to me."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-opening-weekend-sees-10m-players-join-in">Marvel Rivals has proven incredibly popular</a> since its launch at the start of the month. Its opening weekend saw 10 million players join online.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> has reached another sales milestone, years after its initial release.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/press/">developer</a>, as of December last year, the farming sim has sold in excess of 41m copies across platforms. Of those 41m, over half are on PC, with 26m copies sold. Meanwhile, the Nintendo Switch accounts for 7.9m Stardew Valley sales.</p>

<p>This latest sales figure means that Stardew Valley has sold a further 11m copies in less than a year.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1762195335936627147">February of last year</a>, creator  Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone revealed his game had moved more than 30m copies since launch. Even then, that number was impressive, but clearly the appeal of pixelated chickens and crops is still enough to entice even more players to take to the farm.</p><p>It is worth noting that last year, Barone also released Stardew Valley's bumper 1.6 update, which essentially boosted the game to an almost 2.0 status. This update introduced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-will-soon-let-players-drink-mayonnaise">ability for players to drink mayonnaise</a>, among a vast number of other features such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">new NPC dialogues, home renovations and turtle pets</a>. This update was released on PC first, before becoming available across all platforms.</p>
<p>As for the future, Barone is also working on his next game: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>. In May of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-creator-wont-rush-haunted-chocolatier-better-to-have-a-good-delayed-game-than-a-bad-game-on-time">Barone said he's "not too concerned with the pressure" of releasing Haunted Chocolatier</a>, stating, "it's better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time".</p>
<p>In the meantime, if it is more Stardew Valley you are after, a new concert <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-symphony-of-seasons-concert-tour-announced-coming-to-the-uk-in-2026">known as Symphony of Seasons</a> was announced in November. The concert tour will be coming to the UK in 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The yearly speedrunning superstream <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/awesome-games-done-quick">Awesome Games Done Quick</a> is starting this weekend, and it's set to be a musical one. The events will include a player who will beat a set of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> boss battles using a saxophone as a controller, and 16 minutes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a> with a live backing band rocking out as the driver collects their fares. Other notable events will see two players storming through The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild while sharing a single joypad, and an amorous attempt to clear "all romances" in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> within 30 minutes - wait, there are romance options in New Vegas?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ah, I totally forgot there are <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Fallout:_New_Vegas_sleeping_partners">eight named characters</a> in Bethesda's radioactive wasteland with which you can do the horizontal hip hooray. Including one robot called "Fisto". Well, you can look forward to that on Thursday. The festival of nippy nonsense starts on Sunday 5th and runs until Sunday 12th. A whole week of saxy shennanigans. You can see the full schedule <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/52">on the Games Done Quick website</a>.</p>
<p>The appearance of Crazy Taxi during the speedrunning fest might be inspired by news of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/that-crazy-taxi-reboot-will-apparently-be-a-triple-a-game">an upcoming reboot</a>. And the musical accompaniment may include some old favourites from the original soundtrack. Long-toothed taxi drivers will remember the Dreamcast and arcade versions had a punk rock OST with lots of Offspring and Bad Religion, but those songs <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbla-psn-crazy-taxi-drops-soundtrack">got removed in later editions</a> of the game due to licensing rights. </p>
<p>However! You can see how the band scheduled for Awesome Games Done Quick performs the Offspring track "Way Down The Line" in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1sjLtAk3EU">this submission video</a>, which they performed alongside a playthrough from a player's previous speedrun. They even change some of the lyrics to jokily reference speedrunning. And I enjoy the way they cut off abruptly every time the game timer runs out and the menu pops up. </p><p>As for the jazzy side of things, you might have already seen the saxophonist "Dr Doot" completing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAhTPRQkHdE">a no-hits run of Elden Ring</a> on his own time. This time he'll face a "controlled" set of bosses. It is very satisfying to hear the brassy doots and swoots as he calmly rolls away from danger.</p>
<p>Some newer games are also on the roster. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/windblown">Windblown</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake will all see speedruns of various kinds. Some ambitious folks are also planning to nip through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ufo-50">UFO 50</a>, with the organisers allocating 50 minutes to the retro collection. Does that mean they'll spend one minute on each game? Or maybe they're planning to complete as many games in the compilation as possible? I don't know. But it could be an interesting one. </p>
<p>The Games Done Quick organisers regularly raise <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gdq-founder-steps-down-after-13-years-and-more-than-41-million-raised">millions of dollars for charity</a> in their bi-annual events. This year they're once again supporting the Prevent Cancer Foundation. Last year's Summer Games Done Quick (the beshorted beachy brother of the classic January event) saw a Sekiro player interrupted during a speedrun by that most baffling of Windows interruptions - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/even-sticky-keys-cant-stop-sekiro-master-and-other-speedrunners-from-raising-25-million-for-summer-games-done-quick">sticky keys</a>. But it didn't stop the shinobi slashing from tipping the event over the $2.5 million mark.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>How would a younger me react to the concept of game seasons? "Leave me alone, please. I’m busy replaying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suffering">The Suffering</a> 2 for the sixth time to see a new 15 second cutscene that recognises which combination of morally aligned beginnings and endings I’ve picked. It reads your save from the first game and everything!". Say ‘memory card’ to a youthful, broccoli-maned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite </a>enjoyer nowadays. Go on, I dare you. You’ll be in a home before you know it.</p>
<p>Still, having new toys at regular intervals is one real upshot of our new live-service barrage of ephemeral novelty, perpetually flung at my dizzy eyeballs like gleaming carnival daggers at exhausted spinning wheels. Especially if they’re for the exquisite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabellum">Mechabellum</a>. Season 2 released yesterday alongside <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/669330/view/515196931452962768">patch 1.2</a>, bringing with it a new unit and specialist, some reworks, and lots of cosmetic bits I pretend not to care about but then get excited when I unlock a new one.</p>

<p>The new unit is the Raiden, a giant flyer that fires three bolts of lightning at once at different targets. It’s good at fighting medium units. There are also reworks for the Sabertooth (new model, a new tech) and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overlord">Overlord</a>, which is now “larger, stronger, and more expensive”. Death Knell is a new, scarier version of my beloved large laser boy Melting Point, but is only available in the Brawl and Survival modes, which I don’t play. An actual, tangible tactical thought I often have in Mechabellum when considering my formation is "it needs more pew!", so I might have to branch out.</p>

<p>But the star of the show is surely the new specialist, mostly because of how utterly haunted he looks from his years of service in the mechanised forever wars. The Intensive Training Expert gets an extra 50 supplies in the first round, plus a free intensive training upgrade. That’s the one that levels up a unit. In part, Mechabellum is a game of deciding how much time to dedicate catching up and responding to your opponent’s specific chain of cascading power spikes, so I’m interested to see how much this deeply troubled war bastard will affect things.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mechabellum-review">my review</a> of Mechabellum, which I slapped a Bestest Best on. Here’s the paragraph I feel sums the game up best:</p>
<blockquote><p>Its truest joys lie in wanton destruction; so unbelievably tactile for a game in which not a single shell casing is spent without minutes between the locked-in trigger pull and muzzle flare’s crescendo. Watching for weak spots, applying the thriftiest dash of pressure without overextending, and watching entire flanks crumble as several rounds of planning pay off - planning that might just have looked like panicked flailing to your opponent. Having the merest snack-sized premonition of a hunch vindicated as you scry the patterns in your foe’s placement, and having already answered their plan with a hearty “not today, fucko” before they’ve even got close to pulling it off.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fun robots big. Big robots fun.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[More People Play PvE in Tarkov Than You’d Think]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-player-numbers-nikita/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/more-people-play-pve-in-tarkov-than-you%E2%80%99d-think.1073175/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-player-numbers-nikita/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games introduced PvE to Escape from Tarkov a few months back, and it was a divisive decision that was met with mixed reviews. Many hardcore players claimed it was stripping ‘the point’ out of Escape from Tarkov, while the more casual players welcomed the change with open arms – once they’d <strong>bought </strong>the mode, of course.</p>



<p>In the Tarkov community, playing PvE is somewhat stigmatised. It’s often met with jibes from the more skilled players claiming that it’s ‘the easy way out’, or something similar. However, in a recent revelation, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov highlighted just how many people play PvE – and the number will surprise you.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-even-stevens">Even Stevens</h2>



<p>During a recent Tarkov TV stream, Nikita – the head of the studio at Battlestate Games – got onto the topic of PvE player numbers. It has long been thought that PvE gamers represent the minority in Escape from Tarkov, and while that’s true sometimes, it was proven by the numbers that things balance out over time.</p>



<p>Nikita said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At the start of a wipe, 15 – 20% of players choose PvE, and 80% go for PvP. However, as the wipe progresses, the player ratio becomes roughly 50/50%.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When the ‘wipe’ hits Tarkov – as it did a week ago – hundreds of thousands of players come flooding back to see what’s new and to kickstart an all-new playthrough, taking on the early-game tasks once again. However, the player count dwindles over time, as do other elements like viewership.</p>



<p>It can become stagnant within a month or two, with many players drifting off as the power players become established. Before long, it’s seen as being ‘too late’ to start the wipe, given that you’d be coming in as a fresh player against high-level opponents with the best weapons and armour.</p>



<p>The endgame loop also gets tiring for those who make it there as quickly as possible. Once the core tasks are completed and all the boxes have been ticked, it’s an endless grind of daily and weekly challenges and fruitless PvP battles.</p>



<p>The answer? It’s PvE.</p>



<p>By playing PvE, you access a more balanced playing field – perhaps an <strong>easy </strong>playing field. It’s a great introduction to Escape from Tarkov’s maps, modes, and mechanics, and in PvE, all you’re missing is real-world opponents. Aside from that element, everything else is effectively identical.</p>



<p>As the wipe goes on, 50% of Escape from Tarkov’s players gravitate towards PvE, and that’s a huge figure. Are you one of them? Let us know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/epic-games-store-hell-let-loose-free-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-of-the-most-realistic-ww2-games-ever-made-is-free-on-epic-games.1073172/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/epic-games-store-hell-let-loose-free-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Hell Let Loose is available for free as the latest giveaway game on Epic Games on PC. It follows on from a giveaway that featured Kingdom Come Deliverance, and it’ll be replaced on January 9 by Turmoil – so get it while you can.</p>



<p>In 2019, Hell Let Loose dropped to a solid reception, presenting players with one of the grittiest and most grounded WW2 experiences in modern gaming.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-war-is-hell">War is Hell</h2>



<p><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/hell-let-loose-03f036" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hell Let Loose</a> is the latest free Epic Games title, available now through January 9.</p>



<p>It’s one of the most heart-pounding FPS titles you’ll ever play, and it’s perfect with friends. It’s a hyper-realistic WW2 title featuring real theatres of war and iconic battles, and at the heart of the game sits a slew of real-world weapons, items, vehicles, and tactics.</p>



<p>Here’s a trailer for the game to give you an idea of what you’re getting into:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="HELL LET LOOSE | The Eastern Front Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3hLu58KXg8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>This is the last giveaway of the festive period for Epic Games, but it’s not the last giveaway, period. As usual, the platform provider will go on to reward users with free games on a regular rotation, and that’s where Turmoil comes into play on January 9.</p>



<p>For now, you’re free to explore Hell Let Loose and all it offers. Fair warning before you invest, though – it’s best played with a microphone for communications, many players treat it way more seriously than your average shooter, and it’s <strong>hard as nails</strong>. In most cases, you’ll die to a single, unseen shot from a treeline somewhere as you power across the battlefield.</p>



<p>Have fun!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Our Most Wanted Games of 2025 – #45 to #41]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/03/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-45-to-41/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-%E2%80%93-45-to-41.1073169/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/03/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-45-to-41/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We are back with our next batch of games that we are looking forward to in 2025. Today, it is number 46 to 41, covering a range of tastes and styles. There’s racing, management, and a whole load of killing. Buckle up!</p>
<h2>45 – Kingmakers</h2>
<p><em>PC (Early Access) – Q1 2025</em></p>
<p>The Medieval Era was a time of war of much warfare across the world, as different people vied for power and thrones. It would have been brutal and the only thing that would have made medieval warfare more brutal is guns. Kingmakers takes players back 500 years to medieval England, arming them with guns to change the course of history in attempt to stop the apocalypse in the future.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingmakers | Winter Games Expo Trailer - Early Access Release in Q1 2025 AD" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXujvsd9C58?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Kingmakers mixes the action with strategy, as you will have a medieval army at your back. You will control where units go to head off enemy forces. To help them you have access to vehicles too, including a truck and an attack helicopter. Kingmakers will also have solo and co-op play too, and it is due out in Q1 2025 for PC.</p>

<h2>44 – Football Manager 2025</h2>
<p><em>PC, PS5, XSX|S, NSW, iOS, Android – March 2025</em></p>
<p>Football Manager 2025 is a departure for the long running management for a couple of reasons. First, it is actually releasing in the same year as its title, purely down to delays. Second, it is the start of a new era as the series is moving to the Unity engine. That means there are a number of changes coming to the series as a result.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 25 | The New Era | #FM25 Official Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ob06By9TFOA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First let’s talk about changes. The user interface is going to change to be more modern. Goodbye inbox and hello to more messaging instead.Women’s football is also being added to the game as well. Due to the change in engine, there are some features missing too. International management will not be part of the game, and touchline shouts have also gone, as well as create a club, challenge mode, and versus mode. The Premier League license has been acquired though. The game is due out in March.</p>
<h2>43 – Killing Floor 3</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – March 2025</em></p>
<p>Killing Floor 3 was announced in 2023, and it is coming nine years after Killing Floor 2. Much like the previous games, players will team up to take on an undead army of Zeds. Killing Floor 3 is set 70 years after Killing Floor 2, and the world is overrun by the Zeds. Players are part of the rebel group known as Nightfall.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Killing Floor 3 - Game Awards Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NE0qVN3ua4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Teams of five will face the relentless waves of Zeds, unlocking skills and weapons to survive the dystopian setting. Some of the classes confirmed are the medic, the sharpshooter, and the ninja, There will be some closed beta tests ahead of Killing Floor 3’s full launch in March, and you can sign up for your chance to take part on the <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/#signup">Killing Floor 3 website.&nbsp;</a></p>
<h2>42 – Assetto Corsa EVO</h2>
<p><em>PC (Early Access) – 16th January 2025</em></p>
<p>Much like the name suggests Assetto Corsa EVO is an evolution for the racing simulation franchise, as it will have an open world. This open world is set in the region of the Eifel region of Germany, home to the world famous Nürburgring. The map will eventually grow to cover 1600 square kilometers, all of which laser scanned to recreate an accurate portrayal of the region.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Assetto Corsa EVO Announcement Trailer [PEGI]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0uOkigs9hnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Much like its predecessors, Assetto Corsa EVO will feature a range of cars, including road cars, classics, hypercars, and race cars. Each one of these have been recreated digitally using laser scans to make sure all of their details will be captured right down to the smallest.</p>
<h2>41 – Orcs Must Die: Deathtrap</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – 28th January 2025</em></p>
<p>Orcs Must Die: Deathtrap is one of the other earliest games on our release list, coming out later this month. Much like the previous games in the serious, players will be fighting waves and waves of orcs. You are one of the War Mages, each of which have their own skills to master. You can play the game solo or co-op of up to four players.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap - Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y720yo-w24Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Another new addition to the series through Orcs Must Die: Deathtrap are the roguelite build options, meaning no runs will be the same as another. There will be random buffs and debuffs that will impact heroes, traps, weapons, stats, and the levels as well. These will stack too and you will have to decide to keep pushing forward or go back to the castle to improve your character and their stats.</p>
<p><em>Join us next time to look at what games were the first to make the top 40. You can check out our Most Wanted #50 to #46 here.</em></p>

As spotted <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/new-geforce-rtx-50-design-teased-by-nvidia-dual-front-fans-and-led-strip">by <em>VideoCardz</em></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyM_5r3ApEs">a video</a> for Nvidia’s upcoming LAN party includes brief look at a shadowy PC that will be given as a prize, and if you brighten up the image, the GPU in the computer appears to be one that’s a new design.</p><p>See for yourself — I’ve included an image of the shadowed version at the top of this post, but here’s our take at tweaking the image to reveal what’s hidden:</p><div><p><cite>Image: Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>I’ll admit I am not an expert in GPU designs, but <em>VideoCardz</em> says the design is “unfamiliar” and that an RTX 5080 or 5070 Ti could be “among possible candidates” of what’s being shown.</p><p>Leaks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/17/24323555/leak-nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-5070-ti-5070-neural-rendering">last month</a> from Zotac and Acer indicated that Nvidia may reveal as many as five RTX 50 series GPUs very soon, including an RTX 5090, an RTX 5080, and an 5070 Ti. <em>VideoCardz</em> also reported today on a leak of <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/msi-geforce-rtx-5080-gpu-has-been-leaked-16gb-gddr7-and-256-bit-confirmed">an RTX 5080 from MSI</a> featuring 16GB of GDDR7 memory.</p><p>And Nvidia isn’t being particularly secretive about the potentially imminent launch of the RTX 50-series GPUs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-wins-igns-2024-peoples-choice-tournament<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The tournament started with 64 entries and crowned one fan-voted champion.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There were some incredible games released this year, and we wanted to know which you thought was the best of the best. So with our partners at Truth, we picked 64 of 2024’s best games, put them in a head-to-head tournament, and gave you the power to vote for your favorites. After six rounds of voting and more than 1 million votes in all, one game reigned supreme as champion: Black Myth: Wukong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An action game from developer Game Science, Black Myth: Wukong is inspired by the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. You play as the Destined One, an anthropomorphic monkey based on Sun Wukong from the novel. You wield a staff with different stances, have access to several magic spells, and can transform into enemies after defeating them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc"><u>IGN’s review</u></a>, we cited its fantastic combat, beautiful environments, and well-designed bosses as the areas where it shines. While it may not be a soulslike, its combat can be quite challenging and forces you to weave together quick reflexes, smart resource management, and versatile attacks to take down its many bosses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Myth: Wukong’s popularity was obvious from the very start of our fan-voted tournament. It had a dominant run, culminating in a win over Marvel Rivals in the final with 59% of the vote. Before that, it had to get through Harry Potter: Quidditch Championship, Star Wars Outlaws, Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, Stellar Blade, and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, beating all of them with at least 67% of the vote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals’ run to the final was more contested, with it barely beating out the Silent Hill 2 remake in the semifinals and Astro Bot in the quarterfinals, which was one of the closest matchups of the whole tournament. There were more than 50,000 votes cast in that matchup, and Marvel Rivals won by only 960. Before those close calls, it had to get through some stiff competition in World of Warcraft: The War Within, Batman: Arkham Shadow, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-game-of-2024"><u>pick for Best Game of 2024</u></a> went to Metaphor: ReFantazio, but it didn’t make it out of the first round of the People’s Choice Tournament. Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership took it down before falling to Black Myth: Wukong in its path to the title. Indie darling Balatro, one of IGN’s runners-up for Best Game of 2024 and winner of our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pc-game-of-2024"><u>Best PC Game of 2024 Award</u></a>, also had a surprisingly short run. After narrowly defeating Still Wakes the Deep in the first round, it got only 26% of the vote in Round 2 against Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 had a very impressive run overall, taking down multiple big names on its way to the Final Four. In addition to its resounding win over Balatro, it also defeated Sons of the Forest, Dragon’s Dogma 2, and Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth, another of IGN’s runners-up for Best Game of 2024. The other member of the Final Four was Silent Hill 2, which won the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-horror-game-of-2024"><u>IGN Award for Best Horror Game of 2024</u></a>. It got to the semifinals by going through Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, Helldivers 2, Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD, and Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thank you to the many people who logged votes in this year’s People’s Choice Tournament. Let us know in the comments below what you think of the outcome. If you disagree with the winner, which game would you have chosen? And here’s to another great year of gaming in 2025!</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/these-are-the-lasting-things-that-half-life-2-gave-us-besides-headcrabs-and-crowbars/">more than two decades since <em>Half-Life 2</em></a>'s release have been filled with plenty of rumors and hints about <em>Half-Life 3</em>, ranging from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/valve-secrets-spill-over-including-half-life-3-in-new-steam-documentary-app/">official</a>-<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/valve-half-life-alyx-is-not-the-end-of-the-franchise/">ish</a> to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/half-life-3-totally-absolutely-confirmed-by-hidden-dota-2-update-file/">thin</a> to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/mysterious-black-mesa-website-says-its-not-secretly-working-on-half-life-3/">downright</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/10/valve-registers-european-trademark-for-half-life-3/">misleading</a>. As we head into 2025, though, we're approaching something close to a critical mass of rumors and leaks suggesting that <em>Half-Life 3</em> is really in the works this time, and could be officially announced in the coming months.</p>
<p>The latest tease came just before the end of 2024 via <a href="https://x.com/mikeshapiroland/status/1874213952680607922">a New Year's Eve social media video</a> from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0788587/">G-Man voice actor Mike Shapiro</a>. In the voice of the mysterious in-game bureaucrat, Shapiro expresses hopes that "the next quarter century [will] deliver as many <em>unexpected surprises</em> as did the millennium's first (emphasis added)... See you in the new year."</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="und"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Valve?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Valve</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Halflife?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Halflife</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GMan?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GMan</a> #2025 <a href="https://t.co/mdT5hlxKJT">pic.twitter.com/mdT5hlxKJT</a></p>
<p>— Mike Shapiro (@mikeshapiroland) <a href="https://twitter.com/mikeshapiroland/status/1874213952680607922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The post is all the more notable because it's Shapiro's first in over four years, when he concluded a flurry of promotional posts surrounding the release of <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> (many of which were in-character as G-Man). And in 2020, just after <em>Alyx</em>'s release, Shapiro <a href="https://www.vg247.com/mike-shapiro-voice-of-the-g-man-says-the-next-game-hes-in-will-be-like-seeing-an-old-friend-again">told USGamer</a> that he had recently worked on a "blast from the past" project that he would "announce... on my Twitter feed when I'm allowed to" (no such announcement has been forthcoming for any other game).</p>
<p>"I was working on that game for quite a while before I knew [what it was]," Shapiro said at the time of the unannounced project. "There was a rehearsal and some recordings, and after one of the recording sessions I was having a drink with the director. He told me what the game was, and nobody knows that this is coming.</p>
<p>"This is going to be such a mindblowing re-up from what people have come to know," Shapiro continued in 2020. "It's going to really... it's going to make people have a complete re-understanding of what they thought they knew about the story in the game prior to it, and I don't even know if people are expecting it."</p>
<h2>Raised HLX-pectations</h2>
<p>On its own, a single in-character post from a voice actor would probably be a bit too cryptic to excite <em>Half-Life</em> fans who have seen their sequel hopes dashed so often over the last two decades. But the unexpected tease comes amid a wave of leaks and rumors surrounding "HLX," an internal Valve project that has been referenced in a number of other Source 2 engine game files recently.</p>

<p>Betting in Counter-Strike has been a major factor of the game’s incredible growth, especially since the introduction of skins to CS:GO. The betting scene in Counter-Strike has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-csgo-and-cs2-skin-gambling-legal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gone through many changes</a>, but there’s still plenty of opportunities available to those (of legal age) who want to play.</p>



<p>These tips for betting on Counter-Strike aren’t going to tell you the teams or players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-bet-on-counter-strike-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can reliably bet on</a>. Instead, these tips will go over the best practices for betting on Counter-Strike, so that you can play safely and responsibly.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-tips-for-betting-on-counter-strike">Best tips for betting on Counter-Strike</h2>



<h3 id="h-bet-responsibly">Bet responsibly</h3>



<p>Playing responsibly when betting on Counter-Strike should be considered a rule instead of a tip. Gambling and betting can be fun, but it can also be addictive and costly if you don’t play smart. </p>



<p>Here are some essential guidelines for betting responsibly on Counter-Strike, or any game.</p>



<p><strong>Never bet more than you’re comfortable losing.</strong> This is the golden rule of betting. Placing large wagers that promise large payouts can be tempting, but if things don’t go your way, you could end up losing too much.</p>



<p><strong>Learn proper bet unit size.</strong> Knowing how much to bet is crucial to playing responsibly and sustainably. To do this, you’ll need to establish your bankroll.</p>



<ul>
<li>A bankroll is the amount of money you set aside to bet with for a specific amount of time. This can either be for a season, a month, or even a year.</li>



<li>Your bankroll determines your unit size, which is how much you bet with. For example, if you have a $100 bankroll set aside for a month, your unit size should be $1 or $2.</li>
</ul>



<p>The type of bet you place will influence the unit size you use. On a relatively safe bet with lower odds, you should bet one or two units. But for more higher risk wagers, like multi-leg parlays or longshot bets, you should be betting fractions of a unit.</p>



<h3 id="h-take-advantage-of-all-the-sites-available">Take advantage of all the sites available</h3>



<p>There are a number of websites that offer the opportunity to bet on Counter-Strike. These sites consist primarily of esports-focused sites where you can bet on professional match outcomes, and skin gambling sites. </p>



<p>Regardless of which kind of betting you’re more interested in, here are some tips for making the most out of all the sites available.</p>



<ul>
<li>Compare sites to find the best odds. When betting on Counter-Strike matches, differing sites may offer better or worse odds for the outcome you’re betting on. Taking the extra time to find the site with the best odds is worth the reward if your be hits.</li>



<li>Take advantage of sign-up/deposit bonuses. If you’re just getting into Counter-Strike betting now, there are number of sites that will offer bonuses for signing up or placing your first deposit (sometimes you’ll need a promo code). Make sure you read the full details before depositing, but taking advantage of a bonus should reward you with some additional funds.</li>
</ul>



<p>With any site though, make sure it’s a reputable, trustworthy site before you sign up or do anything else. </p>



<p>What are your thoughts on betting on Counter-Strike? Join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>



<p><em>If you’ve got spare CSGO or CS2 skins and you’re feeling lucky,&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;(18+ only)</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/someone-made-a-captcha-where-you-play-doom-on-nightmare-difficulty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>It's a WebAssembly application, but it was made via a human language, prompt-driven web development tool called <a href="https://v0.dev/">v0</a> that's part of a suite of features offered as part of Vercel, a cloud-based developer tool service, of which Rauch is the CEO. You can see the LLM bot chat history with the <a href="https://v0.dev/chat/4X85A52Dzde#vZBwKTIde4ZPopW5ExYEzIi38oM6vJzm">series of prompts</a> that produced this CAPTCHA game on the v0 website.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, there has been a past attempt at making a <em>Doom</em> CAPTCHA. In 2021, developer Miquel Camps Orteza made <a href="https://vivirenremoto.github.io/doomcaptcha/">an approximation of one</a>—though not all the assets matched <em>Doom</em>, and it was more <em>Doom</em>-adjacent. That one was made directly by hand, and its source code is available on GitHub. Its developer noted that it's not secure; it's just for fun.</p>
<p>Rauch's attempt is no more serious as a CAPTCHA, but it at least resembles <em>Doom</em> more closely.</p>
<p>Don't expect to be playing this to verify at real websites anytime soon, though. It's not secure, and its legality is fuzzy at best. While the <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM">code</a> for <em>Doom</em> is open source, the assets from the game like enemy sprites and environment textures—which feature prominently in this application—are not.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-announces-new-rules-for-golden-demon-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has announced Golden Demon 2025. The official <em>Warhammer</em> miniature painting competition will return this year with changes to its various categories and awards.</p>

<h2>The Golden Demon 2025 Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/6vp4sdtr/golden-demon-2025-the-prestigious-painting-competition-returns-to-adepticon-with-a-new-category-and-new-awards/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Warhammer-Community</a> post, the first leg of Golden Demon 2025 will happen at this year's AdeptiCon, which will be held in the United States at the Baird Centre in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on March 26.</p>

<p>The post continues to describe changes to the competition's different categories. Duel will return as its own category, allowing entrants to showcase fierce battles between two opponents. Furthermore, both <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warcry-briar-and-bone-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warcry</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-grandfathers-gardeners-and-jaws-of-itzl-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer Underworlds</em></a> entries will be entered under the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a> Unit umbrella category.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/golden-demon-2025-category-list.jpg?itok=FZTjEdZe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/golden-demon-2025-category-list.jpg?itok=ImAmsy5X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Otherwise, all other categories of Golden Demon 2025 are unchanged. <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>, the <em>Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-old-world-core-boxes-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer The Old World</em></a>, <em>Warhammer The Horus Heresy</em>, <em>Necromunda</em>, and <em>Blood Bowl</em> are all unchanged.</p>

<p>As for awards, Games Workshop adds some new achievements below the podium. In addition to the Gold, Silver, and Bronze awards, there are Finalist, Commended, and Notable awards. The latter three positions are for entries that have caught the judges' attention. It is a welcome consolation for entries that go that extra mile.</p>

<p>Games Workshop's changes to the Golden Demon continues their active support alongside listening to constructive fan feedback. This includes their update to Golden Demon 2024 entries <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-imposes-golden-demon-ai-ban-preventing-its-use-in-miniature-painting" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">banning AI-generated</a> materials in any submitted entry. This may have been caused by the use of an AI-generated backdrop by 12-time winner Neil Hollis.</p>

<p>Games Workshop will be providing more Golden Demon 2025 details in the lead-up to AdeptiCon. In the meantime, if you have an idea for an entry to submit, the sign-up form is the same as last year on the official <a href="https://citadelcolour.com/golden-demon-2025/" rel="nofollow">Golden Demon</a> website. Potential US winners, you have three months to start assembling and painting.</p>

                <p>The Marvel Universe as we know it started in 1961 with the debut of the Fantastic Four, so it's only fitting that the first post-launch heroes for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-coming-to-consoles-ps5-beta-and-exclusive-spidey-costume-confirmed/1100-6523816/" data-ref-id="1100-6523816">Marvel Rivals</a> are coming from the first family of superheroes. NetEase Games has dropped a teaser image for the Fantastic Four with an announcement that a new trailer is coming on Monday, January 6.</p><p>As with the previous heroes introduced in the game, Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and the Thing have been slightly redesigned to fit in with Marvel Rivals' aesthetic. For example, Mr. Fantastic looks considerably younger and more buff than his comic-book counterpart. Intriguingly, the FF's helper robot, H.E.R.B.I.E., is also prominently featured in the promo art. That's prompted speculation that he could also be a playable character, similar to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-hero-guide/2900-6053/" data-ref-id="2900-6053">Jeff the Land Shark</a>.</p><p>One of the reasons why the FF are getting such a prominent push is that 2025 will mark the team's return to cinemas 10 years after the much-maligned 2015 Fantastic Four reboot. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-fantastic-four-movie-receives-new-subtitle/1100-6525360/" data-ref-id="1100-6525360">The Fantastic Four: First Steps</a> will be the team's MCU debut after alternate versions of Mr. Fantastic and Human Torch had cameos in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness-review-dimension-hopping-horrors/1900-6417872/" data-ref-id="1900-6417872">Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/deadpool-and-wolverine-review-status-quo/1900-6418260/" data-ref-id="1900-6418260">Deadpool and Wolverine</a>, respectively.</p><p>Through January 10, NetEase is giving away a free in-game gift of a chibi version of Galactica <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-celebrating-another-milestone-with-a-free-limited-time-reward/1100-6528532/" data-ref-id="1100-6528532">to celebrate hitting 20 million players</a>. NetEase has also promised that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-will-have-cross-platform-progression-just-not-anytime-soon/1100-6528510/" data-ref-id="1100-6528510">cross-platform progression is in the works</a>. As part of the game's Winter Celebration, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-introducing-jeff-centric-mode-and-new-skins-during-its-winter-celebration/1100-6528501/" data-ref-id="1100-6528501">Marvel Rivals added Jeff's Winter Splash Festival</a>--a 4v4 Arcade Mode.
