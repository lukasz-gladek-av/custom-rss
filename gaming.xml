The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders is Getting a New Ban System, But Players Don’t Think It’s Tough Enough]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ban-system-not-enough/</link>
            <guid>1417837</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders underwent a major update today as Embark Studios delivered Headwinds, the first of <strong>four </strong>content drops coming between now and April. It introduced seven new quests, a minor map condition, two new Augments, and some other bits and pieces. The team at Embark also revealed that, very soon, a new anti-cheat <strong>ban system </strong>will be implemented to combat malicious players.</p>



<p>In a footnote in the patch notes for the recent ARC Raiders update, the team explained that a permaban is the result of a cheating spree, but players don’t think getting to that point is happening <strong>fast enough </strong>for it to be effective.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-arc-raiders-need-tougher-anti-cheat">Does ARC Raiders Need Tougher Anti-Cheat?</h2>



<p>Over the festive period, ARC Raiders players were suffering under the weight of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-worse-than-call-of-duty-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exploits, cheaters</a>, and a bit of content stagnation brought on by everyone at Embark Studios going off on a well-deserved break.</p>



<p>Now that they’re back, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-four-months-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a massive roadmap</a> has been revealed, detailing content up to April 2026.</p>



<p>Today, the first part of that roadmap, an update dubbed ‘Headwinds’, was delivered. It introduced some fresh content, a map condition that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fills Buried City with birds</a>, and seven short new quests for players to conquer. It effectively opens up some of the game’s lore, too.</p>



<p>However, one element in the recent patch notes hasn’t filled players with the joy that the positive notes have.</p>



<p>Almost at the end <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-13-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">of the update</a>, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A three strikes progressive ban system is in the process of being implemented. Bans will progress from 30 days, to 60 and finally a permaban for repeat offenders.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Those who tussled with these more malicious players in recent weeks feel that the ban loop isn’t strong enough for anyone <strong>caught cheating</strong>. The item was subtitled ‘Anti-Cheat’, but it reads like this is a <strong>general </strong>approach to banning players caught breaking the rules, and not <em>just </em>cheaters.</p>



<p>In any case, a cheater being banned for just 30 days feels like little more than a slap on the wrist. The second infraction earns them a 60-day penalty, but it takes <strong>three offences </strong>for them to receive a permanent ban. That’s three times that somebody could be caught <strong>using cheats to manipulate the game </strong>before Embark Studios says, ‘Enough.’</p>



<p>Other extraction shooters, like Escape from Tarkov, issue permanent bans upon <strong>a single detection </strong>of cheating, and they <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-cheaters-banned-battlestate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly reveal which users</a> have been kicked from the game. Sure, they might make a new account and come back, but the strong-arm approach is there at the initial stage.</p>







<p>Do you think ARC Raiders needs tougher anti-cheat, and that Embark Studios is risking displeasing the majority of its userbase? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>Eman Ayaz, the actor believed to be playing Farah in the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake, has said she found out - like the rest of us - that the project had been cancelled online.</p>
<p>"Last week I experienced the most devastating moment of my career," <a href="https://x.com/emanayazz/status/2015623611680210980">Eman Ayaz said in a video shared on X</a>. Her brother messaged her asking if she was okay, which prompted a puzzled response, so he sent her a link to the news and then she realised what was going on. "And that's where I read it has been shelved forever," Ayaz said. "I was just in total shock."</p>

<p>Ayaz, 26 years old, does not name the project she was involved in, for NDA reasons. Nor does she mention Ubisoft or Prince of Persia or Sands of Time. But the timelines match up - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">Ubisoft announced it was cancelling the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake last week</a> - and Ayaz has allegedly retweeted Prince of Persia content on her X account before, though I can't find these tweets - perhaps they have been deleted. That's what <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1qnj46j/after_prince_of_persia_sands_of_time_remake/">people on Reddit seem to suggest</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em>"We were all really looking forward to it being released this year"</em></blockquote>
<p>In her video, Ayaz said this project was "life-changing" for her, because there aren't many big roles for Canadian Pakistanis, who tend to be "unplaceable" from a casting point of view. She said she landed the job three years ago after a "rigorous" audition process and was planning to use its release to springboard a move to the US. This was her stepping-stone moment but now it's not to be.</p>
<p>"I have dedicated the last three years of my life to this project," Ayaz said; she even went as far as acting with a broken foot, apparently. "And I've waited and waited for the day it was finally going to be released and I could finally talk about it." She filmed marketing material recently, she said, within the past couple of months. "We were all really looking forward to it being released this year, so it felt like emotional whiplash to find this out in such a random way."</p>

<p>Because the project has been cancelled, Ayaz can't apparently publicly attach her name to it. "It's just as if it never existed," she said, "which is a hard thing to wrap your head around when it's been your life for so long. This project existed, even if the world never got to see it."</p><p>Ubisoft announced the Sands of Time remake cancellation last week as part of major restructuring at the company, closing two studios, cancelling six projects, and delaying several other games. The Sands of Time remake was the only cancelled game named, and the blanket reason given for the cancellations was the games "do not meet the new enhanced quality [and] more selective portfolio prioritisation criteria". The Sands of Time project had been struggling for a while, however, having been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-details-whats-new-in-its-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">announced in 2020</a> and suffering multiple delays since then.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-reset-wipes-34-off-its-share-price-the-lowest-in-15-years">restructuring knocked a third off of Ubisoft's share price</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-worker-unions-reportedly-vote-to-strike-as-publisher-proposes-200-voluntary-redundancies">strikes are expected in France, where Ubisoft is headquartered</a>, in response to a voluntary redundancy initiative.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terraria">Terraria</a> dev Re-Logic is kicking off 2026 in style with the <em>monster</em> 'Bigger and Boulder' update, rolling out on Switch today.</p>
<p>As is so often the case with Terraria content updates, this is a big one. The headline additions are a new crafting interface and inventory management tweaks, a fresh World Seed menu, and brand new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dead_cells">Dead Cells</a> and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/palworld">Palworld</a> crossover content. Of course, there's much more besides, including improved lighting and language support, new blocks and decor, bonus transformations and more bug fixes than you'd think possible.</p>
<p>The full patch notes for ver. 1.4.5 were shared on the <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-1-4-5-bigger-boulder-available-now.145773/#post-3386339">official Terraria forums</a>, and we have gathered together everything in the 'Content Changes &amp; Additions' section for you to check out below — you'd be here all day if we included the 'Balance Changes' and 'Bug Fixes' too, but those are also available in the forum post for you to read at your own leisure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Hytale,</strong> the <strong>Minecraft-like</strong> MMO that went through a long journey of <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/">the game being acquired by a major publisher</a>, only <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-officially-dead-and-its-studio-disbanded/">to be shut down by said publisher</a>, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-minecraft-like-mmo-resurrected-will-launch-early-access-soon/">saved by its original creators</a>, and finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/long-awaited-minecraft-like-mmo-hytale-launches-early-access/">put in players' hands earlier this month</a>, has reached another milestone, further marking its meteoric resurrection.</p>



<p>The game is officially one of the "<em>fastest-growing mod communities</em>" on the popular mod platform <strong><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/">CurseForge</a></strong>, with Hytale players downloading <strong>more than 10 million mods</strong> for the game, with a little more than <strong>2,000 mod creators</strong> supplying more than <strong>3,000 mods</strong> in just two weeks.</p>



<p>CurseForge has been the official mod platform for Hytale since it launched, and <strong>Hypixel Studios</strong> founder and chief executive officer, <strong>Simon Collins-Laflamme</strong>, even credits the platform as a part of Hytale's success.</p>



<p>"<em>I have no regrets saving Hytale, and that’s entirely because of the community and our partners like CurseForge and Tebex who have made our early access launch a massive success</em>," Collins-Laflamme said in a press release. "<em>We came full circle, starting as modders and turning it into a game. Seeing fans build mods, worlds, and experiences at this scale, just weeks after launch, just validates why rebuilding was worth the risk</em>."</p>



<p><strong>Uri Marchand,</strong> chief executive officer and co-founder of CurseForge's operating company,<strong> Overwolf</strong>, added, "<em>Games are better when players get to create alongside the developers</em>. <em>From teenagers experimenting with the endless UGC possibilities to seasoned modders who have achieved a billion downloads, we’re giving Hytale creators a real path to build, share, and earn from their work through CurseForge and Tebex</em>."</p>



<p>Collins-Laflamme has also been highlighting mods on his personal X (formerly Twitter) account, further reiterating his love for Hytale's foundations as a mod itself.</p>



<figure><p>
https://twitter.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2015578980389212170
</p></figure>



<p>Hytale kicked off to an impressive start, with Hypixel Studios reporting a "<em>very high</em>" number of concurrent users when the game launched earlier this month. Even before it launched, Collins-Laflamme announced that the game had already sold so well on pre-orders alone, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-saved-says-hypixel-founder-studios-dev-costs-next-two-years-funded-by-pre-orders/"><strong>the next two years of development costs</strong> for Hypixel Studios were already funded</a>.</p>



<p>Beyond the mods that Collins-Laflamme has highlighted, its modding community is also already pulling off some incredible feats. One mod that is not yet public but is particularly impressive has <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-crossplay-support-with-minecraft-thanks-to-impressive-mod/">added <strong>crossplay support </strong>between Hytale and Minecraft</a>. Two completely separate (albeit very similar) games, speaking to each other and allowing players in Hytale to play alongside their friends in Minecraft. It'll be even more impressive if/when the mod is made public. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard Removes Text From Steam Linking It To The Creators Of Titanfall]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-removes-text-from-steam-linking-it-to-the-creators-of-titanfall-2000663557</link>
            <guid>1417801</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>From the moment <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguards-small-team-sizes-are-a-problem-2000663511"><em>Highguard</em></a> was revealed in December at the Game Awards, the free-to-play shooter has been marketed as coming from people who helped create and develop <em>Titanfall</em> and its battle royale spin-off, <em>Apex Legends</em>. But now, <em>Highguard</em> seems to be backpedaling away from making that direct connection.</p> <p>On January 26,&nbsp; <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136"><em>Highguard’s</em> big launch day on PC and consoles</a>, the devs quietly made a small but very interesting change to the game’s store page on Steam. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/highguard-from-creators-of-apex-legends-wwphyYY"><em>Highguard’s</em> original Steam description said this</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>From the creators of <em>Apex Legends</em> and <em>Titanfall</em>, comes <em>Highguard</em>: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent.</p></blockquote> <p>But on Monday, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/history/#:~:text=All%20rights%20reserved.-,Change%20U%3A71820520,-23%20hours%20ago">as documented by SteamDB</a>, this was tweaked to remove all mention of <em>Titanfall</em> and its spin-off. Now the store page simply says:</p>

 <blockquote><p><em>Highguard</em> is a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent.</p></blockquote> <p>This is a significant change, considering the very first words we heard about <em>Highguard</em> publicly from Geoff Keighley included direct mention of these EA-published sci-fi shooters and how the studio behind <em>Highguard</em> was made up of former <em>Titanfall</em> devs. <a href="https://youtu.be/twK-acOec9o">Here’s what Geoff said at the 2025 Game Awards before debuting <em>Highguard’s</em> first trailer</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>“Our final world premiere comes from 61 members of the team that built <em>Apex Legends</em> and <em>Titanfall</em>. Four years ago, the principals founded a new, independent studio with the hopes of pushing the shooter genre forward…”</p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/26/highguard-preview/">An <em>Xbox Wire</em> post published on launch day</a> also directly mentions <em>Titanfall</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>. But <em>Highguard’s</em> store pages on the Xbox and PlayStation digital storefronts don’t mention either game or the studio’s connection to them.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted <em>Highguard</em> PR and its devs to find out more.</p> <p>Of course, some are already speculating as to why this change was made. Did EA’s lawyers get involved? Did the devs behind <em>Highguard</em> want to distance the FPS, which is receiving horrible reviews on Steam, from <em>Titanfall</em> and their former colleagues’ work? Or did someone in marketing simply decide the Steam store page text was too long and wanted to shorten it up? We don’t know for now, but either way it is a very curious change and just one more odd development in the <em>Highguard</em> saga.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The routine is familiar by now. A new online shooter with bright, colorful graphics launches and rockets up the charts despite the fact that you maybe haven’t even heard of it. Or maybe it just has a really forgettable name. But everyone seems to be talking about it, and it’s free, so you figure you may as well jump in. This moment of promise and anticipation may end up being the best this game will ever be — and there’s a good chance that feeling won’t last long.</p><p>I could be describing any number of games, but the most recent example is <em>Highguard</em>, which just launched on the PS5, Xbox, and Steam. The 3v3 shooter is the first release from Wildlight Entertainment, a new studio made up of veterans from <em>Apex Legends</em>, <em>Titanfall</em>, and <em>Call of Duty</em>. That pedigree is enough to pay some attention to the game, which was originally revealed as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/841973/the-game-awards-2025-annoucements-news-trailers/archives/2">the final announcement at The Game Awards last month</a>. But it’s also doing some interesting things. The developers call it a “raid shooter,” but I’ve found it easiest to understand as a sort of first-person shooter take on a MOBA like <em>League of Legends</em>; each team has a base, and your job is to balance getting improved gear, protecting your own base, and completing various objectives to take down your enemies’ HQ. Also, you can ride a bear.</p><p>It’s a complicated setup, and after a few matches I’m not entirely convinced I fully understand the flow of matches, which could be a problem for wider adoption. It’s certainly not as pick-up-and-play as something like <em>Fortnite</em>. Though as you’d expect from people who worked on <em>Titanfall</em>, the action feels great, with excellent gunplay and smooth movement. It’s also a hero shooter, so you pick from characters with <em>Overwatch</em>-style ultimate powers that can let you quickly turn a battle in your favor, or smash through your opponents’ defenses. They can be a lot of fun when you pull them off properly.</p><p>When you’re in the midst of a tight skirmish, defending your teammates while they try to defuse a bomb, the appeal of <em>Highguard</em> is apparent. At its best it’s fast and tense and forces you to be decisive. But its complex nature also means that things can feel a little strange and messy. For one thing, the team sizes are small yet the maps are large, and so you spend a good chunk of each match wandering around a mostly empty level searching for chests to improve your armor or find a better gun. You do have a mount to speed this up, but even still, I’ve found the early portions of matches to be incredibly slow and not very exciting.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">As the ill-fated <em>Concord</em> showed</a>, the most important thing for a new online shooter is what it does differently, although even that isn’t a guarantee of success. But you need a hook to compete in a space with such established players as <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Counter-Strike</em>, and the annualized behemoth that is <em>Call of Duty</em>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/795232/ea-battlefield-6-hit-launch-deal"><em>Battlefield 6</em> managed to break through with sheer force of will</a>, while the likes of <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Helldivers 2</em>, and <em>Apex Legends</em> have settled into a seemingly steady place where they aren’t the biggest games, but they have a strong, healthy player base. But the list of failures is also large: <em>Anthem</em>, <em>Spectre Divide</em>, <em>XDefiant</em>, <em>Spellbreak</em>, just to name a few. Many had interesting hooks — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/29/23187883/activision-blizzard-spellbreak-acquisition-battle-royale-world-of-warcraft">It’s <em>Fortnite </em>but fantasy!</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24211078/spectre-divide-preview-mountaintop-fps-game">You can control two bodies at once!</a> — but it wasn’t enough.</p><p>As much fun as I’m having with <em>Highguard </em>during the launch week, I’m also not convinced that its strategic matches, slick gunplay, and oddball fantasy setting are enough for lasting success in such a competitive space. It’s different, but not <em>that</em> different, and it can be hard to explain what it really is. The odds are certainly against it. So for now I’ll just enjoy the experience while it lasts — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/864146/bungie-marathon-release-date-march-5th-price">and be ready to do this all over again in March</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/868558/highguard-online-shooters]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a> developers Red Hook have announced that game files for Mythic's troubled boardgame adaptation will be given away to project backers, after grimly concluding that Mythic are no longer able to manufacture or deliver the thing.
</p>
<p>
The Darkest Dungeon boardgame was Kickstarted in 2020, soaking up $5.7 million in funding. Based in Luxembourg, Mythic Games have done well out of crowd-funding, raising over $19 million in five years, but they have been struggling financially nonetheless. They <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1162110258/darkest-dungeon-the-board-game/posts/3557431">asked DD boardgame backers to chip in more money</a> in 2022, after material and shipping costs spiked amid the Covid pandemic and the opening stages of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Mythic finally went into liquidation this December, reportedly following a criminal investigation into fraudulent behaviour and misappropriation of funds, which was terminated for lack of evidence. The company’s closure has left several projects worth millions of Kickstarter dollars in purgatory. There are many Ancestor quotes we could invoke here, I guess. I'm going with "more dust, more ashes... more disappointment."

</p>
<p>
Prior to biting the dust, Mythic managed to ship the first of two “waves” of Darkest Dungeon boardgame materials to backers. Amid the liquidation proceedings, a representative of the company also told <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/12/10/darkest-dungeon-board-game-maker-mythic-games-officially-liquidated-fails-to-deliver-on-millions-of-dollars-worth-of-crowdfunding-projects/">Board Game Wire</a> that they would provide backers with the STLs – aka, digital 3D models that you can use to print game pieces - for both waves.</p>
<p>This was actually impossible at the time, however, because Mythic don’t own the copyright on Darkest Dungeon's designs, but a former Mythic staffer has now secured permission from Red Hook to share the files.
</p>
<p>
“As many of you know, the financial situation at Mythic Games has been strained for the past several years,” Red Hook <a href="https://www.darkestdungeon.com/news/regarding-mythic-games-and-the-darkest-dungeon-board-game/">write on their official site</a>. “We have been keeping an eye on the situation, hoping for the best. Unfortunately, at this point, Mythic Games is no longer able to manufacture or deliver the Darkest Dungeon board game.
</p><p>
“We put our trust in Mythic Games to deliver on their promises and uphold the Darkest Dungeon name,” the post continues. “We won’t mince words, their collapse and inability to fulfill Wave 2 orders is an enormously disappointing development and we know it deeply affects many Darkest Dungeon fans. 
</p>
<p>
“Recently, we were contacted by an ex-Mythic employee who asked for our blessing to distribute the project files to all backers. While we at Red Hook don't own or control the board game files themselves, we were happy to give our permission for our copyrighted material within those files to be distributed to backers for non-commercial use.”
</p>
<p>
If you backed the Darkest Dungeon boardgame, you should now have an email from the Kickstarter campaign with a link to “all game files, including files of the rules, 3D models and more”. If you haven’t received the email, give darkestdungeonrescuefiles@gmail.com a shout.
</p>
<p>
It’s good that some of the project has been salvaged, but email attachments aren’t a patch on getting a chunky new Crusader figurine in the post. “Unfortunately, Red Hook has neither the board game manufacturing expertise nor have we had the ability to divert funds of the scale required to remove whatever obstacles Mythic has faced without endangering our own operations,” the videogame's creators conclude on their site. “We only hope that this final gesture can be a silver lining in an otherwise disappointing situation.”

            <guid>1417756</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For months ahead of <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>‘s February release date, rumors have persisted that the game is “<a href="https://screenrant.com/resident-evil-9-open-world-rumors-good-bad/">open-world.</a>” That would certainly be a significant shift away from previous games, but it’s not something players should expect from <em>Requiem</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/26/resident-evil-requiem-director-sets-the-record-straight-this-isnt-an-open-world-game">according to director Koshi Nakanishi, who said as much in an interview with <em>Game Informer</em></a>.</p> <p>“[The development team] did just want to make clear one point,” Nakanishi said while speaking to <em>Game Informer</em>. “They’ve seen some speculation of whether there’s any open-world elements in the game, and they just want to set the record straight that this isn’t an open-world game.”</p>

 <p>He continued: “The main concept behind this game is combining the very different gameplay of Grace and Leon into a cohesive package, and having those two gameplays represent the <em>Resident Evil</em> series, and I think when you play the game, you realize that, or you will find as well that the development team picked the best approach to do this.”</p> <p>For years, the industry has been obsessed with open-world design. People want more freedom, more hours, more map. But the notion that <em>Requiem </em>might be an open-world game didn’t sit well with <em>Resident Evil</em> players who love the series’ linear, tightly controlled storylines. The horror of <em>Resident Evil</em> is informed by its design, and an open world would significantly shift the way players experience it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0mgOPbpagc">Footage shown last month of a city street with cars and pedestrians</a> sparked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q5dlc8/resident_evil_requiems_path_tracing_trailer_by/">some of that open-world speculation</a>, which can now be hushed thanks to Nakanishi’s statement to <em>Game Informer</em>. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-the-final-preview">In its <em>Requiem</em> preview, <em>IGN </em>said</a> that Grace’s portions of the game should be “familiar to anyone who has played&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2</em> or&nbsp;<em>7</em>.” Leon’s sections, meanwhile, “stirred up our muscle memory of playing <em>Resident Evil 4</em>,” <em>IGN</em> said.</p>

 <p><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, the ninth mainline game in the franchise, will be released on February 27. Capcom’s last <em>Resident Evil</em> Game, <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, was released in 2021.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>IEM Katowice is officially no more, and the competition has moved to Krakow for 2026. This monumental change seemed drastic at the time, but fans are now readying themselves to visit a new city for this supersized tournament. In this guide, we’re breaking down everything you need to know about IEM Krakow 2026, including the schedule, teams competing, and where to watch it.</p>



<p>If you’re interested in IEM Krakow betting or just want to watch your favourite teams and players enjoying Counter-Strike 2 action live on stream, read on.</p>







<h2 id="h-iem-krakow-2026-schedule-and-location">IEM Krakow 2026 Schedule and Location</h2>



<p>IEM Krakow 2026 will take place at the TAURON Arena in the city of Kraków, Poland. It’s set to run from January 28th to February 8th, and in that time, 24 teams will fight for the lion’s share of a massive $1 million prize.</p>



<p>Here’s the <strong>IEM Krakow 2026 schedule and format:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Play-In Stage</strong></p>



<p>During this stage, 16 teams come together for the Play-In round, which features a double-elimination bracket and a series of best-of-three matches. It’s a whittling round here, and only the top eight will make it through to the next round to face the higher-seeded competitors.</p>



<p><strong>Group Stage</strong></p>



<p>The Group Stage includes the eight successful teams from the Play-In Stage and the eight that had already qualified with a higher seeding for IEM Krakow. The teams will compete along another double-elimination pathway, with each group being made up of eight teams in total.</p>



<p>The Group Stage <strong>winners </strong>go through to the semi-finals, the <strong>runners-up </strong>advance to the Quarterfinals as <em>high seeds</em>, and the <strong>third-place teams </strong>go through to the Quarterfinals as <em>low seeds</em>. Only the top three teams from each group will land in the Playoffs.</p>



<p><strong>Playoffs</strong></p>



<p>The Playoffs will crown the champion at IEM Krakow 2026. This is a single-elimination bracket with a best-of-five grand final that will see six teams fight for the grand prize – $400,000.</p>



<h2 id="h-iem-krakow-2026-teams">IEM Krakow 2026 Teams</h2>



<p>Here is the full list of the teams qualified to compete at IEM Krakow 2026:</p>



<p><strong>Directly Qualified</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Team Vitality</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>



<li>Team Spirit</li>



<li>Natus Vincere</li>



<li>MOUZ</li>



<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>The MongolZ</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Play-In Teams</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Aurora Gaming</li>



<li>B8</li>



<li>Legacy</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>Team Liquid</li>



<li>3DMAX</li>



<li>Astralis</li>

<li>FUT Esports</li>



<li>Ninjas in Pyjamas</li>



<li>Passion UA</li>



<li>BC.Game Esports</li>



<li>NRG</li>



<li>GamerLegion</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-iem-krakow-2026-predictions">IEM Krakow 2026 Predictions</h2>



<p>Team Vitality enters the running as the primary title contender, despite recent losses. For a safe IEM Krakow bet, you’d consider backing them, or for similar odds, Team Spirit. FURIA has been on a resurgence of late, and the Brazilian roster could make for a middle-of-the-road bet if you’re playing outrights.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, a swing-tier squad like Team Liquid and Ninjas in Pyjamas could manufacture an underdog win that could result in a nice return for Counter-Strike betting fans.</p>

<p>It’s time to crawl out through the Fallout one more time with episode 8 of Fallout Season 2. Amazon’s stunning adaptation is reaching its conclusion, and Season 2’s episode 8 release date draws closer than a Bloatfly to your irradiated presence.</p>



<p>The Ink Spots famously sang about not wanting to set the world on fire, and yet, Amazon’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fallout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout</a> adaptation has constantly been on fire. Every episode has knocked it out of the park. Fallout Season 2 has been a joy to watch from start to finish, and the high stakes are about to be raised one more time in New Vegas.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-fallout-season-2-episode-8-coming-out-release-date-explained">When Is Fallout Season 2 Episode 8 Coming Out? Release Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Episode 8 will show great steel once more. Credit to Amazon</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Tuesday, February 3, is the official release date for Fallout Season 2, episode 8.</strong></p>



<p>The last couple of episodes of Season 2 have been rejigged by Amazon slightly. But you have no excuse for missing it now with this information! The reason for Amazon’s tinkering with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-2-episode-7-release-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">episode 7</a> and episode 8 was “Due to strong participation and interest,” which, in short, was to make it available for more regions earlier and cut down on potential spoilers.</p>



<p>No one wants a finale ruined for them, making this a commendable gesture by Amazon.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-season-2-episode-8-start-times-amp-dates">Fallout Season 2 Episode 8 Start Times &amp; Dates</h2>



<p><strong>The United States claims the first release time for Fallout Season 2 Episode 8 with a 6 PM PT start time on February 3. Insider Gaming has also provided more time zones for you to check out, including GMT and AET.</strong></p>



<p>It’s the United Kingdom who are probably most at risk for an episode 8 spoiler due to the 2 AM start time! Whereas many other regions are getting more favorable start times.</p>



<p>Take a look at this table and see when Season 2 episode 8 airs for you.</p>

		<p>The Witcher has no need for Tinder when journeying across the Northern Kingdoms, when he’s caught in a love triangle between Yenn and Triss. Here, though, he is now trapped in the Tinder-like left and right swiping of Reigns: The Witcher. It’s the second crossover spin-off between Reigns’ kingdom management and a popular fantasy series, but there’s a distinctly different set up to this game than before.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, Reigns: The Witcher stars Geralt of Rivia, but where you’d play as the ruler of a kingdom in the earlier games of this series and have to appease and balance the whims and desires of various factions, now you’re playing as an adventuring hero. It’s quite a shift, though Nerial has stuck with a familiar format. Kind of.</p>



<p>Geralt of Rivia isn’t really the most personable of characters. No, he’s not as monstrous and inhuman as the legends that precede him would have the general people believe, but he still needs a strong PR campaign to be seen as more than just a necessary evil. Enter Dandelion to sprinkle a little musical sparkle across his adventures, turning Geralt into a folk hero over time.</p>
<p>At least that’s the plan. with Reigns: The Witcher wrapping up the adventures within the context of Dandelion performing to a packed house. But telling stories of Geralt’s adventures is pretty tricky. You can find yourself down some unusual rabbit holes, lose the consistent narrative threads, and bend the truth a little too far.</p>

<p>The game opens with his first effort, with talking dragons, captured lovers and Geralt being burnt to a crisp, but it’s just an opening gambit, as each successive adventure leads to Dandelion finding new sources of inspiration.</p>

<p>There’s less of a single narrative thread through each play, as you’re still met by individuals that each present you with a binary choice and an instant resolution to their problem or request. A farmer might ask you to lure in a beast to spook his overly milky goats, a noble could want a particular monster’s head to adorn their mantelpiece, some townsfolk might request your help in warding off a siren living in the woods nearby, or some other mythical beast will need defeating. It seems quite rare that a situation will have a direct narrative follow up or counterpoint, and they’re almost always swiped away and resolved without issue.</p>
<p>That’s generally true when dealing with monsters and creatures too –&nbsp;you can choose to tell the siren to leave or lop off their head –&nbsp;but some will rope you into a new combat minigame that completely shifts the pacing of the game. Instead of letting you take your time, now there’s a beat to match and move to in a block-dropping puzzler.</p>

<p>Geralt roams the bottom edge of a 5×5 grid, moving left or right each beat, and all you can do is guide his direction as enemy attacks, offensive strikes and healing potions descend from the top. It’s tricky to get the hang of and need a good bit of foresight to evade some of the trickier formations that emerge. Take too many hits and it’s game over, with Dandelion having to come up with a better story next time.</p>
<p>Most decisions will have an impact to the performance, pleasing or displeasing humans, non-humans, sorcerers and monsters. The goal, as with previous games, is to keep all four of these in balance. Fall too low and Geralt meets a gristly end. Max one of them out and he’s lured into some hedonistic equivalent. You can find yourself backed into a corner,</p>

<p>You also have some added overarching goals with the inspiration points that Dandelion can draw upon. Three cards are drawn at the start, providing buffs and modifiers to make certain groups easier to please, harder to displease, add a bit of romance, or add a murderous lilt as companions can meet an untimely demise at the hands of monsters. Meeting their requirements, whether it’s flirting with people, finding a serial killer, or something else, then adds to the experience Dandelion gets at the end of a tale and his inspiration.</p>
<p>Reigns: The Witcher is an interesting twist and reframing of the simplified kingdom management series. There’s a lot that will remain familiar, a lightness to how quickly you flit between situations with a simple swipe, and plenty of amusing deaths to find. After a fleeting introductory hour and a bunch of early deaths, I’m curious to see how deep Dandelion’s imagination goes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Around two months ago, the <strong>Embracer Group</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-sells-cryptic-studios-arc-games-retains-right-to-remnant-fellowship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold off</a> developer <strong>Cryptic Studios</strong> (the team behind MMO games <strong>Champions Online</strong>, <strong>Star Trek Online</strong>, and <strong>Neverwinter</strong>) and publisher <strong>Arc Games</strong>, which were acquired by members of Arc Games' management team.</p>



<p>Today, Cryptic is announcing that veteran game developer executive <strong>Jack Emmert</strong> has returned to the role of <strong>Chief Executive Officer (CEO)</strong>. Key emphasis on the word returned: Emmert began his career in the gaming industry at Cryptic in 2000, right at the studio's foundation, and was eventually promoted to CEO in 2011. He left the company in December 2015. <span>After a brief stint at&nbsp;<strong>Perfect World Entertainment</strong>, Emmert joined&nbsp;<strong>Daybreak</strong>&nbsp;as CEO, managing the superhero MMORPG&nbsp;<strong>DC Universe Online</strong>&nbsp;and later working on an unannounced MMO when the studio changed its name to </span><strong><span>Dimensional Ink Game</span>s</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/jack-emmert-on-dimensional-inks-total-independence-and-whats-next-for-the-dcuo-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I first interviewed him during this time</a>, just before COVID went global. Back then, the game was unknown; we'd later learn it would have been a superhero MMO based on <strong>Marvel IPs</strong>, but Daybreak <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-mmorpg-canceled-as-investment-is-refocused-on-smaller-projects-based-on-current-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled it in 2022</a>. The following year, Jack Emmert <span>founded a new studio,&nbsp;<strong>Jackalyptic,</strong>&nbsp;with <strong>NetEase</strong>'s help, and </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-mmo-qa-jack-emmert-wants-an-accessible-game-that-represents-the-ip-with-care/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>I interviewed him about an upcoming MMO&nbsp;</span>based on the <strong>Warhammer</strong> franchise</a>. Unfortunately, that game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-warhammer-mmo-is-also-canceled-netease-shuts-down-jackalyptic-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got canceled, too</a>, amid many other projects and studio closures ordered by NetEase.</p>



<p>Now, Emmert comes back home, in a way. As part of the Cryptic news, I've been able to chat with him again about his return to the CEO position and what that means for the games currently managed by the California-based developer.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>Jack, I think the last time we spoke, you were working at Jackalyptic on a Warhammer game. I’m guessing you probably cannot talk about anything that happened there.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> Not really. I loved my time at NetEase and Jackalyptic; everybody was terrific. I have zero hard feelings; NetEase treated us wonderfully. Things didn't work out—that's the game industry. I've been through this rodeo many times before and I have a lot of gratitude. But I have even more gratitude that this opportunity came out of nowhere. Right as one chapter in my life was coming to a close, a brand new one started. It is unbelievable to me that I'm back at Cryptic.</p>



<p><strong>You were there from the beginning as one of the founders. What are your first impressions of being back?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> It’s fascinating. Often as an adult, if I travel back, I find myself reverting into the kid that I was—the old behaviors and the old mannerisms. It's hard to escape. But what's interesting about returning to Cryptic is that I've changed, and so has Cryptic. We're learning about each other for the first time. Some parts are familiar, but most of it isn't. It's fascinating to see how Cryptic grew in my absence. I'm learning so much from the teams and everything that they've accomplished. I'm honored that they would have me back. I hope with all the things that I've learned over the past 10 years that I can bring something new to the table, not just what I was during the first 16 years of my career at Cryptic.</p>



<p><strong>A couple of months ago, Cryptic itself, along with Arc Games, underwent a change in management. Are you 100% in charge of your own destiny?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> Yes, we are. We are 100% in charge of our own destiny. I'm thrilled. I know the guys from Arc Games from back in the Perfect World days; they are super smart. I am absolutely thrilled to be on this journey. Even better, Arc Games is fully committed to Cryptic Studios, and the support that we're getting is incredible. Our teams on all of our games are bigger today than when I left 10 years ago. That shows that Arc really believes that while these games are older, they still have a lot to offer, and they have great fans.</p>



<p><strong>Are you working remotely or are you back in the studio proper?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> I'm working remotely from Austin, Texas. Most of the studio is remote. I'm a big believer in that model; it increases the quality of life a lot. There certainly are challenges with communication, but those are solvable if the team is committed. I think it's the way to go with game development.</p>



<p><strong>As the new CEO of Cryptic, will you oversee all the games closely?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> Absolutely. And I don't just oversee; I’m going to be the games' biggest fan. I've been playing and grinding away in Neverwinter, getting to know the new systems and how content is organized. I'll do the same thing with Star Trek Online and Champions Online. Unless I know those games as a player, I don't really offer much to the teams. I don't know the tools anymore, and if I were just a business CEO, I would just be saying "make more money." Anybody off the street can do that. In order for me to add value, I need to be able to understand those games as a player and contribute meaningfully to decisions on development.</p>



<p><strong>Can you share briefly where the games are at and what's coming next?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> Right now, I'm still coming up to speed, as I only started two weeks ago. My impression is that the teams have very solid plans for content moving forward. I'm not intending to upset those in any way because I think they are good plans. As we start moving further into the future, I'll be collaborating more on what we should do. I'm also highly committed to looking at ways for us to re-engage players who have dropped out. The success of WoW Classic and Guild Wars shows the value of these nostalgic relaunches. Our games have been around for over 15 years now, and there are a lot of people who have played all three of them.</p>



<p><strong>Does that also include Champions Online? It seems Star Trek Online and Neverwinter are updated more regularly. Is that going to change with Champions Online?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> Change happens if there's a demand. If you play Champions and you love it, come back, because Arc is going to give us the support for any game that shows growth. Period. I’m bullish on Champions; we've got some stuff, but we could use you. Come on back, build a champion, and let's make that game great. The superhero MMO niche hasn't really been cornered quite yet; it’s an opportunity for us to do some great stuff together.</p>



<p><strong>Could such opportunities involve being available on more platforms, like the Nintendo Switch 2?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> I'm not going to eliminate any opportunity. We did put DC Universe Online on the Nintendo Switch, so I understand the market to a degree. We'll be looking at any opportunity to get these games in people's hands.</p>



<p><strong>What do you think about the future of the industry? Do you see new investment happening from Western developers in MMOs?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> It would be difficult for anybody to go to a Western publisher and ask for money to develop an MMORPG. The track record with Western publishers and MMORPGs is not very good for a lot of reasons. However, I think there's a lot of opportunity to launch a game that isn't necessarily an MMO at the start, but grows into something. A model like Warframe is a really good one; it is vastly bigger than it ever was when it first launched. That is a direction many games could go. A multiplayer story-based RPG could add an open-world component through an update or expansion. Instead of a hundred-million-dollar investment all upfront, you're making a series of $20 million bets so that at the end of five to seven years you have that big MMO, having paid for it and grown the community along the way.</p>



<p><strong>It's interesting you mentioned Warframe. Greg Street told me the same thing: that Warframe started small and grew over time, and it could be a model for future MMOs.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> I know Greg quite well. I would not be surprised to see someone bootstrap a very small product, get some initial success, and continue to invest in it. Subnautica was like that, too. I think that's where you're going to see the new MMOs. To MMO fans, I'd say be patient; if you support a product and love it, just keep supporting it. It'll get there.</p>



<p><strong>When can players expect the next big updates for Cryptic's games?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> I have a rough idea of the battle plans. I was just reviewing them and I've got some surprises up my sleeve. We will roll them out as soon as we're able to nail down dates.</p>



<p><strong>Can you share the approximate size of each team and whether there is overlap between them?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> In general, I'm not a fan of sharing personnel between teams. I like teams that are dedicated to a product because they know its ins and outs. I can't share exact team sizes as that is confidential information, but they are bigger than when I left. Our licensors, Paramount and Wizards of the Coast, are terrific and they’ve extended their hands to help out with tie-ins and other collaborations.</p>



<p><strong>I recently re-downloaded Neverwinter and noticed that the PC version still doesn't have official controller support, even though the game is available on consoles. Are you going to add it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> That's a great suggestion. I never even thought about it before, but I'll write that down.</p>



<p><strong>A lot of PC players play on gamepads nowadays, and it’s good for accessibility too.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> Absolutely, it's a great idea.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time, Jack, and good luck.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>If you went back in time to January 2025 and told someone that a year from now, <strong>Ubisoft</strong> would <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">undergo a "<em><strong>major reset</strong></em><strong>"</strong> that would change the face and structure of the company</a>, they might not have been too surprised by the news. If you then added that this reset would also include the cancellation of the long-awaited <strong>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-still-in-development-after-ubisoft-major-reset/">while <strong>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</strong> remained in production</a>), that might've caught them off guard.</p>



<p>But that is indeed how things shook out, with the remake indeed cancelled, as Ubisoft ultimately decided it did "<em></em><em>not meet the new enhanced quality</em>" standards it is enforcing in this new era of the company's history. <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/2014018590396105121">A statement shared from the official X (formerly Twitter) account</a> for the Prince of Persia franchise shortly after the official reset announcement claimed that "<em>While the project had <strong>real potential</strong>, we weren't able to reach the level of quality you deserve, and continuing would have required more time and investment than we could responsibly commit<strong>,</strong>"</em> adding that the team did not want to release something they felt fell below players' expectations, and that this cancellation "<em>does not mean we're stepping away from the franchise</em>."</p>



<p>Now, as the dust continues to settle around Ubisoft with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">more layoffs incoming</a></strong> and unions representing Ubisoft employees <a href="https://wccftech.com/french-union-claims-ubisoft-ceo-has-no-knowledge-or-understanding-of-his-company-after-major-reset/">calling for chief executive officer <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong> to recognize that he and the rest of the company's top brass are the issue</a> and not the people who actually make the games, a leaked workshop showcasing an early pre-alpha build of the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake from 2024 has fans mourning the lost project even more.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qob510/prince_of_persia_sot_remake_2024_presentation/">The workshop presentation was initially found on Reddit</a>, though it was quickly copyright-claimed by Ubisoft and has since been taken down. Though not quickly enough, it would seem, as <a href="https://x.com/princeozzyX/status/2016120310559334435">X (formerly Twitter) user princeozzyX</a>, also known under the Prince of Persia Universe handle, compiled specifically the images of art and in-game screencaps that at least one fan called "<em>breathtaking</em>," while others add that the game, even in an unfinished state, already looked "<em>beautiful" </em>and that they are now "<em>even more upset</em>" over its cancellation.</p>

<p>Impressive as these images may look to some, the reality is that we don't know the full story behind the game's cancellation. That said, we can make assumptions about project mismanagement, especially when looking at the game's public history and the fact that the same leadership group that allowed this to happen is also the one that led Ubisoft to lose <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/"><strong>95% of its value in the last eight years</strong>.</a> </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-being-teased-by-ubisoft-listings-surface-on-amazon/">After leaks pointing to its imminent reveal</a>, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-remake-announced/">officially announced the remake in September 2020</a>, with a release date set for early 2021. The reception was less than ideal, with many fans calling out its lacking visuals. But the reality of the time was that we all knew it could get better, so there wasn't too much concern as long as the gameplay was solid.</p>



<p>Months after its reveal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delayed/">its release date was pushed back slightly further into 2021 to March</a>, but before it could reach that March release date, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-was-just-delayed-indefinitely/">Ubisoft announced the game had been delayed indefinitely</a>. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-delay-2022-no-e3-showing/">launch was pushed to 2022</a>, before the project was <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-montreal/">taken from the <strong>Ubisoft Mumbai</strong> and <strong>Ubisoft Pune</strong> studios, who were previously leading it, to <strong>Ubisoft Montreal </strong>in May 2022</a>. Almost a year to date later, in May 2023, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-fully-rebooted/">announced that the game was officially <strong>rebooted</strong> and back in the concept phase</a>.</p>



<p>After that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-has-passed-an-important-milestone-ubisoft-says/">development updates were scarce and vague</a>, and despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-dev-team-adds-ubisoft-toronto-far-cry/">Ubisoft putting more teams on the project</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-details/">the initial look at the graphical overhaul</a> looking promising, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-rumored-to-release-in-january-2026/">with a 2026 release even said to be sometime in January 2026</a>, it was ultimately not enough for Ubisoft to consider putting the game out.</p>

            <p>Well, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shush-helldivers-2s-redacted-regiment-warbond-is-all-about-being-sneakily-stealthy-and-silently-suppressed">last one</a> might have only appealed to folks open to taking on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-gets-new-stealth-missions-today-and-its-super-slimmed-install-size-version-is-finally-ready-to-take-over">a mission that demands a bunch of crouch-walking</a>, but you can't say <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s second warbond of 2026 isn't offering plenty of bang for your buck. It's got an exploding hammer. There's other stuff in this Siege Breakers warbond too, but I'll be honest, none of that can boast being a stick with a thing that goes boom taped to the end.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, let me crack open the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/509603414731131980?l=english">notes</a> for this warbond, which is set to release on February 3rd, and wax lyrical about the CQC-20 Breaching Hammer. To be fair to Arrowhead, they've arguably downplayed it in marketing terms, at least when it comes to wordly description. "This sledgehammer can do straight smashing, or it can have an explosive charge attached to its head to drive the point home," they write.</p>
<p>Ok. Annnnnnnnnnndddd there it is in the trailer being bonked down onto the bonce of an automaton by a diving Helldiver who subsequently disappears in a big exploding cloud of fire and explosions. Naturally, it seems that following a killer blow like that, you can just dust yourself off, stick a new explosive charge to your hammer's head and bash on. All in all, I'd say there's plenty of potential for slapstick antics and kills worthy of being uploaded to YouTube with a title that's just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_t9z9KWZE">Steve Urkel's catchphrase</a> in all caps.</p><p>While we're here, I suppose I'll tell you about the rest of the stuff in Siege Breakers. There's the returning LAS-16 Trident from the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a>, this time with six fireable beams instead of three. Building on the hammer's explodey vibes are a belt-fed grenade launcher dubbed the GL-28 and a single-shot missile launcher called the EAT-411 Leveller. On second thought, the Leveller might be just as fun as the hammer.</p>
<p>Rounding out the major additions is a "spherical, projectile-blocking shield" you can lob out for some cover,  a studded heavy armour set dubbed the SA-8 Ram, and a medium set called the SA-7 Headfirst. Both of the latter come with a passive ability that regenerates your stamina whenever you take damage, meaning you can go all night long. Well, at least until you run out of health.</p>

            <p>
Good news everybody! Geralt of Rivia is dead. He lies beneath a pile of naked, sculpted, drunken bodies in a castle ballroom. Actually, that’s not right - he’s been eaten by a dragon. Actually, that’s not right either - he drowned himself in a flagon of syrup. Fair audience, please consider which of these tragic eventualities is most befitting of your hand-claps and progression points. None of them meet your standards? Then I, Dandelion, must sing Geralt’s death anew.
</p>
<p>
Nerial and Devolver Digital have partnered with CD Projekt RED to make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns-the-witcher">Reigns: The Witcher</a>. I’m sure I don’t need to explain that this is a new version of Nerial’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/reigns-review-pc">cherished</a> card-swiping narrative <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>, which takes place in The Witcher’s grotty and magical medieval universe. The game casts you as temporarily embarrassed ‘master poet’ Dandelion, who is both Geralt’s best mate and very often, the biggest pain in his arse. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Dandelion and Geralt have a bet on that Dandelion can’t become an ‘immortal bard’ in one year. To win the bet, Dandelion must spin progressively fancier, longer, sillier and more thrilling tales about Geralt’s heroism, all of which seemingly end in his demise.</p>
<p>As in regular <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns">Reigns</a>, this is done by drawing event cards and swiping left or right to make decisions that fill or empty four gauges at the top of the screen. There’s also a combat system, which sees you tapping to make Geralt hop left or right on a grid of descending damage, spell and attack icons. Between tales, you’ll channel your audience’s initially grudging applause into level-ups that unlock new starting story concepts and modifiers. "Geralt The Bathed", for example, makes Geralt stink less, improving his standing with certain kinds of people, though I imagine there will be repercussions of the “got smelled stalking a werewolf” variety.
</p><p>
I’ve had a quick fiddle with a preview build, and this seems like it’ll scratch your itch if you enjoy either The Witcher or Reigns, though it has yet to surprise me, and is likely best played on a phone. The writing is as daft and bouncy as you’d expect from both Dandelion and the writers of Reigns. The Reigns artstyle is perhaps a bit worn-out at this stage - there have been three other spin-offs, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns-game-of-thrones">Reigns: Game of Thrones</a> - but it remains crisp and suave with some nifty takes on Tarot. The music readily conjures the taverns of the Nilfgaardian Empire.
</p>
<p>
I’m interested to see whether there are nods to the other cardgames in The Witcher universe – both the porno pin-up collecting from the 2008 original game, which we Don’t Talk About Nowadays, and the more recent, beloved Gwent. Mostly, though, I just want to see how far Nerial can warp Geralt and The Witcher universe via Dandelion’s improvisations, particularly given that CD Projekt are dialling up the seriousness with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. Do a custard pie-based death, next, Dandelion. You can make it some kind of sex scene, if you wish.
