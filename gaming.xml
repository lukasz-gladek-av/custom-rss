            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-gets-new-creative-director-biggest-update-to-come-21-november/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In the first-ever dev update released by the Star Wars Outlaws team, they decided to use it to bring in these dev updates to provide insights from the developers while they continue adding new content to Star Wars Outlaws to improve the game further. The first major announcement made in this dev update was that Drew Rechner is now the Creative Director for Star Wars Outlaws. On the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft website</a>, he wrote a big announcement, talking about the team's plans to fix up Star Wars Outlaws and what they can do to continue to improve it.</p>
<p>"Your feedback has already resulted in three Title Updates in which we've focused on fixing some of your biggest concerns, such as bugs, reducing major friction points in some key missions, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-update-1-3-improves-stealth-and-enemy-ai/">particularly around stealth</a>, adjusting the speeder camera and collision, and much more. That being said, there are three key areas in which we're looking to improve the game even further," says Rachner.</p>
<p>They plan to continue to improve the combat, where they want to add "more depth and excitement to the experience, further rewarding your tactics and precision." They also want to focus more on the stealth aspect of the game, something that has been highly controversial for those who have been getting stuck into Star Wars Outlaws. Since the beginning, the stealth has been a huge issue for gamers, as it started off with the stealth missions being too challenging, with players getting caught immediately. Since then, they have worked to update the stealth mechanic and try to make it a smoother experience for those playing Star Wars Outlaws. They are now continuing to improve it by working on the readability and consistency of enemy detection.</p>
<p>Their third key area of focus is working on the character controls to make finding cover and utilizing it more reliable, as well as making climbing and crouching more responsive. While these are just three key areas they're planning on focusing on, they have said that there will be more added in the next Title Update 1.4, which will be released on November 21. Along with this update, Star Wars Outlaws will finally be on Steam, as well as the first story pack, Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card.</p>
<p>It's said by both Rachner and the team that the Title Update 1.4 will be the "biggest update yet," so players can only hope that this update doesn't break things further and actually improves the experience of this <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">controversial title</a>.</p>

But getting the old content working in newer versions of the <em>Halo </em>engine was very tricky. </p><p>The main community member who helped lead the charge for getting the Earth City demo finished and playable in the <em>Master Chief Collection </em>was Steven “General_101" Garcia. According to the post, he was a “one-man army” and helped improve the demo’s art, scripts, and more. Then other modders, including Ludus, Neo Te Aika, Sean T, xScruffyDaSasquatchx, and Killzone, hopped in to finish up the level and make it play like the original E3 demo. </p><p>The remastered <em>Halo 2</em> E3 Demo arrives November 9 as a free mod on Steam Workshop for PC players. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

WWE Women’s Champion Nia Jax looked to destroy WWE World Champion Liv Morgan in a match to determine the first-ever women’s Crown Jewel champion. The WWE Women’s Tag Team Champions champions Bianca Belair and Jade Cargill aimed to defy the odds in a fatal four-way match. </p><p>Could Bronson Reed live up to the expectations when engaged in battle with World Champion Seth Rollins? This event had an array of talent that could have all been viable options to make our pound-for-pound rankings this month, however, there can only be 10.

In the last few weeks, Nia Jax and WWE World Champion Liv Morgan have been trading insults on the mic and Money In The Bank briefcase shots in the ring, trying to get fans to care about their Crown Jewel match the WWE has been promoting as history-making. Did it make history? Technically, yes. Did fans really care? Hardly.</p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>Jax retaining the 10th spot on our rankings list is a clear indication that her matches have walked the tightrope between terrible and exciting, often taking a bump somewhere in between. Jax looked dominant throughout her Crown Jewel fight, at one point crushing Morgan with a Samoan Drop from the second rope that’ll make any spectator instinctively grab their chest. However, some of the moves looked sluggish and relied too much on her raw power as opposed to any in-ring finesse. Jax was pinned after Liv Morgan’s walking insurance policy Raquel Rodriguez caused an interference by hitting Nia in the head while the ref was distracted by Dominick “Dirty Dom” Mysterio, which ultimately allowed Morgan to hit her Oblivion finishing move. Decent effort by Jax in this contest; nonetheless, things need to progress for her if the WWE Women’s Champion looks to remain on our list.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c727ba149f80452ecf120ae45c42066b" data-recommend-id="image://c727ba149f80452ecf120ae45c42066b" data-format="jpg" data-width="3903" data-height="2602" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bianca Belair and Chelsea Green in action during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Belair and Cargill were in a multi-story feud with former champions Chelsea Green and Piper Niven, Iyo Sky and Kairi Sane, both of who were also former tag champions, and main roster newcomers, Jakara Jackson and Lash Legend. They have been booked and busy, and the television matches and angles in the previous weeks were compelling enough to convince some fanatical onlookers that Belair and Cargill could actually lose the titles. </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>Belair never disappoints when she’s given an opportunity, and this was no different. She clearly was the “ring general” in the Fatal Four Way match against Meta-Four, Chelsea Green &amp; Piper Niven, and Damage CTRL where chaos, top rope assaults, and suplex surprises reigned supreme. She’s a star that often shines brighter than her competition, thanks to her unique blend of agility, speed, strength, and irresistible style. Cargill and Belair used the Road Warriors’ legendary “Doomsday Device” finisher on Niven to retain their titles in a fun match that will likely continue the story, with Jackson and Legend being Cargill and Belair’s next opponents. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0aa7b47240029d5ff64f14028f5f9c4a" data-recommend-id="image://0aa7b47240029d5ff64f14028f5f9c4a" data-format="jpg" data-width="3980" data-height="2653" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Solo Siko puts Jimmy Uso in a submission hold during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Solo Siko puts Jimmy Uso in a submission hold during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE/Getty Images<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0aa7b47240029d5ff64f14028f5f9c4a" data-recommend-id="image://0aa7b47240029d5ff64f14028f5f9c4a" data-format="jpg" data-width="3980" data-height="2653" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Solo Siko puts Jimmy Uso in a submission hold during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>No. 5</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments: </strong>Sikoa has been the focal point of major WWE storylines for the last seven months. In just the last three months, he’s been involved in two title changes. After his own older brother Jey Uso came to Smackdown and got in his face, “The Street Champion” invaded Monday Night Raw to cost his brother the Intercontinental Championship. His Bloodline stablemates Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa then lost the WWE Tag Team titles to TNA Wrestling mainstays the Motor City Machine Guns, due to interference from the “OG Bloodline.” Some may have grown tired of the Bloodline story, but for me, things are starting to heat up again, and Sikoa is a major reason why. </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>Sikoa continues to be solid in the ring. His offense is believable enough to dazzle, and he continued to show that growth in the OG Bloodline vs New Bloodline standoff. Sikoa sells Reigns’s Superman punch spectacularly. While his cousin started the match off hot, it didn’t take long for the new tribal chief to assert his will. Personally, I much prefer Sikoa’s version of a “Uranage” that he calls the “Spinning Solo” over his Samoan Spike, but I respect him wanting to honor the memory of the late, great wrestling legend Umaga. The spike is also what allowed the leader of the Bloodline to vanquish Reigns and later declare himself the true Original Tribal Chief, undoubtedly setting up more drama we can’t wait to watch.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="84549931b34dd6934805daf0910cc35e" data-recommend-id="image://84549931b34dd6934805daf0910cc35e" data-format="jpg" data-width="4078" data-height="2719" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Paul &quot;Triple H&quot; Levesque presents the Crown Jewel Women's Championship to Liv Morgan during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

More recently, it has been the Women’s World Champion trying to escape from the Australian-born superstar, often hiding behind Raquel Rodriguez. Due to the WWE’s prioritizing Crown Jewel’s ascension to one of the company’s tentpole annual events, WWE was tasked with advancing the Ripley-Morgan feud, while also promoting Morgan’s Crown Jewel match with Nia Jax to determine the first-ever Crown Jewel Women’s Champion. Ripley got a legitimate eye injury in the build-up to this match, causing a halt in original plans. There is still interest in Morgan vs Ripley; however, they should wrap this story up as soon as Ripley is healthy. As for the Crown Jewel match, the lead-up was underwhelming, and the match mirrored it. </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance:</strong> Morgan has figured out how to be an underdog while also ensuring it’s believable when she picks up a win. At first glance, this is a heel vs heel match, with all parties involved technically being bad guys. However, the crowd response to Morgan made her a babyface—the hero, in wrestling terms—by default. I truly enjoy Morgan’s work in the ring, but she could benefit from either having a different finisher or a second one Oblivion. That doesn’t discredit her work or her huge win against Jax.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="197ec76fc86d82b5c1e92743952e249f" data-recommend-id="image://197ec76fc86d82b5c1e92743952e249f" data-format="jpg" data-width="4149" data-height="2766" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bronson Reed and Seth Rollins in action during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

A few months ago, Reed put Seth Rollins on the shelf. Once “The Architect” returned, his goal was to destroy Reed. The giant performer has looked dominant over a number of wrestlers the last few weeks, and he aimed to end Seth for good. Most weeks, they were brawling all over the arena, with the week going into their Crown Jewel match showing us Reed couldn’t be stopped </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>For someone of Reed’s size, the 330-pound behemoth<strong> </strong>can accomplish some truly incredible feats. He takes bumps well, and he’s also good at selling. Reed knows how to wrestle “big man style,” but he’s not unbeatable. He worked really well with Rollins at Crown Jewel, even taking a nasty “Curb Stomp” on steel steps. That ultimately was the cause for the loss, but even in defeat, Reed rose up to show Rollins he’s here to stay. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3871f9de65e2665ffd6ef0fcff468526" data-recommend-id="image://3871f9de65e2665ffd6ef0fcff468526" data-format="jpg" data-width="4132" data-height="2755" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Roman Reigns says he's the one during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" Roman Reigns says he's the one during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE/Getty Images<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3871f9de65e2665ffd6ef0fcff468526" data-recommend-id="image://3871f9de65e2665ffd6ef0fcff468526" data-format="jpg" data-width="4132" data-height="2755" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Roman Reigns says he's the one during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>No. 3</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> In a somewhat predictable turn of events, Reigns found himself needing help. After his cousin Jimmy Uso made his return at Bad Blood, the OG Bloodline found themselves outnumbered by the New Bloodline. As a result, Reigns and Uso were being decimated week after week on Smackdown. Eventually, Jimmy was able to convince his brother Jey Uso to settle his previous issues with Reigns and help them out. The Bloodline story remains one of the most layered and intriguing stories the WWE has to offer. </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>Roman Reigns losing to Sikoa by pinfall may be shocking to us all, but was certainly the right decision. This was another match where Reigns, being the intelligent man that he is, let his teammates work most of the match and made the tag when it mattered the most. The multi-time Wrestlemania headliner did not do much from a “wrestling” performance perspective; however, Reigns commanded the attention of not only the fans but his opponents. </p><p>Once the former champion did get his hands on Sikoa, the crowd erupted. At one point, the New Tribal Chief hit the Original Tribal Chief with the Samoan Spike, and Reigns did not kick out. Either Jimmy was late breaking it up, or Reigns forgot. Nevertheless, the bad guys walked away winners. The post-match saw The New Bloodline beating down the OG Bloodline when Sami Zayn attempted to make the save for the good guys. The match was fine, but it’s really the story that maintains its position on this ranking. Things are heating up leading into next month’s Survivor Series, and Reigns is performing near his peak.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9f4a2bee1a231157f7692586f4e2efce" data-recommend-id="image://9f4a2bee1a231157f7692586f4e2efce" data-format="jpg" data-width="3977" data-height="2651" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Seth Rollins stomps Bronson Reed during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Seth Rollins stomps Bronson Reed during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE/Getty Images<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9f4a2bee1a231157f7692586f4e2efce" data-recommend-id="image://9f4a2bee1a231157f7692586f4e2efce" data-format="jpg" data-width="3977" data-height="2651" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Seth Rollins stomps Bronson Reed during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> N.A.</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments: </strong>After a much-needed break from the action, “The Visionary” was back to regain some momentum. Rollins took a break from focusing on future opponent CM Punk to forge a battle with a superstar on the rise, Bronson Reed. Week after week, the two were separated after brawling throughout every building they were in. Rollins remains top-level with his promos alone. With the first-ever NXT champion laid out on the go-home edition of Monday Night Raw, we all anticipated watching Rollins attempt to overcome the monster. </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>You’d be hard-pressed to find a bad Seth Rollins match<strong>. </strong>There’s a reason the grand slam champion is always a main attraction. From the very start of the match, Rollins and Reed had the audience in their sweaty, grappling palms. At first, it appeared Reed was going over on Rollins after a “Tsunami” from Bronson in the first few minutes of the match. However, that wasn’t the case, and Rollins was able to hit a “Curb Stomp” for an implacable false finish. After a back-and-forth exhibition, Rollins found a way to win with a super “Curb Stop,” adding to his collection of top-tier performances. Although this feud with Reed hasn’t concluded, I wouldn’t object to Rollins moving on to his story with the aforementioned CM Punk.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="414f2f9213c87c2997b74289a921f94d" data-recommend-id="image://414f2f9213c87c2997b74289a921f94d" data-format="jpg" data-width="5221" data-height="3481" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="LA Knight remains the United States Champion during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="LA Knight remains the United States Champion during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE/Getty Images<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="414f2f9213c87c2997b74289a921f94d" data-recommend-id="image://414f2f9213c87c2997b74289a921f94d" data-format="jpg" data-width="5221" data-height="3481" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="LA Knight remains the United States Champion during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> N.A. </p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> Knight hasn’t been featured as much as many are clamoring for, but he’s still “MAXimized” his minutes on television. The United States Champion found himself in the middle of the issues between his two Crown Jewel opponents, Andrade and Carmelo Hayes. Hayes and Andrade competed in a series of matches that were due to culminate in a Game 7-style match at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center to determine a number one contender for Knight’s title. The U.S. Champion was the special guest referee and ensured there was no decisive winner, therefore sealing his fate. Good build-up to this triple-threat match. </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>Based on entrance and crowd reaction alone, LA Knight was most certainly over with the live crowd. Andrade and Hayes had some creative high spots in the match, whereas Knight focused more on the ground and pound. The champion did show some athleticism when both his challengers were on the turnbuckles; he leaped up and superplexed Andrade off the top. The finish of the match was equally as clever: Knight caught Hayes while he was holding Andrade and hit the “Blunt Force Trauma,” effectively knocking them both out. Impressive showing from all three wrestlers.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8e0cf1dfe8e1d68ff25a6d22e2bba909" data-recommend-id="image://8e0cf1dfe8e1d68ff25a6d22e2bba909" data-format="jpg" data-width="3833" data-height="2555" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="GUNTHER returns with a submission hold on Cody Rhodes during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

With Cody Rhodes having another story occurring simultaneously, Gunther was reduced to just cutting promos. The two champions did fight on a Smackdown live event in Brooklyn. But, other than that, it’s been relatively lax for Gunther.</p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>When I think of an old-school heel WWE Champion, Gunther is the perfect personification. This match between the two world champions was technically sound and hard-hitting. Gunther laid in all of his offensive moves, and Rhodes took it. Despite the loss, Gunther wasn’t hurt by this at all. Cody needed this win more in order to cement his title run. In what some may see as an uncharacteristic move, Gunther shook hands with Rhodes and gave him the Crown Jewel ring. Where does this leave the self-proclaimed “ring general?” Well, we’re just going to have to wait and see. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8ae3a52a1d8232690b8a576c2144d9c7" data-recommend-id="image://8ae3a52a1d8232690b8a576c2144d9c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="5808" data-height="3872" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Paul &quot;Triple H&quot; Levesque presents the Crown Jewel Men's Championship to Cody Rhodes during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Paul &quot;Triple H&quot; Levesque presents the Crown Jewel Men's Championship to Cody Rhodes during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE/Getty Images<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8ae3a52a1d8232690b8a576c2144d9c7" data-recommend-id="image://8ae3a52a1d8232690b8a576c2144d9c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="5808" data-height="3872" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Paul &quot;Triple H&quot; Levesque presents the Crown Jewel Men's Championship to Cody Rhodes during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> No. 4</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments: </strong>In the build to Crown Jewel, Rhodes has been trying to get his lick back from Kevin Owens. Following the Bad Blood event in Atlanta, the prizefighter attacked Cody in the parking lot. Rhodes has been seeking revenge ever since the altercation. Mutual friend Randy Orton has been trying to end this problem between Owens and Rhodes. That only angered Owens, leading him to believe the third-generation superstar was picking sides. Rhodes dealing with the RKO drama, while handling his issues with World Champion Gunther, gave viewers more than enough entertainment to continue supporting the WWE Champion. </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>The highly acclaimed WWE Champion was slated to make history. In a match that would crown the first-ever Crown Jewel champion, Rhodes and Gunther went out and had a standard WWE main event title match. At times, it felt more physiologically based than a knock-down, all-out blood feud, which it was not. There was nothing bad about the match. It did start off slow, but that’s expected of two wrestlers without an actual story leading into the match. Rhodes showed his resilience by reversing Gunther’s sleeper and getting the pinfall on the man who has ruled over Raw. Nothing outstanding throughout the match, just a solid effort. The significance of the results lies solely upon Rhodes winning another championship for the first time.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I won’t sit here and tell you that I’m a totally stoic horror fan. I don’t miss the big ones, but I’m still a total wuss and trudge through the latest shockingly horrific games at night, which is the only time I get to play anything these days. As we all know, playing horror games in the dark is, like, ten times worse. But when you add more action into the experience, well, I’m all for that. Slitterhead promises action combined with horror, and I’m here for it. But how are the Slitterhead reviews panning out before release? Let’s take a look!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-slitterhead">What is Slitterhead?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, for those who stumbled upon this upcoming horror game, or Insider Gaming in general, let’s go over the nitty-gritty of Slitterhead. It’s certainly a unique name and immediately evokes images of horrific scenery and, in my eyes, body horror. Well, that’s apt, considering the game is primarily about body horror with brain-devouring parasite-like creatures that hunt and consume humans. But you, you’re unique. You’re a Hyoki, which means you can possess humans, too, but for good. You’ll use various blood-based abilities and possessed forms to defeat Slitterheads in all shapes and sizes as they wreak havoc on the city of Kowlong.</p>



<p>Slitterhead is out <span>on <strong>November 8</strong> on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</span>!</p>







<h2 id="h-should-you-play-the-horror-game-a-look-at-early-critic-reviews-of-slitterhead">Should You Play the Horror Game? A Look at Early Critic Reviews of Slitterhead</h2>



<p>Now, before you whip out your wallet, especially considering Slitterhead stems from one of the deranged minds behind the original Silent Hill, let’s take a look at a few early critic reviews of the horror game:</p>



<p><a href="https://gamingbolt.com/slitterhead-review-wonderfully-bizarre" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingBolt</a>:</p>



<blockquote></blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>I&nbsp;say this as a compliment-&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>is one of the weirdest games I’ve played this entire console generation, and definitely the weirdest game I’ve played this year. Coming from Bokeh Game Studio – a new indie team formed by Keiichiro Toyama, the creator of&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill, Siren,&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Gravity Rush&nbsp;</em>– it has certain expectations to live up to, but rather than being a slave to those expectations, it carves out a unique identity for itself. It’s not without its issues, and it certainly isn’t a game that I’d recommend to anyone without any caveats- but if you&nbsp;<em>can&nbsp;</em>look past its issues, there’s a very different and interesting gaming experience on offer here.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/slitterhead-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s horrific, but the crux of Slitterhead is its moment-to-moment action. You’re not a helpless dad stumbling through the snowy town of&nbsp;Silent Hill&nbsp;with a lead pipe in hand, but a small militia of civilians armed with razor-sharp clubs conjured up from their own blood. It’s an incredibly ambitious game that reminds me of a time when this industry was far bolder.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slitterhead-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There is something of a honeymoon phase to Slitterhead’s early moments, as you admire Kowlown’s murkiness and the general grossness of the yoghurt monsters. Sadly, this haze also quickly starts to dissipate, replaced by a thick fog of jank. Like its namesake enemies bursting forth from an unfortunate meat puppet, Slitterhead eventually reveals its true nature, and reader, it isn’t good.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horror/slitterhead-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Part sci-fi body horror, part thrilling detective yarn, Slitterhead is a story of humanity versus monstrosity in a city where both are plentiful. Bokeh’s debut release bravely takes strides to manipulate, challenge, and evolve how we play horror games, and while some of these risks do not pay off as well as others, Slitterhead’s sheer creative ambition is impossible to ignore.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/slitterhead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PushSquare</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>There’s quite a lot going on here, and sometimes the information is buried in tutorial menus. But it makes for a unique combat system unlike anything else you’ve ever played. One character can drop a blood vortex onto the stage, for example, sucking foes in; you can then switch to an unimportant human, prime them for detonation, run into the middle of aforementioned maelstrom, and possess a different body before they explode.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/slitterhead-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TechRadar</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Slitterhead won’t be for everyone due to its quirks, it’s a bit clunky and reuses content frequently. But behind its issues lies one of the most unique titles of the past few years. With a great mystery story, impressive world-building for a debut, and a possession mechanic that adds an extra strategic layer to combat. Slitterhead lives up to its pedigree.</p>

Gerighty confirmed he'd soon be handing over the Star Wars Outlaws reigns in an <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/star-wars-outlaws-massive-entertainment-interview-creative-director-julian-gerighty-and-game-director-mathias-karlson-exclusive/">interview with GamesRadar</a> last month, explaining, "It's been announced that I'm executive producer on The Division, so these are my last weeks [on Outlaws]". And now, new creative director Drew Rechner has provided a look ahead at Star Wars Outlaws' future.
</p>
<p>
Rechner highlighted "three key areas in which we're looking to improve the game" in a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-1-pushing-into-hyperdrive">new developer post</a>, starting with combat, where he sees a "real opportunity to add more depth and excitement... further rewarding your tactics and precision." Stealth, meanwhile, will see improvements to "readability and consistency of enemy detection" while also "providing choice in how you want to approach each encounter."

<p>
Developer Massive Entertainment's final focus is character controls, with the studio looking to improve "the reliability of cover... the responsiveness of climbing and crouching [and] the consistency of the controls overall." All this is set to be addressed in Star Wars Outlaws' Title Update 1.4 release on 21st November, and Rechner says specific details on the planned changes will be shared in the "upcoming weeks" .
</p><p>
21st November is also the day Star Wars Outlaws comes to Steam (Ubisoft will, of course, be bringing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-new-ubisoft-games-to-release-day-one-on-steam-starting-next-february">all its new titles to Valve's platform on launch day</a> starting February next year), and the same day the game's first story expansion, Wild Card, releases.
</p>
<p>
Star Wars Outlaws' 1.4 update marks the latest in a series of patches designed to "polish and improve the player experience" following Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">admission earlier this year</a> that sales had been "softer than expected". At the time, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said the development team was "fully mobilised" to update the game "in order to engage a large audience during the holiday season [and] position [the game] as a strong long-term performer".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/latest-black-ops-6-update-addresses-issues/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Black Ops 6 has been on the market for more than a week, and players are busying themselves contending with everything from SBMM to the annual camo grind. It’s being mostly well received by the community, but there are a few niggling issues that are being steadily addressed by Treyarch and Co.</p>



<p>The latest Black Ops 6 patch has applied a few tweaks that will help to fix some of these issues.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-early-changes">Early Changes</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 might only be a week old, but it’s already being adjusted left, right, and centre by Activision’s teams.</p>



<p>The most recent update has made it tougher for users to <strong>snake</strong>, which is where they adjust their stance rapidly to ‘bob up and down’ in a way that makes them hard to hit. Typically, they’ll do that behind cover, and for anyone trying to engage them, it becomes near impossible to land consecutive shots.</p>



<p>Treyarch has also adjusted flashbangs, reducing the amount of time you remain flashed by up to 20%, which is a huge win. Being ‘spam-flashed’ has become a common occurrence on smaller maps like Nuketown, especially with users running Tactical Expert.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the team has tweaked the effective damage range of SMGs to make them tougher at longer distances. Conversely, they’ve reduced the range of ARs and made their headshots less effective at close range, which… Doesn’t make much sense.</p>



<p>They’ve also adjusted spawn logic on several maps and added Nuketown to private matches, which means you can now hunt for easter eggs in earnest. Shotgun slugs have been nerfed, and Recon has been dramatically tuned down to be much less effective, which eradicates many of the ‘wallhack’ comments.</p>



<p>For those concerned about the XP earn rates during this Double XP weekend, Treyarch has adjusted Player XP and Weapon XP earn rates between various modes. </p>



<p>Basically, nothing was done to change Zombies because it’s already kind of perfect.</p>

Once the Mastery Gauge is full, you'll get a Mastery Point that can be spent at Mastery Cave in Cindersap Forest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more information on Mastery Points and the rewards you can spend them on, head to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/Mastery_Points">our Mastery Points guide</a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Raccoon Family Quests</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/04/stardew-valley-1-6-raccoon-quests-1730744095325.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In Stardew Valley 1.6, you'll receive an announcement randomly telling you that a strong windstorm occurred overnight and if you head to Cindersap Forest, you'll find that there's now a giant treestump where a tree was.

The associate director on last year’s <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora </em>is taking the reigns over from <em>The Division 2</em>'s Julian Gerighty,</p><p>Alongside existing title updates that have already gone out focused on improving certain mission mechanics and various bugs, the new director outlined three areas for future updates: stealth, combat, and responsiveness. Here’s how he described what that means:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The first key area of improvement to the game is combat where we see a real opportunity to add more depth and excitement to the experience, further rewarding your tactics and precision. Our second key area is stealth which is not only about improving the readability and consistency of enemy detection, but also providing choice in how you want to approach each encounter. Finally, our third key area of focus is centered around the character controls, which means improving the reliability of cover, increasing the responsiveness of climbing and crouching, and generally improving the consistency of the controls overall.﻿</p></blockquote><p>While <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>is scheduled to get a third major title update on November 21 when the game comes to Steam and gets its first story pack DLC, the new job title and talk about “more depth and excitement” certainly make it sound like Ubisoft is working on even more improvements over the long haul. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-stealth-bugs-ubisoft-1851637931&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-stealth-bugs-ubisoft-1851637931">The game has a lot of flaws but also a lot to offer</a></span>, even if its sales were so bad, the publisher decided to delay<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>by four months. </p><p>Time will tell if these final polish passes and quality-of-life adjustments are enough to turn <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>from a good game to a great one or if some of the problems ultimately run deeper than that.  </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-2/" data-ref-id="5000-4788">Halo 2's</a> iconic E3 2003 demo, much of which did not appear in the final game when it launched a year later, will finally be playable next week via a Steam Workshop mod for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-master-chief-collection/" data-ref-id="5000-283982">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> on PC, just in time for Halo 2's 20th anniversary.</p><p dir="ltr">The mod will be available for free and will release November 9, the same day Halo 2 released in 2004. In the demo, Master Chief rides in a Pelican to the Earth city of New Mombasa, where he meets up with embattled UNSC Marines and battles his way through the city streets. After boarding and hijacking an enemy Ghost (a new gameplay feature added in Halo 2), Chief escapes from a pursuing Phantom dropship, only to find himself surrounded by Covenant drop pods filled with Energy Sword-wielding Elites. As he pulls out a plasma grenade, Cortana tells Chief "Bet you can't stick it," to which Chief replies, "You're on" before throwing himself at the Elites as the screen fades to white. All the while Martin O'Donnell's instantly recognizable score plays.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqZcZk1wOuk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BqZcZk1wOuk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It made a powerful impression back in the day. In an Xbox Wire <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/04/20-years-of-halo-2-new-maps-e3-demo/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Halo community director Brian Jarrard, who previously worked at Halo 2 developer Bungie, said the stakes and energy going into E3 2003 were off the charts.</p><p dir="ltr">"The response to the demo at E3 was electric, and nearly every Halo fan remembers that demo and where they were when they were first blinded by its majesty," Jarrard said. "Best of all, none of us ever would have expected that 20 plus years later, a group of passionate community modders would bring this demo to life as a full-fledged mission."</p><p dir="ltr">But making the demo fully playable wasn't easy. As noted in the blog, the original demo was built on a version of the Halo engine that no longer exists and isn't compatible with other versions of Halo 2. Halo senior franchise writer Kenneth Peters said the original build of the demo required an original Xbox developer kit to boot, something "in increasingly short supply even within the studio."</p><p dir="ltr">The work to bring the demo back to life was previously announced in a Halo Waypoint <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/cutting-room-floor" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog</a> from 2022, where first details on how developer 343 Industries (now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-new-halo-games-in-the-works-as-series-moves-to-unreal-and-343-gets-a-new-name/1100-6526938/" data-ref-id="1100-6526938">rebranded to Halo Studios</a>) and a group of community modders referred to as the Digsite team were working on restoring old cut content from Halo and Halo 2, including the E3 2003 demo. At the time, 343 made no promises the demo would ever become fully playable.</p><p dir="ltr">One Digsite member said some aspects of the demo were just smoke and mirrors, with the team having to make some aspects of the demo "real" by using assets from the shipped version of Halo 2. The demo, Peters said, was never made to be played off-script without breaking. That presented a unique challenge, including having to make sense of "barely documented" code "originally written under an insane time crunch" 20 years ago.</p><p dir="ltr">"This was NOT a trivial process, and we should probably layer on a whole page of caveats that come with taking a demo map for an engine that no longer exists and getting it to not blow up the current lightmapper (among other issues that come from letting people go into areas that were never intended to be seen)."</p><p dir="ltr">The Halo 2 E3 2003 demo isn't the only way Halo Studios is celebrating Halo 2's 20th anniversary. A special Halo 2 playlist in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo Infinite</a>, featuring Halo 2 maps remade in Forge and gameplay changes made to mimic the 2004 shooter, will go live November 5.</p>

" This transformational technology will accelerate the velocity of development and unlock truly novel game experiences that will surprise, delight, and inspire players."</p><p>Verdu, a founding member of Netflix Games, continued and touted the technology as ushering in a defining time for gamers and said he hadn't felt this excited since the 1990s. "It was an incredible time to be making games as talented creators showed all of us what the future looked like. Guess what? We're back to those days of seemingly unlimited potential and the rapid pace of innovation, which resulted in mind-blowing surprises for players every few months.”</p><p>Buzzwords aside, it's interesting for Verdu to dive into games given that Team Blue, a Netflix-owned gaming studio, closed up shop just last month. The result was the laying off of 35 people, whose past credits include big-name, big-budget franchises like Halo, God of War, and Call of Duty. Verdu explains that was all part of the plan.</p><p>"Pay no mind to the uninformed speculation in the media about the changes in Netflix Games," he added. "What you've seen over the last several months was actually a planned transition."</p><p>Verdu mentioned no plans or goals were in place since he took the position over the weekend, but insists that he's focused on a "creator-first" vision. While Team Blue has closed its doors, Netflix still owns Night School, Next Games, Spry Fox, and Boss Fight Entertainment, with over 80 games across its library with huge titles on the horizon like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game/">Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game</a>. </p>

To be clear, I’ve seen both variations before writing this ranking, and still would probably put him at the bottom of this list. Lucanis is a web of fascinating contradictions. On the surface, he seems like a character ripe for tiresome edgy nonsense with his brooding demeanor, magic crow wings that he uses to fly around and strike his targets from above, and the fact that the demon embodiment of Spite lives within him. But he’s also kind of a golden retriever.</p><p>Lucanis drinks more coffee than any writer you’ve met, just to stay awake and maintain control of his body, cooks for the team and remembers all their favorite foods, and he is protective of those he cares about. His story is a <em>Game of Thrones</em>-esque political drama with family ties and blood magic in the mix, and unfortunately, it can feel a bit truncated on certain playthroughs. Still, Lucanis’ inner struggle with his literal and figurative demons shines through.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2de1da4a1f8944ce07a2d102d5df8158" data-recommend-id="image://2de1da4a1f8944ce07a2d102d5df8158" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Taash is shown looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Taash is shown looking at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2de1da4a1f8944ce07a2d102d5df8158" data-recommend-id="image://2de1da4a1f8944ce07a2d102d5df8158" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Taash is shown looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The lone qunari on the team is an interesting one. Taash joins The Veilguard initially to help the team fight the dragons they’ll face when fighting the elven gods. Though their foes are the size of buildings, their biggest fight is the one they deal with internally as they navigate the intersection of gender and culture. Taash is standing between two worlds: the Qunari one they were born in, and the Rivain one they have grown into. They feel pulled in different directions, whether that be in the way they dress, the food they eat, or the gender they identify as.</p><p>Though Taash can initially come off as bullheaded and deadpan, it’s clear they are an introspective, thoughtful person who wants to be themself, but also seeks the approval of those who have cared for them. Finding yourself when you have so many forces telling you who you’re supposed to be is a pretty universal concept, but watching <em>The Veilguard</em> wrestle with these ideas within its own world remains one of the series’ strengths, and Taash is one of the most endearing and entertaining examples under its belt.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a0a31dd97ff01975998753d3af1b947b" data-recommend-id="image://a0a31dd97ff01975998753d3af1b947b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bellara is shown looking at something in the distance as Rook approaches." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bellara is shown looking at something in the distance as Rook approaches." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a0a31dd97ff01975998753d3af1b947b" data-recommend-id="image://a0a31dd97ff01975998753d3af1b947b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bellara is shown looking at something in the distance as Rook approaches." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>At first, Bellara felt primed to slip through the cracks for me. The elven mage, introduced as an expert on ancient elf technology and magic, seems scatterbrained if she’s not fixated on one of her interests. But as her story unfolds, it becomes clear that Bellara’s preoccupation with elven artifacts, lost history, and hobbies like fiction writing are all born out of a need to distract herself from her grief, and possibly make up for her failures.</p><p>When you meet her, Bellara has been hunting for a way to make the world make sense again, only for the elven gods she had known her whole life to return, and everything she knew is repeatedly flipped on its head. What does someone who seeks to restore history do when it’s constantly changing? What decisions do you make when the answers you’ve found can hurt those who have already gone through so much? Bellara is the kind of character a story like <em>The Veilguard </em>needs: as the world changes, she’s the most well-equipped to understand its significance and ponder the effects it will have on everyone when the dust settles. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3d8946eeccb14873e15b9a18889f2726" data-recommend-id="image://3d8946eeccb14873e15b9a18889f2726" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Davrin is shown looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Davrin is shown looking at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3d8946eeccb14873e15b9a18889f2726" data-recommend-id="image://3d8946eeccb14873e15b9a18889f2726" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Davrin is shown looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>The Veilguard</em>’s Grey Warden companion is a man-and-a-half. Davrin is a monster hunter who carves each of the beasts he faces into wooden statues from logs he cuts himself. He’s also a great bird-cat father to Assan, one of the last griffons who was once thought extinct in the <em>Dragon Age</em> universe. How could I not fall for the lumberjack bird-cat dad who is doomed by the narrative because he’s part of a faction that will one day go underground to die when they start to go mad from the darkspawn taint inside him?</p><p>But I digress. Davrin is one of the best examples <em>The Veilguard </em>has of a character whose very personal story has long standing ramifications for the world of <em>Dragon Age</em>. As a Warden, Davrin knows his time is relatively limited, and feels a great deal of responsibility to protect those around him. He wants to ensure that he leaves the world better than he found it. The revelations he finds in his quest fundamentally shift how the Wardens will be viewed in the annals of history, but he doesn’t lose sight of the good those still living under the banner can do. All of this is delivered with a heartfelt story of a man and his bird-cat son learning to love and live with each other. Davrin’s story has some of the greatest range in <em>The Veilguard</em>, and it’s all elevated by the dashing man in the center (I’m sorry, I’m gonna thirst for my video game boyfriends). </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9a15d730a57d0dee603874fc41f1a95b" data-recommend-id="image://9a15d730a57d0dee603874fc41f1a95b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Harding is shown reading a book on a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Harding is shown reading a book on a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9a15d730a57d0dee603874fc41f1a95b" data-recommend-id="image://9a15d730a57d0dee603874fc41f1a95b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Harding is shown reading a book on a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Lace Harding could have easily been a throwaway party member in <em>The Veilguard</em>. The dwarven rogue started as a supporting character in 2014’s <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, and that’s a long time for fans to project an idealized vision of the mostly jovial scout in their minds. But Harding is so much more complex in <em>The Veilguard</em>, and a lot of it has to do with its willingness to examine the cracks in the happy-go-lucky attitude she’s been known for.</p><p>Harding becomes a centerpiece for some of the biggest reveals in dwarven lore <em>Dragon Age </em>has ever dropped, and as she uncovers truths about her people, her anger for what the dwarves have lost becomes central to her world. Things are changing for everyone in <em>The Veilguard</em>, and it often feels like Harding has no one to relate to as she carries heavy dwarven baggage on her back. Rage for what she and her people have lost doesn’t have to consume her, as justified as it might be. But one way or another, someone who once played the support role for the Inquisition becomes a pillar for the dwarven people to build upon. It’s inspiring to see.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="acb8af2d200907522fa688e54bf69010" data-recommend-id="image://acb8af2d200907522fa688e54bf69010" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Emmrich is shown talking to Manfred in a dark area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Emmrich is shown talking to Manfred in a dark area." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="acb8af2d200907522fa688e54bf69010" data-recommend-id="image://acb8af2d200907522fa688e54bf69010" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Emmrich is shown talking to Manfred in a dark area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Every friend group needs a silly guy. Emmrich, a necromancer with a skeleton assistant named Manfred, fills that role. Though raising the dead sounds like dirty, scary work (and not everyone on the team is thrilled by the notion), this mage is an eccentric, kind hearted, and often goofy old man who is a joy to be around. Though death and grief are universal concepts that could be part of any universe, Emmrich spends much of his time studying and celebrating death as a cultural concept within Thedas.</p><p>Some of the most memorable scenes in <em>The Veilguard </em>are the quiet moments when he regales you with stories about his fascination with death, how we face it, and how he maintains respect for those who are gone as he brings them back. But what does a person who deals in life and death feel about his own oncoming end? What do they think when the death in question is no longer something abstract and related to people they’ve never known? Emmrich explores those ideas in his work, but once <em>The Veilguard</em> makes him confront his relationship with death, he is catapulted to one of the most memorable mages we’ve ever met in Thedas. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="961f9f7315f5127890e8a5f7504d01ac" data-recommend-id="image://961f9f7315f5127890e8a5f7504d01ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Neve looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Neve looks at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="961f9f7315f5127890e8a5f7504d01ac" data-recommend-id="image://961f9f7315f5127890e8a5f7504d01ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Neve looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Like Lucanis, your opinion on Neve might vary depending on whether you help her save her home of Minrathous in the early hours of <em>The Veilguard</em>. But in both routes, there’s something compelling about watching the mage detective in her element. Neve knows the name of a lot of the people you meet on the streets of Minrathous. Even as the elven gods are blighting cities and some of the biggest revelations of the <em>Dragon Age</em> universe are raining down upon Rook and their team, Neve doesn’t lose sight of the people on the ground who will still be struggling if and when the Veilguard accomplishes their mission to stop the gods. The question is whether she wants to fight for them from the shadows, or become a beacon of hope to pave a new path in the city.</p><p>Neve is perhaps the most concise example of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s broader thesis. Where often the series shaves down conflict and progress into factions and choices nudged by the player, <em>The Veilguard </em>feels like the series finally believes in something, rather than just showing you a nuanced ideological battle and letting you choose which one deserves to be wiped from the face of Thedas.</p><p>Neve believes that the world can be better, and is willing to do whatever it takes to find that path forward. Oppression and the structures that allow it are not choices or debates in her mind; she is here to fight for the people of Minrathous, it’s just a matter of how. This world is changing, and there are people who will be written in the history books as those who charted the course. Neve may choose to omit herself from the official stories if she can, but she won’t sit idly by while those who benefit from the way things have always been try to direct how things will be.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Dragon Age: Inquisition was supported with no less than eight DLC packs but you will not be getting a single one for Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The news was confirmed in an interview with Rolling Stone who say Bioware have now moved all their staff on to working on the next Mass Effect game.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/06/dragon-age-the-veilguard-dreadwolf-single-player/">previously known as Dragon Age 4 and then as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a> – is the long-awaited return of one of BioWare’s most popular RPG series. The game is currently sitting at ratings of 70 for the PC version, 84 for the PS5 version, and 93 for the Xbox version over on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard/">Metacritic,</a> our review is still in progress.</p>


<p>The next Mass Effect title was teased back on N7 Day, 7th November 2022, when Bioware said “Pre-production development has been proceeding very well. The team, comprised of Mass Effect franchise veterans as well as some amazing new additions to BioWare™, has grown steadily! They’ve been hard at work crafting new characters and locations that you’ll love, as well as revisiting many that you’ll remember.”</p>
<p>The game is set to follow on the from the original trilogy and will be a single player game.&nbsp; In the interview with Rolling Stone veteran Bioware creative director John Epler notes that while he likes multiplayer games, they are very hard to make.</p>
<p>“It’s possible to tell a strong story in a multiplayer game.<em>&nbsp;Final Fantasy XIV </em>does an excellent job,” he said. “Multiplayer also introduces some complications around world states. I make a giant choice in my world, and the world changes.” For games like <em>Dragon Age</em>, the consequences of a player’s choice are intended to impact the narrative moving forward, but for a multiplayer game, it isn’t quite as simple. For example, one player could choose to save a certain person from their fate while another could do the opposite.”</p>


<p>“It’s funny, because the games I play the most on my personal time are actually multiplayer games,” he says. “But when it comes to crafting these worlds and crafting the experiences, I love the focus that single-player can give you.”</p>
<p>With N7 day just round the corner, maybe we will get an update then.</p>

This remake even features new cast recordings as well as an original score. I’ve always had a soft spot for the <em>Mafia </em>games; they’re much moodier than the open-world sandboxes of the <em>Grand Theft Auto </em>series and are focused much more on realism and simulation.

I am, of course, referring to the console and mobile release of <em>Stardew Valley</em>’s<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-update-full-changelog/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-update-full-changelog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> latest major content patch</a></span>.</p><p>Eight years after its release, <em>Stardew </em>is still the<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-haunted-chocolatier-cozy-game-switch-1850184459&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-haunted-chocolatier-cozy-game-switch-1850184459"> overall king of cozy gaming</a></span>, and version 1.6 adds a number of excuses to start up yet another new farm.</p><p>This is a good opportunity to jump back into <em>Stardew </em>or pick it up for the first time, as many of the changes in 1.6 are designed to smooth out its early game. This includes a new starting farm layout that lets you get an early start on raising chickens, a few new seasonal crops for easy money in the early game, and optional micro-festivals that provide some useful rewards for a starting player.</p><p>At this point, however, <em>Stardew </em>is such a pillar of the genre that it can be mildly intimidating. It’s developed a legion of fans, some of whom are hardcore enough that they’ve gotten the game down to a science, and that’s chased off some newcomers. If you’re looking to start<em> Stardew Valley </em>in 2024, here are some useful things to know beforehand.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="769455c291937a8b945933c5508001de" data-recommend-id="image://769455c291937a8b945933c5508001de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->ConcernedApe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="769455c291937a8b945933c5508001de" data-recommend-id="image://769455c291937a8b945933c5508001de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of the first things you notice when you play <em>Stardew </em>in 2024 is that over the last four years, much of the “cozy” subgenre of gaming was specifically made as a reaction to it. Many more recent games such as <em>Fae Farm</em> or <em>My Time at Sandrock </em>have made decisions that address <em>Stardew</em>’s weak points or focus more heavily on its strengths.</p><p>A particular sticking point is the beginning of the game, as <em>Stardew </em>starts you very low on what another game might call its power curve. You initially have little stamina, don’t know any of the good cooking recipes yet, and are usually forced to keep yourself going through the day by eating random things that you found on the ground. Spring 1, Year 1 farming in <em>Stardew </em>is done on a steady diet of dandelions.</p><p>As you get more established, you slowly get better options, more stamina, and time-saving machines like sprinklers, but every day in <em>Stardew </em>is still a race to get as much done as possible before you’re forced to go to bed. There’s a reason why long-time fans all have strategies that revolve around pure efficiency.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="313e445d5b32d8b23fffbb97c5dca576" data-recommend-id="image://313e445d5b32d8b23fffbb97c5dca576" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->ConcernedApe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="313e445d5b32d8b23fffbb97c5dca576" data-recommend-id="image://313e445d5b32d8b23fffbb97c5dca576" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Despite that, however, <em>Stardew </em>is built in such a way that you might have inconveniences, but not setbacks. There aren’t many problems that you can’t fix, solve, or recover from.</p><p>The worst-case scenario in <em>Stardew </em>tends to be missing out on seasonal opportunities. For example, it’s possible to lose your initial shot at growing one of the most valuable crops, strawberries, as you can only buy the seeds from Pierre during the Egg Festival on Spring 13. If you don’t know that, you’ll have to either wait until the next year or hope a Strawberry shows up on the<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Traveling_Cart&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Traveling_Cart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> traveling cart</a></span>.</p><p>That’s no great trial, however, and there’s no way to do <em>Stardew </em>“wrong.” It’s a game that’s meant to wrap itself around you, and anything you don’t want to do will usually patiently wait until you’re ready. Despite its occasionally hectic daily schedule, you’re meant to take this at your own pace.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="811f20dde822714652cf2082d46ce873" data-recommend-id="image://811f20dde822714652cf2082d46ce873" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->ConcernedApe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="811f20dde822714652cf2082d46ce873" data-recommend-id="image://811f20dde822714652cf2082d46ce873" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>To “win” <em>Stardew Valley</em>, you have to get 100% Perfection, which involves mastering most of the game’s individual mechanics, minigames, and exploration challenges, as well as becoming every single villager’s best friend. It can take quite a while to get anywhere close to Perfection, especially if there are parts of the game that you simply don’t care to engage with.</p><p>One of the biggest hurdles, however, is just earning straight cash. You’ll be fine for everyday expenses if you’re smart about which crops you focus on (potatoes, strawberries, blueberries, melons, pumpkins), but many of the endgame challenges in <em>Stardew</em> involve making fat stacks. If you want that elusive 100%, you need 14 million gold to build all four Obelisks and the Gold Clock.</p><p>The time-tested way to become a cash-money millionaire in <em>Stardew </em>usually involves turning your farm and/or beach house into a production facility for high-quality starfruit wine. As you’re going about your business in the mid-to-late game, it’s worth having Robin build you a storage shed, and then filling it with kegs and preserve jars. When you’re ready to cash out, install a bunch of casks in your farmhouse basement, age all your stockpiled starfruit wine in them, and practice using terms like “mouthfeel” and “oaky” like you know what they mean.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b643a53411458dd02758f186a4545f2b" data-recommend-id="image://b643a53411458dd02758f186a4545f2b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->ConcernedApe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b643a53411458dd02758f186a4545f2b" data-recommend-id="image://b643a53411458dd02758f186a4545f2b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you’re coming back to <em>Stardew </em>after a while or you’re a new player, it’s worth pointing out one of the biggest new additions to the game in patch 1.6.</p><p>Once you’re updated to 1.6, a new cave appears in the forest south of your farm, about halfway down the cliffside to the east. If you try to enter it early on, it tells you that “only a master of the five ways may enter.”</p><p>This is a new endgame system in the latest patch. The five ways refer to your five skills: farming, mining, combat, foraging, and fishing. When you reach level 10 in all five, you can now enter the cave. This sets you up to unlock a number of new tools and passive buffs that grant you several solid quality-of-life bonuses for <em>Stardew</em>’s endgame. This includes the new “trinket” equipment slot, some high-end blueprints like the Treasure Totem, a new iridium-quality fishing rod and scythe, and the ability to find valuable Golden Mystery Boxes.</p><p>There are quite a few other things to see and do in patch 1.6, but the skill mastery system should be your first stop. It makes you better at all the things you were already doing and really smooths out <em>Stardew</em>’s endgame. If you’ve been neglecting combat or fishing, it’s worth grinding them up to level 10 to gain access to the mastery cave.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f1e90771a0da0dbb536b72e2cad77e84" data-recommend-id="image://f1e90771a0da0dbb536b72e2cad77e84" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->ConcernedApe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f1e90771a0da0dbb536b72e2cad77e84" data-recommend-id="image://f1e90771a0da0dbb536b72e2cad77e84" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Many long-time players will tell you that once you’ve played <em>Stardew </em>with mods, it’s hard to go back.

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance is perhaps the most realistic medieval RPG ever made. It debuted in 2018 after several years of development that began with a Kickstarter project. In the time it has been on the market, ‘KCD’ has done remarkably well, and the developer, Warhorse Studios, has just revealed that the game has sold a whopping 8 million copies.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-henry-s-come-to-see-us">Henry’s Come To See Us!</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance is a phenomenal RPG set in a real-world location – and it even sticks to events that <strong>actually happened</strong>. In this wonderful game, players lose themselves in an adventure that could last hundreds of hours and is extremely accurate in its representation of the period.</p>



<p>From true-to-life sword combat mechanics to the need to scavenge, barter, and bargain to survive, Kingdom Come Deliverance is a brilliant game for anyone wanting to immerse themselves in 15th-century Bohemia.</p>



<p>On social media, Warhorse Studios shared a brief celebration of the latest milestone:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In February, the team at Warhorse Studios will release Kingdom Come Deliverance II, a direct follow-on from the 2018 title that promises to improve on every angle of the first game.</p>



<p>When I was at Gamescom, I was fortunate enough to play an extended, press-only trial of the game, and being a fan of the first game, I was blown away. It’s everything I hoped for – and I’ll leave it at that.</p>

But the demo was built in a version of the <em>Halo</em> engine that no longer exists, and the assets were not compatible with any other existing versions of <em>Halo 2</em>.</p><p>“This put us in a bit of a quandary,” <em>Halo</em> senior franchise writer Kenneth Peters said. “Even the original executable is difficult to work with, as you need an Xbox developer kit to get it to boot, which is in increasingly short supply even within the studio. But now, in 2024, we have the Digsite-developed tools to analyze and automate up-porting old assets, and the unearthed knowledge to know why <a title="Companies > Bungie [224 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-interactive-entertainment/bungie">Bungie</a> built things the way they did in the demo.”</p><p>Peters continued, “Steven Garcia (known to the community as General_101) was vital in getting this scenario stood up and even improved over the original. He was a one-man army and did a significant chunk of the work in developing tools, updating scripts, and even arting the levels. Digsite team members Ludus, Neo Te Aika, Sean T, xScruffyDaSasquatchx, and Killzone then provided finishing touches to replicate the original demo experience and test for bugs. Without them, we would probably have only had a rather unceremonious drop of raw assets and that was it.”</p><p>Xbox Game Studios did not announce any plans to release the level for the Xbox Series or PC (<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/halo-the-master-chief-collection/9mt8ptgvhx2p" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>) versions of the game.</p><!-- AD: content -->

feedback from internal analytics, user tests, reviews, media feedback, crash reports, and more, Rechner said. He also noted that Ubisoft has seen the feedback on YouTube, Reddit, Discord, and other social media sites. "We deeply care about your experience with the game, and use all the data and feedback possible to see the friction points you are encountering, what you're enjoying, and where we can further improve certain elements that matter the most to you," Rechner said.</p><p>Ubisoft has so far released three title updates for Star Wars Outlaws that have addressed some of the "biggest concerns" from fans, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-effort-to-save-star-wars-outlaws-continues-with-huge-patch/1100-6526900/" data-ref-id="1100-6526900">bug fixes</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-update-aims-to-make-stealth-missions-less-frustrating/1100-6527363/" data-ref-id="1100-6527363">improvements for the game's stealth missions.</a> That said, Rechner explained there are three additional areas the team is looking to address. The first of these is adding "more depth and excitement" to the combat systems with the aim of "further rewarding" tactics and precision.</p><p>The second area is stealth. Rechner said includes "improving the readability and consistency of enemy detection," along with "choice in how you want to approach each encounter." Third, Rechner said the team is trying to refine the control experience, including "improving the reliability of cover," as well as making climbing and crouching more responsive. In general, Rechner said Ubisoft wants the controls overall to be more consistent.</p><p>Rechner said Ubisoft will provide "more specific details" about these changes and more in the coming weeks. The next title update, Title Update 1.4, will launch on November 21, alongside the game's debut on Steam and the launch of the game's first story expansion, Wild Card.</p><p><i>"</i>To our players, thank you again for your support and feedback, and we hope you will enjoy continuing exploring the galaxy with us," Rechner said.</p><p>After Star Wars Outlaws launched in August, Ubisoft said the game's sales were worse than expected, and noted that its teams would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">"fully mobilized" to improve the game.</a></p><p>It was <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-ca/article/18oNmwEFQzGDu0TYVOAcJN/julian-gerighty-appointed-executive-producer-for-the-division-brand" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">always the plan</a> for Gerighty to move on to become the executive producer of The Division franchise after Star Wars Outlaws was released.

		<p>Nacon and studio KT Racing have announced&nbsp; free in-game items for those who purchased and played Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown before the first major patch which was released on &nbsp;September 30th 2024.&nbsp; The goodies are compensation as the game suffered server issues when it launched with a reported 55% of players failing to log in to the game.</p>
<p>“NACON and studio KT Racing have decided to offer them two unique items: an exclusive special edition of the&nbsp;1986 Porsche 911 Carrera Coupe custom-built as an&nbsp;“Adventurer” edition, fully equipped for the island’s off-road roads, as well as a pack of 5 exclusive stickers for customizing their cars,” said Nacon in a press release.&nbsp; “This compensation will be offered to all players who played Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown before the arrival of the first major patch, which was released on September 30. These items will be automatically added to players’ inventories in December, for the opening of Season 2.”</p>


<p>Tomorrow, Tuesday, November 5th, the second patch will be released. “This update primarily focuses on graphical enhancements for PS5,” comment Nacon. “The patch also optimizes game performance on PC and Xbox Series. Additionally, it includes network upgrades, improved peripheral compatibility, and numerous bug fixes.”</p>
<p>“We understand your frustration, given the difficulties that have been encountered during the launch of TDUSC. We are sorry for this situation and we want to acknowledge your concerns. We genuinely appreciate your patience and commitment to Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown.”</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/13/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown review</a>,&nbsp; Stefan said, “After years and years of waiting, Test Drive Unlimited is back. Kind of. Solar Crown is an open world racer for gamers who don’t need constant gratification, but can be patient and work toward a key unlock and crowning car. It’s just a shame that the game at launch will require patience while KT Racing fix, improve and hopefully expand it to meet more of its potential.”</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-has-double-the-amount-of-enhanced-games-than-ps4-pro-at-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-pro-has-double-the-amount-of-enhanced-games-than-ps4-pro-at-launch.1027191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-has-double-the-amount-of-enhanced-games-than-ps4-pro-at-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PS5 Pro is fast approaching, and with it comes a ton of enhanced games that will be released on the console, offering <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-pssr-is-a-game-changer-to-bring-visual-fidelity-to-the-next-level-says-insomniac/">new graphical fidelity</a> options and upgrades to make it a worthwhile experience to play on that console rather than the ordinary PS5. The list of PS5 Pro-enhanced games is already pretty hefty and continues to grow. As a matter of fact, it's double the list of games that the PS4 Pro had when it launched. When the PS4 Pro launched, it had over 40 enhanced games, with the console being released in November 2016. So far, the PS5 Pro has a <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2024/11/03/ps5-pro-enhanced-games-double-than-ps4-pro-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed list of over 80 games</a> thus far, with the console officially launching on November 7.</p>
<p>There is already quite a hefty list of games that will be available on the PS5 Pro, with quite a few of them bound to be a smoother experience overall than the experience you'd ordinarily have on the PS5. This is due to updates and hardware that will help make the game run smoother. While PC has generally been seen as the advantageous platform to choose from, in modern days, games typically run better on console at launch, as there is a lot less to consider when patching the game and making updates for compatibility.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no guarantee that games will look or even feel better on the PS5 Pro, but you'd certainly hope so, as that is what you're paying for. It will be a matter of "wait and see," but there is a great catalog of games available for those who are planning on picking up the new and improved PS5. Some of these games had some issues on the PS5 when the titles were released, so it'll be interesting to see that once the PS5 Pro comes out, they will have improved performance after all. It's worth noting that some of these games haven't been released yet, so the PS5 Pro enhancements at launch apply to the launch of the game in this case rather than the console.</p>
<p>Games such as Baldur's Gate 3, Demon's Souls, Dragon's Dogma 2, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered are some that will be ready for the PS5 Pro when it launches and will provide new graphical updates and smoother performance. Considering that there were complaints about performance for both Dragon's Dogma 2 and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it will certainly be interesting to see if the PS5 Pro version of the game helps to improve it in any way.</p>

H2<em> </em>With Sprinkles and <em>Halo 2: Uncut</em> don’t just aim to expand the original game, but they aspire to do so by restoring content that was seen in previous builds of the original, with new weapons, vehicles, and redesigned encounters.</p><h2 id="h8377"><a id=""></a><em>H2</em> With Sprinkles</h2><p>I’d argue that for every addition <em>Halo 2</em> made to the game’s core gameplay, it also suffered from some not-so-great omissions. Chief among them? The damn Assault Rifle.</p><figure id="" data-id="cc0d069b44788f60268c04a3f5970c46" data-recommend-id="image://cc0d069b44788f60268c04a3f5970c46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Master Chief fires an Assault Rifle during the opening of Halo 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Master Chief fires an Assault Rifle during the opening of Halo 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Halo Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc0d069b44788f60268c04a3f5970c46" data-recommend-id="image://cc0d069b44788f60268c04a3f5970c46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Master Chief fires an Assault Rifle during the opening of Halo 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em>’s Assault Rifle doesn’t necessarily perform like a modern <em>Call of Duty</em> bullet hose—it’s a bit more old-school and less accurate than what you’d find in a shooter today. But the gun’s thunderous bullet output, unique visual stylings and readable on-weapon bullet counter made for a signature look that shouldn’t have waited until <em>Halo 3</em> to rejoin the series. <em>Halo 2</em> yanked the assault rifle in favor of the more dull-looking and crappier-sounding SMG. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3005851002&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3005851002" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">H2 With Sprinkles fixes that</a></span> by adding the Assault Rifle back, thank god. And I’d argue it’s not a redundant admission next to the SMG. The presence of the Assault Rifle means that you can go back to a run-and-gun style of gameplay with high bullet output that doesn’t sacrifice grenade throws like dual-wielding an SMG does. </p><p>There are a few other notable new guns too: Alongside the traditional three-round-burst Battle Rifle, H2 With Sprinkles adds a single-shot Battle Rifle, as seen in the very <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.halopedia.org/Halo_2_E3_demo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.halopedia.org/Halo_2_E3_demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first demo for the game in 2003</a></span>. There’s also a satisfying automatic, portable plasma cannon that deals plenty of damage before needing to cool down. </p><figure id="" data-id="50b67046d9faeeb931fa59d1dc7d2024" data-recommend-id="image://50b67046d9faeeb931fa59d1dc7d2024" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Scorpion tank takes aim at a Covenant transport vehicle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Scorpion tank takes aim at a Covenant transport vehicle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Halo Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="50b67046d9faeeb931fa59d1dc7d2024" data-recommend-id="image://50b67046d9faeeb931fa59d1dc7d2024" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Scorpion tank takes aim at a Covenant transport vehicle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Perhaps my favorite addition, however, is the boost in friendly NPC forces when you land on Earth. Compared to <em>Combat Evolved</em>’s larger spaces, particularly on levels like “The Silent Cartographer” and “Assault on the Control Room,” <em>Halo 2</em> sometimes feels a little too empty, with smaller-scale battles. Extra marines and vehicles, however, make the entire tone of the fight on Earth feel more epic. This is particularly the case with the beach battles on “Outskirts,” and the vehicular showdown toward the end of “Metropolis.”</p><p>There are a few rough edges to be aware of, however. For example, the newly added Assault Rifle shows up as a Battle Rifle on the HUD and the mod skips the opening cutscenes. To be honest, that last part works out for me as I find <em>Halo 2</em>’s intro to be a bit of a drag.</p><h2 id="h8378"><a id=""></a><em>Halo 2: Uncut</em></h2><p>If you want something more than new guns and increased characters on screen, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2898973963&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2898973963" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Halo 2: Uncut</em></a></span> offers a look at a version of <em>Halo 2</em> from an alternate timeline. The mod features new weapons such as a silenced SMG, various guns inspired by the game’s beta, and extra vehicles such as the Mongoose and driveable Shadows (the transport vehicles that only serve as set-dressing in “Metropolis”).</p><figure id="" data-id="1b3f439e137e7339f5eaa410d11d5d28" data-recommend-id="image://1b3f439e137e7339f5eaa410d11d5d28" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Master Chief looks up at a Falcon ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Master Chief looks up at a Falcon ship." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Halo Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1b3f439e137e7339f5eaa410d11d5d28" data-recommend-id="image://1b3f439e137e7339f5eaa410d11d5d28" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Master Chief looks up at a Falcon ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The mod also aspires to change the flow of some levels. “Outskirts,” for example, sees Seargant Johnson leave your company earlier via a Falcon, with redesigned encounters following the courtyard sequence.

<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure is finally here, bringing Max Caulfield back to our screens after almost a decade. Aside from a brief reappearance in the Before the Storm ‘prequel episode’, this is the first major appearance of Max Caulfield in a Life is Strange game since the first title debuted in 2015.</p>



<p>I had the phenomenal opportunity to sit down with Hannah Telle, Max Caulfield’s actor, to talk about the impact of returning to this iconic character after so many years.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="INTERVIEW: Hannah Telle Talks Life is Strange: Double Exposure" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ahYHgKBFat4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-return-of-the-max">Return of the Max</h2>



<p>Double Exposure is already becoming a fan-favourite title studded with twists, turns, and emotional sequences—much like the other games in the series. It was assembled by Deck Nine over three years and is a direct follow-up to the episodic game released in 2015.</p>



<p>The difference is, that this is a one-shot game – there are chapters but no iterative episodes to download or wait for.</p>



<p>Hannah walked me through the changes she had to take on board to ensure that an ‘older’ Max Caulfield was properly represented in Double Exposure:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I was so excited that people wanted to see more Max and that she was going to get to continue her story. I love this character and I hold her very dear to my heart.</p>



<p>I knew that there would be a lot of people who had very strong opinions about what they thought Max would be like as an older person. I had a lot of pressure and wanted to make sure that the fans would be happy. </p>



<p>I also wanted to make sure that I stayed true to this character’s organic trajectory, and I really related to her journey of experiencing some success as an artist.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While many people expected a new Life is Strange title, not many could have predicted the return of Max Caulfield. In our interview, Hannah explained how she had to go off the radar and become very vague about her life as Square Enix facilitated a relocation across the country from California to Colorado to work on Double Exposure in the utmost secrecy.</p>



<p>By the end of the development cycle, Hannah had spent three years working on motion capture and various avenues of voice acting for Double Exposure’s Max Caulfield.</p>



<p>It’s not the end for Max, though. At the end of Life is Strange: Double Exposure, players are advised that the character will return in the next game – but Hannah was tight-lipped about that:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In terms of the future, I don’t know anything, but I’m really, really excited, and I hope Max is coming back, and that we get to learn more about her future and her inner world, and I think she’s got worlds within her.</p>



<p>There’s so much to explore with her, and I’m just excited to see where she ends up. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>In case you were wondering, in a world where powers are possible, Hannah Telle would opt to become invisible at will, using that power to spy on people and be present without anyone knowing she was there. </p>
