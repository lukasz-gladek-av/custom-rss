		<p>The Game Bakers have announced a new release date for their mountain climbing game Cairn, which was delayed back in September as the team needed more time. The new release date for Cairn is January 29th, when it will be released for PC and PS5. Ahead of the full release, you can play the Cairn demo on Steam and PS5 to get an idea of what to expect on your climb of Kami.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cairn - Launch Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x6KWhvvk3bM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Game Bakers has also revealed the details of the Deluxe Edition, along with pricing for the different versions of the game. The Cairn Deluxe Edition will include a Kami travel book, wallpapers, and three keepsakes that can be added to main character Aava’s rucksack. Both versions will have a 10% launch discount with the standard edition priced at $26.99/26.99€ / £22.99 / JP¥3060 / CN¥98 and the Deluxe Edition priced at $34.20/ 34.20€ / £28.60 / JP¥3924 / CN¥129.</p>
<p>In Cairn, players climb the mountain Kami as explorer Aava. On this journey, Aava will find traces of past climbs, historical artefacts that tell the story of the mountain, and run into other climbers who are on their own journeys. Cairn is a realistic climbing simulator where you will need to guide Aava to suitable holds for her hands and feet, while also maintaining balance so she does not fall off of Mount Kami.</p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>According to a report by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-wins-the-warner-bros-discovery-bidding-war-enters-exclusive-deal-talks/"><em>TheWrap</em></a>, Netflix is now entering exclusive talks to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, having outbid other competitors for the&nbsp;<em>Batman</em>-owning megacorp. If the deal goes through, rumored to be at $30 a share, it would mean the streaming giant would own everything from HBO to DC comics, including all your favorite Lego and <em>Batman</em> games.</p> <p>Warner Bros. boss David Zaslav has been making it clear he wants to sell the company for a good while now, but holding out for a big exit. In October this year he <a href="https://kotaku.com/holy-monopoly-batman-warner-bros-reportedly-reject-a-buyout-bid-from-paramount-2000634581">turned down a bid from Paramount</a> said to be at $20 a share, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-12/warner-bros-is-said-to-rebuff-paramount-takeover-approach"><em>Bloomberg</em> claiming</a> the CEO was holding out for 50 percent higher. That valuation seemed crazy, and it was assumed that Paramount came in much lower to test the waters, with the expectation of either a $25 per share bid to follow, or more hostile takeover moves. However, instead, it seems Netflix has swooped in with that $30 offer thus won the war.</p>

 <h2>What are the implications of this deal?</h2> <p>If the deal goes through, this would mean streaming giant Netflix would own one of its big rivals, HBO Max, and presumably look to merge the two services. It would also own Warner’s entire movie business including New Line Cinema, all of DC Entertainement, the Discovery network of channels, and multiple networks like CNN, TBS, TNT and the Cartoon Network. And, of course, Warner Bros. Games.</p>

 <p>In a normal universe, this would be the sort of deal that would be tangled in monopolistic concerns for years to come, as people questioned the unparalleled power this could offer Netflix over multiple industries. However, given other recent mergers that have taken place after, um, payments made to the Trump orbit, what might happen is anyone’s guess. However, earlier talk last month of the potential deal between Netflix and Warner <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-warner-bros-bid-antitrust-concerns-darrell-issa-letter/">resulted in antitrust concerns being raised</a>, and certainly there will be a lot of fight from those concerned how the deal could affect Hollywood.</p>

 <p>Yet, at the same time, Paramount was allowed to merge with Skydance and Disney was allowed to buy Fox, so Netflix has plenty of precedent to argue from. As it happens, it could be Paramount that objects the loudest to the Netflix deal, given how it and so many others had assumed it would get Warner eventually, and the company is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/04/paramount-questions-warner-bros-discovery-sale-process-letter.html">already questioning the “fairness and adequacy”</a> of the process. A Warner attorney wrote, “It has become increasingly clear, through media reporting and otherwise, that WBD appears to have abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process, thereby abdicating its duties to stockholders, and embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder.”</p>

 <h2>A messy breakup for gaming?</h2> <p>The Netflix deal also makes another aspect of Warner Bros. Discovery more interesting. <a href="https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-separate-two-leading-media-companies">Zaslav had appeared determined to break up the company</a> such that its linear cable channel businesses would be separated from the rest, and then that loss-making sector take all the company’s debt with it. Because that’s legal I guess. However, while Paramount likely wouldn’t want to end up owning a bunch of profitless cable channels, for Netflix the vast number of new shows to stream could be a real boon. Not only would it have everything on HBO Max, but also be able to strip-mine the remaining cable channels for extra content.</p>

 <p>At the same time, the deal could be very concerning for games players, given <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-gaming-hades-monument-vally-golden-idol-braid-1851785038">Netflix’s very clear backward step from anything other than mobile gaming</a>. Its owning the studios that develop the <em>Arkham</em> and&nbsp;<em>Lego</em> games could mean bad times for console players if the pattern continues.</p> <p>There’s obviously a lot of fighting to come, and presumably some hefty legal challenges from those who feel dropped at the altar, let alone the antitrust maneuvers. But given [broad sweeping gesture], it won’t be in the least bit surprising to see it happening sooner rather than later.</p>

But fan discussion has now centered on the fact this amiibo also unlocks a jukebox feature for Samus' Vi-O-La motorbike, which allows you to hear other themes from the game.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/samus-1764933522137.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The amiibo - Samus - Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Series costs $29.99.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Discussion around the rights and wrongs of Nintendo providing extra features for amiibo owners is nothing new, and dozens of Nintendo games include exclusive additions for people who own associated figurines (or borrow them from friends). Additionally, in this case, there have also been a number of inaccuracies shared over the radio's usage, with some reports incorrectly stating that it includes otherwise exclusive music, or that the bike's main Sol Valley area is silent otherwise. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's true that the Sol Valley's etheral, ambient music is relatively sparse — the desert-like area is meant to be a wasteland, after all, and a notably different environment from the game's main areas that Samus once again explores on foot. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, some fans have suggested that it would have been nice to have the option of turning on the in-game radio without buying a $29.99 toy, which — while a familiar argument for Nintendo games with amiibo-exclusive features — seems fair enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Couldn't they have given us that jukebox mode in the first place instead of having us buy an accessory to unluck said jukebox mode?" wrote Nintendo fan knightedwolf851 on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/casualnintendo/comments/1pdpg1j/it_seems_you_will_be_able_to_put_music_in_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>.

"It is a cosmetic that doesn't impact the game.

            <p>Banjo-Kazooie is now playable on PlayStation - at least, a fan-made version created in Dreams - and it's even caught the eye of Rare.</p>
<p>Banjo-Kazooie: Mumbomania has been created by William Butkevicius, and is just a single level made in homage to the N64 platformer. Butkevicius, incidentally, is a level designer at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ori-and-the-blind-forest">Ori and the Blind Forest</a> developer Moon Studios, who created this project in their spare time.</p>
<p>Butkevicius described it as a "labour of love", but doesn't have plans to add to it. "I'd like to move away from big Dreams projects now, so unless I get the opportunity to work on an official Banjo-Threeie (which I would be thrilled to), this is it for now," Butkevicius wrote on social media. Rare, are you listening?</p>

<p>Well actually, it is. The studio shared Butkevicius' post, stating: "Put our fanciest hat on just so we could tip it to this. Incredible work!"</p>
<p>Gregg Mayles, Banjo-Kazooie's director (who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banjo-kazooie-director-officially-leaves-rare-following-everwild-cancellation">recently left Rare</a>), also <a href="https://x.com/Ghoulyboy/status/1996694869297795109?s=20">shared the post</a> calling it "splendid", while <a href="https://x.com/grantkirkhope/status/1996298038286111087?s=20">composer Grant Kirkhope</a> shared it with the googly eyes emoji.</p>

<p>Butkevicius' video shows the iconic bear and bird exploring an island level reminiscent of Treasure Trove Cove - it even has that terrifying shark. There are musical notes and jiggies (30!) to collect, platforming challenges and puzzles, and new characters to meet.</p><p>Perhaps most notable are the new transformations, including a rock golem and a skeletal fish. It took Butkevicius around 14 months and over 800 hours of work to create, adding: "A lot of the concepts were born out of issues I had with the original game, like 'the transformations don't feel fun enough to use', or 'going to the hut to transform is tedious' and then tons of iteration to find good solutions!"</p>
<p>There's some great jaunty music too from composer Duckenomics and brass ensemble The Game Brass, while PieceofCraft assisted with sculpting, animation, and logic.</p>
<p>The original Banjo-Kazooie was released for the N64 27 years ago and the last new release was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/banjo-kazooie-nuts-bolts">Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts</a> in 2008 for Xbox 360. It's clear the original game has left a lasting impression, but could we see a new game in the series in future?</p>
<p>It seems unlikely, considering Mayles' recent departure from Rare. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banjo-kazooie-sequel-chances-better-than-zero-but-not-much-says-composer-grant-kirkhope">Kirkhope also told Eurogamer there's "better than zero but not much" of a chance</a> the bird and bear will return.</p>
<p>The project is also a reminder that Media Molecule's Dreams is still up and running. A report last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dreams-pc-playstation-5-ports-reportedly-canned">claimed PC and PS5 versions of the game were in development</a>, but were later canned.</p>

            <p>The next <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> patch will finally remove all glamour restrictions, even though Yoshi-P isn't really a fan of it.</p>
<p>Glamouring essentially allows players to combine the visuals of their favourite armour with the stats of something better - transmog, basically. However, players can only glamour within the Job they're playing as, so your White Mage can wear any other White Mage outfit but can't dress as a Dragoon.</p>
<p>That's all set to change in Patch 7.4, out later this month, which is great news for fashion fans - the real endgame of Final Fantasy 14. However, it seems director and producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has agreed to the change reluctantly.</p>

<p>The decision not to allow this type of glamour until now wasn't due to technicalities, but Yoshida's personal taste.</p>
<p>"I felt more strongly than anyone else that we had to cherish the Final Fantasy worldview," Yoshida told <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/59484">Famitsu</a> (translation via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/ff14s-yoshi-p-reveals-why-hes-finally-lifting-glamour-restrictions-hes-got-his-own-preferences-but-its-no-longer-the-time-to-force-them-on-players/">PC Gamer</a>). "I felt that the way Final Fantasy should be is for Dragoons to be able to equip their character in that style, and to be able to hold their spear and strike the 'Kain pose' [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-iv">Final Fantasy 4</a>'s iconic Dragoon]. It's the job's identity, so to speak. The core of that feeling hasn't changed much even now."</p><p>However, he noted there are "very few games that have the same limitations as Final Fantasy 14 in terms of enjoying fashion", although he added if he were in charge of a free-to-play game he'd naturally want players to buy items without restrictions.</p>
<p>Yoshida has been playing games from other companies and now understands, in this modern era, what players want may differ to his own preference. For instance, he plays as a Black Mage and wouldn't want his character to wear other armour.</p>
<p>"These are my own roleplaying rules, so I have decided them arbitrarily," he said. "I reconsidered and decided that it would be pointless to impede the roleplaying of people who say, 'My character is the coolest and cutest in the world. I want to dress up even more,' by [forcing them to follow] my own rules.</p>
<p>"I'm fine with being particular about my own preferences, and I'm sure there are many others who feel the same way, but that doesn't mean that the system should restrict the motivation of people who are particular about dressing up."</p><p>Another reason for the change is to combat the use of mods. Yoshida has been adamant about not allowing mod-use in Final Fantasy 14, which reached a peak earlier this year when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-most-controversial-third-party-plugin-used-for-in-game-stalking-has-been-shut-down">a controversial third-party plugin used for in-game stalking was shut down</a>.</p>
<p>Some players used mods to alter their character's appearance - most notably the Mare Synchronos mod, whose creators were <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/final-fantasy/legal-inquiry-shuts-down-one-of-final-fantasy-14s-most-popular-mods-adding-yet-another-blurry-line-in-the-sand-from-square-enix/">sent a cease and desist earlier this year</a>. Now the game itself has been altered to appease players.</p>
<p>What's more, the change is an offer of goodwill to players. When, anecdotally, the MMORPG has seen a reduction in player count since the release of the less well-received expansion Dawntrail, this change to glamouring will likely be a popular change - and give an extra incentive to explore everything in the game in the search for the right outfit.</p>
<p><a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/dawntrail/patch_7_4/">Patch 7.4, Into The Mist</a>, will be released on 16th December, extending the story and bringing various other additions as expected with each patch. Next year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> will host multiple Fan Fest events as it prepares to launch the next expansion, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-us-fan-fest-event-square-enix-accessibility-disabled-players">disabled fans in the US fear their accessibility needs won't be met</a>.</p>

            <p>It looks as though Epic is getting over its aversion to showing male nipples in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>
<p>The discussion around Fortnite's lack of nipples on its shirtless characters famously began after a Travis Scott concert was held in-game, with the <a href="https://x.com/Fresh/status/1252792137143312384">topless singer sporting some very smooth pecs</a>.</p>
<p>However, you may recall last month, a then-leak revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-homer-simpson-going-to-be-the-first-character-skin-to-get-his-nipples-out-in-fortnite">Homer Simpson would be getting his own nipples out in Epic's shooter</a>, thanks to a skin of the yellow patriarch in his underwear. In Homer's case, his nipples were just two black dots on his chest.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>But now it seems Homer was in fact a vessel for change. As spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-really-does-seem-to-have-changed-its-nipple-policy-and-now-its-not-just-homer-simpsons-chest-thats-in-the-game">IGN</a>, a new battle pass skin for Carter Wu shows a shirtless Fortnite model complete with actual nipples. Unlike Homer's cartoonish pec specs, though, these nipples are actually (for Fortnite) quite anatomically accurate, with detailed areola.</p>
<p>You can check out how Carter Wu's Fortnite nipples look in the reddit embed below.</p>
<p>So, has Homer Simpson started a new wave of nipples in Fortnite? What a triumph to add to his ever growing list of achievements (I mean, this man has gone to space, become a professional boxer and stopped nuclear meltdowns).</p>

</span></p><p>As for Fortnite more generally, it recently made headlines after players discovered what they believed to be AI-generated images within the game. In a Reddit post entitled "Say 'No' to AI slop, a billion-dollar company should have no problem supporting real artists for real art", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-fans-are-saying-no-to-ai-slop-after-spotting-what-they-believe-are-ai-generated-images-in-game">Fortnite players shared their thoughts on a number of alleged AI-generated images</a>, including in-game posters and sprays.</p>

<p>"AI adoption can face strong resistance in creative areas"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="95589e4db57d8"><a title="Sega Will &quot;Carefully Assess Appropriate Use Cases&quot; When It Comes To AI 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/95589e4db57d8/sega-will-carefully-assess-appropriate-use-cases-when-it-comes-to-ai-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://x.com/IDWPublishing">Sega / IDW</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>While rivals such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/ea-is-diving-headfirst-into-generative-ai-with-new-partnership">Electronic Arts</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/ubisoft-is-all-in-on-generative-ai-says-its-as-big-a-leap-in-tech-as-the-shift-to-3d">Ubisoft</a> have jumped into the world of Generative AI development with both feet, not every company in the games industry is willing to throw caution to the wind.</p>
<p>During a Q&amp;A session following its recent Q2 financial results, Sega‘s top brass addressed the use of AI when it comes to making games (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sega-says-it-will-use-ai-in-game-development-but-only-in-appropriate-use-cases/">VGC</a>) and how it will help tackle the increasing costs of development.</p>
<p>Sega's response was as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rather than fully following the trend toward the large-scale development, we will also pursue efficiency improvements, such as leveraging AI. However, as AI adoption can face strong resistance in creative areas such as character creation, we will proceed by carefully assess appropriate use cases, such as streamlining development processes."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So, while Sega certainly isn't against turning to AI to streamline production, it doesn't look like it will be embracing it with quite the same vigour as other companies.</p>
<p>While Generative AI models are powerful tools, they are often trained on the work of artists, musicians, filmmakers<span>, and animators without permission or remuneration. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/openai-is-trying-to-get-sued-nintendo-ip-floods-sora-2-video-generation-app">Many models have been found to produce</a></span> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/openai-is-trying-to-get-sued-nintendo-ip-floods-sora-2-video-generation-app">copyright-infringing results with minimal effort.</a></p>
<p>Nintendo has previously stated that it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/dont-worry-nintendo-likely-wont-utilise-generative-ai-in-its-game-development">doesn't currently intend</a> to use Generative AI in its own games, citing "issues with intellectual property rights" as one of the main reasons for avoiding it.</p>

		<p>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun developer Auroch Digital has announced its next FPS, and you will be shooting at aliens but not in the Warhammer universe. This time, Auroch Digital has turned its attention to Starship Troopers announcing Starship Troopers: Ultimate Bug War, which is a single player retro styled FPS where players will shoot a lot of bugs to do their part.</p>

		<p>Well, I don’t think anyone was expecting a new Carmageddon game to be announced, and yet 34BigThings has revealed Carmageddon: Rogue Shift. The new Carmageddon game is a roguelite racer where vehicular combat is central to every event. Players will have a number of different vehicle bodies and weapon types to use to build their own deadly racer. You can see some of the gameplay in the announcement trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Carmageddon: Rogue Shift - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7mFmSbChgC8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is set in the year 2050, where the streets are overrun by the Wasted at night, meaning humanity has to shelter in their homes during the dark. That is unless they are a street racer looking for money, prestige, and a chance to get off of the planet to safety. Carmageddon: Rogue Shift will feature 15 vehicles, a mix of FWD, RWD, and AWD, with each having their own unique stats. There are also 13 weapon classes from shotguns to rocket launchers, and these are upgradeable too. Players will also have access to over 80 perks to further customise vehicle loadouts as they race across tracks that have a dynamic weather and day and night cycle. All campaigns will be unique as the events are randomly generated, with players taking part in races to boss battles as progress is made. In each event players will sustain damage so it planning routes to the shops dotted around will also be key, to make repairs and buy upgrades.</p>
<p>A pre-registration event is also taking place on the <a href="https://playcarmageddon.com/#unlock-rewards">Carmageddon: Rogue Shift&nbsp;</a>website, where players can unlock rewards for the game. Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is due to release in early 2026 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/gta-6-will-release-before-the-elder-scrolls-vi-todd-howard-practically-confirms/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Will Rockstar's GTA 6 be released before The Elder Scrolls VI? That's the question posed to Bethesda Creative Director Todd Howard <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRzIJQ-CGtt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Power Unlimited</a> on a red carpet for the presentation of the second season of Amazon's Fallout TV series, which airs on Prime Video starting on December 17.</p>



<p>Howard suggested GTA 6 would indeed launch before his studio's next big project. He then went on to profess his great respect and admiration for Rockstar's work.</p>



<p><em><strong>What game do you think releases sooner? Is it GTA 6, is it The Elder Scrolls VI, or is it Fallout 5?</strong></em></p>



<p><em>I got my fingers crossed for GTA 6. </em></p>



<p><strong><em>Do you think it will really come next year?</em></strong></p>



<p><em>I do. They are doing an incredible job. I know the folks at Rockstar and I think they are some of the absolute best at bringing a virtual world to life. It's a world that feels like it would go on even if you weren't there.</em></p>



<p>It's high praise from Howard, but then again, gamers who have experience with both franchises are aware of some similarities. While The Elder Scrolls is, of course, a roleplaying game and Grand Theft Auto is not, both try to achieve world simulations that are among the best in the industry.</p>



<p>Regarding the release window prediction, it isn't too much of a shock. Fallout 5 was never a realistic chance, as it remains in pre-production while Bethesda focuses on finishing The Elder Scrolls VI. Plus, it's not even been a whole month since Todd Howard himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told fans</a> that TES VI is 'still a long way off'.</p>



<p>Granted, on that occasion, he also teased that he'd love to make it 'just appear' when it's ready, but the chances that he'll be able to do that before November 19, 2026, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the new GTA VI release date</a>, are slim to none. There are still some people who believe Rockstar may delay the next Grand Theft Auto yet another time, but it's unlikely. They've never delayed a game three times in their entire history so far.</p>



<p>As for The Elder Scrolls VI, the track record of Bethesda Game Studios tells us that it took them nearly four years between The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and then another four years between The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Fallout 4 (which just <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-all-dlc-creation-club-content-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> its Anniversary Edition to celebrate the 10th anniversary). Sure, Fallout 76 (just <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-update-now-live-adding-the-ghoul-from-the-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updated</a> with the largest map expansion to date and The Ghoul character from the TV show) launched only three years later, but that was essentially Fallout 4 modded to support multiplayer and set in Appalachia. </p>



<p>Starfield took five years to make, but it happened during COVID and it was also the first sci-fi game made by the developer, not to mention their first new IP in 25 years. They had to create the whole space travel and combat systems. It stands to reason that TES VI will require four years, thus putting its target window to around late 2027. On the other hand, GTA 6 will most likely be released in November 2026, and even if it slips a bit, it wouldn't be delayed beyond the end of Take-Two's fiscal quarter (March 31).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone, raise your glass and let’s make a toast to The FINALS, as it’s quite literally introduced a weapon skin that makes toast as you’re playing a match.</p>



<p>Just when you think you’ve seen every kind of wacky cosmetic in a live-service shooter, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-finals-current-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The FINALS</a> comes along and boots all expectations out of the window and into the kitchen—next to your toaster. If the thrill of killing and scoring points doesn’t satiate your appetite, then a new toast-making skin might.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-finals-players-are-toast-thanks-to-new-skin">The FINALS Players Are Toast, Thanks To New Skin</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A real breadwinner. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’ve fallen out of love with the P90 or need a new exercise to use it, Embark might interest you with the new Toast &amp; Roast Skin.</p>



<p>When you want to reload, simply insert bread. Hilariously, the longer you fire the gun and the more you burn through your ammo clip, the more the bread will cook—Ergo, the more it will toast.</p>







<p>Should you suddenly be overcome by full, unadulterated, and unfilmed bullet-spewing menace, barreling through a full clip will completely incinerate your toast: Taking it from a well-toasted snack to a charred mess.</p>



<p>It’s a genius skin, and fits in with the arcadey and kooky nature of The FINALS.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It would look out of place in Call of Duty or Battlefield, that’s for sure. Is it your new favorite skin in The FINALS? If you still play The FINALS, what keeps drawing you in compared to all the other new shooters released in 2025?</p>



<p>As always, please head to the free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> to express your thoughts, whether about The FINALS or anything else!</p>

<figure data-uuid="7c30e4405c23d"><a title="samus Aran Varia Suit Chogokin" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7c30e4405c23d/samus-aran-varia-suit-chogokin.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bandai Spirits</em></figcaption></figure><p>Now that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is finally in the wild (still feels weird to be able to type that) and given that it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">another excellent entry</a> in this phenomenal series, you may well be feeling like now's the time for some fancy Metroid merch.</p>
<p>Well, say no more because (and thanks to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2025/12/03/samus-aran-finally-gets-the-chogokin-toy-she-deserves-next-year/">Forbes</a> for the heads-up) Bandai Spirits has announced a very appealing diecast 'Samus Aran in Varia Suit' model that's got us morphing in and out of ball mode furiously over here. Whatever that means.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, it is very nice. We agree. Standing at 21cm, there's a whole lot of lovely diecast metal here, and with lights accentuating all of the most important and iconic elements, such as Samus' great big cannon (so batteries required). We've also got lots of nice moveable joints, so you can recreate all your most frequent in-game poses (for this writer that's just Samus' death pose).</p>


<p>We've been over <a href="https://tamashiiweb.com/item/15649/?wovn=en">on the official website</a>, and the price is set at 30,800 yen (that's around £148 or $198) and you can also pre-order on the <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/goods/VM_NSJ_8_A3AA2">official Nintendo site</a>. However! Fly in the ointment klaxon. The pre-orders, which went live yesterday AM, are Japan-only for now. Although we can't see it being very long before you're able to get yourself one imported from either the main Bandai Spirits website or another vendor.</p>
<p>The expected release date for the model is May 2026. Ooooft. It would have looked so good on top of the Christmas tree, too. Maybe next year.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cejqzkpu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

		<p>A big cinematic story trailer has been released for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dawn-of-war-iv">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV</a>, revealing some of the alien races that you’ll battle and a surprise Space Marine team-up in the fight for the future of the planet Kronus.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV - Story Trailer | PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ja6IOle_Thg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The planet Kronus was the setting for the second DLC campaign for the original Dawn of War game, and this leads us back to battling some familiar foes. Co-written by Black Library author John French, the story sees Kronus beset by an Ork infestation, now with two rival Ork Warbosses vying for power, while the Necrons are emerging from their tombs beneath the surface, as well as with an invasion fleet appearing above.</p>
<p>That’s a lot for a Space Marine Chapter to deal with, as formidable as they all are, so it’s a good thing that they’ll be getting a hand. The Adeptus Mechanicus will feature in the game, and the Dark Angels are also turning to to ally themselves with the Blood Ravens. You’ll get to play as both chapters, with Company Master Astoran and Chaplain Ezrael leading the Dark Angels into the fray. They’ve also teased that Dark Angels Primarch Lion El’Jonson could be playable at some point in the campaign, which would be a landmark moment for 40K in general, not just video games!</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV has been entrusted to Iron Harvest developer King Art Games and publisher Deep Silver. It’s a new leaf for the franchise, which was created by Relic Entertainment way back in 2004 and defined a new style of real time strategy with less focus on resource gathering and base building, and more on controlling the map and battlefield. Dawn of War enjoyed a good few expansions before Dawn of War 2 explored a more tactical approach in 2009, and Dawn of War 3 sought to blend them all together.</p>

<p>The interest in having King Art work on Dawn of War IV was organised by Games Workshop <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dawn-of-war-4-devs-on-taking-over-from-relic-the-health-of-real-time-strategy-and-reviving-a-legend-of-the-genre">some time before Iron Harvest’s release in 2020.</a> It’s not known if GW initially wanted to stick with Relic, but that time frame would have been around the time that Relic was focussed on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/25/age-of-empires-4-review/">Age of Empires IV</a> and later <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/company-of-heroes-3">Company of Heroes 3</a>. Relic has since gone through the tumult of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/relic-entertainment-confirm-layoffs-affecting-121-employees/">layoffs while under Sega’s ownership in 2023</a>, and then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/sega-cuts-another-240-uk-jobs-relic-entertainment-goes-independent/">independence with an investor buyout in 2024</a>. They had plenty of things going on, in other words, but King Art had proven themselves with their steampunk RTS and could be great new stewards for this series. We look forward to seeing more in the run up to its 2026 release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Amidst the veritable sea of announcements (<a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-tyndalston-story-open-world-game-protagonist-fighting-out-of-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samson</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hello-sunshine-preview-you-the-desert-and-your-giant-robot-best-friend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hello Sunshine</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/intriguing-sci-fi-first-person-bullet-hell-game-luna-abyss-gets-2026-launch-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luna Abyss</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv-shown-in-new-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dawn of War IV</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/survival-pirate-adventure-game-crosswind-gets-rebranded-to-windrose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crosswind/Windrose</a>, to name a few) from the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2025 showcase, SOL Shogunate certainly stood out among the most impressive.</p>



<p>Small independent developer Chaos Manufacturing reimagines the sci-fi genre in samurai fashion. In this 'space opera action RPG', a powerful shogunate rules a colonized solar system. However, it's about to be challenged by protagonist Yuzuki, the broken heir of a once-powerful samurai family that was massacred by a rival clan. With no choice left but to become an outlaw ronin, Yuzuki seeks to carve a bloody path of vengeance with a traditional ronin arsenal reforged for the battlefields of the future. As the game unfolds, new abilities and skill combinations are unlocked, enabling evolving tactics against increasingly challenging foes.</p>



<p>Yuzuki will explore the so-called Lunar Glass cities of SOL Shogunate, where artificial gravity and simulated night-time provide an Earth-like experience for the Moon's inhabitants, who also enjoy infrastructural wonders such as space elevators and high-speed rails. But beneath the bright skylines and opulent districts of the wealthy lie sprawling industrial zones where workers toil unseen to sustain the shogunate's pervasive influence.</p>



<p>According to the people behind SOL Shogunate, each metropolis on the Moon draws inspiration from a different era of Japanese history. To navigate these vertical districts, players must use gravity-assist gear. They will also uncover hidden layers within each biome and discover clues that unlock the mysteries of the game's backstory.</p>



<p>The developers at Chaos Manufacturing have designed combat to be all about precision, timing, and adaptability. Yuzuki is meant to feel like the ultimate space samurai, albeit genetically modified for the future of combat. Players will get to choose between various weapon types and can channel different types of energy into attacks to expose weaknesses, stagger foes, and create new tactical opportunities. As Yuzuki's abilities grow and her enhancements, like bio-ceramic skin and enhanced vision, evolve, new techniques shift how battles flow and how players overcome increasingly dangerous enemies.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The pinnacle of combat encounters are, of course, the boss fights. The studio promises dynamic, cinematic, multi-phase boss encounters that challenge players to identify and exploit weaknesses. Meanwhile, the music changes as battles intensify, featuring dynamic tracks hand-crafted for the game by talented recording artists, including Japanese rock band AliA.</p>



<p>SOL Shogunate is still in early development, but we already know the game will be released on PC and consoles. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219360/SOL_Shogunate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a> also lists the surprisingly low system requirements.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PS5 Price, Explained—How Much Does It Cost On PlayStation 5?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-price/</link>
            <guid>1374076</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re wondering whether a year-old Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on PS5 still has a high price, you might be in for some turbulence. This guide has details on the game’s full price and the different editions you can pick up.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-release-date-early-access-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on PS5</a> isn’t a free in-flight meal, far from it. Originally an Xbox and PC title, MSFS 2024 arrives on PS5 with all the updates and content additions that have landed over the last 12-plus months. But don’t think Xbox Game Studios and Microsoft will go easy on you, PlayStation owners.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-does-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-cost">How Much Does Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PS5 Cost?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Xbox Game Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Standard Edition for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on PS5 has a fairly routine $69.99 or £69.99 price.</strong></p>



<p>No discount, no price reduction, it’s a full-priced port on PlayStation. It is a premium property with a ton of content, though, so it’s worth the price of admission. When you also consider that this is the first entry in the series’ 40-year history to arrive on PlayStation, it’s quite a significant milestone.</p>



<p>Many will see $69.99 as a fair deal. This is only for the Standard Edition, so is the damage much worse for more expensive packages?</p>







<h2 id="h-all-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-editions-amp-prices">All Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PS5 Editions &amp; Prices</h2>



<p><strong>There are four Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 editions for PS5: Standard, Deluxe, Premium Deluxe, and Aviator.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick breakdown of each edition and what it costs. Warning: The later editions get sky-high with their pricing.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">MSFS 2024 Edition</th><th data-align="center">Price</th><th data-align="center">Contents</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Standard Edition</td><td data-align="center">$69.99 or £69.99</td><td data-align="center">-Base game<br>-70 Aircraft<br>-150 Airports</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Deluxe Edition</td><td data-align="center">$99.99 or £99.99</td><td data-align="center">-Base game<br>-Early Access<br>-80 Aircraft<br>-155 Airports</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Premium Deluxe Edition</td><td data-align="center">$129.99 or £129.99</td><td data-align="center">-Base game<br>-Early Access<br>-95 Aircraft<br>-160 Airports</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Aviator Edition</td><td data-align="center">$199.99 or £199.99</td><td data-align="center">-Base game<br>-Early Access<br>-125 Aircraft<br>-160 Airports</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>It’s up to you if you can justify as much as $200 for the PS5 launch of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. What do you think of its pricing? Should it be more reasonable? Is $200 too much for simply adding more vehicles and airports?

<p>A new Monster Hunter Showcase is scheduled for December 8, 2025, featuring the title update 4 for MH Wilds and the latest information on MH Stories 3. </p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds was one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-still-2025s-best-selling-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top launches of 2025</a>, but some PC performance issues and content complaints have brought criticism from the community. The developers already confirmed they are working on those issues and have now announced a new showcase that will provide players with details on another free content update for Monster Hunter Wilds and the latest information on their upcoming title, MH Stories 3: Twisted Reflection. </p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-watch-monster-hunter-showcase-on-december-8-2025">How to Watch Monster Hunter Showcase on December 8, 2025?</h2>



<p>Announced through the Monster Hunter <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1996867143057445119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), the Monster Hunter Showcase will begin on Monday, December 8, 2025, at 2:00 PM PST. Interested readers can tune in to the live stream on the official <a href="https://t.co/WbntyFTmOM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://t.co/KNEebgyzzy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> accounts. The developers have also explicitly stated that “For Monster Hunter Wilds, the event will focus solely on Free Title Update 4.” For Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection, we might get to see new story details or maybe a gameplay deep dive. Players will have to wait to know for sure. </p>



<p>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection is set to arrive in March 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2. The title is the latest instalment of the RPG series set in Monster Hunter World.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man/">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a> has an official release date of February 11, 2026, executive director and game producer Goichi "Suda51" Suda has revealed. Priced at $50, it'll land early next year on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with a Switch 2 port also being considered.</p><p>Suda added that the release date could be delayed by up to two weeks if the master copy of the game is rejected up to three times, which would result in Romeo Is A Dead Man launching around the same time as "that title with a big nine" on its box art. Suda is likely referring to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-preorder-guide-ps5-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-pc/1100-6535813/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, which launches on February 27 next year.

As for the proposed Switch 2 port, Suda51 said this could happen after the game's launch.</p><p>"We've got to make sure it works on PC and the other platforms that have already been decided on," Suda said to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/grasshopper-wants-to-bring-romeo-is-a-dead-man-to-switch-2-but-needs-to-make-sure-the-engine-will-play-nicely-with-it-first/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>. "And since we're using Unreal Engine 5 for Romeo is a Dead Man, we need to make sure that we can find a way that the engine is going to play nicely with Switch 2, using stuff like Nanite and Lumen and other things--some of them are new to us, some of them them might have issues with Switch 2, with porting and stuff."</p><p>Billed as a third-person adventure, Romeo is a Dead Man puts players in the boots of FBI Space-Time special agent Romeo Stargazer as he hunts down fugitives across the multiverse and searches for his lost girlfriend, Juliet.</p><p>The game's current release date puts it in the middle of a very busy February, as it launches a day before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-kiwami-1-2-0-directors-cut-preorder-guide/1100-6534988/">Yakuza Kiwami 3</a> and other highlights that month include Tales of Berseria Remastered, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-fixes-the-originals-painful-slog/1100-6536315/">Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-nintendo-switch-2-2026-game-preorder-buying-guide/1100-6534725/">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, and No Sleep for Kaname Date on PS5.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/05/metroid-prime-4-phenoros-boss-guide-lava-volcano-flare-pool/</link>
            <guid>1374061</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Lying deep in Metroid Prime 4’s volcano facility of the Flare Pool region is the huge boss Phenoros, yet another creature native to Viewros that has been corrupted by a Metroid and now serves as a major threat to Samus and her mission.</p>
<p>There’s a few stages to this battle, which can be quite a drawn out one if you don’t spot the key moments and what you need to do in order to succeed. Here’s a breakdown of the stages to the boss battle and how best to overcome them.</p>
<p>Obviously there are some <strong>progression spoilers</strong> within this guide, so at this point, <strong>stop reading if you aren’t currently struggling to beat Phenoros!</strong></p>


<p>OK, so… with that out of the way, let’s get on with the guide!</p>
<h3>Phenoros on the lava lake</h3>
<p>The first section of the Phenoros battle has Samus on the Vi-O-La IC, chasing after Phenoros as it swims around a huge lake of lava. It doesn’t really try to attack you during this phase, but can swim a little erratically, throwing up choppy lava flows that slow you down and balls of magma. Scanning Phenoros and look at it for visual clues reveals a string of weak spots on the underside of its snake-like body.</p>


<p>The goal during this section is to use the Vi-O-La disc attack to hit all of these weak spots, and the best way to do this is to try to drive alongside Phenoros and quickly target multiples as its body dips in and out of the lava. Once all of them have been hit, it’s on to the next stage!</p>
<h3>Phenoros showdown</h3>
<p>Now you’ve made Phenoros really angry! Samus is stuck on a small chunk of its body while its head towers over her. The aim here is to hit between one and four blue weakspots on Phenoros’ head and trigger a damage phase where you blast its tongue with as many heavy attacks as you possibly can! Ice Beam attacks can quickly take out chunks of its health during this.</p>

<p>Hitting the weak spots can be tricky. Phenoros’ head waves around a lot and the weakspots are on the side of its head. You need to either lock on and manually adjust your aim to hit them, or Switch 2 players might feel better using mouse mode.</p>
<p>During this section, Phenoros has a few key attacks to be aware of:</p>
<p><strong>Flame Breath</strong> –&nbsp;Phenoros rears back and then unleashed a beam of flaming energy that it sweeps from one side of the semi-circle island to the other. You can jump over this, but I found it easiest to just morph ball and wait until it passes over.<br>
<strong>Bite</strong> –&nbsp;Phenoros pulls back from the island before rushing forward to grab Samus. You need to time a dodge move to evade this, or be caught in Phenoros’ mouth and mash A to escape.<br>
<strong>Magma Balls</strong> –&nbsp;Phenoros spits out five slow-moving magma balls that home towards you. Shoot them in time and you’ll get some ammo and health top ups.</p>

<h3>Phenoros below half health</h3>
<p>Once you’ve got Phenoros below half health, it transforms and opens up two large head flaps, revealing four new weak spots. The goal is the same: blast those weak spots to put Phenoros into a dazed state and then blast its tongue with damage.</p>
<p>During this, Phenoros has all its previous attack, but a little bit faster and souped up –&nbsp;the flame breath is a double sweep. In addition there is one new attack:</p>
<p><strong>Ear Guns</strong> –&nbsp;From the remaining weak spots, Phenoros shoots blasts of energy at you. Keep strafing to avoid taking damage.</p>

<h3>Phenoros Finisher</h3>
<p>With Phenoros down to its last chunk of health, it will be incapacitated, floating on the surface, mouth wide open. This is the time to strike the final blow. You can’t head into its body yourself, but using a guided charged beam shot – charge up a standard beam shot while in the scanner view – you can home in on its core and take it down!</p>

<p>If you don’t do this in time, Phenoros will recover and return to the previous stage with a bit more health, needing to be downed once more.</p>
<p>Well done, you’ve defeated Phenoros! And now? Well, it’s time to grab a new ability and get the heck outta here!</p>

            <p>If you're a fan of gruff blokes punching goons and putting the pedal to the metal in muscle cars, Samson looks like it'll be up your alley. It's the debut game of Liquid Swords, the Swedish studio founded by former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause">Just Cause</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mad-max">Mad Max</a> developer Christofer Sundberg, and mirrors the gritty open-world destructive mayhem both of those are known for.</p>

<p>Set in a fictional industrial metropolis called Tyndalston, which its leather-jacketed protagonist dubs the "asshole of the world", Samson is about a dude in debt. Each day, this dude wakes up with a daily quota to meet in terms of paying back what he owes to some bad people, a problem that grows worse by the hour unless he takes action.</p>
<p>That action is punching goons in the face or slapping them with improvised weapons as part of Mad Max-ish brawls in alleyways and mini-marts or getting behind the wheel of your all-black muscle car and using it to either race people, ram them off the road, or some combination of both. Police chases will kick off if your punching and driving gets a bit too rowdy, giving you a chance to unleash those skills on some boys in blue.</p><p>As you go, you'll work your way through the different factions of Tyndalston's districts, spending action points to choose which missions you dedicate Samson's limited time to. There's a tale about unearthing the dude's past in the city and saving his family to offer extra motivation to get out there and wreak havoc.</p>
<p>As much as playing a game about having constant money worries might hit a bit too close to home given what the real world's like for the non-rich at the moment, I'm keen to see if Liquid Swords have nailed the satisfying violent rollercoaster ride a game like this usually needs to shine. It looks more along the lines of Mad Max's desert marauding transplanted into an urban spawl than Just Cause's more exotic pinging around a map and blowing shit up, and I'm certainly partial to the former. Here's hoping the gritty city doesn't struggle to seem a bit dull compared to the backdrops Sundberg and co worked with at Avalanche Studios.</p>
<p>Samson's set to release in early 2026 and you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3634520/Samson/">Steam</a>, if you're so inclined.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/samson-tyndalston-story-open-world-game-protagonist-fighting-out-of-debt/</link>
            <guid>1374046</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Liquid Swords, a Swedish developer founded in 2020 by ex Avalanche Studios founder Cristofer Sundberg, has unveiled their debut game, Samson: A Tyndalston Story, during the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2025 showcase.</p>



<p>About a year ago, the studio had <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-like-open-world-game-shows-off-photorealistic-visuals-in-debut-images/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> the photorealistic visuals of its Unreal Engine 5 open world game. Now, we have received a lot more details. According to the developer, it's going to be a gritty, brutal story.</p>



<p>The protagonist, Samson McCray, is forced to return to the unforgiving streets of the titular city of Tyndalston. He owes some very, very dangerous people a lot of money, and to make sure he returns to pay his debt, these criminals are threatening Samson's sister.</p>



<p>Samson: A Tyndalston Story is based on the simple, yet brutal truth that time is against the protagonist. With every passing day, the debt owed grows with interest. Each job picked by the main character uses up a limited supply of Action Points, and every decision affects how the city treats him, with no do-overs possible. Samson must keep moving forward because standing still makes everything worse.</p>



<p>While one of the features listed is indeed 'open world districts', this is not the type of near-endless open world game where you can stop to explore every nook and cranny without any repercussions. It's a focused story, likely not even too long given that the recommended price is $24.99. Over the course of the narrative, players will learn what broke Samson's family and what it takes to fix it before time runs out.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SAMSON | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQ4z_yQE5Xo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That said, Liquid Swords has prepared several systems that will cause Tyndalston to react to what Samson is doing. The police, for example, will push back if the protagonist sows too much chaos on the streets. Moreover, faces, factions, and streets shift in response to Samson's actions.</p>



<p>As you can see in the trailer, fights look very grounded. On-foot combat appears to be focused on brawling, with Samson using momentum, terrain, and improvised tools to take them down. But there's also car combat, with high-speed chases easily turning into collisions, traps, and close-quarters destruction.</p>



<p>The developers also confirmed that Samson: A Tyndalston Story includes a skill tree with over 25 upgrades to shape the main character into the type of fighter preferred by the player.</p>



<p>The game will launch on PC (no other platforms have been confirmed at this time) via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3634520/Samson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/samson-ab5af7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>. It shouldn't be far off, either, with Liquid Swords promising an early 2026 release. </p>



<p>The Epic Games Store already lists the minimum and recommended requirements, although they are oddly missing the CPU:</p>

<p>It’s finally time for PS5 owners to book their ticket to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The title has so far been kept from the blue brand’s main console, but now MSFS 2024 has a PlayStation 5 release date, along with complete start times.</p>



<p>A one-way ticket to the sky beckons for PS5 players. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> took off just over one year ago, and boarded with plenty of Xbox and PC passengers on board. The flight-sim title is the latest in the franchise, and it’s going to be another instance of ‘Xbox Game Studios’ being bizarrely plastered all over a PS5 game.</p>



<p>Here are the official Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 release details for PS5.</p>

<p><strong>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 launches worldwide for PlayStation 5 owners on December 8.</strong></p>







<p>It’s nearly a year to the day since MSFS 2024 debuted on Xbox and PC: November 19, 2024, to be exact. But now it’s time for MSFS to add its name alongside Forza Horizon 5, Gears of War: Reloaded, and the upcoming Halo: Campaign Evolved as Xbox hits to make the jump to the blue side of life.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-on-playstation-5-have-early-access">Does Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 On PlayStation 5 Have Early Access?</h2>



<p><strong>The PS5 release of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 comes with early access for those who pre-order the Deluxe, Aviator Edition, or Premium Editions.</strong></p>



<p>Consider this the gaming equivalent of securing priority boarding on a flight. Early access is out—meaning you don’t need to wait until December 8—and there are more details below on dates and times.</p>



<h2 id="h-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-start-times">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PS5 Start Times</h2>

            <p>A sudden update for Armored Core 6 on Steam has spurred hopes among fans of the third-person mecha action game that something big is coming to The Game Awards next week.</p>
<p>The update, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1888160/history/">which can be seen on the game's SteamDB page</a>, shows a change to the application <em>has</em> happened. However, we can't see what has changed. It could be absolutely nothing, <em>or</em> it could be preparation for something substantial… In this murky realm of possibility, a flicker of hope has been lit.</p>
<p>"Babe wake up. Armored Core got another SteamDB update 1 week before the Game Awards," <a href="https://x.com/Etheox/status/1996259179225620778">posts user Etheox on X</a>. It is worth noting of course that Armored Core 6 has received several Steam page updates over this year and no DLC announcements.</p>

<p>The game, while successful, has been left largely alone since its release in 2023. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/armored-core-6-has-had-its-best-weapons-nerfed">It received an impactful nerf to some of its most powerful weapons</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/armored-core-6-now-has-1v1-and-3v3-ranked-online-matchmaking">ranked matchmaking support for both 1v1 and 3v3</a>. Aside from that, it's been left well enough alone, which is a shame! More Armored Core would be a wonderful thing.</p><p>It is worth noting that previous Armored Core games have recieved DLC packs in the past. Take <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/armored-core-5">Armored Core 5</a>, which was updated with the Modeler's Pack. This brought a vast number of new AC parts and weapons to the game. While big narrative updates aren't the norm with the series, FromSoftware has proven keen to create such content for its games in recent years. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-difficulty-harder-than-main-game-the-forsaken-hollows">Take Elden Ring: Nightreign's recent Forsaken Hollows DLC</a>, an injection of difficult content adding life to the multiplayer spinoff.
</p>
<p>Armored Core 6 was an outstanding game from FromSoftware. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review">In Eurogamer's review</a>, Caelyn Ellis wrote: "FromSoftware delivers a superlative action game that builds on its Soulslike pedigree while staying lean and laser-focused."</p>

            <p>Portal shooter Splitgate 2 will be making its return from beta later this month, and to mark this return developer 1047 Games has rebranded it with a new name.</p>
<p>The free-to-play Splitgate: Arena Reloaded will arrive across PC (via Steam, Epic Games Store and Windows), Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5 and PS4 on 17th December.</p>
<p>"After months of community feedback, testing and rebuilding the entire experience, this is Splitgate refocused on what made it special in the first place: classic arena combat without factions, abilities, or extra noise," the developer shared on Splitgate: Arena Reloaded's announcement, along with a new trailer you can see below.</p>

<p>1047 Games said Splitgate has "always been about the arena first", though the developer admitted it had somewhat missed the mark when it released Splitgate 2 earlier this year. As such, it has now taken elements from both the original Splitgate and its short-lived sequel, removed the bits that "didn't fit" and "refined" the ones that did.</p><p>"In the process, we not only rebuilt the game, we reconnected with the magic of the genre that built this studio in the first place. A Return to the Arena," the studio wrote, saying arena shooters are part of its DNA.</p>
<p>"Splitgate has always been a love letter to the classic shooters that sparked a lifelong passion for games for so many of us. They were fast, expressive, and skillful, and they brought people together around shared experiences.</p>
<p>"With Splitgate : Arena Reloaded, our goal is to bring that feeling forward for a new generation while keeping it fresh for the players who have been with us from the start."</p>
<p>You can check out the various changes coming to Splitgate: Arena Reloaded below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed Splitgate 2's factions, abilities, and select equipment so the focus is back on classic arena combat without the extra noise.</li>
<li>Rebuilt progression from the ground up so your time in game feels rewarding, with weapon and character cosmetics you can earn simply by playing.</li>
<li>We've added a true Classic Arena mode with even starts and new map pickups, recapturing the feel of the original.</li>
<li>Fine tuned combat to better match expectations for a modern arena shooter, with more meaningful gunfights and fewer "what just happened" moments.</li>
<li>Completely overhauled the ranked system so your rank reflects your actual skill for players who love to climb and compete.</li>
<li>Added key systems you have been asking for: Mode Select, Player Stats, Ranked Leaderboards, and Account Levels.</li>
<li>Introduced five brand new maps and six fully reworked arenas, bringing the total map pool to 20.</li>
<li>Added three new LMG primary weapons and the iconic Power Weapon, the Railgun.</li>
</ul>

<p>Closing, 1047 Games acknowledged that relaunches such as this one can be "met with scepticism", and it appreciates that. However, the studio is proud of what it has built with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded, and will be sharing more in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>"From everyone at 1047 Games, thank you for your feedback, your patience, and your passion over the last few months," it closed. "We hope to see you back in the arena on December 17."</p>

<p>Splitgate 2 was initially released earlier this year, but soon after the studio and its founder Ian Proulx admitted they had taken the game out of beta too soon. "We had ambitious goals with Splitgate 2, and in our excitement to share it with you, we bit off more than we could chew," a statement in July read. As such, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-fails-to-make-fps-great-again-goes-back-into-beta-resulting-in-layoffs-and-server-shutdowns">the shooter returned to beta</a>, and layoffs were made at 1047 Games.</p>

            <p>The full release of action role-playing game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> - otherwise known as the 1.0 release - has slipped further away again. The game is currently in early access, remember.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-path-of-exile-2-10-release-this-year-as-ddos-attacks-blamed-for-server-issues-and-huge-new-update-revealed">Grinding Gear Games had been targeting a potential March 2026 release for Path of Exile 2</a> - that's what game director Jonathan Rogers told me a few months ago. But in an interview conducted yesterday, Rogers told me he didn't think the studio would hit that date.</p>
<p>"I'm fairly confident that we won't be out of 2026," Rogers said, "but as I said, I never want to really completely promise anything. But I don't think it'll end up being March; we'll have to see."</p>
<p>His comments follow those made during a Path of Exile 2 presentation Q&amp;A shortly before we spoke, in which he said: "I don't have a specific timeline but I certainly wouldn't want to be any later than the end of next year. Obviously we're trying to get there as fast as we can, but I certainly wouldn't want to slip into 2027."</p>

<p>The obstacles to a Path of Exile 2 launch are threefold: the campaign, balance changes and endgame content. Path of Exile 2 currently has only four of six campaign-acts implemented, the most recent one - the fourth - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-path-of-exile-2-10-release-this-year-as-ddos-attacks-blamed-for-server-issues-and-huge-new-update-revealed">having been introduced in August</a>. These are big things, and even if we assume the two missing acts are ready to release in the game's next quarterly updates, presumably one after another, we're still potentially looking at one in spring 2026, and one in the summer, and they will both need testing time. Factoring that in, an autumn 2026 release at the earliest seems more reasonable.</p><p>That's assuming, of course, there are no balance changes or endgame changes that hold that up - both being areas Rogers wants "in a good place" before the game comes out. This is a constant pursuit for a game like Path of Exile 2, and balance changes have already interrupted the early access flow of content <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-fixes-incoming-following-criticism-of-dawn-of-the-hunt-updates-slow-pace">as Grinding Gear Games sought to address issues with the hunter class</a> it introduced back in April. This, then, is a potential risk any time the studio introduces a significant new element to the game, such as a player class, which it's just about to do again with the druid in the upcoming update, The Last of the Druids (0.5.0).</p>
<p>Alongside the new druid class, Grinding Gear Games will introduce a new world (league) for players to play in - something it does in every update. This upcoming league, The Fate of the Vaal, is themed around an ancient Vaal civilization and their lost, time-altering temple that's located somewhere underground. The cool thing is once you find it, you'll have to piece the dungeon together yourself, a bit like you do in the blueprint-adjusting puzzle game Blue Prince, although it's actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/loop-hero-review-round-and-round-the-garden">an indie game from 2021, Loop Hero</a>, the idea is inspired by, Rogers told me.</p>
<p>The autumn Path of Exile 2 update, which includes the new druid class, the new league, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-performance-boost">a significant performance boost for all platforms</a> but especially consoles, arrives 12th December.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-early-access-review">Path of Exile 2 launched into early access in December 2024</a>, so it's been out for about a year now. What was already a very impressive package back then has only grown since. This is, in my mind, the action RPG to beat.</p>

Developer Massive Entertainment wisely chose not to retell the story of the films, instead weaving a tale on the other side of the moon of Pandora where the films take place.</p><p dir="ltr">But while Frontiers excelled at turning the dense, visually fascinating world of Pandora into a cogent, interactive space and exploring the culture of the Na'vi peoples who populate it, the game also felt somewhat disconnected from the movies. With the release of the third Avatar movie, Avatar: Fire and Ash, Massive is taking the opportunity to adjust that situation a bit.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – From the Ashes Hands-On Impressions</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Alongside the movie hitting theaters comes From the Ashes, an expansion for the game that tells a new story that incorporates major elements from the film, while also shaking up Frontiers' take on Pandora in some very big ways. Massive worked closely with Cameron's production company, Lightstorm Entertainment, to bring the stories of the movie and the game a little closer together.</p><p dir="ltr">"With From the Ashes, we were very closely aligned with Lightstorm on where they're taking the tone of the franchise--it's becoming very dark," Aoife O'Friel, From the Ashes' narrative director, told me in an interview. "And so we wanted to mirror that and link with that as much as possible. And so From the Ashes also has that darkness and a kind of vengeful edge to it."</p><p dir="ltr">Central to both Fire and Ash and From the Ashes are the Mongkwan, or Ash people, a warlike Na'vi clan that attacks and raids the others. In the movie, the Ash people side with the antagonistic human military forces of the RDA and Miles Quarritch, the series' primary villain. The story of the expansion takes place soon after the events of the movie, with the RDA making a new push across Pandora--but this time, they're doing it with a powerful and aggressive band of Na'vi among their ranks.</p><p dir="ltr">What that means in practice is that, when you leap into the new story told in From the Ashes, you'll face Na'vi enemies for the first time, in addition to the human soldiers, VTOLs, and mechs that make up the forces of the RDA. I played about three hours of From the Ashes at a recent preview event in Los Angeles, and saw how the addition of Na'vi enemies can introduce a pretty significant bump in challenge. For the first time in Frontiers of Pandora, you're facing foes who largely have the same capabilities that you do.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4616353-avatarfromtheashes3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616353" data-ratio="0.56245686680469" data-width="1449" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4616353-avatarfromtheashes3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616353"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4616353-avatarfromtheashes3.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">A new protagonist</h3><p dir="ltr">From the start of Frontiers of Pandora, you've played as the Sarentu, a Na'vi who was abducted from their tribe as a child and raised among humans, but who takes the fight to the RDA throughout the story of the game. From the Ashes flips the script, putting you in control of So'lek, a side character with a dark past who players have worked with and grown close to throughout Frontiers' story.</p><p dir="ltr">The expansion begins with a fresh invasion by the RDA and Mongkwan forces, attacking the hometree where your closest allies live, and setting fire to the surrounding Kinglor Forest. The Sarentu and many of the other resistance members from Frontiers are scattered and left for dead, and as So'lek, it becomes your goal to reunite with and protect them.</p><p dir="ltr">So'lek's clan was wiped out by the RDA before the events of Frontiers, and he's been on a quest of revenge ever since. Throughout the course of the story and its previous DLC expansions, So'lek became part of the Sarentu's found family of survivors and resistance members. That makes this new attack deeply personal for him, dredging up a lot of personal pain and playing into the darker feel that From the Ashes brings to the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"[So'lek] is older, he is battle-hardened. He's already grown up as a Na'vi, so he's not learning about the world, and so there isn't that kind of curiosity that maybe we focused on in the main game here," O'Friel explained. "So he's very driven and very focused on his goal and on protecting his family. And so it's much darker in that sense, that it's about the trauma that he's endured and that he never wants to go through again."</p><p dir="ltr">The devastation visited upon the game world only amplifies those feelings. After having spent tens of hours exploring the Kinglor Forest region, seeing it ravaged by flame highlights the brutality of the RDA and changes the game world significantly. The destroyed regions are bereft of the resources you need to craft ammunition or healing items, which can significantly change the dynamic of exploring or getting into battles with RDA patrols, forcing you to be more on-guard and cautious as you make your attacks.</p><p dir="ltr">The preview included two story missions from early in the expansion, totaling about an hour. The first sees So'lek invading a new RDA base set up in the Aranahe clan's hometree. You're free to enter the base however you want to, but I chose to sneak in, hoping to learn the whereabouts of the missing resistance members. In addition to the quieter Na'vi weapons like bows that players had in the base game to take down RDA forces without alerting the whole base, So'lek can also sneak up on many enemies and take them down with his knife, providing a quiet option for eliminating foes in your path.</p><p dir="ltr">This first mission mostly serves to introduce a few of the villains of From the Ashes, including one of three Na'vi warlords, who you'll hunt down and face throughout the course of the campaign. There's also Major Bukowski, who you'll hear over the loudspeaker as you make your way through the hometree base. Massive describes Bukowski as being akin to movie protagonist Jake Sully, if Sully had never left the RDA. Bukowski speaks Na'vi, understands their culture, and is even somewhat sympathetic to their plight, but he's still loyal to humanity.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4616356-avatarfromtheashes2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616356" data-ratio="0.56245686680469" data-width="1449" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4616356-avatarfromtheashes2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616356"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4616356-avatarfromtheashes2.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Battling the Mongkwan</h3><p dir="ltr">After gathering some intel, but unable to save any survivors, the mission culminates in So'lek emerging from the hometree and taking on a Mongkwan raider in close combat in an attempt to save another Na'vi member of the resistance. Na'vi enemies are much quicker and more resilient than even the toughest RDA mechs, making them feel more like mini-bosses (or full-on bosses) and more dangerous than any other enemy we've seen in Frontiers so far. The raider uses human weapons, like an assault rifle and grenades, so you need to keep moving and pick your moments to attack, as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Taking down the raider kicks off a cinematic in which the Na'vi survivor is killed before So'lek emerges victorious. The loss unlocks one of the new abilities that makes So'lek stand apart from the Sarentu: Warrior Vision. It's basically an ultimate power that So'lek can charge up by dealing damage or taking hits from enemies. When you activate it, enemies are highlighted on your screen, and you deal additional damage while losing less health to enemy attacks, allowing you to storm through with overwhelming, rampaging force.</p><p dir="ltr">So'lek's rage soon has him fighting basically the entire RDA base at once, using Warrior Vision to identify and quickly clean up targets. The fight brings a few new enemies to bear against So'lek, including RDA mechs with new weapons like flamethrowers, and eventually, another Mongkwan raider. This all adds a new degree of chaos and challenge to Frontiers of Pandora's already fast, flowing combat, and it can be harrowing taking on a quick Na'vi fighter while the RDA are streaming in from the fringes of the battlefield. But between So'lek's Warrior Vision, agility, and weapons, the mission soon ends with all the RDA forces defeated.</p><p dir="ltr">Frontiers of Pandora adds a lot to the Avatar franchise by giving players a chance to meet and interact with different Na'vi and their clans. From the Ashes goes a step in a different direction, creating Na'vi enemies, which required a shift in mindset, O'Friel explained.</p><p dir="ltr">"With the Mongkwan, they are such different Na'vi--we've never seen any Na'vi like them before. We've always thought of Na'vi as being so peaceful and so attuned with nature, and these Na'vi are so destructive and so chaotic and so brutal. It was really kind of shocking to realize how far they will go," O'Friel said. "And then, of course, in From the Ashes, you will get to engage in combat against Na'vi for the first time, which we never had before, right? It was about really seeing what are the motivations of the Ash Clan, and what kind of motivations from the movie that we can carry through--like wanting to spread their fire, wanting to kind of subvert the will of Eywa."</p><p dir="ltr">The Mongkwan also offer a fascinating contrast to So'lek. For the Na'vi, using human technology goes against the will of Eywa, the deity or force that connects all life on Pandora. The Mongkwan are willing to use human technology because the clan has been cut off from Eywa and actively resents the deity. So'lek's use of those weapons is more pragmatic, but no less scorned by his fellow Na'vi.</p><p dir="ltr">"With So'lek, as well, we explore a little bit of his clan, the Trr'ong--he lost most of them in the Battle of the Hallelujah Mountains [which took place in the first Avatar movie]," O'Friel continued. "And we see him trying to hold on to remnants of who he was. But he also uses human weapons, which is also against the will of Eywa, but he does it for a different reason. He doesn't want to defy Eywa, but he believes that the best way to fight these kinds of people and the RDA is with their own weapons. So exploring those different views on Na'vi culture, and also that internal conflict that So'lek is having, like choosing to use weapons like this because he thinks is the best way forward, versus the Ash, who enjoy it because they know it's wrong--that was really fun to compare and contrast."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4616347-avatarfromtheashes1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616347" data-ratio="0.56245686680469" data-width="1449" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4616347-avatarfromtheashes1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616347"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4616347-avatarfromtheashes1.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Saving the mastodon</h3><p dir="ltr">The second mission in the preview sets So'lek on the trail of the Beast, one of the three Mongkwan warlords now operating in the region. One of the best things about Frontiers of Pandora is that it generally eschews quest markers in favor of forcing you to explore areas, using your detective vision-like Na'vi Vision to search for clues and find your own way.</p><p dir="ltr">You first find evidence of the Beast when you discover a huge dirt path cut through the jungle, where the RDA moved heavy machinery. Following it, So'lek discovers evidence that the RDA have been capturing various animals--but it's unclear just what for.</p><p dir="ltr">The answers aren't far away, however. The path eventually leads you to a huge RDA facility, a Laser Ore Processor. Once again, you need to find your way in, and you have a couple of options. You can blast straight through the front door, taking on mechs and turrets, or you can go a sneakier route. I always prefer the careful planning required with stealth, as well as the chaos when it goes wrong, so I find an out-of-the-way side door, carefully dispatching a few mechs with stealthy takedowns to clear my path.</p><p dir="ltr">Where the Sarentu can hack different RDA devices in Frontiers of Pandora, So'lek has no such skill. Finding a hidden way into the base instead requires using the knife he previously took off a Mongkwan raider, which can short out machinery just like it can RDA mechs. But with water spraying from a broken pipe right over the door control mechanism, you first have to track down a nearby shutdown valve before you can break into the facility.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally sneaking in, it starts to become clear what's going on as you move past animal pens and scientific experiments: The RDA are trying to create weaponized and robotic versions of some of Pandora's dangerous animals, and the Mongkwan are helping them. As you head deeper into the facility, the RDA ambush you with a big group of Hell Hounds, doglike robots that are new to the expansion and love to attack you from behind with their electrically charged jaws.</p><p dir="ltr">Before much longer, you reach the major threat hidden within the Laser Ore Processor: a towering Fireback Mastodon the RDA has attached machinery to in order to drive it into a violent frenzy. Mechanical attachments on the mastodon's feet and back allow the RDA to remotely sting the creature, driving it to attack. Seeing the huge mastodon trampling toward you gives the sense of fighting a huge, fast, angry construction crane.</p><p dir="ltr">But the battle is also something of a keepaway game--So'lek's goal is to free the animal, not to harm it--which means you'll need to dodge its monstrous tusks and bait it into crashing through support pillars so you can stun it long enough to destroy the machinery attached to it. Every so often, RDA enemies stream in to stop you, but the mastodon can be as dangerous to them as it is to you, if you're quick enough to avoid its huge, sweeping tusks. As the fight continues, So'lek removes more and more of the mechanical pieces from the mastodon, before it bursts through a wall and you have to chase it into another room.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWHd5neGekk" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mWHd5neGekk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The second half of the fight is a bit more of an environmental puzzle, since you need to get onto the mastodon's back to free it from the last few pieces of machinery. That means waiting for the creature to smash through walls and pipes that create a climbable path through the huge room you find yourself in, while you also fight RDA soldiers as they try to stop you with rockets and assault rifles.</p><p dir="ltr">The climb is a good highlight of the new third-person viewpoint mode, another major change coming to Frontiers with From the Ashes. Frontiers launched as a first-person game, but with the update that comes with the expansion, you can play it all in third-person if you so choose, which provides more awareness of your environment that can be useful in combat and in platforming. You also get a better sense of scale as you control So'lek, with the ability to see how he towers over humans and barely fits through RDA doorways, and the viewpoint makes a degree of narrative sense as you follow the story of So'lek, a fully formed character, at a bit more distance than you did with the Sarentu's.</p><p dir="ltr">In practice, though, third-person felt a little loose and floaty to me. The Na'vi are almost <em>too</em> agile; you can quickly cut sideways or back at a run as you're moving around the battlefield, and the animations supporting third-person mode end up looking unnatural as a result. Frontiers was originally designed as a first-person game, where that agility feels more natural and the ability to quickly change direction or scamper up a vertical wall to a new position elevates the game, giving you a lot of freedom. What you gain with third-person in situational awareness and easier, clearer platforming, you lose in feeling like a more natural part of the world.</p><p dir="ltr">Principally, though, From the Ashes is just more Frontiers, and Frontiers is already a solidly fun open-world experience. I spent the rest of the preview wandering the open world, attacking different RDA facilities, some of which even had a Mongkwan mini-boss waiting in the wings to stop me as I sabotaged their machinery. The things that work about Frontiers, like its huge open world and the fun of playing as a fast, resilient, 10-foot-tall alien leaping over buildings made for six-foot humans, are still great in the expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">From the Ashes builds on Frontiers of Pandora with a new story, a new protagonist, new abilities, new enemies, and a changed world, and all those things are welcome additions to an already strong foundation. Though I only got a short taste of the 25-hour addition, From the Ashes reminded me of what I liked about the game in the first place, while doing just enough to make the experience feel fresh all over again.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Was The Most-Searched Game of 2025, Despite Dropping in October]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-most-searched-game-2025-drop-october/</link>
            <guid>1373998</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Google Trends has just published its Year in Search report for 2025, and it uncovers a juicy tidbit about Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders, the all-new extraction adventure that has taken the gaming world by storm in the last few weeks. The game was released on October 30 to an overwhelmingly positive reception and has been on the upswing ever since.</p>



<p>Google’s new report revealed that, in 2025, ARC Raiders was the <strong>most-searched game</strong>, despite being released at the tail end of October. It beat all comers to hold the top spot, which is indicative of the sheer amount of interest around this game.</p>







<p>ARC Raiders has been scoring high in the review stakes, securing award nominations, and holding a consistent audience of hundreds of thousands of concurrent players. It’s arguably the most accessible extraction game ever made, and it has turned the tide for a genre otherwise thought of as being ‘too challenging’ for the average gamer.</p>



<p>That’s partly why ARC Raiders was the most-searched game in 2025 on Google, which was confirmed in a recent report published by the Google Trends team.</p>



<p>Here’s <a href="https://trends.withgoogle.com/year-in-search/2025/">the full list</a>, and it might surprise you where certain games fall:</p>



<ol>
<li>ARC Raiders</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Strands</li>



<li>Split Fiction</li>



<li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li>



<li>Path of Exile 2</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto 6</li>



<li>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>



<li>Roblox</li>
</ol>



<p>It might come as a shock to see GTA 6 so far down the line, but that’s mostly because it’s a case of gamers biding their time until news surfaces. There’s almost nothing to search for otherwise related to Grand Theft Auto 6. On the other hand, ARC Raiders has mission guides, item location tips, loadout walkthroughs, and more, all of which are being eagerly sought out by players far and wide.</p>







<p>It’s a well-deserved accolade for ARC Raiders, which has turned out to be a stunning game that has impressed players more than anyone truly expected. Embark Studios has promised to support the game for years to come, so only bright things are in store.</p>

<p>Activision hasn’t officially unveiled this season’s Call of Duty League skins, and until now, all we’ve seen is the default Call of Duty League Launch pack. That is, until one user on social media uploaded a video showcasing all the CDL 2026 skins in the Call of Duty store.</p>



<p>Thanks to the short video, we now know what every CDL 2026 skin looks like, and this year, they’re more customized per team than they have been in a minute, with a special focus on the skin’s face mask layout.</p>







<p>On social media, user RealityUK uploaded a two-minute video detailing every CDL 2026 Operator skin. This included a brief snapshot of every team competing in this season’s Call of Duty League:</p>



<ul>
<li>Boston Breach</li>



<li>Carolina Royal Ravens</li>



<li>Cloud9 New York</li>



<li>FaZe Vegas</li>



<li>G2 Minnesota</li>



<li>LA Thieves</li>



<li>Miami Heretics</li>



<li>OpTic Texas</li>



<li>Paris Gentle Mates</li>



<li>Riyadh Falcons</li>



<li>Toronto KOI</li>



<li>Vancouver Surge</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the full video, provided by Reality:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The feedback on the leaked CDL skins was mixed, with many coming to claim that their favorite teams were ‘done dirty’ by the skin designers. Many had issues with OpTic Texas’ skin in the video, one of which (the away skin) was almost a plain, stark white with no OpTic colorways.</p>



<p>One user wrote, <em>‘Why does OpTic look so barebones? They are getting more revenue this year the more people buy it’s not fixed anymore why did they go so basic I’m confused?’</em></p>



<p>What wasn’t revealed are the incoming weapon camos, stickers, emblems, and charms associated with each CDL team. It typically costs around $9.99 to purchase a CDL skin pack, and when doing so, you’ll unlock all the above, but all we’ve seen leaked thus far are the Operator skins themselves.</p>



<p>Is there a particular skin standing out to you? Let us know on the I<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">nsider Gaming Discord server</a> which you’d want to invest in.</p>
