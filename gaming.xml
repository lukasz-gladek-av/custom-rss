            <p>
Five couples got engaged at this summer's Pokémon Go Fest, some of whom met through playing the popular smartphone game. 
</p>
<p>
The proposals took place at the event's big weekend in Madrid - the year's main European meetup for Pokémon Go fans, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-director-discusses-avatar-backlash-and-a-course-correct-needed-on-the-slowdown-of-new-species">Eurogamer recently attended</a>. Happily, all players who popped the question received a 'yes'. 
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Go developer Niantic asked fans ahead of time if any couples were planning to get engaged at the event, after hearing reports of players getting down on one knee at previous Go Fests.

<p>
Five fans responded and were then invited to secretly surprise their other half by popping the question at a Pikachu and Eevee 'Meet and Greet' photo opportunity - meaning the moment could be captured on camera, with the aforementioned Pokémon celebrating/lurking in the background.
</p>
<p>
After meeting while playing Pokémon Go in a London park, Martina and Shaun (pictured above) got engaged at Go Fest after being together for eight years. Several years of that time had been spent long-distance, between England and Spain, before Shaun moved out to live together with Martina in Barcelona this year.
</p>
<p>
"It was just the right time," Martina said, after popping the question. "After eight years of relationship, the last six of them being long-distance, we have finally managed to settle in the same place.
</p>
<p>
"The game has helped us discover new places where we live and wherever we go and we really enjoy going for Pokémon Go walks (so does our dog)," she continued. "We share a passion for the game and we enjoy being outdoors a lot. It has also connected us to other local players that have now become essential in our lives."
</p>
<p>
Other couples who got engaged included Dutch couple Joris and Louise, the former of whom moved up his plans to pop the question when he saw Go Fest on the schedule.
</p>
<p>
"I told Louise we had won a VIP meet and greet with Pikachu and Eevee, but as the day went by I got more and more nervous and hoped she didn't see anything, as I was carrying the ring with me," Joris said. "She didn't expect anything and it was a real surprise!"
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, for Benidorm couple Ana and Daniel, it was third time lucky. The pair have known each other since 2018, and in 2020, amidst the Covid pandemic, Ana discovered she was pregnant with their now-three-year-old daughter. 
</p>
<p>
"When I told him I was pregnant, he asked me to marry him, but I didn't want to because I didn't feel ready, and didn't want to do it because of the baby."
</p>
<p>
Ana later reciprocated the proposal, but the couple decided to settle - until now - without labels for their relationship. 
</p>
<p>
"I wanted to surprise him!" Ana said about proposing again at Go Fest. "In the end, Pokémon Go has given me a good boyfriend (hopefully husband!), a three-year-old daughter, many friends in Benidorm and even others around the world."
</p>
<p>
After this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fest-2024-dates-start-time-ticket-price-global-activities-9404">past weekend's Go Fest Global</a>, next up for Pokémon Go is the summer's Ultra Unlock events, which are set to see the launch of new species Tandemaus and the long-awaited debut of Mega Lucario.

<p>With racing simulators, there’s no name bigger in the world than iRacing. However, it’s not just true simulation games that the company is responsible for anymore. They are working on dirt racing, arcade titles, an official NASCAR game, and a <a href="https://www.iracing.com/orontes-games/exocross-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sci-fi themed rally-like racing</a> title known as ExoCross.</p>



<p>Developed by Orontes Games – whom iRacing acquired in 2021 – ExoCross is built on a completely custom engine that Orontes has mastered over the years. Mixed with things like AI and tire models from iRacing, ExoCross is a full package racer that you may not expect when looking at it from the outside.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ExoCross Final Preview - Our Impressions" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EFxYsURcJtQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The game offers you a number of modes, including Championship, Time Trials, Quick Races, and more. The Championship Mode can be viewed as the game’s story as it opens by explaining to you the premise of why you are racing on a different planet than earth. For the record, the game takes place 100 years in the future where all forms of fossil fuels and vehicles have been banned on earth.</p>







<p>There are three vehicles to choose from, each having their own pros and cons associated with their difficulty levels. For example, the Vulcan is easier to drive with its lower peak power and heavier weight while the lighter weight Titan can be tougher to keep stable due to its power, top speed, and the way it can slide on the track. Each car takes some time to get the hang of, but never feels too difficult, even with assists turned completely off.</p>



<p>There’s no upgrade options for your car. The only customization you can do is your number, decal, and the colors.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The AI battles on the track are the best part of the gameplay.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As you race you’ll have access to boost that replenishes while you drive. If you happen to be in the draft of an opponent, you’ll see your boost meter increase quicker than if you are by yourself. It adds strategy to how you drive, especially if you have someone behind you. Breaking their draft is key to keep them off your back and you in front.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s damage that you need to be aware of because despite these being giant metal cars that you’re controlling from a distance, they can still break. Drive too recklessly, and you’ll quickly find yourself either off the track or without a tire.</p>



<p>Going back to the AI, the battles you have, especially when you move to the higher difficulties, is as much fun in a racing game as you’ll get. Being side-to-side and bumping wheels while trying to not lose control is some of the most satisfying racing I’ve had in some time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From a simulation vs. arcade standpoint, ExoCross is a nice mix of both. Things such as surface transitions like going from asphalt to dirt and back again feel natural and require you to have that extra level of control to avoid a spin out. Hitting your drifts on turns is both challenging yet satisfying that will have you looking for more reasons to utilize your handbrake than not.</p>



<p>The game is designed to be played with both controller and wheel. Controller was the primary focus when developing, and it feels as smooth as you’d hope. Using a wheel, there are some tweaks that need to be done to get it just right. So, I’ll reserve an official opinion on how the wheel racing feels until launch.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The world surrounding ExoCross can be breathtaking.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Visually, it’s stunning. From the vehicles to the tracks to the overall atmosphere, ExoCross looks phenomenal. There’s just something about racing with Saturn in the backdrop that feels breathtaking. It can also be distracting the first time around because you just want to soak it all in. It’s where having a replay suite would come in handy.</p>



<p>As a whole, ExoCross is a fun racing game on a really solid engine. The cars feel great while giving you enough of a quick to learn yet hard to master feel. The Championship mode, as well as other offline options, give you a nice entry point into the game’s tracks and vehicles, and allow you to really learn the ins and outs before taking to online racing. There’s such a fun game here that feels like the foundation for something bigger in the future.</p>



<p>Where my concern sits with ExoCross is mainly in the replay factor. It’s going to rely heavily on&nbsp; online multiplayer. However, there is no cross-platform play. There’s cross-generation between Xbox and PlayStation consoles, but they can’t play with each other. And if you’re on PC, well you only have the PC player base to compete against.</p>



<p>Obviously, we’ll have to wait and see what the reception to the game is and how many people pick it up before making a judgment on that front. But from what the game offers you on the track, it’s&nbsp;</p>



<p>ExoCross officially launches on July 23 for PlayStation, PC, and Xbox. Insider Gaming’s full scored review of the game will come shortly after once multiplayer can be properly tested and the game’s full release with various bug fixes becomes available.</p>

			<p>The very best examples of the metroidvania form often take a ‘less is more’ approach to storytelling. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night doesn’t inundate you with lengthy exposition or drawn-out flashbacks, and even contemporary hits like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/13/hollow-knight-review/">Hollow Knight</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/27/momodora-reverie-under-the-moonlight-review/">Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight</a> let their well-developed worlds do most of the talking. Gestalt: Steam &amp; Cinder has one of the most interesting worlds I’ve ever seen in a sprawling platformer adventure like this, but a constant focus on exposition-filled, unexciting dialogue tears all the intrigue out of the experience and left me wishing this game could have burned so much brighter than just a cinder.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gestalt: Steam &amp; Cinder | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2GsLaTphHcY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I have to be real with you for a second: I am so sick of games opening with a bunch of illustrations and text boxes to explain the entire history of their world to you. When I’ve yet to see my protagonist or press a single button, it’s hard for me to care about or even remember the history textbook I’m being pop quizzed on. Gestalt: Steam &amp; Cinder does exactly this, outlining a history that began countless years ago when a Gate to the Abyss cracked open in the ground, leading hellspawn and demons to invade the world and drive humanity to near-extinction. Then humans used the power of the Abyss to create special armor, people wearing that armor fought and defeated the demons, and then the armour corrupted its wearers and the armour-wearing Akhaian warriors were led by The Betrayer to defeat humanity again. Then, one person in armor defeated the Betrayer, drove the Akhaians into exile, and the remaining human race built Canaan, the Steam City.</p>


<p>Anyway, Gestalt: Steam &amp; Cinder’s actual story kicks off countless generations after all of this and is barely about any of the events I described to you. Obviously it’s all a bit important, but it feels like putting the horse before the carriage to summarise all of these historic moments to the player instead of letting the immediate narrative and character interactions deliver bits of that info to me and draw me into this world more naturally.</p>


<p>Even more frustrating than the exposition-forward opening of the game is that a vast majority of the story that occurs afterwards barely involves your protagonist. Aletheia, the hero of this story, is a badass, beautiful crimson-haired bounty hunter who operates on her own terms and her own moral compass. She should be front and centre, but so much of the game’s opening acts instead focus on political conflict and intrigue playing out between other characters that feel far less exciting to be spending my time with.</p>
<p>When you’re given the reigns to guide Aletheia through city streets and winding dungeons, it’s a blast. Gestalt: Steam &amp; Cinder is rendered in gorgeous 32-bit style graphics, and the Castlevania: Symphony of the Night inspirations are immediately obvious. From the weight of your attacks and the precision of the platforming, to minute details like the after-image trail you leave behind as you dodge roll or the little pop-up in the corner of the screen when you pick up a new item. It’s an obvious homage, but there’s nothing wrong with that at all. Plus, I appreciate the modern touches blended in that make the game a little more distinct. Levelling up earns you points that you can use to unlock nodes on a skill tree – some nodes upgrade your sword or gun damage, while others will unlock new attacks or extend your basic combo.</p>

<p>Enemy design and placement is varied enough to keep you on your toes as you explore, but consistent enough that you’re quickly able to learn the best ways to rout each enemy and feel satisfied with your efficiency. Every enemy you fight has a health meter and a break meter, and while you can fire tesla bullets to quickly drain their break meter, you can only hold a few of those at any time. It leads to a really satisfying loop of dishing out sword attacks to build your ammo meter, then using your ammo to weaken your enemies, rinsing and then repeating.</p>
<p>The flow is a little less rewarding with boss battles, if only because those encounters tend to be a little too repetitive for their own good. Most bosses have limited move sets, slow movement, and a bit more health than you’d hope for. It leads to a lot of these fights dragging on just a bit longer than I would have liked.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, there’s a really special world and atmosphere to Gestalt: Steam &amp; Cinder. I love the character designs and environment art, and a lot of the lore lurking at the corners of the story is genuinely fascinating. The drawn out and exposition-stuffed storytelling drains so much of the magic, though, and what’s left behind is a fun if not slightly repetitive metroidvania that’ll still please fans of the genre, but probably not wow them.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/supraworld-early-access-release-planned-for-this-year.927405/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supraworld-early-access-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Supra Games has revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Supraworld&nbsp;</em>Early Access release is planned for sometime this fall, although the developer is hesitant to commit to a specific date or even a specific window right now.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1869290/view/6485829649605514602" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the game's Steam page</a>, Supra Games says that the current goal for&nbsp;<em>Supraworld</em>, which is a followup to 2019's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/supraland-review">shrunk-down 3D Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Supraland</em></a>, is to finish the first of its four acts "by the end of August".</p>
<p>Assuming that work is done and when the devs think "act 1 is solid", it'll be released in Early Access, which "might be in October", according to Supra Games. The dev does follow that announcement up with "we'll see", however, so it's far from set in stone.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/supraworld-early-access-release-date-dialogue.jpg?itok=B3i8JoKm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/supraworld-early-access-release-date-dialogue.jpg?itok=DvbBheua 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Supraworld&nbsp;</em>will feature more of <em>Supraland</em>'s non-linear exploration and irreverent humor.</figcaption></figure><p>Supra Games then provides a rationale for its decision to launch&nbsp;<em>Supraworld&nbsp;</em>in Early Access.</p>
<p>The developer says the decision was made "for feedback and motivation reasons". If players are able to provide feedback during Early Access, it reminds developers "why [they're] actually doing this", and also gives people "a better time instead of working on something in isolation forever".</p>
<p>Additionally, there's a more mercenary and practical reason for launching in Early Access; Supra Games says it's been working on&nbsp;<em>Supraworld&nbsp;</em>for three years (presumably since the launch of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supraland-devs-call-dlc-terrible-business-model-announce-supraland-six-inches-under">standalone&nbsp;<em>Supraland</em>&nbsp;expansion&nbsp;<em>Six Inches Under</em></a>) and "production is expensive".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/supraworld-early-access-release-date-monsters.jpg?itok=rjVlRq3H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/supraworld-early-access-release-date-monsters.jpg?itok=KFGad3Jx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Supra Games is targeting an Early Access release for&nbsp;<em>Supraworld</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The developer also seeks to reassure those who think that <i>Supraworld</i>'s first act taking three years might mean the rest take even longer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Supra Games, a lot of work has been done across acts two through four, but "it's just lots of loose bits" that haven't been properly connected yet. Hopefully, that means the full&nbsp;<em>Supraworld&nbsp;</em>release will come not too long after the Early Access launch.</p>
<p>At any rate,&nbsp;<em>Supraworld&nbsp;</em>is due to arrive in Early Access later this year. Stay tuned for more on this promising-looking project.</p>

            <p>Just shy of two years since the release of Two Point Campus, the Two Point Studios team has begun teasing its next project, suggesting an announcement is on the horizon.</p>
<p>A post on the <a href="https://community.twopointcounty.com/two-point-studios/two-point-campus/blogs/74-operation-charter-archaeology-mystery">Two Point County site</a> shared a few days ago informed the community that Two Point's fictional and eccentric millionaire Wiggy Silverbottom was in need of some assistance.</p>
<p>"As you know, our beloved intrepid explorer is always on the lookout for his next adventure. So a few months ago, he assembled a team of newly graduated (so-called) experts in his field to embark on a top-secret and extremely important mission. There they made a remarkable discovery..." the site teased.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, there was a <em>slight</em> hiccup before this discovery reached its destination... the whole thing went missing! This caused quite a stir, as you'd imagine."</p>

<p>While the Two Point developer didn't specify precisely what this 'discovery' is, we know it to be some kind of artefact. And, it transpires that poor old Silverbottom is not alone in his predicament, as other artefacts have also gone astray.</p>
<p>The only clue as to their whereabouts was a "weird note" written in mysterious symbols (see below), which the community needed to decode. And thus began the first chapter of this story, which the Two Point team has named Operation: Charter.</p>
<p>Currently, fans have figured out the text translates to "Goons meet back at the lagoon" - though what this then means is as yet unclear. If you're keen to join the puzzle solving, you can head over to <a href="https://discord.com/channels/510054255416311808/1260936209014718534">Two Point Studio's Discord server</a> to pitch in.</p>
<p>The rest of the story will take the community "on a journey to investigate the mysterious heists" complete with puzzles, up until the developer is presumably ready to officially unveil its next game.</p>

<p>As for the studio's most recent title Two Point Campus (which released in 2022), we were rather taken with the whole thing.</p>
<p>"Just as it did with Two Point Hospital, Two Point Studios has combined neatly overlapping management systems with an irrepressably oddball charm," our Ed wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-point-campus-review-university-was-never-this-fun">Eurogamer's Two Point Campus review</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1812835599369359753" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X today, Ed Boon of NetherRealm Studios revealed the official gameplay trailer for Takeda Takahashi, who will join the Mortal Kombat 1 roster starting July 23, 2024.</p>



<p>Boon <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1806792243044336115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first teased</a> Takeda weeks ago, who is also the final Kombat Pack 1 fighter.  Fans can play the character on July 23 with Early Access. Players can earn Early Access by purchasing the associated Kombat Pack or the Premium Edition for Mortal Kombat 1.</p>



<p>Today’s gameplay trailer revealed some of Takeda’s moveset, dialogue, and a brutal fatality using their signature weapons.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Since Takeda will release on July 23 with Early Access, the full release should follow a week later. Most recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-1-adding-homelander-ferra-kameo-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat 1 added Homelander</a> to the roster in June 2024. Homelander followed that schedule, with an Early Access release on June 4 and a full release on June 11, 2024.</p>



<p>Fans will recognize Takeda Takahashi for appearing in Mortal Kombat X. Takeda will also be playable at EVO 2024.</p>



<p>Although the devs planned to release the Ferra kameo last month, the delayed kamo will finally release alongside Takeda next week.</p>



<p>Most recently, a new tease surfaced online suggesting that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-remaster-being-teased-by-studio-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat remaster</a> could be on the way. Eyeballistic CEO Joe Tresca encouraged fans to keep an eye on something related to the franchise with a screenshot.</p>

                <p>The first-ever Olympic Esports Games are heading to the Middle East in 2025, thanks to a new agreement between the International Olympic Committee and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The 2025 event will be the first part of the IOC's 12-year deal with Saudi Arabia's National Olympic Committee. But the final details about where and when it will take place next year have yet to be revealed.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inaugural-olympic-esports-games-2025-will-be-held-in-saudi-arabia" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, the French newspaper <a href="https://www.lequipe.fr/Esport/Actualites/L-arabie-saoudite-accueillera-les-premiers-jeux-olympiques-de-l-esport-en-2025-league-of-legends-envisage/1481996" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">L'Equipe</a> is reporting that video game companies like Capcom, Riot Games, and Epic Games are under consideration for partnerships with the IOC for next year's event. If those deals go through, titles like Street Fighter 6, League of Legends, and Rocket League could be included at the 2025 Olympic Esports Games. Saudi Arabia is already a major investor in video game companies, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-studio-owner-embracer-defends-decision-to-take-1-billion-from-saudi-arabia/1100-6504587/" data-ref-id="1100-6504587">Embracer</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabias-400-billion-wealth-fund-invests-in-ea-activision-blizzard-and-take-two/1100-6487651/" data-ref-id="1100-6487651">EA, Take-Two, and Activision Blizzard</a>.

"Supported by His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, Crown Prince and Prime Minister, our Kingdom has become a global hub for professional esports. Hosting this event is the result of a rich past, an exciting present and a promising future for the industry in the Kingdom. This is a natural next step for our young athletes, our country and the global esports community."</p><p>The esports outreach is the latest step in Saudi Arabia's attempt to rehabilitate its reputation for its horrific human rights violations against women and LGBT people. Prince Mohammed bin Salman himself has reportedly been linked to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-khashoggi-death-penalty.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 2018 death and dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashoggi</a>. But as long as organizations like the IOC and WWE are still willing to accept Saudi Arabia's money to hold events in that country, then the kingdom's efforts to reframe itself in more positive terms appear to be working.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/aliens-fireteam-elite-2-seemingly-leaked-coming-in-2025.927381/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/aliens-fireteam-elite-2-leak-rumor<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new leak appears to have confirmed the existence of&nbsp;<em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite 2</em>, a followup to the 2021 squad-based third-person shooter. If the leak is correct, the game is set to launch sometime next year.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AliensFireteamElite/comments/1e2r9kj/aliens_fireteam_elite_2_leaked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">document spotted by Redditor firemonkey11</a> (with additional reporting from <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/aliens-fireteam-elite-2-information-seemingly-appears-online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VGC</a>),&nbsp;<em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite 2</em>, which is currently codenamed&nbsp;<em>Project Macondo</em>, is set to launch in the third quarter of the 2025 financial year, which would likely mean somewhere between September and December next year.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor, the game will be a third-person co-op shooter, but it'll make some changes to the first game's formula, including the addition of a class system and the removal of in-game voice chat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aliens-fireteam-elite-2-leaked-first-game-shot.jpg?itok=D--sXgte 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aliens-fireteam-elite-2-leaked-first-game-shot.jpg?itok=sQ4yj8xL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>2021's&nbsp;<em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite&nbsp;</em>is getting a followup next year, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite 2&nbsp;</em>will feature "evolved enemy intelligence and behaviors", according to the leaked document, and it'll also give you the chance to test your alien-slaying skills in the new Annihilation Mode, a "new spin on Horde Mode".</p>
<p>The sequel will give you a choice between five different character archetypes, including the "silent assassin" Callsign Nix and the "inspiring leader" Callsign Vulcan. This represents a fairly major change over the original's more modular build-crafting system.</p>
<p>According to the document,&nbsp;<em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite 2&nbsp;</em>won't feature any microtransactions, gacha systems, or in-game advertising, and it also won't support native in-game chat, instead asking players to use the voice chat included with the platform on which they're playing.</p>
<p>Some of these purported changes haven't proven popular with&nbsp;<em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite&nbsp;</em>fans; one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AliensFireteamElite/comments/1e2r9kj/comment/ld335cb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="noopener" target="_blank">simply says</a> that the plan appears to be to "make it worse" in the sequel, while <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AliensFireteamElite/comments/1e2r9kj/comment/ld2zo65/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="noopener" target="_blank">another says</a> the character classes and kits included in the leak "ain't doing it for me".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aliens-fireteam-elite-2-gameplay-first-game.jpg?itok=zjnkLjwT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aliens-fireteam-elite-2-gameplay-first-game.jpg?itok=jIf3utiG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of&nbsp;<em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em>'s features might not end up in its sequel.</figcaption></figure><p>This leak is apparently part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/details-of-unannounced-disney-projects-including-games-leak-online-after-another-slack-hack" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a larger Disney hack</a> that also supposedly contains personal employee details, as well as information about other unannounced projects.</p>
<p>Disney hasn't issued a comment regarding the hack yet, but it was apparently carried out by accessing the company's internal Slack messaging system, which is also apparently how the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-leaks-include-over-hour-of-footage">infamous 2022&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>leak</a> happened.</p>
<p>At the moment, it's worth taking these reports with a pinch of salt, but if the leak is correct, then you can likely expect an&nbsp;<em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite 2&nbsp;</em>announcement sometime in the near future. Stay tuned for more.</p>

You can make a comparison easily by using the fake pool described earlier.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Redo benchmark measurements each time you make changes that could affect the execution of any of the pool delegates.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For pools that control visual effects, consider centralizing pool capacities and policies so you can easily tie these with performance profiles.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Classes that use generic hash tables or dictionaries should take an optional comparer that is fed to the hashtable or dictionary.

Most of the discussion in this post assumes that the objects we want to hash are reference types. Structs are often smaller objects, and their creation does not directly affect garbage collection, so in many cases it may not make sense to pool them at all. Besides, when passing them between methods, their values are copied, so any gains trying to avoid creation will be thwarted. There may well be occasions where pooling structs may be useful. In that case though, the pool designs discussed here will probably not be appropriate.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Be careful when decreasing the pool capacity:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Make sure to destroy inactive objects first.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Decide how to handle active objects. In the implementation here we do not decrease below the number of inactive objects. In active object tracking pools, you can also destroy active objects if you choose. With non-tracking pools, how to interpret what it means to reduce beyond the inactive objects is difficult. What if users try to return objects beyond the current capacity? Do you destroy them then?</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If your pool can destroy active objects, let the user specify whether to deactivate active objects first before destroying them.</span></p></div></li></ul></div></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In any operation where you ask for n things to be done, if it is possible for less than n things to be done, return the actual number of things done.

            <p>Genshin Impact has once again been accused of cultural appropriation from fans and voice actors in response to the reveal of its new cast of Natlan characters.</p>
<p>Every region in Genshin Impact draws heavy inspiration from real world countries and cultures, basing each region's general design, mythology, and music on these various real-world areas. Inazuma is representative of Japan, Fontaine of France, Mondstadt of Germany and the Netherlands, and so on.</p>
<p>Based on its character and region names, established mythology, and glimpses of what the area looks like in trailers, the upcoming Natlan region looks set to take great inspiration from countries and cultures in both Africa and the Ring of Fire area surrounding the Pacific Ocean, which includes Latin America and Aboriginal Australian cultures. But fans say that this isn't reflected in Natlan's character designs, and now the game's voice actors have joined in the criticism via social media.</p>
<p>"I really hope that a video game company listens to its fanbase when valid criticism is made multiple years in a row about the execution of its research and inclusion of elements/aspects of other cultures," said <a href="https://x.com/annejyatco/status/1812215122888437830">Anne Yatco</a>, who voices Raiden Shogun in the game.</p>

<p>Valeria Rodríguez, who voices Sucrose, <a href="https://x.com/ElvisBadger/status/1811938029709496606">shared a similar sentiment</a>: "If you're going to use real-world deities, RESPECT them. If you're basing off of real cultures, RESPECT THAT. I'm fine with things being inspired by various cultures - that's awesome. Representation is dope. But bare minimum do some research and show some cultural appreciation."</p>
<p>Rodríguez also compared Genshin Impact's representation of Ọlọrun, the supreme Yoruba deity, with that seen in popular MOBA Smite, showing the stark contrast of skin colour between the two. "This is unforgivable. Look at what a sick job Smite did with their own interpretation!!! IT'S NOT HARD!!!"</p>
<p>Alejandro Saab, who voices Cyno in Genshin Impact and Jing Yuan in Honkai: Star Rail, retweeted Rodríguez's Smite comparison, adding "You still got time to fix it", presumably addressing Genshin Impact developer HoYoverse.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted HoYoverse for comment.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Genshin Impact's Albedo voice actor, Khoi Dao, also <a href="https://x.com/khoidaooo/status/1812140177126723759">addressed Ọlọrun's representation</a>: "If a game draws so heavily from real-world cultures, and bases a character on the supreme deity of Yoruba religion, and that character ends up looking like pale sasuke Batman, people are absolutely within their rights to demand better representation, ESPECIALLY when said game has a clearly-stated commitment to a *global* audience. I hope y'all keep making your voices heard, and I hope they listen."</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Genshin Impact has been called out by fans for its overwhelmingly light-skinned cast of characters, as the same criticisms have been continually made against Sumeru, a nation with heavy South Asian, Middle Eastern, and North African influences. However, this is the first time so many prominent HoYoverse voice actors have spoken up, which seems to have brought more attention to the issue.</p>

<p>The hashtag 'BoycottHYV' has been steadily gaining momentum on X since the Natlan character reveal, which fans are using to share their frustrations, petitions, and character redesigns. HoYoverse has yet to respond, and has continued to post Natlan character teases on their social media. The company isn't known for addressing controversies, but with Chinese players and its own voice actors criticising Natlan's characters, fans believe the company may be more likely to respond than usual.</p>
<p>Zeno Robinson, who voices Sethos in Genshin Impact, <a href="https://x.com/childishgamzeno/status/1812108021050318922">sums up</a> the worldwide dissatisfaction with Natlan's characters well: "If even your base audience, the Chinese fans, are asking for better representation/or character[s] with different shades of melanin, who are you making these characters for?"</p>

			<p>Sony might not have much this year coming from its own PlayStation Studios, but Astro Bot certainly is the notable exception. <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-revealed-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unveiled</a> during May's State of Play broadcast, Astro Bot <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-is-the-biggest-game-made-by-team-asobi-with-80-levels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> to be the biggest game made to date by Team Asobi with 80 levels.</p>
<p>Speaking to EDGE Magazine (<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=31026X886738&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Faaa-fallout-crpg-was-larians-alternative-pick-if-they-didnt-get-the-baldurs-gate-license-from-wizards-of-the-coast%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.magazinesdirect.com%2Faz-magazines%2F6936449%2Fedge-magazine-subscription.thtml&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=-120&amp;xuuid=0ad38a56c8611bae7d8f9493083ecd87&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue #400</a>), Team Asobi's Studio Director and Creative Director Nicolas Doucet revealed that the developer considered an open world design but decided against it to provide optimal variety.</p>
<p><em>Actually, we did consider, at first: should this be an open world game? In the end, we went for a level-based approach, because that was the one that gave us the most control over the game’s variety.</em></p>
<p>On that note, Doucet also said Astro Bot will continuously provide players with new mechanics to learn and experiment with to avoid repetition.</p>
<p><em>We don’t really stretch any mechanic too much until it becomes repetitive. We give you just enough to want more, and then move on to something else. We want it to be fresh, to be really surprising the player.</em></p>
<p>Power-ups will be key to the ever-changing mechanics, as Team Asobi only plans to use each two to three times throughout the entire game.</p>
<p><em>Usually, we use them twice. Up to three times maximum. The first time you use the power-up, you get introduced a little bit to what the next use case will be. Like a preview of what’s to come. There will also be free DLC coming that really takes the power-ups to a level of high precision.</em></p>
<p>Astro Bot, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-devs-explain-why-the-game-doesnt-support-ps-vr2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won't support PS VR2</a> despite the franchise's debut on the original PlayStation VR, is slated to launch for PlayStation 5 on September 26. Considering Sony's aggressive multiplatform strategy, we might see the game launching on PC, too, at some point in the next couple of years.</p>

Because of this, Starry Studio said it had “no other choice” but to limit the number of players on each server.</p><p>“But we'll admit that this has indeed caused inconvenience for some players, so we are working on improving that,” the developer added. “We apologize for the inconvenience.”</p><p>Starry Studio went on to explain exactly why too many players on a single server causes problems for Once Human. It’s a helpful insight into the way the game works and the challenges developers face when it comes to MMO-style games such as these.</p><p>“Once Human is an open-world survival building game where resources on the map are limited in numbers,” Starry Studio said. “If too many players get on the same server, they will have a hard time finding a suitable spot to create their territory. Additionally, some late-game content such as the Stronghold Conquest for PvP servers will be affected. According to our previous test data, we discovered that the current scenarios could offer a better gaming experience if the number of players on each server was limited between 6,000 and 8,000. That's why we've set a limit. Once that limit is exceeded, players will have to wait in queue. This is all for the online players to enjoy a better gaming experience.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>At the time of this article’s publication, nine of Once Human’s servers are completely full. Starry Studio suggested players play on other servers instead in order to get in the game. In the meantime, Starry Studio said it will soon raise the limit for each server, which should mean players can play on the server of their choice, “but this measure is not a long-term solution, so you should still try to avoid servers that seem too crowded.” An August update will add an invitation code feature so you can invite players to join your server even when the server is already full.</p><p>In the shorter term, a patch scheduled for July 18 will make some initial improvements, with plans to offer compensation “for those who spend too long waiting in a queue.”</p><p>“We understand that you eagerly want to have fun with your friends. We assure you that our team is hard at work resolving issues related to server loads, and we are doing all that we can to improve the queuing issue,” Starry Studio said.</p><p>Last week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-hit-once-human-to-make-all-purchased-cosmetics-accessible-across-multiple-characters-following-backlash">Starry Studio responded to a backlash about how cosmetics work in Once Human, and promised changes</a>. Once Human has a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam, with some players expressing concern about everything from the game’s privacy policy to the use of the NetEase Launcher. In gameplay terms, players have hit out at mandatory seasonal resets and how they can affect your sense of progression and attachment to your character, as well as cosmetics being tied to individual characters.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>In order to bring Japanese games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-step-inside-the-plumber-rpgs-back/1900-6418230/" data-ref-id="1900-6418230">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/1900-6418063/" data-ref-id="1900-6418063">Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> to America and other countries around the world, Nintendo uses teams of internal and external translators to fully localize each title. But you'd never know that from the games' credits, which exclude the names of the external translators. Now, a small number of external translators are speaking out about not being credited for their contributions to some of Nintendo's biggest titles.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/nintendo-s-systemic-policy-of-miscredting-is-harming-external-translators#close-modal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameDeveloper.com</a>, an anonymous former Nintendo employee--who currently works as a translator for Nintendo through an outside company called Localsoft--has detailed the onerous terms that the external translators have had to deal with. In addition to not getting any credit in the games themselves, the translators have to sign a 10-year NDA that prevents them from telling anyone they worked on the titles or even putting them on their resumes. </p><p>"I felt I would benefit from being able to state I worked on the title when offering my services to new clients. Not to mention that I actually spent a fair amount of time working almost exclusively for them," wrote an anonymous translator. "It is nigh impossible for translators to push back against this structure. Anyone trying will get blacklisted before getting anywhere. This is a field where taking an annual break can shut you out of months of work. No one cares what we think because there's literally nothing we can do about it, and that's even if we were willing to forfeit our livelihood for the greater good." </p><p>Nintendo's exclusion of the external translators from their rightful credit appears to be the company's stance on the issue. As noted above, the vast majority of the translators are unwilling to risk their livelihoods by calling out Nintendo's practices. But the only way this issue can be addressed is if the public pressure is great enough to convince Nintendo to change that policy. Otherwise the status quo will remain.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-game-hotel">Death Game Hotel</a> came out last week - a comically gory game in which players play casino-style card games around a table and raise the stakes by betting their own limbs. It's a VR game, which is a break from the norm for White Owls, the studio run by Hidetaka "Swery" Suehiro (then again, what is their "norm"?). It's also got a big multiplayer component, with lots of jovial bubble-popping and chicken-squeezing between the comedy blood spurts. And this taste of multiplayer mischief has Swery's head percolating. This game won't be his last dipped toe in the multiplayer ocean, he told us.</p>
<p>"In the future," said Swery, "I would like to leverage this experience to challenge myself with something new in the online multiplayer realm (something you probably haven't even imagined yet)."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's just a tease. He didn't say much more about future plans in our chat. We do know Swery is already working with Goichi Suda (aka Suda51) on a totally different deadly guesthouse - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2286600/HOTEL_BARCELONA/">Hotel Barcelona</a>. But whatever multiplayer mayhem is marinating in Swery's head, it isn't related to that.</p>

<p>For now, Swery is mostly keen to get players into the lobbies of the studio's VR gambling den, where each player has a goblet full of blood in front of them, into which they must drop their increasingly unhinged bets. He said the idea for a mortal multiplayer table game came during the Covid-19 pandemic, when workers at the studio started hanging out in VR to discuss work.</p>
<p>"During the 'Stay Home' phase, when we couldn't leave our homes or meet friends and colleagues, we at White Owls distributed VR headsets to all employees and held game meetings in VR," he said. "This experience led to the idea of creating a place where people could gather and connect, which heavily inspired this project."</p>
<p>This'll be Swery's 17th published game (at least according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidetaka_Suehiro">his wiki</a>), not surprising for someone who's been making video games since the 1990s, sometimes to a mixed reception. The lead developer of cult favourite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadly-premonition">Deadly Premonition</a> and cosy village cat-person simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-good-life">The Good Life</a>, communicated that he was satisfied with his studio's previous works. Even if the nature of making art means there's always something left undone. </p>
<p>"As a game creator, I believe all the works I've created are 'eternally unfinished' yet considered 'as complete as they’ll ever be.'"</p>

<p>When I asked if he had any advice to give to younger developers, he dispensed with any flowery talk and put it to me straight: know what you're making.</p>
<p>"Big companies make AAA titles by investing money," he said. "Indies try to compete with big titles by offering something unique that can't be experienced elsewhere. I think it’s important to look deep within and ask yourself what it is you are offering - and how - in order to avoid moving forward without a strategy."</p>
<p>Swery is also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/swery-on-the-cats-and-countryside-of-the-good-life"> a fully certified Buddhist monk who gives excellent appraisal of felines</a>, having previously given me some good advice on my cat's behaviour. When I told the studio head and fellow cat enjoyer I no longer lived with my precious moggy due to a breakup (sniff), he knew which tone to adopt.</p>
<p>"Everyone has different approaches to healing from the loss of a relationship with a beloved cat," he said. "Getting another cat (preferably a newborn kitten), reading cat blogs daily, finding another girlfriend who has a cat, or chatting with an AI pretending to be a cat – all could be some good options. </p>
<p>"As for me, I would calm my mind by believing that we will meet again someday (in another dimension). For now, let's play Death Game Hotel together and cheer up! Hang in there!"</p>
<p>Death Game Hotel is for sale <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/7371422382882960/?utm_medium=yt&amp;utm_source=social&amp;utm_campaign=1-aw-deathgamehotel-20240708&amp;utm_content=3&amp;utm_term=quest">on the Meta store</a> if you're Oculus'd up.  The developer also points out there's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/deathgamehotel">a Discord server</a> where staff at the studio arrange to play games, sometimes involving Swery too. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-kernel-exploit/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-series-x-new-kernel-exploit-collateral-damage-released-online.927330/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-kernel-exploit/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One SystemOS kernel exploit called Collateral Damage was released online today, giving users total control over the SystemOS virtual machine to do things normally not possible in retail mode.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/exploits-forsale/collateral-damage">Collateral Damage exploit</a>, which was developed by Emma Kirkpatrick and Lander Brandt, targets systems running kernel versions 25398.4478, 25398.4908, and 25398.4909 and uses the Game Script UWP application. As explained by one of the exploit's developers on <a href="https://x.com/carrot_c4k3/status/1799981812523172027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1799981812523172027%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X/Twitter</a>, this isn't a jailbreak, as SystemOS is the virtual machine where apps run, which is the same environment users get control over when enabling dev mode. As such, the exploit doesn't allow piracy but essentially gives users full control of SystemOS without dev mode.</p>
<p>Being the first release, the Collateral Damage Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S exploit is not fully reliable, as it relies on a CPU side channel as well as race conditions, which can fail. In case they do fail, the console will simply crash and reboot, so there should not be any danger of bricking a system. Additionally, the exploit is best used offline for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Even without this exploit, which could definitely lead to some interesting developments, the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S were already homebrew-friendly systems thanks to dev mode. Multiple emulators for older gaming systems can already run on the systems, and some recent developments may lead to Microsoft's current-generation systems emulating <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-run-playstation-3-games/">PlayStation 3 games</a> even before the PlayStation 5.</p>

The Covid pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine were the biggest setbacks in development of Baldur's Gate 3, said CEO Swen Vincke.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Edge magazine, Vincke discussed how Larian closed a studio in St Petersburg, Russia, and was "fighting with embassies" to relocate staff.
</p>
<p>
"I had already thought about what we were going to do if it actually happened," said Vincke. "So the decision was instant: we can't stay there. We needed to move people away because, as these things go, you can almost predict that eventually there's going to be a mobilisation, and that meant that all my team was going to go to war."

</figure>
<p>

A joint task force of the developer's studio operations, finance and legal teams was then set up to facilitate the move.
</p>
<p>
"They did an incredible job, worked day and night to be able to get every single person a tailored solution to get them out of there," said Vincke. "I'm super-proud of them for doing that."
</p>
<p>
As a result, over 90 percent of staff from the St Petersburg team were relocated to other Larian studios.
</p>
<p>
"That meant that we started fighting with embassies and consulates," said Vincke. "It was really complicated."
</p>
<p>
Though of course worthwhile, this did cause setbacks in development.
</p>
<p>
"In a machine as complicated as an RPG, where everything's connected to everything, if you suddenly start ripping stuff out, the entire thing collapses," said Vincke. "Because things that were supposed to be done are not being done. It's not that they didn't try, but it was really, really hard. You could see the ripple effect of that lasting all through the end of development."
</p>
<p>
On a more positive note, the success of the game began to affect development due to all the award shows staff attended.
</p>
<p>
Baldur's Gate 3 won a huge number of awards, including top honours at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-sweeps-the-game-awards">The Game Awards</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-takes-home-best-game-and-four-more-awards-at-this-years-baftas">BAFTA Game Awards</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developers-use-award-show-win-to-address-state-of-the-industry">the DICE Awards</a>.
</p>
<p>
"I think it's great that you have a moment of celebration, but we still have award shows that we're going to," said Vincke. "Because they're important, and we really appreciate it, but it would be cool if everybody could agree to do it all at the same time."
</p>
<p>
And while Larian is of course grateful, Vincke said attending ongoing award shows "is surprisingly draining on the soul. I certainly didn't expect that. I think we've all been more emotional because we can't get closure. And you want to have closure at the end of a project.
</p>
<p>
"We sent rotating teams," he said. "So different people went to different award shows. It affects development - there's a lot of them." He added, laughing: "This has been a real problem."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-adds-official-modding-toolkit-this-autumn">Larian is adding modding tools to the game in September</a>. At a BAFTA talk last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mod-support-in-baldurs-gate-3-will-be-final-handover-moment-to-players-says-larian-ceo">Vincke stated this would be a final handover moment to players</a>.
</p>
<p>
"One of the big things for us, and the one that we're really working towards now, is the ability for players to mod [Baldur's Gate 3] themselves, because then they will be able to make their own things," said Vincke. "And I think that will be the point where we're going to say 'ok, now it's yours fully'."

			<p>The first official GTA VI trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-trailer-breaks-100-million-youtube-views-is-the-biggest-non-bts-video-ever-for-its-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set</a> new records right away, becoming the most-viewed YouTube video (except for two songs by South Korean boy band BTS) on its launch day. In just 34 hours, the trailer had already amassed 100 million views.</p>
<p>It's been a little over seven months since December 5, and the GTA VI trailer has now reached the impressive milestone of 200 million views. For comparison, the debut GTA V trailer only has around 111 million views despite having been on YouTube for twelve years. The trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto installment also helped its signature song, Tom Petty's Love Is a Long Road, mark a mind-boggling 36,979% increase in Spotify streams.</p>
<p>These figures once again reaffirm the incredible amount of hype for what is now undoubtedly the most anticipated game in the industry, following GTA V's 200 million units sold to date. In fact, according to Circana (formerly NPD), GTA VI is <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected</a> to be the biggest entertainment launch of all time when it launches.</p>
<p>Currently, Take-Two has <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">established</a> a Fall 2025 launch window for Grand Theft Auto VI. However, looking at Rockstar's recent track record, it is hard to imagine there won't be any delays. GTA V was originally slated to launch in Q2 2013 before being moved to September 17, 2013. Red Dead Redemption 2 fared even worse, suffering two major delays: from the second half of 2017 to <a href="http://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-2-delayed-screenshots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spring 2018</a> and later to <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-2-final-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 26, 2018</a>, the final launch date. That's more or less in line with the average of triple-A games, which also tend to see one or two delays.</p>
<p>Of course, it is also possible Rockstar Games has improved its internal development prediction model. GTA fans certainly are eager to play a brand new entry in the franchise, having already waited for nearly eleven years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-online-bottom-dollar-bounties-update-out-now-adding-bounty-hunts-dispatch-work-and-new-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continues to update GTA Online</a>, which, as we had all assumed, essentially <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-rockstar-dev-says-kick-ass-gta-v-standalone-trevor-dlc-was-scrapped-to-milk-gta-onlines-cash-cow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannibalized </a>a promising GTA V story DLC with its incredible appeal.</p>

IGN has asked 2K for comment.</p><p>According to the site, the image is taken from a 2021 showreel that depicts an early demo build of the game, so it’s already years out of date and probably doesn’t reflect what fans can expect to play when the next BioShock eventually comes out.</p><p>It includes the expected first-person shooter perspective from the previous BioShock games, as well as a basic user interface and what’s called a ‘Ricochet Shotgun.’ We see what looks like BioShock-style plasmid powers in icon form, triggered by controller bumper button presses. It's hard to tell what these are meant to indicate, but one looks like an electricity bolt, which would be very BioShock. Another looks like a stopwatch, so perhaps there were, and still are, plans to be able to pause time during gameplay.</p><p>The character is facing what looks like a burning orb set atop a pedestal of some kind. Of note: the codename Parkside is displayed on the image, which tallies with a 2019 <a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-the-new-bioshock-has-been-in-the-works-for-yea-1840314561" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kotaku</a> report that revealed the same codename, and a recent Epic Game Store leak of video game codenames.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Judas State of Play Trailer</h3></div></output><p>2K announced the upcoming <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/12/09/new-bioshock-game-confirmed-being-developed-by-new-developer-cloud-chamber"><u>BioShock sequel</u></a> in 2019. It’s in development at 2K studio Cloud Chamber after initially being outsourced to Halo support studio Certain Affinity. 2K is yet to call the game BioShock 4, so it remains unclear whether it will be a sequel, a prequel, or something separate to what’s come before.</p><p>But we do know it’s set in what 2K has called a “new and fantastical world”, so don’t expect a return to Rapture or Columbia, the settings of BioShock 1 and 2, and Bioshock Infinite, respectively.</p><p>Original BioShock development chief Ken Levine is not involved.

            <p>If there’s one series that can be relied upon to dole out 80-hour helpings of joy straight into my eager face at regularly scheduled intervals, it’s the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> brawler stylings of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/yakuza">Yakuza</a>/<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-like-a-dragon">Like A Dragon</a>. One could, I believe, make a convincing argument for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-0">Yakuza 0</a> being - if not the best videogame ever made - then at least the <em>most</em> videogame. While this coming October’s Amazon series won’t be the <a href="https://youtu.be/6qKAM2UxFVs">first live action adaption</a> of Yakuza, I am hopeful its episodic format will give its characters a bit more room to breathe. Or, according to Kiryu actor Ryoma Takeuchi in an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/interview-ryoma-takeuchi-like-a-dragon-yakuza-kazuma-kiryu">interview with IGN</a>, to find the love they’ve always longed for.</p>

<p>“Rather than me becoming Kiryu, I had to create Kiryu from scratch,” Takeuchi told IGN Japan. This is music to my ears, honestly. It’s always reassuring to hear an actor not treat previous depictions of a character with so much reverence it becomes stifling, even if the interview makes it sound like Takeuchi has clearly spent a lot of time researching the games for his own portrayal. “I have great respect for the feelings of the fans,” Takeuchi says. “But when I play a character, I have to express them in my own way, so I can’t pay attention to the preconceptions of others."</p>

<p>Takeuchi told IGN he sees Kiryu as a man who’s “starved for love," saying ““I think we all unconsciously chase after what is missing in our lives, and we all want to be loved.” With this in mind, Takeuchi continues, “I thought about what Kiryu might be searching for in Kamurocho, as he strives to become the Dragon of Dojima. He wants a family, he wants love, and he doesn’t even realise how much this drives him.” And, yep, that’s Kiryu.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Takeuchi talks about honing Kiryu’s different fighting styles before and after the character’s prison sentence. “When the story starts in 1995, Kiryu’s fighting style is still rough and not very effective, because he has not formally learned martial arts and he is just using his instincts,” he says. “I wanted to portray him growing as a fighter, as he gradually becomes able to beat his opponents. So his fighting style in each of the two eras is very different.”</p>
<p>Takeuchi is obviously a bit more fresh-faced than the Dragon Of Dojima we know. But as long as he can lift a bicycle over his head and belt out Judgement at karaoke, he’s fine by me. I had a chat with the localisers of Yakuza: Like A Dragon a while back about translating <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/like-a-dragons-localisation-team-explain-how-they-bring-the-series-singular-storytelling-to-the-west">the jokes and other fun nuances</a> of the series from Japanese to English, in which they detailed the subtleties of Kiryu and Ichiban being great mates who have each other's backs.</p>

			<p>Morthal may not be among the most stunning locations in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, but even a small city like it can look stunning with the help of modern technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lion_towers3d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leo Torres</a>, who has been remaking <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-remade-unreal-engine-5/">towns and cities</a> from the fifth entry in the series by Bethesda using Unreal Engine 5, shared today a new video showcasing recreation of the city with lore-accurate scale made in the 5.4 version of the engine as well as Nanite for all models and foliage and Lumen for global illumination and reflections. Needless to say, the end results look incredible, giving the town the visual identity it kind of lacked in the original game.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Real Scale of Morthal: Skyrim in UNREAL ENGINE 5!

<p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was released well over ten years ago, but it continues to receive plenty of attention from modders who have vastly improved the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-ray-tracing/">visuals.</a> Unfortunately, a proper remake of the game is nowhere in sight, and with Bethesda currently working on the sixth entry in the series, we may not see one in a very long time, if ever. The studio, thankfully, hasn't forgotten about its popular game, releasing the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1746860/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Anniversary_Upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anniversary Edition</a> to celebrate the game's 10th anniversary with new content and features. Who knows, maybe the 20th anniversary will be the right occasion to release a remake that would certainly be very well received.</p>

            <p>"Honey, I shrunk the first-person puzzler. Twice." This is how I like to imagine the designer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/supraworld">Supraworld</a> explaining the hijinks that unfold in his life. Supraworld, the sequel to toybox explorer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/supraland">Supraland</a>, is going to hit early access this year, say developers Supra Games in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/813630/view/6338336761809130584?l=english">an update post on Steam</a>. These are happy words for anyone who enjoyed 2019's dander among the sandcastles and erasers. A lot of games offer a "sandbox" but in Supraland, the entire world really did take place in exactly that - a sandbox out in a garden, full of toys. The sequel's launch into early access "might be in october," says the post. "We'll see."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Explaining why the studio has again decided to follow the early access route, Supra Games are straight-talking, calling it "a great advantage for feedback and motivation reasons." </p>
<p>"Seeing people play what you're making, you are being reminded why you're actually doing this and try to give people a better time instead of working on something in isolation forever.</p>
<p>"We also simply need the Early Access income because we're working on the game for 3 years now and production is expensive."</p>
<p>I like it when game devs speak plainly. Production <em>is</em> expensive. The previous game was always marketed with a similarly comical frankness. The Steam blurb, often reserved for high-falutin' game summaries, straight up tells you how much time Supraland can take. "Playtime 12-25h." And the game's trailer ends not with a poetic or catchy tagline beneath the title, but a pie chart showing how much of the game is devoted to "exploration," "puzzles", and "fighting". They may as well ask the prospective buyer: "Do you understand there is limited time on this earth? Are you a parent?" </p>
<p>Well, it pleased one dad, at least. In his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supraland-review">Supraland review</a> John (RPS in peace) called it "an absolute joy of a game. It really does stand comparisons with Portal, Zelda and Metroid, which is no mean feat."</p>
<p>In Supraworld, you'll be continuing the puzzling and nose-poking as an apprentice "solver" (who needs subtext, eh?) "Solvers are the most important people in this world," says the game's description, "because puzzle storms are rising all over the place, making people's lives harder."</p>

It appears the credits for Elden Ring, revised after the release of DLC Shadow of the Erdtree, do not properly credit translators from Latin America.

<p>
Eurogamer understands the revised credits now fully credit translators from Europe. Localisation staff have been listed, as well as a Special Thanks including all individual translators, all under Bandai Namco Europe.

However, translators from Latin America under Bandai Namco America have not been given the same courtesy. Thai translators have also not been listed individually by Bandai Namco Asia, beyond the name of the agency, unlike those for Chinese and Korean.

What's more, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lSeisyhrqk">original credits</a> for the game credits Brazilian Portuguese and Latin American Spanish translators individually, but the new credits remove these names and instead includes a generic Special Thanks message. 

</p>
<p>
Now that the revised credits overwrite the original, these translators are no longer individually credited.

The full, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ4uJrWBMak&amp;t=308s">revised credits have been uploaded to YouTube</a>. Further, translator Ramón Méndez has confirmed the European localisation teams are fully accredited.</p> <div>

This miscrediting of translation staff is in violation of the <a href="https://igda.org/sigs/credits/">International Game Developers Association game crediting policy</a>. This states: "Any person, be they contractor, freelancer, external agency employee, vendor, part time employee, or full time employee with billable contributions toward creation or publication of a game in any discipline must be credited."

</p>
<p>
As for external agencies, it states: "Employers must establish a contractual obligation to identify and credit vendors and contractors employed or contracted by an external agency to work on their project."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Bandai Namco for comment.
</p>
<p>
Just last week a report was published by Game Developer concerning external translators <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/external-translators-hired-for-nintendo-projects-bemoan-lack-of-credit-in-almost-every-big-title">not being properly credited in Nintendo games</a>. This followed a high profile case last year of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-translation-company-commits-to-change-after-leaving-staff-out-of-credits">translation staff being left out of the Baldur's Gate 3 credits</a>.

            <p>A screenshot purportedly taken from Cloud Chamber's upcoming BioShock game - codenamed "Parkside" - has popped up online.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/tUs50kO#ti0OL7P">Whilst the image itself</a> isn't particularly exciting - we can see a weapon, called the "ricochet shotgun" and some kind of weird glowing sphere, er, thing - we do get to see how the UI looked at the time the demo was created (thought to be around 2021), and get our first peek at some of the powers available to players.</p>

<p>BioShock fans of old will be familiar with the plasmids and vigors that complement your armoury, enabling you to shock enemies, set things on fire, or chuck them up in the air, and so on.</p>
<p>In this image, we can see three plasmid-like powers in the bottom-left corner. On the bottom-right seems to be an Electro-Shock like power, and next to it, a magnet, intimating magnetic or telekinetic powers.</p>
<p>On the top, however, is the icon of a stopwatch, which may hint that we'll get the opportunity to slow down or even stop time, perhaps?</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-bioshock-4-screenshot-surfaces-giving-us-look-early-look-at-ui-shotgun-and-more">MP1st</a>, which was first to report the screenshot, the image originates from "a 2K visual effects artists but for the sake of privacy, we are refraining from naming or linking their online profile".</p>
<p>More than a decade on from the release of BioShock Infinite, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-bioshock-developer-ramping-up">the team working on a successor is now "ramping up"</a>.</p>
<p>Work to continue the BioShock series has been ongoing - if off and on - over the past 10 years.</p>

			<p>Rising PlayStation 4 PC emulator shadPS4 is now also able to boot last year's Red Dead Redemption Remastered.</p>
<p><span>The team behind the PS4 emulator has been making great progress recently, and as covered earlier this month, the emulator is <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-4-emulator-shadps4-bloodborne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already able to boot fan-favorite Bloodborne on PC</a>. Last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-emulator-improves-bloodborne-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we reported on additional improvements being made</a> when it comes to emulating the game on PC.&nbsp;</span>With a PC port of FromSoftware's PS4 hit title likely not happening, this is welcome development for many fans of the game. As it turns out, the team behind the promising emulator has now also managed to get Red Dead Redemption Remastered to boot on PC. Not only that, but the emulator also allows to access the game's main menu. We've included a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjVbfQQU-zY1N7RWkavDF-A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WIP video</a> of the emulator booting Red Dead Redemption Remastered below. Quite the news for the PS4 emulation scene indeed.</p>

<p>Red Dead Redemption Remastered was released for the PlayStation 4 (and Switch) last year. The game is a remastered version of the 2010 original. We've included some info from the original press release of the remaster below:</p>
<p><em>Relive, or experience for the first time, the story of former outlaw John Marston in the events immediately following the critically acclaimed 2018 blockbuster Red Dead Redemption 2.&nbsp;Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;also includes&nbsp;Undead Nightmare, the hallowed story expansion that reimagines the world of&nbsp;Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;as Marston fights to survive a relentless zombie horde and searches for a cure in a spooky, supernatural twist on the Western genre.</em><br>
<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>These new conversions of the original games were crafted specifically for the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, and both are showcased at a framerate of 30 FPS, up to 1080p resolution on the Nintendo Switch and the PlayStation 4, up to 4K on the PlayStation 4 Pro, and in full 4K on the PlayStation 5 (via backwards compatibility).</em></p>

            <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> enjoyer-in-public Paul Tassi of Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/07/07/the-first-descendant-is-using-barely-changed-destiny-2-icons/">wrote an article</a> pointing out the similarities between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-first-descendant">The First Descendant</a>’s in-game icons and those used by Bungie’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> looter shooter. Nexon have since reached out to Tassi, saying they’re taking the concerns seriously, and will make adjustments so that the imagery "clearly reflects the unique identity" of their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a>-Destiny hybrid GaaS shooter.</p>

<p>“It’s pretty clear that if these weren’t flat-out taken from Destiny they were copied almost exactly with those small additions or subtractions added,” wrote Tassi in the first article, sharing several comparison images like the one below. Tassi also points out comparisons between guns, enemies, some promotional art, and a skull icon.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/destiny-first-descendant-icons.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Paul Tassi/Forbes.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Whether you think there’s any veracity to these comparisons or not - although let’s be honest, some of them are incredibly suspect - Nexon themselves decided to reach out to Tassi <a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1811595182577426907/photo/1">with a statement</a>. In short it basically says: uh, sorry about that, we’ll get right on it.</p>
<p>"The First Descendant, as a looter shooter game, was developed with a deep affection and respect for other games in the genre," said Nexon. "Destiny 2, being a globally renowned looter shooter game, is also personally admired and respected by the team, and it has served as an inspiration during the development process. We have taken the concerns raised seriously and decided to make adjustments to ensure that the imagery that may appear similar clearly reflects the unique identity of our game."</p>
<p>I don’t really care much about The First Descendant, although if Nexon go back and draw moustaches and glasses on all the offending icons, I will champion it until the day it dies. Despite my personal lack of enthusiasm for getting involved with another forever-shooter right now, I did chat to Nexon about how they’ve designed their endgame to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-descendants-endgame-wont-be-about-meaningless-dps-or-piling-on-specs">not rely on "meaningless DPS" or "piling on specs"</a>, which is admirable.</p>
