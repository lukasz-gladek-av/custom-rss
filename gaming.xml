<p>The Mario-themed park will be getting a celebratory birthday makeover from <strong>18th March</strong>, featuring a giant superstar cake at the entrance and a special 'Star Hunt' activity within. Yoshi will also be joining the meet-and-greet circuit in the park itself, marking the first time that the beloved dino has been available for photo ops with the public.</p>
<p>Of course, that's not all. The <a href="https://www.usj.co.jp/web/ja/jp/areas/super-nintendo-world">Universal Studios Japan website</a> also notes that the park will be stocking exclusive birthday food and merch options throughout the celebrations, because nothing screams 'happy birthday!' quite like consumerism.</p>
<p>The anniversary extras will be sticking around until 11th January 2027, so if you happen to be heading to Japan in the next year, you'll <em>have</em> to make a point to swing by.</p>

<p>Back in 2024, the park opened its first expansion in the shape of the Donkey Kong Country zone. Despite other parks popping up in the US in the five years since the Japan one started it all, it remains the only place that you can meet DK... not that we're at all envious, of course.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>2024's <strong>Batman: Arkham Shadow</strong> was one of the best games to release that year, despite it being a <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-is-an-exclusive-meta-quest-3-vr-game/">VR Meta Quest 3 exclusive and not arriving until December</a>. A sequel was <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-confirmed-meta-camouflaj/">accidentally confirmed by one of its voice actors, <strong>Mark Rolston</strong></a>, who was set to play Commissioner Gordon in the coming sequel. But a new report from <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-canceled-as-camouflaj-sees-significant-layoffs/">UploadVR</a> reveals that <strong>Meta's</strong> recent 10% layoff to its Reality Labs division hit developer <strong>Camouflaj</strong> with "<em>significant</em>" layoffs, cancelling the sequel, and <strong>marking the end of Camouflaj developing VR games entirely</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-shuts-down-deadpool-vr-twisted-pixel-games-asgards-wrath-sanzaru-games/"><strong>Twisted Pixel Games</strong> and <strong>Sanzaru Games</strong> were both shuttered by Meta</a> as part of the recent layoffs, which saw <strong>1,000</strong> people get laid off across the Reality Labs branch of Meta. While Camouflaj was one of the few that didn't get entirely shut down, according to the report, the studio "<em>has seen significant layoffs, and will no longer be developing VR games</em>."</p>



<p>The report also adds that Sanzaru Games was working on the Arkham Shadow sequel alongside Camouflaj, though that work ended once Sanzaru was shuttered, which also contributed to the sequel project getting cancelled. </p>



<p>With the teams behind two of the best VR games to release in recent years either shut down or pushed out of making VR games entirely, it's a clear sign from Meta that it is no longer invested in making VR games. It's also a sign of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/meta-begins-jobs-cuts-after-shifting-focus-from-metaverse-to-phones">Meta stepping away from its Metaverse focus</a> and instead investing in AI.</p>



<p>VR hasn't grown to be the next frontier of gaming in the way that many touted it would for years, as it remains a niche part of tech and the gaming industry, but it's still upsetting to see the teams that were making genuine strides in pushing the medium forward have been pushed out of it. Sanzaru Games' Asgard's Wrath 2 was regarded as one of the best VR games ever made when it arrived in 2023. Arkham Shadow was a new step forward for what combat could look like in VR.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this isn't the end for Camouflaj entirely, and we still see them move on to make their own games, rather than becoming a support studio for the few remaining teams under Meta's Reality Labs division still making VR games.</p>

            <p>
Alas and alack for Lickity Split, knight hero of The Fortress, prisoner of a villainous Sorceror King. ‘Twas I who named him (I wanted a pun on “Lich” and I’m fairly sure we’ve done “Lich My Balls” several times before) and ‘twas I who led him to his death a whole six rooms away from his cell... and ‘twas I who then resurrected him as a wizard and got him killed again, a mere five minutes later. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It’s not my fault, though. Lickity Split appears to have terrible luck, if not an actual Luck stat, and The Fortress is a dungeon crawler with a murderous fixation on dice. As regards the opening stretch of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3459150/The_Fortress/">the Steam demo</a>, at least, each fight sees you rolling dice of three different colours, then spending their pips to attack enemies with health points of the same colour. If the colours don’t match up, you’ll have to end the turn and take damage. 
</p>
<p>
The get-out clause is that any unused dice fill up a Super Mega Ultra AOE Attack gauge when you end the turn. This dishes out punishment without regard for niceties of coloration. That’s not much consolation if you get hacked to death before the gauge fills completely, though. Woe unto Lickity Split! I thought he was doing pretty well until he ran into that ghost dog.
</p>
<p>
There are nine character classes in The Fortress, each of which favours a different dice hue, or combination of hues. There are also three slots for equipment pieces that modify the dice, or confer shorter-lived benefits. A rusty shield will cancel one incoming attack before disintegrating; an enchanted scroll will add a pip to your blue magic die. There are also potential allies, or at least beings who are not initially enemies: “vampire merchants, fallen abbots, and other sinister figures, each hiding secrets and ulterior motives”.
</p>

<p>
Somewhere in the citadel above lurks your jailor. After dying twice to a ghost dog in room 6, I do not want to know how many different shapes and colours of dice it takes to kill the Sorceror King. Perhaps I can persuade him to play checkers instead.
</p><p>
I flailingly compared The Fortress to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/legend-of-grimrock">Legend of Grimrock</a> and Eye Of The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beholder">Beholder</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-hytale-quarantine-zone-a-weird-batman-sim-and-a-fresh-batch-of-rpgs-and-shooters">this week’s Maw</a>, but it seems a lot simpler so far – a steady, linear onslaught of fights with the occasional treasure room, and precious little to distract you from the throwing of the bones. The retro presentation is lovely: heaving, gaping, pixelated enemies and walls of bruised and abraded shadow. I’d say it’s worth a pop at the demo, at least, if you like the screens. The full game launches on Steam tomorrow.

Exactly how this new game handles Chloe (and explains her presence, depending on players' past choices) remains to be seen, however. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-life-is-strange-game-spotted-and-yes-this-one-will-finally-bring-back-chloe">last week's early spilling of the game's likely title and plot</a> via the European ratings board, and a string of disgruntled leaks from developers pointing to a troubled development for the franchise behind the scenes, Square Enix's suggestion that fans should tune in to "separate the real from the rumor" feels like an acknowledgement of the series' current situation — but also, hopefully, that it has something promising for fans to move the franchise forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

No better time than when it’s $30 off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned earlier, January has seen quite a few video game deals catch our eye alongside this one.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Resident Evil Village Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>As Windows Central noted in its January 15 story, the "install" button you can click on doesn't actually install the game. Instead, it downloads a 10MB container that doesn't contain the actual game. You can still sync your saves from Xbox Series X|S, but strangely, the game doesn't launch. When you try to launch it, you'll just receive a "This game has crashed" message on these devices, meaning Xbox Play Anywhere has broken RE: VIII's release for now.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that RE: VIII is available on a plethora of places. This includes the usual spots you play games, like Nintendo Switch consoles, PC, PlayStation platforms, and Xbox systems. It's also playable on Apple devices such as the iPad, Mac, and iPhone, as well as Xbox Game Pass for any paying subscriber. This is just an odd situation that may not affect everyone, but underscores the work Microsoft still needs to do to ensure Xbox Play Anywhere functions as intended when new games arrive in the service.</p><p>Released in May 2021, Resident Evil Village is the sequel to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard/" data-ref-id="5000-455390">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and continues protagonist Ethan Winters' story as he searches for his kidnapped daughter in a mysterious village filled with freakishly mutant creatures. We gave RE: VIII a "superb" 9/10 in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-village-review-shapeshifter/1900-6417672/" data-ref-id="1900-6417672">GameSpot's review</a>, with reviewer Phil Hornshaw calling it "an intelligent reintroduction of the best action elements of Resident Evil." The follow-up, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-requiem/" data-ref-id="5000-634330">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, will launch on February 26 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

			<p><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/life-is-strange-double-exposure-drawn-out-murder-mystery/">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a></strong> developer <strong>Deck Nine Games</strong> will reveal the next <strong>Life is Strange</strong> game next week on <strong>January 20, 2026,</strong> in a live stream that will kick off at <strong>10am PST / 1pm EST / 6pm GMT / 7pm CET.</strong></p>



<p>The news was revealed in a short teaser video posted to the official Life is Strange X (formerly Twitter) account, which seems to tease the return of series protagonists <strong>Max Caulfield </strong>and <strong>Chloe Price</strong>, who walk across the frame in the teaser.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>2024's Double Exposure was the last game in the series, and one that carries its fair share of controversy with it among fans of the series. Not because it was an overall poor game - Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/life-is-strange-double-exposure-drawn-out-murder-mystery/">gave it a 7.7/10 when we reviewed it when it launched</a> - but because of the ways in which it impacts the storyline of the series, and how it makes players retcon the ending of the previous game right at the beginning.</p>



<p>This next game could be a major turning point for the series and a major point for Deck Nine Games, which experienced <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-devs-deck-nine-lay-off-more-staff/">two rounds of layoffs in 2024, the second coming after the release of Double Exposure</a>. </p>

<p>Hopefully, this new title will be a solution to Deck Nine's woes. We'll see how next week's reveal goes over with fans.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has famously endured struggles when it comes to running well on PC since release. Capcom have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patches-will-keep-coming-if-almost-as-slowly-as-the-game-still-runs">tried relentlessly</a> to improve that situation, with varying results. Cue today, and a Reddit scientist coming to the conclusion that overtly aggressive DLC checks might be a key factor in the game's woes. Another modder has subsequently put out a work to combat the issue with the checks, but they reckon fixing this problem isn't necessarily a cure-all.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/mh_wilds_bad_performance_mystery_solved/">original thread</a> looking into these DLC checks was penned by Reddit user de_Tylmarande. Having played around with versions of the game on two Steam accounts - one with all of the Wilds' DLC bought and one running the DLC-less base version - they observed that the former seemed to benefit from better FPS numbers. Reaching the hypothesis that the discrepancies in frame rate they report experiencing in the two versions might be down to the DLC-less version of the game being throttled by regular behind-the-scenes checks as to which DLC was active, they did some testing.</p>
<p>"I quickly made a small 'mod' that made the game think I have all DLC present...And yes - performance went through the roof. Yes, without any CPU boost, in Balance mode. On any settings. The game literally flies," they wrote, emphasising that the mod was simply one that convinced the game they had all of the DLC installed, rather than actually giving them it. So, they said they've reached out to Capcom's support with their findings, suggesting "it's just a bug in the code they need to fix" rather than any maliciou bit of design.</p>
<p>Cool. Naturally, this being modders, one of their brethren has already looked into the situation and put out a work which <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/3798">limits Wilds' DLC checks</a> on Nexus Mods (as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dominictarason.com/post/3mchsumduun24">spotted</a> by friend of the Treehouse <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/authors/dominic-tarason">Dominic Tarason</a>). According to this second modder, Vaeux, the DLC checks do seem to have some impact on performance, but only in certain areas of the game:</p>
<blockquote><p>As discovered by de_Tylmarande, who documented it in a Reddit thread, depending on which DLCs you own, Monster Hunter Wilds may perform dozens of checks for DLC ownership every frame. This can easily add up to thousands of (relatively) computationally-expensive checks every second, significantly reducing your framerate if it's bottlenecked by your CPU.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like this only happens when you're close enough to a Support Desk Felyne (the ones that handle bounties and have a DLC menu) to see an exclamation point on its map/world icon, which pops up if you purchase DLC, so you know to go and redeem your new DLC. So, it only matters while you're standing in/near a Base Camp. Not quite as game-changing as some were hoping, but better than nothing.</p></blockquote>
<p>We'll see whether Capcom, having seen all of this experimentation, end up being able to nail down any extra fixes/improvements to Wilds beyond what they've already done or <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/2011732622435557475">have planned</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Everything To Know Before Jumping Into Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ 3.0 Update]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-tips-guide-2000660180</link>
            <guid>1407190</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span>‘ 3.0 update is live, and lapsed players are rushing back to their near-abandoned islands. The update is technically two parts—the free part, which everyone will get, and the paid part, which is only for Nintendo Switch 2 players. Most of the content is tied to the free update, like Kapp’n’s seaside hotel which has been constructed on island piers. For existing owners, the Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade is $4.99; Nintendo says it’s got an “enhanced resolution,” as well as mouse control support and larger multiplayer sessions.</span></p> <p><span>Though Kapp’n’s hotel is the big, main content piece of the big 3.0 patch, there’s a lot of little details to love in both the free and paid updates.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000658997" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658997"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658997">Image: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <h2><span>You can decorate two rooms per day at Kapp’n’s hotel</span></h2> <p><span>Isabelle will announce that the hotel is open, so head right down to the pier to check it out. Kapp’n and Tom Nook will be inside to give you the rundown on what’s going on. Basically, the hotel is already entirely built, but they’re looking for someone to help Kapp’n’s wife, Leilani, decorate the rooms. You’ll be prompted to decorate a room, and Leilani will walk you through it. She wants it to be themed, but you don’t </span><i><span>have</span></i><span> to follow that. You’ll get 200 tickets for doing so! You’ll continue to get prompted for a couple days to decorate rooms and help out with unlocking other features around the hotel.</span></p>

 <p><span>But, at max, you’re only able to decorate two rooms per day. Once you decorate a room, tourists will start showing up. You can keep helping with the hotel, though, by taking on tasks at a DIY requests stand on the pier, which will be unlocked as you proceed.</span></p>

 <h2><span>Tourists will roam your island</span></h2> <p><span>The animals that show up to rent the rooms on your island can be found wandering around, exploring the sights. They’ll interact with your residents, but can’t be asked to move onto your island, like with the campsite.</span></p> <h2><span>You can decorate your pier</span></h2> <p><span>All of the wooden parts of the hotel pier can be decorated as you please. It’s not a ton of room, but it’s enough to bring in some extra flair. It works exactly the same way as decorating anywhere else, but you’ve got to work around some of the permanent fixtures.</span></p>

 <p><span>The hotel’s facade can’t be customized, but it is decorated seasonally, it seems—there’s snow on the roof in winter, and an adorable little snowman outside.</span></p> <h2><span>Save up your bells for Resetti’s pricey service</span></h2> <p><span>Resetti will be wandering around your island when you update to 3.0. He’s able to quickly reset portions of your island, but it’ll cost you 60,000 bells per day. The good news is that it’s </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> 60,000 bells per portion of land—it’s a daily rate, so you can keep calling Resetti back for an entire 24 hours at no extra cost.</span></p>

 <p><span>Of course, the first use of the service is free, so you’ll have time to save up if you want to give it a try but can’t afford his hefty fee. Here’s how it works: You first go tell Isabelle you want to use the service, and Resetti will be wandering your island. He’ll give you three options: to reset either the whole island, your beaches, or specific areas. If you choose the third option, you can go and choose the area and summon him.</span></p>

 <h2><span>New movement actions make decorating and terraforming more precise</span></h2> <p><span>This is a super small detail, but makes a huge difference. There are new movement options in </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span>. It’s easy: You just need to tap and hold the L button to move precisely in different directions. Basically, it’s movement on a grid—up, down, left, and right. When you press the L button and don’t hold it down, you can do a little, cute jump.</span></p>

 <p><span>This is particularly exciting for me, because it drives me crazy to be trying to dig up something and accidentally dig the wrong area. By being able to make precise movements, I can more easily position myself in the correct spot. It’ll help with placing items in the world, too, I think.</span></p> <h2><span>Craft without having resources in your pockets</span></h2> <p><span>Empty the sticks and rocks out of your pockets, because crafting now pulls from your home inventory! If you </span><i><span>do</span></i><span> have materials in your pockets, crafting will use those first, then move to home storage. You can do this from any crafting bench on your island, but it won’t work if you’re crafting on someone else’s island.</span></p> <h2><span>Bulk crafting limited to 10 items</span></h2> <p><span>Crafting that pulls from home storage is particularly helpful now that bulk crafting is a thing. However, bulk crafting is limited to making 10 of a certain item at once—no more than that. Ten is still a lot, and will certainly make life easier for people who are furiously crafting.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/what-even-is-a-video-game-backlog-in-2026-2000659435</link>
            <guid>1407187</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/that-s-a-wrap-on-backlog-month-1846849615">We’ve written a lot about backlogs on this site.</a> Those long lists of games we want to play or finally get around to finishing. I have a backlog. It’s very big. It’s scary to think about. And I also recently realized, after returning to <em>Diablo 4</em>, that in 2026, a backlog is becoming an outdated concept as forever games take over the industry and live-service titles get killed, making it harder and harder to actually finish a game, cross it off your list, and walk away.</p> <p>For decades, competitive multiplayer games have existed, and the concept of a game that can’t be “finished” has been around for about as long as games themselves. But when I talk about the games that undermine the very concept of a backlog, I’m not talking about online-only PVP titles like<em> Arc Raiders</em> or <em>Team Fortress 2</em>. I’m instead talking about the growing list of live-service games, many of which can be played solo, that have campaigns with “endings” but also keep growing, that are all fighting for your attention and receiving an endless wave of updates and expansions.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-open-beta-review-rpg-rogue-build-barbarian-1850244422">I finished <em>Diablo 4</em> in 2023</a> and really enjoyed it. With that completion, it was crossed off my backlog. But since then, it has received numerous seasonal updates, adding new content and narrative elements. It has also received an expansion and <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4s-second-expansion-adds-new-classes-and-big-changes-2000652722">is getting another one later this year</a>. I booted the game up last week to check it out again and realized that, well, shit,<em> Diablo 4</em> is <em>back</em> on my backlog. I completed <em>The </em><em>Division</em> <em>2</em>‘s main campaign once upon a time, but since then, it’s expanded into a bigger game with more missions to finish and more story to experience. That one is probably never leaving my backlog, despite me having over 300 hours in it at this point.</p>

 <p>Then there are those live-service games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964">like BioWare’s <em>Anthem</em></a>, which I had on my backlog for years, always telling myself I’d get to them and finish up the main story one day. Well, in&nbsp;<em>Anthem</em>‘s case, I waited too long, and now the game is dead, the servers permanently shut down. And while I could just scrub it from my mental backlog of games, I know it will linger around like a ghost. A memory of what I could have done. There are a lot of live-service ghosts hanging out in my mental backlog these days. It’s getting crowded.</p>

 <p>A part of me wonders if the entire concept of backlogs is pointless now. Even single-player games that aren’t technically live-service titles, like Ubisoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-impressions-review-ubisoft-1851077773"><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em></a>, are often updated with <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-pandora-cheap-third-person-new-game-1851786644">new features and content</a>. It might just be time to try to build a new backlog in my head and reserve it only for offline single-player experiences that I’m confident won’t be expanded upon or killed in the future.</p>

 <p>At the very least, if I do rebuild my backlog, I’ll have a more manageable one. I mean, it will still be <em>extremely</em> long and nearly impossible to complete. But at least this new list–which will be devoid of live-service titles and “forever games” that, ironically, can go away forever with little warning–won’t be literally impossible to finish. And that’s nice. I guess.</p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021.

<p>A new developer diary video from Marathon provides players with a deep dive into the game’s Runner Shells. </p>



<p>With Bungie’s next first-person extraction shooter, Marathon, releasing in March 2026, the developers have been slowly sharing more details about the game. Last month, players were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-devs-reveal-pricing-battle-pass-details-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">informed</a> about pricing details, battle passes, new features, weapons, improvements, and more. Now, the developers are going straight into Runner Shells, the biosynthetic bodies you will be playing as. </p>







<h2 id="h-each-marathon-runner-shell-has-its-own-archetype">Each Marathon Runner Shell Has Its Own Archetype</h2>



<p>In the universe of Marathon, players are transferred into biosynthetic shells known as Runner Shells to navigate the Tau Ceti system. Each Runner Shell has its own archetype, which may include roles such as intel gathering, combat disruption, or combat healing. Additionally, these shells are designed with distinctive silhouettes, allowing players to identify them from a distance and strategize accordingly.</p>



<p>Players can experiment with different playstyles using the game’s cores, implants, weapons, and mods. Additionally, players can look forward to visual customizations that will be revealed at a later date.</p>



<h2 id="h-runner-shell-cores-and-impants">Runner Shell Cores and Impants</h2>



<p>Players can use Cores and Implants to customize their Runner Shell’s playstyles in Marathon. Cores are designed for one Runner Shell, mostly, where they can “buff or modify” the shell’s ability. Implants, on the other hand, can be used by any Runner Shell, and they grant additional stats and a random perk. Higher-tier implants also feature a bonus fixed perk. </p>



<p>For example, if players are going for a mobility build, with cores they can turn the Vandal’s double jump into a triple jump, and with implants they can increase its base movement speed, jump height, and heat capacity. Cores, implants, weapons, and mods can be combined with Runner Shells in Marathon to create unique play styles that best suit the player. Players can check out the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFzR8bN13FA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dev diary</a> to learn more about these systems. </p>

<h2 id="h-marathon-runner-shells-archetypes-and-abilities">Marathon Runner Shells Archetypes and Abilities </h2>



<p>Bungie has provided details on the base archetype and abilities of Runner Shells in Marathon. You can check them out below: </p>



<p><strong>Destroyer</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Combat specialist</li>



<li>Armed with a personal defense barricade, missile systems, and movement thrusters, Destroyer shells are designed to bring the fight to enemy threats.</li>
</ul>



<p>Assassin</p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Shadow agent</li>



<li>Synthetic smoke deployment and camouflage technology allow Assassin shells to plan unseen strikes or take cover during hostile engagements.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Recon</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Intel specialist</li>



<li>Recon shells excel at identifying threats and tracking movements using echo pulses, tracker drones, and holographic footstep trails.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Vandal</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Combat anarchist</li>



<li>Vandal shells traverse ground at incredible speeds, using their advanced movement and knockback cannon to disrupt combat.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Thief</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Covert acquisitions</li>



<li>With enhanced visors and piloted butterfly drone, Thief shells can locate and acquire loot, then use their grapple to push an advantage or make an escape.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Triage</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Field medic</li>



<li>Triage shells help keep themselves and allies alive using deployable healing drones, onboard reboot abilities, and combat buffs.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Rook</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Scavenger</li>



<li>The Rook frame is designed for scavenger mode, a unique way to play Marathon. As Rook, you’ll drop into a match that’s already in progress as a solo player. You won’t be able to bring a loadout, but you also aren’t risking anything, which makes Rook an excellent option for scavengers.</li>
</ul>



<p>Details about the Runner Shells were found through Bungie’s new <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/dev-insights-runner-shells-new-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It's a big week for Amazon Prime's slate of video game adaptations.

And now there's news on the Tomb Raider front – we got our first look at Sophie Turner's portrayal of Lara Croft. See it for yourself below.</p>

      <p>Sophie Turner as Lara Croft. The image was originally uploaded to Amazon Prime Video's social media with the caption "Get your artifacts out. Lara's on her way… #TombRaider #WardrobeTest"</p>
  
</article>

<p>It's a relatively classic take on the character, as opposed to the recent reboots (known as the survivor trilogy). Turner wears shorts, pistol holsters on each hip, a teal tank top, and even Lara Croft's sunglasses (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9yxzDDvAm8&amp;pp=ygUdZ2FtZSBpbmZvcm1lciB0b21iIHJhaWRlciBuZ3Q%3D">which appear on the cover of Tomb Raider III</a>), complete with red, circular lenses. As is often the case with live-action adaptations, Turner's initial casting as the character was met with skepticism from some, but now that she's in the wardrobe, you can't deny she looks the part. We'll just have to wait and see if her performance holds up as well.</p><p>The Tomb Raider series is created by Phoebe Waller-Bridge (known for <em>Fleabag </em>and <em>Solo</em>), who serves as both showrunner and writer. The show's cast also includes Martin Bobb-Semple, Sigourney Weaver, and Jason Issacs (<a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2023/2023/06/08/baldurs-gate-3-gets-lucius-malfoy-actor-as-a-bad-guy" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f702c8e0-a49a-4402-b9f0-e4d417704f26" data-entity-substitution="canonical">who <em>Game Informer</em> readers might know as Gortash in Baldur's Gate 3</a>). The show is currently in production.</p><p>This shift back towards the classic Lara Croft look is a move the entire brand is making in 2026, which is the 30th anniversary of the first game's launch. This year, we can expect to see <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-is-a-remake-of-the-first-game-in-the" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="22919195-3e7d-45ff-9ee7-9d0fc3924b8d" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, a reboot of the original game</a>, while 2027 will bring <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/tomb-raider-catalyst-takes-lara-croft-to-northern-india-in-2027" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="00d416d9-e569-40af-805a-22822aae745c" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Tomb Raider: Catalyst, a wholly new adventure</a>.
