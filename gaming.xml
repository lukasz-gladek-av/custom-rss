            <p>Future updates for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> will seemingly include "Hagga-Basin-like maps".</p>
<p>Revealed by community manager Iggy in the Dune Awakening Discord server, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1006265467754790943/1379064253537063103/1384818624283545693">he wrote</a>: "I think Joel kinda leaked in the past that we plan to add more Hagga-Basin-like maps in the future as part of new content".</p>
<p>Iggy refers to pre-launch developer vlogs in which Dune: Awakening spoke about the roadmap for future updates. Creative director Joel Bylos stated updates for the game would be free, with only optional cosmetics, battle passes, and especially large expansions being sold.</p>

<p>Dune Awakening has proven exceptionally popular since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-and-stellar-blade-both-set-new-concurrent-user-records-on-steam-this-weekend">its launch on Steam, breaking 150,000 concurrent players</a> and popping off among the higher reaches of the Top Sellers list alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a>. A recent patch for the game provided several quality of life fixes, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-patch-ends-the-reign-of-vehicular-terror-as-ramming-into-other-players-no-longer-deals-damage">ended the practice of crushing players with orniphopters in PvP</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-review">Eurogamer's recent review of Dune Awakening</a>, which scored it four stars, offered praise to the progression through Hagga Basin. It features the following: "[...] the process of gathering material around the starter area of Hagga Basin, refining your haul at your handcrafted base, and manufacturing new gear is made endlessly compelling with an unwavering faithfulness to the source material."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rematch-review.1223022/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/rematch-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>As someone who has spent an inordinate amount of time playing football games, including FIFA, EA FC, PES, Championship Manager, Football Manager, and even the cult classic Red Card Football, I generally know what to expect from them. Enter Rematch, the new multiplayer football title from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/06/sifu-review-ps5-pc-ps4/">Sifu</a> developer Sloclap, which looks to introduce a different way to play the beautiful game. This is a football game that does away with the pesky rules and demands patience and skill from the player.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rematch | Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jQ_GJQQmMMo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Rematch you will only control your own player across all match modes. You can customise them by unlocking different cosmetic items including tops, shorts, and hats, but there are no skill points or attributes to assign. In other words, your player is only as good as you are at the game. That means if you can master the controls of the game, then your player will shine like some of the best players in the world. If you struggle with the controls of Rematch then you will be more like Ali Dia than Lionel Messi. Before you dive in, you should know the default controls do not have a lock on option for the ball. This can be changed in the settings, where there is an alternative control set up that does have a ball lock on mode, which is very helpful when starting out.</p>


<p>In terms of match modes there is 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 which are all playable in quick match, and each of these lets you familiarise yourself with different aspects of Rematch, including positioning and ball control. There are also tutorials to complete that will give you more depth and insight for the game’s various systems. After you reach rank 5 you will unlock the ranked match mode, which is purely 5v5. Once you have a few matches within ranked mode under your belt, you will be given your rank, which will fluctuate depending on your future performances. I was initially placed in Silver One, just missing out on Gold Three.</p>


<p>There are two major elements that count towards whether you are going to have a good time with Rematch. The first is the gameplay itself and the second are your teammates. The controls can be fiddly and the action a little bit too chaotic at times. Let’s take attacking as an example. When you are going for goal you need to manually aim towards the net, but if you are facing the goal you’re not likely to see the ball coming in from a cross. If you are looking at a player who may cross it and the ball does reach you, you then need to turn and line up the shot towards the goal and take it. That gives the defence time to close in and get into position to stop your scoring. There is nothing like auto assist or auto aim in Rematch as, like I said, every move is dependent on your own skill. If you do not have the ball in view there is an on screen indicator that tells you where it is and you can kind of work with that, but it is always better to be watching the ball than not.</p>
<p>Passing also requires precision as you need to be aiming right where you want the ball to go, whether it be directly to a player or into space. A little like Rocket League, the ball cannot go out of play in Rematch so you can also use the stadium walls to bounce the ball off to make passes into tight spaces.</p>

<p>As much as every school kid wants to be playing up front, banging in goals and getting all the glory, defending and keeping are just as important – you don’t want the other side scoring, after all! Rematch rotates players through different roles after each goal is scored, assigning someone to play in goal each time. You can shirk your duties and run off to be an outfield player, but I actually liked being the keeper as you can pull off some great saves and get involved in attacks by creating assists. If you’re lucky you may even score from kicking the ball out, like I somehow managed to do one time. Locking onto the ball as the keeper is a necessity as you can then position yourself better to either run and get the ball off an attack player or dive in the right direction to stop the ball finding the back of the net. Interestingly, crossing the goal line while saving the ball means that the shot won’t count as a goal. How do you feel about that, Mr. VAR?</p>
<p>If you’re playing in a defensive role you have the options to do a light tackle, a sliding tackle if you’re sprinting, or trying to intercept the ball with your positioning or heading it away. The tackling is not as smooth as it could be with tackles that look like they should make contact missing the ball or opposing player completely. All players have the ability to sprint, but it is limited by everyone having the same amount of stamina, so you can’t just whizz around the pitch hoping to run from end to the other and getting a shot off.</p>
<p>Overall the gameplay is okay. It’s definitely an interesting take on playing a football game, but it needs some improvement, especially when it comes to attacking.</p>

<p>Hell can be the other people you play with, and this is where Rematch’s success or failure will truly lie. Football is a team game but in the hours I have played it there have been a number of examples of selfish players that will ball hog in an attempt to go for glory, but almost always messing up and costing the team. When you find a group of players that acts like a team, you see the elements of Rematch which really work as each individual understands there task to defend or attack, calling for passes at the right moments, and linking up well together. It is these teams and players that usually go on to win matches.</p>
<p>Rematch is not without other issues either. For example, after a match if you want to view your performance you can switch to a tab to do so but sometimes it automatically toggles to your progression screen instead. Also post match, the game takes you back to the main screen instead of just matchmaking and putting you into a new match. There should be the option to just keep matchmaking unless you choose to opt out of it. I did have a couple of crashes on PC, but this seems to have been ironed out in a new patch. The graphics are serviceable, but there’s some fun stadium themes that include tropical jungles and outer space, and I quite liked the music too.</p>
<p>Sloclap has addressed some of these issues and areas of improvement<a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/rematch-launch-priorities-next-steps"> in a blog post for today’s launch</a>. Initially stability will be the immediate priority, but they also plan to add cross-play down the line, and are looking at feedback on slide tackling, keeping, wall collisions and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I absolutely adored the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/fantasy_life">Fantasy Life</a> on the 3DS, and thankfully, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> has proven to be a worthy successor, sinking its claws into me all over again.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Kate Gray reviewed the Switch 1 version</a> and said, “It's beautiful, it's robust, it's got multiplayer, it's got three fully-fleshed-out areas to explore, it's got crafting and foraging and cooking and fishing and minigames and beautiful music and sidequests and more. And it's all really, really good.”</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182726 @ 1750338004 -->
<p>Well said, Kate, and I wholeheartedly agree. It's one of those wonderfully addictive games where there's so much to do, so much to see, and all the numbers go up and up making you feel really good about your progress. You could argue that it does little to meaningfully evolve the gameplay from the 3DS original, but when it's this good, I'm really not that fussed.</p>
<p>So it’s great news, then, that the Switch 2 version makes the overall experience even more enjoyable thanks to a small batch of noteworthy improvements to the presentation. We’re mainly talking about resolution and frame rate here, so don’t expect any fancy mouse controls or HD Rumble 2 or tie-ins to a mobile app.</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i admittedly looked pretty nice and performed reasonably well on Switch 1 at around 30fps. That said, the significant bump up to 60fps on Switch 2 is very welcome and I can’t imagine going back now. It doesn’t <em>always</em> hit its target, particularly in the larger open-world environments, but I didn't get anything more serious than a few minor dips here and there.</p>
<p>Similarly, the visuals are much crisper than before, especially noticeable when playing in handheld mode. The blur effect is still in place around the edges of the screen, but it feels slightly toned down to allow the game’s world to shine brighter than ever. You can turn this off completely, if you wish, but I find the focus blur adds to the charm; kinda like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Link’s Awakening</a> and, to a lesser extent, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>.</p>
<p>A small patch applied shortly after release also boosts shadow quality and the object render distance; a minor improvement, but one that further widens the gap between the versions. Load times were acceptable on Switch 1, averaging between 5 and 10 seconds, but this has been cut down significantly to 3 or 4 seconds for most scenarios.</p>
<p>Given how cheap the upgrade is for Switch 1 owners — you’re looking at £2.04 / $2.59 / €2.27 or your regional equivalent — the performance improvements for Fantasy Life i on Switch 2 are more than worth the price of admission. Other publishers have the gall to charge full price again (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">looking at you, Sega</a>), but this is an acceptable middle ground. If you’re keen on trying out Level-5’s long-awaited sequel, this is absolutely the best way to play on Nintendo systems.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>NVIDIA announced that the Borderlands franchise (with the exception of the spin-off Tiny Tina's Wonderlands) is now available to stream on its GeForce NOW cloud gaming platform. As you might recall, publisher 2K was among those companies that <a href="https://wccftech.com/2k-games-is-the-latest-publisher-to-remove-its-lineup-from-geforce-now-while-epic-games-vows-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pulled out of GeForce NOW</a> when the service first launched out of beta in early 2020.</p>
<p>Something must have changed recently, though. The Mafia franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-gets-the-whole-mafia-franchise-including-old-country-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined</a> GeForce NOW last month, and now it's time for Gearbox's first-person looter shooter games. Moreover, the upcoming Borderlands 4 will be available to stream on day one. Its system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-confirms-fairly-tame-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren't that high</a>, but it's still welcome news.</p>
<p>Sid Meier's Civilization franchise is already available on GFN, but BioShock, X-COM, and the sports games (NBA, WWE, Top Spin, PGA Tour) aren't. Will they be the next 2K franchises to join GeForce NOW? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, here's the full list of GFN additions for this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>REMATCH (New release on Steam, Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, June 16)</li>
<li>Broken Arrow (New release on Steam, June 19)</li>

<li>Date Everything! (New release on Steam, June 17)</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress-dont-forget-to-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a> (New release on Steam, Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, June 17)</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</a> (New release on Steam, Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, June 17)</li>
<li>Architect Life: A House Design Simulator (New release on Steam, June 19)</li>

<li>Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel (Steam, Epic Games Store)</li>
<li>METAL EDEN Demo (Steam)</li>
<li>Torque Drift 2 (Epic Games Store)</li>
</ul>
<p>As a reminder, there are several GeForce NOW promotions in full swing for the Summer Sale, such as 40% discounts on a six-month Performance membership or a <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-gets-40-discount-on-performance-day-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Performance day pass</a> to try out the cloud gaming service before committing to a more extended subscription.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-adel-upgraded-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreigns-first-superpowered-boss-is-here-in-new-update.1223013/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-adel-upgraded-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has released a new&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>update, and it's got the first of the promised upgraded Nightlord bosses for you to take on.</p>

<p>These bosses were first teased as part of a preview of what's next for the multiplayer-focused spinoff <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-confirmed-sales" rel="nofollow">earlier this month</a>, along with duos, which aren't being included as part of this update, unfortunately. They're due to land later this year.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-the-everdark-sovereigns-have-emerged" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Bandai Namco website, the first upgraded boss you'll be facing is Adel, Baron of the Night, otherwise known as Gaping Jaw on the game's menu screen. The publisher is promising "new moves and increased power", constituting "an even greater threat" to you and your squad.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-upgraded-nightlords-adel.jpg?itok=tlwKx71f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-upgraded-nightlords-adel.jpg?itok=OV-XRv95 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s first upgraded boss is waiting for you.</figcaption></figure><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware haven't revealed exactly how Adel will be upgraded for your battle against him, so you'll have to head in and take him on if you want to see exactly how he's going to wreck your squad anew.</p>

<p>Beating the new version of Adel - and, indeed, any other upgraded Nightlords - will net you a new resource named Sovereign Sigils, which you can exchange for unique Relics and other rewards. The first time you beat an upgraded Nightlord will net you extra Sigils as well.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with <i>Elden Ring Nightreign</i>, it's a multiplayer-focused spinoff of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">massively successful</a> open-world action RPG&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, and it also serves as the first ever spinoff of a game in the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>series or its ancillaries.</p>

<p>The game sees players descending on a randomly-generated map to scavenge for resources and defeat minibosses, level up, and prepare for battle against a Nightlord, a unique boss with new attack patterns and weaknesses, at the end of a three-day period.</p>




<p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>has proven hugely successful, but&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is no slouch in the sales department either; it managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">top two million sales on its first day</a>, and it had reached 3.5 million at last count.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-nightreign/9PJ22QNVCZ3G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review-fort-night" rel="nofollow">read my review of it here</a> if you want to know how I felt about it.</p>

            <p>The owners of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">EVE Online</a> developers CCP Games are looking to sell it off, according to a report from Korean finance website MTN. Apparently, parent company Pearl Abyss are sounding out interest from a bunch of games publishers, though no names have been named for the moment.</p>
<p>Pearl Abyss - a South Korean outfit otherwise known for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-desert-online">Black Desert Online</a> and the forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-online-devs-ccp-being-bought-by-black-desert-online-company">scooped up all of CCP's shares in 2019</a> for about 250 billion won, according to the exchange rate of the time. That translates to about $181,139,200 or £134,752,675 in today's money, which is, you know, a fair dollop. You would be pretty chuffed if you found that tucked behind your sofa cushions.</p>
<p>Naturally, Pearl Abyss have been keen to make their money back. According to <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025061910371430049">MTN's sources</a>, CCP and their affiliates have been incurring sizeable losses instead. They released a mobile game, EVE Echoes, via NetEase shortly after the acquisition, but this has apparently fallen short of expectations, and CCP are now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/project-awakening-is-born-from-eve-onlines-fragility-so-its-turning-to-the-blockchain">focusing rather heavily</a> on "web3" games fuelled by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-frontier-is-a-survival-game-spin-off-of-eve-online-and-yup-its-full-of-blockchain-bullshit">blockchain bullshit</a>. They are also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-vanguard-is-a-pvpve-shooter-set-in-the-eve-online-universe">still trying to make an EVE Online FPS</a>, despite screwing this up three times in a row.</p>
<p>Amidst all this, the storied and genuinely majestic EVE Online continues to truck along with a <a href="https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility">fiercely dedicated community</a>, who are all playing a vicious meta-game of their own devising I like to call "Backstabbery Betwixt the Space Balkans".</p>
<p>One of the MMO's biggest player alliances, the Imperium, are in the middle of a gigantic operation called The War of the Ruses. During the recent Battle of Lantorn, 3,808 players teamed up to lay 306 dreadnoughts to waste. These are the kinds of losses you enjoy reading about. The ones that emerge from quarterly earnings calls, less so.</p>
<p>While I can only scratch my head at some of CCP's recent doings, I have an enduring fondness for EVE, and am hopeful that its makers will find a way to prosper - whether in the hands of Pearl Abyss or elsewhere. I've reached out to PR representatives for comment on the MTN story. More to follow.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ara-history-untold">Ara: History Untold</a> is a game I briefly gave a go last year, back when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civ 7</a> was still a game we were all yet to play and have a vast slew of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">different opinions</a> about. I thought the little I played was alright, but didn't stick with it that long, slipping back into the pair of comfy slippers that were Civ 6.</p>
<p>Now, though, Ara's just gotten a big update, and it looks like it should solve some of the issues that folks flagged with the base game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Dubbed the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2021880/view/507330049932791470?l=english">Living Strategy update</a>, this revamp's the first step in a roadmap for the game that was laid out when Stardock Entertainment took the lead on Ara's continued post-launch additions from original developers Oxide Games. It looks like it'll make Ara a bit less frustrating to play.</p>
<p>For example, the revamp takes its name from the default view being switched to a new "Living Strategy" middle ground that aims to balance the up-close perspective on the stuff you're building with the wider strategic overview you'll want when making bigger moves, meaning you should be able to do everything from one perspective.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the patch addresses two of the biggest issues that Sin Vega flagged in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ara-history-untold-review">our review of Ara</a> - the sheer amount of micromanagement required to manually equip buildings and citizens with the stuff from your inventory they need to accomplish certain tasks, and your AI opponents being too easy to outfox.</p>
<p>Now, you've got the option to automate resource selection or control it through policies, meaning you should get less bogged down in just making sure your cities don't grind to a halt. Stardock say AI leaders will "make more nuanced decisions, better optimize their resources and challenge players with deeper strategic considerations", in an effort to ensure you actually face a challenge down the stretch in games.</p>
<p>Skirmishes between you and the likes of bot Otto von Bismarck will feature a new "battle viewer panel" designed to explain fight outcomes and strats more clearly as part of a wider combat overhaul, and map's been upgraded to try and provide more variety in starter setups. Along with those additions and redesigns, Stardock's had a go at making the game run better graphically, gameplay flow more smoothly, and squashed some bugs.</p>
<p>So, maybe worth checking out if you're not happy with where Civ 7's currently at in its own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7s-next-update-will-make-food-actually-worth-investing-in-and-let-you-play-forever-if-youve-got-that-long">ongoing update metamorphosis</a>, and crave the chance to play dictator/benevolent overlord/person who tells virtual people what to do.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

More than 67 million Americans flocked to see it in theaters, only to leave terrified of ever setting foot on a beach again. John Williams’s ominous score, built on low-pitched instruments like basses, cellos, and tubas, combined with Spielberg’s use of POV shots and clever restraint in revealing the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-best-video-games-starring-sharks-1843611686&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-video-games-starring-sharks-1843611686">shark</a></span>, helped cement <em>Jaws</em> as one of the scariest movies of all time.</p><p>From that point on, every shark movie would inevitably be measured against <em>Jaws</em>. And though some have come close to being just as horrifying, many fall short. With so few able to live up to the mastery of Steven Spielberg’s craftsmanship, the genre began to swing in the entirely opposite direction: bottom-of-the-barrel absurdity. These movies put sharks in the most ridiculous scenarios imaginable, and the titles speak for themselves: <em>Space Sharks</em>, <em>Ouija Shark</em>, <em>Sharkenstein</em>, and <em>6-Headed Shark Attack</em> are just a few examples. Only the ones that are “so-bad-it’s-good” make it onto this list.</p><p><em>Jaws</em> set in motion the Hollywood myth that sharks are vengeful and evil killers, when in reality, they’re just curious creatures and human attacks are rare. Still, those toothy giants are the last thing you would want to encounter in open water. If you’re eager to dive into the wild world of shark movies in between episodes of <em>Shark Week</em> on TLC this summer, take a look at the list below. These are the best shark movies that aren’t Steven Spielberg’s iconic blockbuster, ranging from serious horror to those that fully embrace the hokey chaos of Sharksploitation.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6b52aec8b88c8aa065caa2ede3784b2d" data-recommend-id="image://6b52aec8b88c8aa065caa2ede3784b2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="5760" data-height="3840" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woman inspecting a shark" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Woman inspecting a shark" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sofie Gheysens/Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6b52aec8b88c8aa065caa2ede3784b2d" data-recommend-id="image://6b52aec8b88c8aa065caa2ede3784b2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="5760" data-height="3840" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woman inspecting a shark" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Under Paris</em> carries an ecological message and emotional gravitas that elevates the convoluted plot and silly concept into something genuinely exciting to watch. A grieving scientist named Sophia (Bérénice Bejo) must rescue Paris from a giant shark lurking in the Seine. Conveniently, Lilith is the very same shark that killed her husband, making their conflict far more personal and emotionally charged than it would be with a random, evil shark. While Sophia tries to hunt Lilith down, there’s a triathlon taking place that the mayor refuses to postpone (sound familiar?). This results in the grisly deaths of countless athletes. The militaristic efforts to destroy Lilith are over-the-top, and <em>Under Paris</em> as a whole requires a lot of mental gymnastics to appreciate. But it’s got a great payoff that reminds us of the unstoppable force of nature. The upsetting fact that Lilith is mutated by a polluted, waste-filled ocean makes you stop and think just as much as the rest of the movie makes you clutch your seat.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="179127d8fb46f7dd02daed04899274dc" data-recommend-id="image://179127d8fb46f7dd02daed04899274dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shark attacking a man" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shark attacking a man" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Syfy</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="179127d8fb46f7dd02daed04899274dc" data-recommend-id="image://179127d8fb46f7dd02daed04899274dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shark attacking a man" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> The low-budget production company The Asylum isn’t exactly known for high art. It mostly churns out cheap copycats of previously released blockbusters like <em>Top Gunner</em>, <em>Transmorphers</em>, <em>The Terminators</em>, and <em>Battle Star Wars</em>. The films are a waste of time and money, and it’s hard to say why they even exist, but one of their original movies became an overnight sensation after airing on Syfy in 2013. In <em>Sharknado</em>, Tara Reid is tasked with saving Los Angeles from a tornado that, somehow, is filled with sharks. Part of the film’s charm lies in how fully it embraces being a winking send-up of the Sharksploitation genre. With sharks out of their natural ocean habitat and raining down from the sky, there’s plenty of room for colorful and outlandish deaths, and <em>Sharknado</em> more than delivers. It may be one of the most shallow shark movies out there, but it’s undeniably worth watching, if not only for its cultural impact. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6b2466205b8a0aa59a32e7b421889564" data-recommend-id="image://6b2466205b8a0aa59a32e7b421889564" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Man standing in front of a shark" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Man standing in front of a shark" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

Their open jaws were much taller than a full-grown man and their body longer than an entire school bus. When I was a little girl, I had a theory that they still existed near the bottom of the ocean. This is exactly the premise of <em>The Meg</em>, which should give you a clue into the maturity and believability of this movie. You just have to ride the wave of this intentionally campy blockbuster—much like the ass-kicking Jason Statham, who hangs onto the fin of the massive prehistoric creature, flies through the air, and somehow still survives. <em>The Meg</em> fully embraces its ludicrousness, which is fitting because a creature as enormous as a megalodon ever existing is bonkers enough on its own. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9d01caab1cccb22faee716ccae9efe4d" data-recommend-id="image://9d01caab1cccb22faee716ccae9efe4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A shark crashing in" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A shark crashing in" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9d01caab1cccb22faee716ccae9efe4d" data-recommend-id="image://9d01caab1cccb22faee716ccae9efe4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A shark crashing in" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>  <em>Bait</em> is one of the most creative entries in the Sharksploitation genre. It feels like the filmmakers said: “Sharks in the ocean? Yawn. Let’s put them inside a supermarket!” Director Kimble Rendall tosses <em>Jaws</em>, <em>The Impossible</em>, and Stephen King’s <em>The Mist</em> into a blender for the wild premise: after a freak tsunami hits, a group of strangers (plus a cute little dog) are trapped inside a flooded grocery store with a shark. Standing on the shelves can only help them for so long. Their battle against the shark menacingly roaming the aisles is gorier than most other shark films. The use of animatronics in several scenes makes the carnage believable. Even though the concept sounds idiotic, it actually works and leaves you hooked. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bf2a705aa78a1e5fdcdbead8a7e7a4c1" data-recommend-id="image://bf2a705aa78a1e5fdcdbead8a7e7a4c1" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="People trapped in cage" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="People trapped in cage" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Dimension Films</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bf2a705aa78a1e5fdcdbead8a7e7a4c1" data-recommend-id="image://bf2a705aa78a1e5fdcdbead8a7e7a4c1" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="People trapped in cage" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> In <em>47 Meters Down</em>, a diving trip goes awry for two vacationing sisters. Their cage plummets to the ocean floor, leaving them surrounded by sharks and a dwindling oxygen supply. The viewer is choked with fear by the darkness of the watery environment and the claustrophobic framing. There’s also something terrifying about the characters being completely immersed in the shark’s kingdom—seeing life through their eyes and coming face to face with them. The film uses this setup to deliver some biting jump scares. The sequel, <em>47 Meters Down: Uncaged</em> (2019), raises the stakes by submerging a group of girls in an underwater maze of caves and tunnels filled with sharks. Both films are serviceable popcorn thrillers that venture into uncharted depths of shark terror. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6f5c767a7f413cdb5ae9e7cf3a4d1b05" data-recommend-id="image://6f5c767a7f413cdb5ae9e7cf3a4d1b05" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shark attacking a man" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shark attacking a man" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

It heightens the stereotype that sharks are vindictive and deliberately hunt down their chosen victims by making them genetically engineered to be smarter. The experiment to see if their brain tissue can cure Alzheimer’s backfires in the most brutal way. It’s great, blood-soaked fun to watch the all-star cast—Samuel L. Jackson, Stellan Skarsgård, Michael Rapaport, and LL Cool J (who also performs the end-credits rap), etc.—either get caught in the feeding frenzy or narrowly escape. Some scenes use slow motion to heighten the drama and make the adventure feel more epic and cinematic. When <em>Deep Blue Sea</em> bares its teeth, it’s less horrifying and more of a high-adrenaline action flick. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7fb08c8c8143a7930f41cb16273cce26" data-recommend-id="image://7fb08c8c8143a7930f41cb16273cce26" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman looking terrified" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman looking terrified" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Columbia Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7fb08c8c8143a7930f41cb16273cce26" data-recommend-id="image://7fb08c8c8143a7930f41cb16273cce26" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman looking terrified" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Being stranded in the middle of the deep, shark-infested waters, with no land in sight, has been the terrifying concept of several movies already, so <em>The Shallows</em> tries to do something different. It’s a cruel twist of fate for Nancy (Blake Lively), who ends up stranded on a tiny, isolated rock only 200 yards from the shore. All that’s between her and safety in the shallow waters is a giant shark. She’s so close yet so far. Jaume Collet-Serra, who also directed <em>Orphan</em> and <em>House of Wax</em>, has a very lyrical vision that makes even the simplest of his horror movie concepts feel grand and mythic, which really works for this stripped-down survival concept. Blake Lively gives her character some gumption and emotional gravitas that makes us invested in her survival. There are some very creative set pieces involving jellyfish and a buoy, plus some welcome levity from a seagull named Steven Seagull. <em>The Shallows</em> is a solid B-movie that doesn’t pretend to be anything more than it is, but still manages to rise above most brainless shark thrillers. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a447f43a3a5ccc746561443f0eb0af81" data-recommend-id="image://a447f43a3a5ccc746561443f0eb0af81" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man dangling over a shark" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man dangling over a shark" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->IFC Films</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a447f43a3a5ccc746561443f0eb0af81" data-recommend-id="image://a447f43a3a5ccc746561443f0eb0af81" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man dangling over a shark" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re looking to expand your shark movie repertoire, you’ll have to wade through plenty of ridiculous ones. But every so often, one surfaces that’s genuinely thrilling and adds something new to the genre. <em>Dangerous Animals</em> has a particularly intriguing premise where a serial killer (played by an unhinged Jai Courtney) uses sharks as his weapon. The breathtaking underwater shots show the sharks in all of their menacing, enormous glory, and they simply behave as they naturally would. <em>Dangerous Animals</em> does not demonize them, instead making it clear that the true predator is toxic masculinity. Tucker’s philosophical attachment to the sharks and the shocking mayhem he causes make for a brutal, fast-paced viewing experience that hits you hard like a tidal wave.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b31a69032bd9bb842e0e13939efdca67" data-recommend-id="image://b31a69032bd9bb842e0e13939efdca67" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A shark swimming" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A shark swimming" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Image Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b31a69032bd9bb842e0e13939efdca67" data-recommend-id="image://b31a69032bd9bb842e0e13939efdca67" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A shark swimming" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Australia’s Great Barrier Reef is known for being a shark hotspot, but that doesn’t stop five friends from partying there on a yacht, which ends up capsizing. Director Andrew Traucki was already known for another white-knuckle creature feature, <em>Black Water</em>, about a group of people stalked by a relentless saltwater crocodile in a swamp. Instead of clinging to the tops of mangrove trees, the protagonists in <em>The Reef</em> are forced to make a terrible choice: stay on board the sinking ship or swim twelve miles to the nearest island while a great white shark waits in between. The suspense of this decision, as well as who will be taken by the shark and when, is as razor-sharp as the predator’s teeth. Traucki’s use of actual shark footage gives the water scenes a chilling authenticity. The sequel, <em>The Reef: Stalked</em> (2022), follows an entirely different story in which a kayaking trip goes terribly wrong and is just as intense.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7abe23a955ab3c29f4d7623573570edd" data-recommend-id="image://7abe23a955ab3c29f4d7623573570edd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="People looking frightened at sharks" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="People looking frightened at sharks" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lionsgate</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7abe23a955ab3c29f4d7623573570edd" data-recommend-id="image://7abe23a955ab3c29f4d7623573570edd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="People looking frightened at sharks" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Filmed on digital video, <em>Open Water</em> makes an American couple’s harrowing experience stranded in the middle of the ocean after a scuba diving trip look like the worst home movie ever made. Based on a true story and using live sharks instead of CGI or mechanical ones, <em>Open Water</em> stands out as one of the most raw shark movies ever made. The sharks patiently circle the couple in the depths below, unlike Hollywood versions where they launch like missiles toward their prey. The film has an intimate, DIY aesthetic that puts you right there next to the couple: waves lap against the camera, natural daylight fades into a dark thunderstorm, and there is no way to see what lurks below. <em>Open Water</em> proves that shark movies do not have to be elaborate and effects-heavy in order to put viewers on the edge of their seat. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>On September 6, 2018, South Korean game developer Pearl Abyss (Black Desert) <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-to-acquire-eve-onlines-ccp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> CCP Games and the MMORPG EVE Online, the flagship product of the Icelandic studio, for around $425 million.</p>
<p>Nearly seven years later, Pearl Abyss might be reconsidering their stake in CCP Games. At least, that's what <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025061910371430049" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new report by Korean website MTN</a> alleges today: PA has reportedly reached out to multiple game companies to gauge their potential interest in acquiring CCP Games.</p>
<p>We don't have public visibility on the sales performance of CCP's games, but we do know that there were several missteps along the way, both prior and after the acquisition by Pearl Abyss. Over its nearly thirty-year history, CCP canceled at least four games (an MMO set in the World of Darkness, Project Legion, Eve: The Second Genesis, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-nova-developers-drawing-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Nova</a>), while other projects notoriously fizzled too early, such as Dust 514. For a while, CCP even released several Virtual Reality games (<a href="https://wccftech.com/196685-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVE: Valkyrie</a>, Gunjack, Gunjack 2: End of Shift, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sparc-virtual-sport-of-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sparc</a>), although eventually it gave up once it became crystal clear that the VR market was too small.</p>
<p>More recently, CCP <a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-frontier-goes-public-today-with-founder-access-new-era/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> EVE: Frontier, a survival spin-off of EVE Online, in 'Founder Access'. Perhaps Pearl Abyss isn't thrilled with the direction of Frontier and the other new project, <a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-online-frontier-vanguard-fanfest-2025-qa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanguard</a>, CCP's umpteenth at a shooter game connected with its MMORPG.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, the MTN report alleges that the Korean company would be glad to be rid of this subsidiary and focus on its own games, such as Crimson Desert and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-reportedly-moved-to-q2-2025-dokev-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DokeV</a>. This is the same source that <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-on-november-2-says-korean-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a tentative internal release date for Crimson Desert, by the way, to which Pearl Abyss only referred back to official announcements coming from its own social channels.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we'll update this article if PA chooses to comment in any way. Stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/689708/summer-game-fests-best-games-were-small-and-personal<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Summer Game Fest 2025 was definitely a weird one, but even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/688568/summer-game-fest-2025-los-angeles-ice-arrests">with everything going on outside</a>, the games on display were still immaculate. My favorites, the ones that I <em>live </em>for, are small, unique, and made for pure love of expression. Being able to see that love so clearly on display, expressed through such painstaking and often thankless work, and also being able to show them to our audience who might not otherwise encounter them, is the defining privilege of my job. That’s what I love about Summer Game Fest, weirdness and all, and hopefully when these games come out, you’ll check ‘em out too.</p><div><p id="escape-academy-2-tbd"><h2>Escape Academy 2 - TBD</h2></p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23218887/escape-academy-review-xbox-playstation-escape-room-puzzle-game">I loved the first <em>Escape Academy</em></a> and vibrated through my chair seeing that Coin Crew Games had returned to Summer Game Fest with <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3296060%2FEscape_Academy_2_Back_2_School%2F" rel="sponsored">a bigger, more expansive sequel</a>. Instead of selecting levels, now you can explore an open world, solving puzzles as you discover them in a college campus setup. I love this new direction: the open-world exploration better melds the quirky / cute storytelling of <em>Escape Academy</em> with the actual act of solving puzzles. </p><p>In the short demo I was introduced to a cat who lived in my dorm room and wanted a snack. As I explored the campus, I found the cafeteria was closed but the special of the day was fish and milk. I solved the puzzle to open the cafeteria and was rewarded with my feline dorm-mate following me around campus for the rest of the demo and hopefully the full game. There’s no release date yet, but whenever it’s out, I’m enrolling.</p><div><p id="petal-runner-tbd"><h2>Petal Runner - TBD</h2></p></div><p>Speaking of pet companions, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2795110%2FPetal_Runner%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Petal Runner</em></a> is a somber exploration of the tension between the joy of owning a pet and the inevitable devastation that comes with that, only disguised as a lighthearted pixelated <em>Pokémon</em>-like minigame-a-palooza. You, as a newly minted motorcycle courier, are tasked with helping people with their living Tamagotchis known as HanaPets. Install them, feed them, and bring them items while along the way you explore your relationship with your own first-generation HanaPet, who might not be around for much longer. I did not expect to sit down and play this game, which had all the hallmarks of a quote-unquote “wholesome game,” and be emotionally devastated. It ruined me... 10/10, can’t wait to play.</p><div><p id="relooted-tbd"><h2>Relooted - TBD</h2></p></div><p>When I tell you I sat the hell up seeing <em>Relooted</em>’s trailer. Here’s a game, stuffed full of African folks, talking about <em>stealing back their cultural artifacts??? </em>Hell, and I cannot stress this enough, yes. <a href="https://nyamakop.co.za/relooted/"><em>Relooted</em></a> really captures the feeling of pulling off your own <em>Ocean’s Eleven</em>-style heist. You have a team of experts with their own specialties, and before your heist, you have to position them strategically so that the right person is in the right place to hack locked doors and help you reach unreachable places for a smooth escape. </p><p>While some of the Black members of the game’s African developer team <a href="https://aftermath.site/relooted-game-africa-museum-visa-nyamakop-interview">couldn’t secure the visas they needed to attend SGF</a>, Ben Myres, the creative director who I was able to speak to, said that each item you’re stealing is a real-life artifact currently being withheld from its country of origin. Each gets its own encyclopedia-like entry giving you its history, where it is now, and where it actually belongs. Nathan Drake, Lara Croft, Indiana Jones are all weaksauce compared to these heroes.</p><div><p id="directive-8020-october-2nd-2025"><h2>Directive 8020 - October 2nd, 2025</h2></p></div><p>I enjoyed Supermassive Games’ spooky narrative choice adventures in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/17/22980954/the-quarry-supermassive-horror-game-release-date-ps5-xbox-steam"><em>The Quarry</em></a> and its <em>Dark Pictures Anthology</em>. So I was really glad I had the chance to see what the team is doing next with <a href="https://www.thedarkpictures.com/games/directive-8020"><em>Directive 8020</em></a>. This time, instead of haunted schools or cabins in the woods, we’re going to space with Lashana Lynch — a favorite actress of mine for whom I will show up no matter what.</p><p>The neat thing about <em>Directive 8020</em> is its replay system. At critical decision-making moments, you have the option to replay events without having to replay the game. Shoot a guy you shouldn’t have shot? You can immediately go back and see what happens when you don’t. You’ll also have the option to disable that, so the choices you make stick. I had the option to unshoot someone, but I chose to live with my mistake, and all these days later, I still think about that.</p><div><p id="possessors-tbd"><h2>Possessor(s) - TBD</h2></p></div><p>Heart Machine, maker of <em>Hyper Light Drifte</em>r and its sequel, <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>, are back with another game guaranteed to mess with your emotions. <em>Possessor(s)</em> is a Metroidvan— excuse me, <em>search action </em>game. I had a spirited and convivial conversation with one of the developers on the merits of using “Metroidvania” versus “search action” as a descriptor and I gotta say, I’ve been convinced. Not enough to remove “Metroidvania” from my vocabulary, but definitely enough to think more about how I use these terms when I write about games.</p><p>In <em>Possessor(s)</em> you play as a young woman escaping a city under attack. She is grievously wounded and enters a pact with a demon to heal her wounds and grant her powers so she can escape from the city. Speaking to the developer, he told me the game was about toxic relationships and what they can do to a person. The demon you make your pact with is not nice; he is not the hero. And yet, the developers at Heart Machine decided to make him smokin’ hot, which they know will obscure the very necessary message they’re trying to relay… which, I’m thinking, is probably the point. </p><div><p id="out-of-words-tbd"><h2>Out of Words - TBD</h2></p></div><p><a href="https://www.outofwordsgame.com/"><em>Out of Words</em></a> is my game of the show. Developed by Kong Orange and published by Epic Games, <em>Out of Words</em> is a stop-motion co-op adventure game akin to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/623660/split-fiction-review-hazelight-studios-it-takes-two"><em>Split Fiction</em></a> with a much, <em>much </em>better story. This is the kind of game that reminds me that video games are more than just vehicles for making money or simple entertainment; they are works of art, expressions of a developer’s heart and mind.</p><p>It’s about two teenagers who, after a moment of miscommunication, have their mouths removed, forcing them to communicate and navigate a fantastical world without words. </p><p>Everything in the game is made by hand and with love so evident it was incredibly moving. When I asked the game’s director, Johan Oettinger, why he and the team spent so much time — he told me they’d been working on this game for a decade — and money to make something that could potentially get drowned out by bigger, flashier releases, he looked me in the face, serious as a cemetery, and said, “Because it has been my dream to make something like this since I was a child.”</p><p>As a games journalist I <em>live </em>for the moments when I can see a developer’s fingerprints in a game, their personal quirks and the idiosyncrasies of their lives reflected in their art, and that was all over <em>Out of Words</em>. The developer told me how each blade of grass was made from paper, and how the blue clay they used to make the quirky clay men that populate the world comes from a specific place in Denmark where they harvested it by hand. It was so beautiful I spent most of the 20-minute demo in tears. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hideo Kojima has been out and about and doing interviews at the Sydney Film Festival as part of the build-up to the release of his upcoming, Australian-set sequel, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>.</p>
<p>As shared by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/i-almost-gave-up-hideo-kojima-on-looking-into-the-abyss-death-stranding-2s-australian-setting-working-with-his-idols-and-connecting-with-koalas/">GamesRadar</a>, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> director openly chatted about a whole bunch of topics, including one rather cool Game Boy Advance title by Konami that he produced back in 2003. During the conversation, as he discusses his creative spark and how eureka moments come about, he mentions <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/boktai_the_sun_is_in_your_hand">Boktai: The Sun Is in Your Hand</a> as an example of his interest in infusing game experiences with new tech.</p><p><figure data-videoid="bhK3W_3CW7w" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e97frziwuq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhK3W_3CW7w">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Indeed, with this in mind, Kojima gave an example of how Konami's toy division once manufactured a UV-light-detecting teddy bear (just what we've always wanted!). It failed to gain any traction, for some reason, and so, with Konami sitting on a load of unused components, Kojima pounced, striking a deal on the UV-sensor tech on the cheap to incorporate into the Boktai cartridges so that the game could detect actual real sunlight and charge up your in-game weapon to kill vampires. Pretty rad, right?</p>
<p>"UV sensors were so expensive at the time," he said. "You have to select the ideas at the best time."</p>

<p>And so it proved, as Boktai released to cracking reviews, and sits on a rating of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/boktai-the-sun-is-in-your-hand/">83% over at Metacritic</a>, which is actually 1% more than <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/death_stranding">Death Stranding</a>, so maybe someone should look at sticking some UV tech into the sequel, eh.</p>

			<p>A new Battlefield Labs update has gone live today, introducing new features to the test version of what will presumably be the next entry in the popular first-person shooter series.</p>
<p>As reported on the franchise's official subreddit, the new patch that went live a few hours ago introduced a few changes and improvements, such as NVIDIA DLSS 4 support and the option to turn off the border around the capture zone. Additionally, the new update has changed the watermark from PRE ALPHA to ALPHA and has added files related to a battle royale mode. With the promise of news coming soon regarding the class system, there's the chance the update has been pushed in preparation for something, possibly the official announcement of the next Battlefield which is still scheduled for this <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">summer.</a></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lf7tkr/new_information_dropped_from_the_1bf_telegram/">New information dropped from the 1BF telegram</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NSGXD/">u/NSGXD</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/">Battlefield</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Although Battlefield Labs footage was not meant to be shared, plenty of it has made its way <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-new-leaked-footage/">online,</a> providing an early look at what the next entry in the series should offer. Besides the multiplayer modes that select users can test right now, the next entry in the series will also feature a <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/">single-player campaign</a> developed by Motive Studios, the team behind last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-space-effective-yet-finite-facelift/">Dead Space remake</a>, which will be influenced by TV shows and movies like Lioness and Civil War.</p>
<p>More information on Battlefield Labs can be found on its <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

They need to increase top speed when using thrusters. PvP should be about control, not ganking. You use rockets to take or hold a landmark, not to hunt people.

"I’ve killed so many people with them and I shouldn’t be this fast or efficient. Assaults should have the rockets, because they’re slow and need constant input to out manoeuvre someone.

<p>I'm a fan... Get it..? Fan!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> is out now on Switch and Switch 2, and we thought it was really rather good. In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">9/10 review of the Switch 1 version</a>, we said it's "a must-play for Rune Factory fans and would be well-enjoyed by newcomers to the series as well," praising the sheer amount of compelling stuff to do alongside the "edgy and dramatic" story.</p>
<p>The kind folks over at Marvelous have sent us the physical Limited Edition of the Switch 1 game to check out, and we thought you might like to see exactly what's included in this edition. So we've put together a cheeky little gallery to peruse at your leisure.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xosjtg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>What's included, exactly? Well, the star of the show is a rather beautiful Sacred Fan with an accompanying clear display stand. You've also got a Woolby Plush Keychain, a 161-page softback art book, a two-disc soundtrack CD, and the game itself on cartridge.</p>
<p>Definitely some high-quality goodies, and we're particularly enamoured with the art book – it's chock-full of character designs and environment paintings. Gorgeous stuff. Let's take a closer look.</p>

<p>The Limited Edition is still available and priced at <strong>£79.99</strong> in the UK and <strong>$99.99</strong> in the US (if you can find one). A proper physical edition for the Switch 2 (i.e. not a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Card</a>) is also available for <strong>£59.99 / $69.99</strong> (or alternatively you can opt for the upgrade pack for <strong>£10 / $10</strong> if you already have the Switch 1 version).</p>
<p><em>Huge thanks to Marvelous for sending us a sample to check out. Have you tried Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma on Switch or Switch 2 yet? Are you tempted to grab a copy of the Limited Edition? Let us know with a comment in the usual place.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-has-just-become-more-challenging-with-the-introduction-of-the-everdark-sovereigns/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Elden Ring Nightreign has just become more challenging, thanks to the introduction of a more powerful variant of the Nightlords.</p>
<p>Following the release of the game's latest minor update mainly focused on fixing bugs, Nightfarers will now encounter <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/the-everdark-sovereigns-have-emerged-elden-ring-nightreign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everdark Sovereigns</a> during Expeditions. Over the next few weeks, they can take on more powerful variants of the Gaping Jaw, Sentient Pest, and Darkdrift Knight bosses, with other Everdark Sovereigns getting added to the game later. Every week, a new Sovereign will arrive in Limveld for everyone who has already defeated the base version of the boss, and when the time is up, they will disappear. Those who manage to take down these limited-time versions of the Nightlords will be rewarded with Sovereign Sigils that can be exchanged for special Relics and other items. The first Everdark Sovereign, an enhanced version of Adel, Baron of the Night, will be available until June 26 9:59 JST 2:59 CEST 5:59 PM PDT.</p>
<p>Considering there isn't much to do in Elden Ring Nightreign after defeating the game's final boss, the introduction of more powerful Nightlords is more than welcome. Not that the game needed more challenge, as some of the base Nightlords are among the most challenging bosses created by FromSoftware, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">review.</a></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

            <p>Gears of War Reloaded developer The Coalition has extended the second weekend of the game's beta, which along with more time will also include more modes and more maps for participants to check out.</p>
<p>The upcoming weekend's beta will now run between 20th June 8pm UK time until 23rd June 5am UK time, and feature five maps for both Social Team Deathmatch and Competitive King of the Hill and Execution. Initially, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-reloaded-multiplayer-beta-coming-this-weekend">things were planned to be wrapped up within 48 hours and with less variety</a>.</p>

<p>As to why the team has decided to do this? Well, "we heard you," is what it wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/GearsofWar/status/1935414750034411784">post on social media</a>.</p>
<p>You see, the first Gears of War Reloaded beta weekend didn't <em>exactly </em>go all that smoothly for the developer, and there were multiple reports from players of <a href="https://x.com/SASxSH4DOWZ/status/1934359201523929512">server instability</a> as well as technical issues. Many were quite <a href="https://x.com/Lilkillsville/status/1934044001050730864">vocal about their experiences</a>.</p>
<p>"Most of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> stream thumbnails are of people sitting trying to find a match. When you eventually can get into a match, everybody is laggy and when you start shooting somebody they just disappear and then randomly you die or they stutter back and forth taking multiple full clips and not dying," read <a href="https://x.com/Freas23Gaming/status/1933863257304875257">one such post on social media</a> following the first beta. "I knew the beta was probably gonna be bad but this is just terrible and unacceptable."</p>
<p>Hopefully things will go a bit better this weekend.</p>

<p>Gears of War Reloaded - which is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-coming-to-playstation">revamped edition of the original Gears of War game</a> - will be making its full arrival on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th August.</p>
<p>It will feature faster frame rates and "deeper visual fidelity", with the studio promising "clarity, smoothness, and immersion that matches the power of today's hardware".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-update-20-1-5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Nintendo Switch 2 system update is now live, introducing general stability improvements as well as undocumented improvements.</p>
<p>The official update notes don't leave any doubt regarding the fact that this is a minor update, as it only introduces <em>"general system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience."</em> What's more interesting is that the update reportedly does introduce some undocumented improvements. As reported by well-known dataminer OatmealDome on <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1935542554642051512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, the new update improves backward compatibility, and some previously unsupported titles are now properly playable on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>While not a direct effect of the new system update, Pikmin 3 Deluxe now properly works on the new system, thanks to a new <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1935510351015006422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a> that addressed screen flickering issues. The demo version of the game will also be fixed later.</p>
<p>Backward compatibility seems to be one of the best features of the Nintendo Switch 2, so it wouldn't be surprising to see improvements already being made so soon. Multiple tests have confirmed that even<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-backward-compatibility-better-original-system/"> unpatched games</a> can take advantage of the new system's better specs to deliver more stable framerates, so hopefully, more of the incompatible titles will become fully playable on the system in the future.</p>
<p>For the rest, the Nintendo Switch 2 is a massive improvement over its predecessor in every possible way. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>

            <p>Sloclap launched its football action game Rematch today, but crossplay has not been included due to "unforeseen technical complexities".</p>
<p>Rematch released across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC (Steam), but players are unable to play with others on rival platforms - at least, not yet.</p>
<p>"We understand many of you were looking forward to playing Rematch across platforms from day one," said the studio in a <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/rematch-launch-priorities-next-steps">launch blog post</a>. "We did our utmost to include crossplay at launch, but Rematch is the studio's first crossplay title, and we faced unforeseen technical complexities which prevented us from having this feature ready in time. We should have communicated as soon as it became apparent that crossplay wouldn't be available at launch, and we're sorry for the inconvenience and frustration it caused to some of our players."</p>

<p>The studio noted it's "very important for us that our players are able to enjoy Rematch with their friends" and so crossplay is its "absolute highest priority" alongside bug fixes. It's "committed to delivering this feature swiftly". A basic working version has already been produced from a technical standpoint, but needs to be debugged and polished before full implementation.</p>
<p>The studio also noted other issues it's looking to fix, based on feedback from the early access period. These include: performance optimisations to improve stability; preventing server and client desynchronisation; and resolving game-breaking bugs.</p>
<p>Beyond these issues, the studio will be working on broader updates with new content like tournament and leaderboard systems, social features like spectating and (ironically) easier rematches, as well as more casual game modes such as quick play and implementing AI bots to train against.</p>
<p>Sloclap will also tweak the core gameplay, with improvements to the sliding tackle, goalkeeper mechanics, the dribbling system, and wall contacts, among others. "Our general objective is to keep adding depth and granularity to our mechanics, to make the game as interesting as possible in a competitive environment," the studio said.</p>
<p>"Please remember that we are not a huge team, and that these features take time, so don't expect all this by the end of the year!" Sloclap concluded. "We will communicate on a more precise roadmap for upcoming seasons as soon as we have better visibility on when we can deliver on these intentions."</p>
<p>The studio added: "We're dedicated to making Rematch the outstanding multiplayer football experience you deserve, and we're committed to communicating regularly and transparently with our community to keep you updated on our progress. Thanks to all players who joined us already for your incredible enthusiasm and support, this is really what motivates us to make this game as great as it can be!"</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Tom Orry has been playing Rematch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-the-challenging-new-online-football-game-hitting-game-pass-immediately-transported-me-back-to-my-schools-playground">likened it to being transported back to the school playground</a>, stating "the same blinkered overconfidence of school days is here to see in Rematch".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-next-batch-of-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-june">Rematch has also been added to Xbox Game Pass</a>, for those with a subscription.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Hogwarts Legacy on Nintendo Switch was pretty naff, let’s be honest. A remarkable achievement, but one that was inevitably heavily compromised just to get it running at the low level that it managed. By contrast, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is a huge accomplishment that captures so much more of the tone and feel of the game on PS5, Xbox Series X or PC that it feels so much more worth playing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hogwarts Legacy on Switch 2 is a transfigurational new port!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AIeg7MFl6NY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is a brand-new port of the game to Nintendo Switch, retaining none of the heavy compromises that were needed to work on Switch, and making its own adjustments to match the new hardware platform’s strengths and weaknesses.</p>


<p>The difference is night and day, though. The often very flat lighting and shading of the interior of Hogwarts on Nintendo Switch is replaced by the rich light and dark of more realistic internal lighting and illumination. This is one of the key areas where the game gets much closer to the game on PS5.</p>

<p>To me, that is one of the most impactful changes, but there’s so many other changes that were made for the game on Switch that have effectively been reverted for Switch 2. It’s everything from how thick the grass looks on the ground with the draw distance, to the variety of fidelity of the trees in the grounds around Hogwarts, the shadows that things cast.</p>

<p>It’s seriously impressive.</p>

<p>Alongside this has come a general gameplay experience that better matches the game on PS5. Where Switch 1 had loading transitions to get into Hogsmeade and to walk into shops, Switch 2 is able to get back to the style of PS5, where the doors all just feel like they’re a bit haunted and slow to respond –&nbsp;most noticeable at major area transitions.</p>
<p>Flying around on a broomstick has also been sped back up, the faster storage and larger amount of RAM in the Switch 2 allowing for dynamic loading to keep up better. It’s one of those things you might notice most in side-by-side comparisons, or if you ever compare your records for time trials.</p>
<p>On a simplistic level, Hogwarts Legacy on Switch 2 is able to hold onto a 30fps target very well, Running through Hogwarts grounds on the path to Hogsmeade is basically just locked to 30fps, and when you reach Hogsmeade itself, you don’t have a loading screen like on Switch 1 and can just run straight into the tight village streets where, once again, performance is great.</p>

<p>Really, the main issues we’ve found have been with instances of loading stutter when coming up to the hidden loading screens at doors between areas –&nbsp;which when Hogwarts itself is a maze of doors and courtyards, does add frequent little blips, in addition to some pop-in and the fade of new lighting conditions. Flying around on a broom also leads to poor frame pacing, so this introductory time trial, for example, is 30fps, but it feels more juddery than it should be.</p>
<p>In any case, this all makes for a much more pleasant experience than the Switch 1, which can pretty much never maintain its 30fps target. Just running through the halls dips to the mid-20s, and the broom flying is seriously taxing for the system, such that this port slowed down the speed of flight to try and keep up.</p>
<p>You can, of course, play the Switch 1 port on Switch 2 via backward compatibility, and this does make it much more palatable. Dynamic resolutions will be better (though I’d argue still not exactly good), and the frame rate does steady up to 30fps, but there’s bad frame pacing here when running to Hogsmeade in particular. I guess Shiver Entertainment who did this Switch 1 port didn’t feel the need to look at this when they had much bigger problems!</p>
<p>Of course, even 30fps is a big step back from what is possible on PS5 and other more powerful platforms. They have graphics performance options, ranging from 30fps fidelity and ray tracing modes, through a standard 60fps performance mode and even a higher frame rate mode.</p>

<p>The main comparison, to my mind, would be from Switch 2 to PS5 performance mode. Not the max fidelity or performance, but the safe middle-ground. With this, you definitely notice some of the compromises still being made for Switch 2. And…. well, honestly you don’t even need to make this comparison to see how the Switch 2 relies on lower resolutions and upscaling to get the job done. The key area that always grabs my attention is when in the dialogue scenes and you can see the low resolution hair with jaggies and floating isolated strands. The diffuse reflections on shiny walls and floors through Hogwarts also have much more of a speckled look at you get to the ends, though intriguingly, it does seem that there are more of these reflections by default on Switch 1, vs. performance mode on PS5.</p>

<p>However, in general, this is an incredibly impressive new port of Hogwarts Legacy for Nintendo Switch 2. Yes, there are of course compromises, but it really captures the look and feel of the original game release that makes it feel of that generation, and not like the necessarily cut down port of the original Switch.</p>
<p>It’s also nice to see that, while this is new work, Warner Bros. is offering upgrade pricing. If you own the game on Switch 1, you can access a DLC from the game’s main menu to enable a discount price for the full Switch 2 game to bring it down to $10 or £8.50. This could have been made more obvious with a Switch 2 Edition style release, but has the major benefit that you won’t need the Switch 1 cartridge to play anymore, if you’re coming from a physical copy. For one of the biggest generational leaps you’ll ever likely see, that’s a bargain, but it’s also just a nice good faith upgrade in general.</p>

<p>Hogwarts Legacy is a great port for Nintendo Switch 2, and another great showcase of how the console can punch above its weight.</p>

			<p>A new game project titled Lionhearts <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/612741239/lionhearts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeared on Kickstarter</a> yesterday, seeking a minimum of $100K, of which over half has already been pledged. ROBLOX fans might recognize the name from <a href="https://www.roblox.com/communities/1160789" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lionhearts: Crusade</a>, a conquest experience developed by Credenzio Studios that reached over 6.3 million plays in the popular game since its original release in 2018.</p>
<p>Now, Colorado-based developer Credenzio is turning the concept into a standalone game developed with Unreal Engine 5. It will be a persistent multiplayer feudal simulator inspired by games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-to-get-war-sails-nautical-expansion-this-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mount and Blade: Bannerlord</a>, Assassin's Creed, Helldivers, and EVE Online.</p>
<p>The game is set in a historically authentic 12th-century medieval world, specifically during the Third Crusade. The developers pledged to respect the bounds of historical plausibility and accuracy. In this context, players will be given nearly complete reign, with NPCs having little to no presence in the game world. They'll start with having to gain favor in their kingdom to ascend the religious, military, or trade hierarchies and acquire wealth, tools, lands, and power. To do so, they'll choose one of the three career paths of the age: military, religious, or trade. With 16 factions, 14 guild types offering 60+ career paths, and 4 religions, players can become a knight, blacksmith, bishop, merchant, or even a king, eventually ruling the Holy Land itself.</p>

<p>In Lionhearts, there will be 12 player-run kingdoms and 4 military orders, in which every position of power, from lord to king, is controlled by real players. Players can command retinues, wage wars, and navigate diplomacy in an ever-changing struggle for land and influence. Monarchs must balance internal politics, trade, and religion while competing for dominance in the Holy Land and beyond. As mentioned earlier, Credenzio is promising a persistent MMO-like world. This is supposed to happen through a server meshing-like technology where servers are stitched together to create a single, seamless shared open world. Each location will exist in a single instance, so there will be no need for server hopping or loading screens.</p>

<p>Needless to say, it's an incredibly ambitious project, especially for an indie studio. There is, however, a 'visual demo' available for download (the link is on the Kickstarter page) for those interested. Otherwise, you could simply add <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3348690/Lionhearts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lionhearts</a> to your Steam wishlist.</p>
