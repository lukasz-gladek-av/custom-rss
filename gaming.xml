            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/22/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-doesnt-have-a-platinum-trophy/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launching later this week, preloads for what is sure to be one of the biggest games of the year are now live, and this has revealed that there’s no <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> platinum trophy on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>.</p>
<p>There’s a list of 44 trophies for Black Ops 6 on PS5, but they top out with a handful of gold trophies instead of a platinum that you would typically expect for any new game. Bizarrely, there is a platinum trophy for the game on PS4, per <a href="https://www.exophase.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-psn/trophies/">Exophase</a>.</p>


<p>Black Ops 6 preloads are available through the unified Call of Duty game app that launched with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/modern-warfare-ii">Modern Warfare 2</a> in 2022 – AKA COD HQ – providing one client that brings together MW2, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii">MW3</a>, Black Ops 6 and Warzone and does what it can to keep game install sizes in check through sharing common assets.</p>
<p>This also means that MW2, MW3 and Black Ops 6 trophy lists are brought together. Of the three, only Modern Warfare 2 has a platinum trophy with MW3 and Black Ops 6 missing out.</p>
<p>You might think this is a deliberate tactic to get under the skin of PlayStation gamers by Activision Blizzard’s new owners at Microsoft, but it’s almost certainly nothing to do with that. Black Ops 6 presents itself within Sony’s system as an expansion to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, so it cannot have a platinum trophy, just like Destiny 2 only ever had one platinum despite numerous big yearly expansions. Then again, that doesn’t explain why Black Ops 6 can have a platinum on PS4…</p>

<p>This won’t stop millions of people playing the game, but it will be a sour note for trophy obsessives. Thankfully the trophy list doesn’t look that bad, with goals to complete the campaign on Veteran difficulty, some mission specific objectives, and a pretty typical smattering of multiplayer trophies, building up to getting Prestige for the first time.</p>
<p>One oddity is needing to eat a fish in Zombies. Look forward to figuring out what that’s about!</p>
<p>Black Ops 6 leans into all of the usual tropes and expectations of Black Ops series, with double crossing subterfuge and more through the campaign, set in the 1990s after the end of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/17/cod-black-ops-cold-war-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">Cold War</a>. George HW Bush is President, and there’s lies and more swirling around that you’ll dip your toes into. The campaign is sure to be another rollicking ride of gunfire and explosions, and that will absolutely carry on over to the full multiplayer game, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/08/see-the-black-ops-6-zombies-gameplay-reveal-and-its-definitely-round-based/">the round-base zombies mode</a>.</p>

		<p>Naughty Dog has released a patch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a>, fixing a few bugs, but most importantly adding support for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>We’re going to see a lot of PS5 Pro updates coming out in the next couple of weeks, and Naughty Dog are amongst the first to add native support to their game. In this case, they’ve added a new rendering mode that aims to take advantage PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution with a new “Pro” mode. This will render the game at 1440p, upscaled to 4K, while also maintaining a target of 60fps. The intention, as revealed during the PS5 Pro’s announcement is to give Fidelity mode visuals at Performance mode performance, with PSSR adding a little soupçon on top.</p>


<p>Performance and Fidelity rendering modes will both still be available, with the higher power of the PS5 Pro simply buffing their performance metrics.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there’s a fix for PS4 save imports not popping all the trophies, some stat tracking fixes for the No Return roguelike mode, and</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-will-feature-sylens-recast-following-lance-reddicks-untimely-death/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-horizon-adventures-will-feature-sylens-recast-following-lance-reddick%E2%80%99s-untimely-death.1015878/</guid>

			<p>Guerrilla Games has confirmed that they are recasting the character Sylens, starting with LEGO Horizon Adventures. Sylens was played by actor Lance Reddick, who unfortunately <a href="https://wccftech.com/lance-reddick-passes-away-60/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">met an untimely death at 60 years old in March 2023</a>. Reddick, who was also known to gamers for Destiny's Commander Zavala and for Quantum Break's Martin Hatch, was last featured in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/horizon-forbidden-west-bigger-and-better-in-every-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Forbidden West</a>. Those who completed the storyline already know his character Sylens was positioned to be instrumental in future installments, making this recast less than surprising.</p>
<p><a href="https://nordic.ign.com/lego-horizon-adventures/88300/news/lego-horizon-adventures-recasts-lance-reddicks-character-sylens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to IGN</a>, Guerrilla's World Art Supervisor Lucas Bolt said:</p>
<p><em>Lance Reddick tragically passed away in 2023, and he is deeply missed within Guerrilla and our community. He wonderfully portrayed the essential character of Sylens in Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West. The character of Sylens does appear in LEGO Horizon Adventures, and we will introduce the new actor at a later date. Hearing the voices of other original actors, including Ashly Burch as Aloy, JB Blanc as Rost, John Macmillan as Varl and John Hopkins as Erend, has really brought back the tone of comradery found in the original game</em></p>
<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures will retell the first franchise entry, Horizon Zero Dawn. Guerrilla previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-will-feel-lighthearted-while-keeping-the-characters-as-they-are/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> that the goal is to keep the core of every character while switching to a more lighthearted tone due to the different target audience. Narrative Director James Windeler explained:</p>
<p><em>It has still got to feel like Horizon. We have definitely bent the rules a lot. But the characters remain core to who they are. I think we've found a really good balance with it. We have a lot of help. Ashley Burch is back as the voice of Aloy, and JB Blanc (as Rost). And you would have heard the exuberance to their performances. It is different to what the other games are, but they're still recognisable. They're part of it and they bought into it, and that's been a huge boon to us.</em></p>
<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures is out <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-reportedly-launching-on-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 14</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch. It features two-player coop, a first for the franchise ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-online-co-op-game-nearly-confirmed-by-job-openings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned cooperative multiplayer game</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-review.1015872/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>For most of us, the biggest penalty for making too much noise might be a scolding shush from the movie theater seat behind you, but in A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead you’re only ever one creaky floorboard away from getting snuffed out by an alien threat that’s always listening out for you like it’s the most sinister form of Siri. This instant fail stealth-heavy horror story does a pretty convincing job of recreating the breath-holding tension of the films, in addition to borrowing heavily from the likes of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/alien-isolation">Alien: Isolation</a> in the way it casts you as the reluctant rodent trapped in a deadly game of cat and mouse. The result is a consistently stressful undertaking from start to finish, even though my careful creep down The Road Ahead moved at a relentlessly glacial pace and occasionally snagged on some slightly curious design decisions.       </p><p>A standalone story mostly set around four months after the alien invasion seen in <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/a-quiet-place-day-one">A Quiet Place: Day One</a>, The Road Ahead casts us as college student Alex Taylor and follows her attempts to flee her abandoned hospital hideout in order to make a silent and steady pilgrimage towards an off-shore safe haven isolated from the threat of the monsters, known as Death Angels. It’s a straightforward setup, but tender early moments spent with her likable boyfriend Martin and kindhearted father Kenneth were enough to get me invested in Alex’s cause before inevitable alien-inflicted tragedy spurs her escape plan into action. It’s a bit of a letdown that, in spite of its strong start, the payoff for The Road Ahead’s plot in its dying hours is all too predictable, and its overall story comes up noticeably lacking in impact – particularly in the wake of the far more emotionally resonant tale found in <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/a-quiet-place-day-one">Day One</a> earlier this year. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead Review Screens</h3></div></output><p>Still, there’s no shortage of affecting human artifacts to comb through along the way. Outside of the story’s opening chapters and the odd flashback, Alex is alone with her own thoughts – which are appropriately represented via onscreen text since any spoken sentence is only ever followed by a death sentence – for most of The Road Ahead. In lieu of any interactions with other survivors, I got a strong sense of the history of each space I shuffle-stepped through by observing the heartbreaking family portraits handcrafted in a child’s crayon tacked to the wall of a deserted safehouse, or the hilarious note about a toilet paper-related riot left by a store owner in a seaside shopping strip. There are plenty of great worldbuilding touches like this in The Road Ahead, and I had ample opportunity to study every little detail since I moved through it in a constant state of slow-motion, desperately trying to keep my every movement on mute.</p><h2>Creeping with the Enemy</h2><p>It might be a first-person adventure almost completely devoid of combat, but The Road Ahead is no “walking simulator;” it's a <em>balking </em>simulator. Every step you take or action you perform is a reluctant one, because even the lightest door hinge-squeak or stomped-on gravel crunch can alert an alien hunter to your whereabouts and end your slow-walk to safety in an instant. Thus, most of my progress through Alex’s adventure through empty houses, camping grounds, and trainyards was made with micro movements to my controller’s thumbstick; tip-toeing through rooms at a snail’s pace and incrementally tilting forward to push doors open or carefully pulling back to slowly open desk drawers to search through. It felt a bit like coming home late from a night out and trying to find your way to bed without waking your significant other, only in this instance your significant other is a spindly-limbed extraterrestrial who wants to rip your insides out rather than simply ask you to sleep on the couch.</p><p>Almost every environment you explore in The Road Ahead is purpose-built to test your coordination and fine-motor skills. Rooms are cramped and cluttered with beast-stirring booby traps to avoid and – if you’re not careful – simply brushing past hollow barrels or pulling open the cover of an air vent too eagerly can bring your swift undoing. Thankfully, Alex is given a homemade phonometer early on which, when carried in her left hand, indicates the decibel level produced by her movements relative to the overall volume of the ambient sounds around her. I basically spent the entire seven-hour journey anxiously trying to prevent its meter from lighting up as a result of each steady-handed interaction I performed, not unlike trying to extract the wishbone in a game of Operation without suddenly triggering the patient’s buzzer and blinking red nose.  </p><p>Some of the ways The Road Ahead conjures up a life-ending crunch or clang do feel a little contrived, though. It makes total sense for there to be shards of broken glass lining the paths beside the shattered windows of an upturned train carriage, but the number of discarded paint cans to be found on remote forest hiking trails does seem a touch too improbable, like rolling out from under the Simpsons’ family car and finding yourself in a carpark that’s inexplicably full of garden rakes to step on. I managed to suspend my disbelief and just abide by the noise-making obstacle course that the developers have created, but I do wish they’d been able to disguise their monster-rousing trip-ups a little more organically. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The threats to blowing Alex’s cover aren’t only found in the world around her, though; they’re also within. Alex is an asthmatic, so actions of overexertion – like pulling herself up onto ledges or carrying heavy planks to use as makeshift bridges, as well as moments of heightened stress such as finding herself in close proximity to one of the alien stalkers – can push her into a state of noisy hyperventilation, which acts as a heavy-breathing beacon to any monsters in the area. This brings the welcome challenge of identifying when to best use the inhalers that can be collected along the way, even if it does seem a little silly that they’re single-use only, as though their previous owners huffed each of them right up to the limit.   </p><h2>Quiet Riot</h2><p>The Road Ahead isn’t only about stalking around in silence like some sort of survival-horror street mime, and along with the phonometer you are provided with some other basic tools to keep the keen-eared killers at bay. Bricks and bottles can be picked up and lobbed to temporarily distract them in fairly standard stealth-game style, while some other items serve dual purposes, like the hand flares that can be sparked to either light up darker environments or tossed away to confuse your petal-faced pursuers with their crackling hiss. It does feel a bit arbitrary the way certain items in Alex’s inventory can only be wielded in certain hands, though. It may create an added layer of tension to be forced to choose between measuring sound with the phonometer and illuminating the path forward with Alex’s flashlight, for example, since they can each only be wielded in her left hand, but it hardly makes any logical sense. Where was this flashlight purchased, at Ned Flanders’ Leftorium?</p><p>Occasionally, I’d find myself caught in close quarters with a monster and not have any noise-making tools in either hand, which put me in the lose-lose situation of either trying to make a run for it and getting instantly slashed in the back, or standing perfectly still only for the blind beast to accidentally bump straight into my nose and strike me down on the spot. It didn’t seem to matter if I chose to stick or twist, since either way I was going to find myself stuck and twisted apart. Thankfully, The Road Ahead’s generous auto-save system meant I was rarely penalised too heavily each time I perished, so although the slightly scripted feel of its enemy encounters mean it’s never as outright terrifying as <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/alien-isolation">Alien: Isolation</a>, it is at the very least more lenient and less likely to frustrate because you couldn’t reach a manual save point.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s never as outright terrifying as Alien: Isolation, [but] it is at the very least more lenient and less likely to frustrate.</p></div><p>The quarter-speed crawl along The Road Ahead does eventually run out of steam, though, even despite the fact that encounters with the aliens do evolve in some ways. There’s only ever one enemy type, but midway through they develop the ability to sense your movements even if the sounds you make are masked by the threshold of the ambient noise, effectively forcing you to simply take your hands off the controls and stand as still as a statue until the concussive effects of their scanning is completed, as an example. These modest changes help preserve the tension level throughout, but they struggle to completely disguise the fact that you’re otherwise mostly doing tedious tasks like turning valves and searching through drawers for supplies like any other survival-horror game, only at a considerably slower pace and without any combat sequences to release that tension in. There is one short flashback sequence that allows you to briefly blaze away with a shotgun out of the back of a speeding van, but The Road Ahead could have done with a few more of these dynamic detours to help break up the bit-by-bit crawl even more.  </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Tristan's Favourite Horror Games</h3><p>Intensity in ten entries.</p></div></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead does a commendable job of taking the uniquely silent scary movie series and spinning it into an interactive adventure, even if its methods for sustaining stress seem a bit too clearly contrived at times. I greatly appreciated the many handcrafted human touches that made its evacuated spaces so evocative, and the safety net of its consistent auto-save meant that my numerous instant deaths never became a source of frustration. However, although it may maintain a regularly tense atmosphere every shuffled step of the way, the absence of any significant story surprises or enough substantial changes to its simplistic stealth-based gameplay means that A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead doesn’t quite have enough twists and turns to make for an unmissable journey.

			<p>For years, Netflix has slowly started ramping up its gaming department. After launching with a mobile offering, they also <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-reportedly-working-on-aaa-pc-third-person-action-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> a triple-A development studio in Los Angeles, California, around two years ago, with former Overwatch executive producer Chacko Sonny chosen as its founder.</p>
<p>The goal was to create a third-person action RPG for PC (and, presumably, consoles). To achieve this objective, the studio continued hiring high-profile industry veterans such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-joe-staten-joins-netflix-343-creative-director-frank-oconnor-leaves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Staten</a> (known as the writer and creative director for various Halo games, ReCore, Crackdown, and more) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-hires-ex-god-of-war-art-director-to-create-original-aaa-game-alongside-halos-joe-staten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raf Grassetti</a>, former Art Director at Sony Santa Monica on the God of War games.</p>
<p>Despite all this talent, though, Netflix has already decided to shut down this studio, which had become known internally as Team Blue.&nbsp;<span>The news came from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephen Totilo's Game File</a>, who added that the Netflix gaming department had undergone some major changes starting in July when former chief Mike Verdu was moved to another role.</span> Alain Tascan, former executive vice president of game development at Epic Games, stepped into Verdu's role, and last week, Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-shakes-up-gaming-division-new-epic-hire-layoffs-2024-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Tascan picked former Epic Games VP of game development to join Netflix as VP of game technology and portfolio development. Business Insider also said there were around 35 cuts when Tascan was hired, although Totilo's sources say the figure was slightly lower.</p>
<p>That said, Netflix is not thinking about closing up shop in games if that's something you were worried about. It seems like its other studios (<a href="https://wccftech.com/night-school-studio-is-the-first-game-developer-purchased-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Night School</a> of Oxenfree fame, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-to-acquire-next-games-by-q2-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Next Games</a>, Spry Fox, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-acquires-dungeon-boss-developer-boss-fight-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boss Fight Entertainment</a>) will continue as if nothing happened. Of course, most of those are mobile game developers, so the question is whether Netflix plans to resume its triple-A multiplatform plans at some point or if it is content to stay on the mobile market for the time being. Time will tell.</p>

<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered was released to yet another stellar reception in January 2024, serving as the latest (re)iteration of this iconic post-apocalyptic franchise. While fans wait for the inevitable PC release, Naughty Dog has started fixing the game up for the impending arrival of the PlayStation 5 Pro console.</p>



<p>In the recent 1.2.0 patch, the developer tweaked the game in a few ways to enable PS5 Pro support, including boosting the game’s visuals with a rendering mode that leans on the new PSSR mechanics.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-better-than-ever">Better Than Ever</h2>



<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered is a stunning title that sold me on buying a PS5. Per my track record, I’ve brought a new console for each release of The Last of Us, as it’s my favourite PlayStation series and has been so since 2013 when the original game was released. If they announced The Last of Us Part III for PS6, guess what I’ll do?</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://feedback.naughtydog.com/hc/en-us/articles/31374559271828-The-Last-of-Us-Part-II-Remastered-Patch-1-2-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">1.2.0 patch</a> for The Last of Us Part II Remastered, Naughty Dog made some amendments to enable the game to lean on the full power of the upcoming PS5 Pro:</p>



<ul>
<li>New rendering mode added that takes advantage of PlayStation® Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR)
<ul>
<li>New “Pro” mode renders at 1440p, with PSSR upscaling output to 4K, while maintaining a target of 60 fps*</li>



<li>Performance and Fidelity rendering modes are still available and provide a smoother experience and high framerates compared to the original PS5*</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Outside of those major changes, Naughty Dog has swept through  The Last of Us Part II Remastered and fixed dozens of issues and bugs, particularly those focusing on trophies and save data.</p>



<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro console will be released on November 7 – are you going to push it to the limit and run The Last of Us Part II Remastered in Pro mode? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

During the panel in question, the streamers utilized a popular internet meme called a tier list, in which the top of the tier is the “best” or, in this case, the person for whom using “habibi” is most acceptable and the bottom was the least acceptable. At the TwitchCon panel, the tiers were labeled “Arab Coded, Asks Permission, Thinks It’s a Slur, and Loves Sabra,” a reference to Sabra Hummus, a popular brand of hummus manufactured in the United States. The VOD for the entire second day of TwitchCon (which was when Rating Streamers aired) has been removed from the GivePlz Twitch channel, which hosts all of the TwitchCon videos. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFZPZxOPbag&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFZPZxOPbag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The video is still available on the Ayyrabs YouTube page</a></span>.</p><p> Fr0gan, Capri, and Raffoul are all Arab (Fr0gan is Muslim, Raffoul is Jewish, and Capri is Christian) and host a podcast called Ayyrabs together.

<p>Are you excited for Fallout Day? The upcoming broadcast has quite a few fans itching for new content. Here are the Fallout Day dates and times fans should expect to watch the broadcast. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-fallout-day-broadcast-dates-and-times">All Fallout Day Broadcast Dates and Times</h2>



<p>Bethesda fans unite. The official Fallout Day broadcast is only days away. The broadcast will air on October 23, 2024. Here are the air times in each region it will go live:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>United States:</strong> 3 PM (EST)/12 PM (PST)</li>

<li><strong>United Kingdom:</strong> 8 PM (BST)</li>

<p>So, what should fans expect to see in the broadcast?</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-news-and-more">News and More</h2>



<p>While we do not know exactly what will be featured in the broadcast, we can expect to gain a plethora of Fallout news. Now, this does not mean a new game will be announced. While that is a possibility, it is more than likely that Bethesda will talk more about the hit TV show.</p>



<p>We know that season two is currently in production, so it is more than likely we will get some news on that. We may even get to see one of the cast members speak, which would be incredibly exciting.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There could also be updates on Fallout 76, the popular Multiplayer Fallout game. Who knows, though, we could get a brand new game announcement. A new Fallout game before Elder Scrolls 6? Anything is possible.</p>



<p>Will you be watching the Fallout Day broadcast?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/in-whirlwind-24-hours-twitch-re-enables-sign-ups-in-israel-and-palestine-bans-five-streamers-following-claims-of-antisemitism.1015767/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/twitch-israel-palestine-frogan-ban-h3h3<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Twitch began its week by correcting what it deemed an “unacceptable miss”: Many users in Israel and Palestine haven’t been able to sign up to use the site for a year. Yesterday, the issue finally roused Twitch, evidently asleep at the wheel, following recent viral social media and Israeli media posts. As a result of those posts and others, Twitch today went on to suspend five streamers who participated in a TwitchCon panel over perceived antisemitism. In so doing, it managed to clean up one mess and immediately make another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"Following the October 7, 2023 attacks, we temporarily disabled sign ups with email verification in Israel and Palestine,” Twitch’s official support account <a href="https://x.com/TwitchSupport/status/1848191418377830708" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. “We did this to prevent uploads of graphic material related to the attack and to protect the safety of users."</p><p>Twitch’s track record of actually preventing real-world violence from appearing on the site is spotty, but it has at least <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/05/20/twitch-buffalo-shooter-facebook-nypd-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prioritized speedy responses</a> to mass shootings and other tragedies in recent years.&nbsp;</p><p>Twitch says that new users in Israel and Palestine who logged in using phone verification instead of email verification were still able to register, but evidently taking down part of the system still stopped many at the door. So, what happened? Due to some configuration of left hand not meeting right hand, Twitch failed to re-enable functionality in Israel or Palestine. For a year.&nbsp;</p><p>"We’ve learned that, inadvertently, we did not re-enable email verification sign ups for either region,” the company wrote. “We deeply regret this unacceptable miss, and the confusion it has caused. We’ve fixed the issue, meaning all affected users can sign up with email verification."&nbsp;</p><p>While it’s unclear how exactly Twitch managed to lose track of something so major, it is noteworthy that following <a href="https://aftermath.site/latest-twitch-layoffs-spread-teams-even-thinner-no-idea-how-folks-are-going-to-make-it-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple rounds of layoffs</a> totalling out to nearly 1,000 employees, the company is running about as lean as possible, with some current Twitch staff <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-profitable-layoffs-interview-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently telling Aftermath</a> that remaining employees are overworked. It’s a recipe for things slipping through the cracks, whether or not that includes this particular situation.</p><p>Twitch ended yesterday’s post with a vaguely-worded statement about how it will continue to enforce its rules.</p><p>"We’ve also heard concerns about whether our Community Guidelines apply to all content on our service,” Twitch wrote. “We continue to enforce our rules as consistently as possible, and are actively reviewing content and taking enforcement action where needed."</p><p>As <a href="https://www.404media.co/twitch-quietly-blocked-new-users-from-israel-and-palestine-since-october-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">404 explains</a>, content creators and Israeli media tried to use Twitch’s sign-up flub as evidence of antisemitism, also pointing to the platform’s unbanning of creators Sneako and Fresh &amp; Fit – who <a href="https://x.com/AlexNaivety/status/1847955885961728374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do</a>, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/meeting/house/115561/documents/HHRG-118-IF16-20230328-SD033.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admittedly, suck</a> – and a tongue-in-cheek TwitchCon panel hosted by the Ayyrabs podcast a month ago in which the cast <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/streaming-site-twitch-accused-of-unchecked-antisemitism-anti-israel-bias/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allegedly</a> ranked other content creators on a scale from Arab to Jew, but a) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFZPZxOPbag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actually</a> did not include “Jew” anywhere on their scale, which <a href="https://x.com/fr0gan/status/1847651231432659010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ranked who is allowed to say “habibi,”</a> an Arabic word meaning “my love,” and b) used the scale to poke fun at themselves, critique wider systemic issues like racism, and take shots at Israel – at least, insofar as they were able from inside TwitchCon, whose sponsorship deal with Chevron <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitchcon-2024-protest-chevron-palestine-hilton" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drew pro-Palestinian protests</a> outside the convention center. </p><p>The "habibi" scale was the brainchild of Raffoulticket, a streamer who is Jewish. “[People calling the panel antisemitic] are so fucking racist they don’t realize I’m Jewish,” Raffoulticket <a href="https://x.com/Raffoulticket/status/1847528829532983675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter</a>. “Weaponizing ‘antisemitism’ like this is ANTISEMITIC.”&nbsp;</p><p>Now, following <a href="https://x.com/ADL/status/1848501823100932346" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a conversation</a> with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2024/jan/05/adl-pro-israel-advocacy-zionism-antisemitism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notoriously pro-Israel</a> Anti-Defamation League, Twitch has suspended all five of the streamers from the Ayyrabs TwitchCon panel: Frogan, Denims, Vio, CapriSunnPapi, and Raffoulticket.</p><p>"We appreciate Twitch making the right decision to finally suspend the streamer Frogan for abusing her platform and the TwitchCon event to spread antisemitic vitriol during this time of intense apprehension for the Jewish community," reads <a href="https://x.com/ADL/status/1848501823100932346" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a post from the official ADL account</a> on Twitter.</p><p>Frogan is a Lebanese streamer who has repeatedly been targeted by big names like Ethan “H3H3” Klein, who has claimed that Frogan’s <a href="https://x.com/fr0gan/status/1763751586617332205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anger at Israel</a> and <a href="https://x.com/fr0gan/status/1848179969312051507" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the military industrial complex</a> constitute antisemitism.

                <p>October is full of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/october-is-thankfully-stacked-with-new-horror-games/2900-5825/" data-ref-id="2900-5825">new horror games you can play now</a> or before Halloween comes to a close. Though it won't be among those playable so soon, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/corporeal/" data-ref-id="5000-645589">Corporeal</a> looks creepy enough to stretch spooky season into a future month. The New Zealand-based indie team Cold Out has revealed the paranormal mystery game, which is played using a photo album of real-life people, not in-game renderings.</p><p>The outcome of that choice is a game that feels unnervingly real, at least in this reveal trailer. It reminds me a bit of a Sam Barlow and Half Mermaid game, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/immortality/" data-ref-id="5000-533269">Immortality</a>, mixed with touches of 2012's underrated horror movie, Sinister, in which a writer scrubs through left-behind home movies and photos to piece together his new house's haunted backstory.</p><p>Players will flip through a photo album with analog-inspired interfaces and gameplay, solving non-linear puzzles that uncover the game's mystery of the cursed family at the heart of it all. Though I've likened it to Sinister and Immortality, the team also drew comparisons to Annapurna's Storyteller meets the cult-classic horror movie, Lake Mungo.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og5vPtM3IpQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Og5vPtM3IpQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Corporeal is set in the 1990s, making it the latest in a growing line of projects, particularly spooky ones (I Saw The TV Glow, Long Legs, et al.), that have gone back in time to that era. The nineties nostalgia is in full bloom.</p><p>Corporeal is coming to Steam, though no release date was yet revealed.</p>

                <p>Assassin's Creed Shadows needs a little bit more time in the development oven, but the good news is that you can secure a preorder right now for the official strategy guide that'll be released alongside the game on February 14, 2025. While this is sure to be good news for Assassin's Creed fans who miss collecting physical strategy guides, the even better news is you can preorder the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Assassins-Creed-Shadows-Complete-Collectors/dp/191333015X?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Collector's Edition of the book</a> at a slight discount for just $40.49 (was $45).

These strategy guides have been developed in conjunction with the development team at Ubisoft, and they serve as useful companion pieces that you can consult whenever you find yourself stuck in certain points of the game or looking to gain mastery in every skill tree. While there'll likely be no shortage of online guides to consult, guidebooks like these are nice because they get straight to the point of what you're looking for instead of spending valuable time trying to convince you to like and subscribe to a channel.</p><p>In addition to a spoiler-free overview of all main quests, walkthroughs for secondary objectives, and a comprehensive rundown of the game's inventory, you'll also get a map with detailed annotations revealing the position of all key points of interest and collectibles. This includes landmarks, viewpoints, chests, valuables, loot caches, hideouts, and more, allowing you to get a 100% completion rate in the game more easily.</p><p>Both books have over 400 pages of content, and for the collector's edition, it comes in a premium hardcover format and includes an exclusive additional 32-page section.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Assassins-Creed-Shadows-Complete-Collectors/dp/191333015X?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Assassin's Creed Shadows: The Complete Official Guide (Collector's edition)</a> -- $40.49 ($<strike>45</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Assassins-Creed-Shadows-Complete-Official/dp/1913330168?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Assassin's Creed Shadows: The Complete Official Guide (Standard edition)</a> -- $30</li></ul><hr><p>In addition these guidebooks, there's also an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-art-book-from-dark-horse-will-release-alongside-the-game/1100-6524680/" data-ref-id="1100-6524680">Assassin's Creed Shadows hardcover art book set to release on February 18</a>, which will offer readers a behind-the-scenes look at the game's art direction, development details, and more.</p><p>For more video game walkthrough books, publisher Piggyback has a few comprehensive tomes for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Complete-Official-Expanded/dp/1911015486?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-ZeldaTM-Complete-Official-Collectors/dp/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cyberpunk-2077-Complete-Official-Guide-Collectors/dp/1911015761?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.

            <p>
Delta Force: Hawk Ops, the free-to-play tactical FPS and Call of Duty/Battlefield challenger from publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>, is launching for PC as a global open beta on 5th December this year.
</p>
<p>
The Delta Force series was originally developed by NovaLogic and debuted in 1998; it would go on to spawn eight sequels, with a ninth announced but never released due to NovaLogic's closure in 2016. Last year, however, Tencent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-reviving-delta-force-fps-franchise">announced it was reviving the series</a> for PC, consoles, and mobile, and Delta Force's reboot (developed by the publisher's Timi Studio Group, which also created <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-mobile">Call of Duty: Mobile</a>) has had several alpha playtests since then.
</p>
<p>
And Delta Force is now ready to move to the next stage. Its global open beta (previously referred to as Early Access) is considered to be its "initial release version", featuring full live-service content updates and no more progress resets. Its 5th December arrival also marks the start of its first season, Genesis, which is set to introduce new maps and modes for both its 32-player Havoc Warfare component and Hazard Operations' squad-based PvPvE. There's also talk of a new operator joining the existing seven, new weapons, and a new vehicle.

Tencent's <a href="https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/detail.html?father_content_id=6cc4e588ae1c9a4b55aba70a6f0f9d77a927&amp;content_id=6cc4e588ae1c9a4b55aba70a6f0f9d77a927">FAQ</a> also notes paid content - Battle Passes, weapon appearances, and vehicle appearances are all specifically mentioned - will be available when the open beta goes live, but it insists there'll be "no pay-to-win elements". And looking to the future, new maps, modes, Operators, weapons, and vehicles are all expected to be introduced as the open beta progresses, alongside gameplay enhancements, improved performance, bug fixes, better anti-cheat, and controller support. Delta Force's third element, its Black Hawk Down-inspired single-player campaign, will arrive at an unspecified later date.
</p><p>
Delta Force: Hawk Ops will be available via Tencent's official browser, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2507950/Delta_Force/">Steam</a>, and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/delta-force-acea48">Epic Games Store</a> when it launches into PC open beta on 5th December. PlayStation, Xbox, and mobile releases are all expected at some point in "Q1" 2025.
</p>
<p>
"If Delta Force: Hawk Ops can provide a decent single-player experience, alongside its combination of big multiplayer fireworks and free-roaming tactical engagements," Eurogamer contributor Rick Lane <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delta-force-hawk-ops-has-a-real-shot-at-knocking-call-of-duty-and-battlefield-off-their-perch">wrote in his preview</a> earlier this year, "then Battlefield and Call of Duty could be in for a rather unpleasant surprise.

The company also reiterated it will not be moving forward with its plans of implementing season passes. Consequently, the price of Assassin’s Creed Shadows collector’s edition will be dropping from $280 to $230. The collector's edition will still come with a steelbook, an artbook, a statue, and more. However, there may be additional changes to those products before the final release.</p><p>The report indicates that these late changes may "be inspired by the issues Ubisoft has had thus far maintaining historical accuracy and cultural representation." That was one of the given reasons for the game's delay in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-developers-pushed-for-assassins-creed-shadows-delay-report/1100-6526847/" data-ref-id="1100-6526847">a previous report</a>, in addition to a request from Shadows' developer Ubisoft Quebec to have more time to polish the game before its release.</p><p>Additionally, there's been word that Ubisoft Quebec <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-is-getting-a-co-op-mode-report/1100-6526890/" data-ref-id="1100-6526890">may be adding a co-op mode to Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. Presumably this will allow two players to fight side-by-side as the game's dual protagonists, Naoe and Yasuke. But given the delay of the game, that feature may not be ready by launch.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will hit PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on February 14, 2025.</p>

I’ll let you decide if that’s a good thing or not. Also, just say the words “A Chick-fil-A Original Story” a few times out loud and really marinate in how bad this all is.</p><p>And now, here’s a human being trying to convince you that it’s totally normal and logical that a fast food restaurant that serves chicken sandwiches should also make TV shows for kids. From the press release:</p><p>“Hospitality and fun have always been at the core of the Chick-fil-A family experience, whether inside our Restaurants and play areas, or through our Kids Meals,” said Dustin Britt, executive director of brand strategy. “The Chick-fil-A Play App is a digital extension of that experience and another way we’re reimagining ‘Play’ for our Guests, in a unique way through entertainment that really encourages time together.”<br></p><p>That’s a terrifying amount of buzzwords and nonsense crammed into one paragraph, but it is October, so I guess it’s perfectly spooky. Anyway, if you want to watch any of this stuff or read books approved by Chick-fil-A, the app goes live on Apple and Android on November 18. Enjoy? </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Whenever a brand-new survival horror hits the market, content creators and fans rush to finish it before spoilers wind up online. It’s often a race to the finish. But sometimes, players can’t get enough of the horror genre despite their insistent fear. They want to know how long it takes to complete a game like this. So, here’s what you should know about A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead length!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-to-beat-a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead">How Long to Beat A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead?</h2>



<p>If you want to finish A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, expect to play for approximately 6 to 8 hours total. Most players finish the game in around 7 hours, give or take. However, you can stretch the experience by playing immensely carefully, watching your every step, and reading all the notes scattered throughout the environment for additional backstory. </p>



<p>My first playthrough lasted around eight hours, during which time I immersed myself in the environment instead of playing my usual run-and-gun horror game.</p>



<p>All that said, this is a straightforward, story-based survival horror experience without much side content. Besides a handful of collectibles, the odd note or drawing left behind by another survivor, and some valuable pick-ups scattered about the world, you won’t find much besides a linear path forward.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-multiplayer">Is A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead Multiplayer?</h2>



<p>Of course, a survival horror game with multiplayer would add considerable length to any experience, but sadly, that’s not happening here. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is a single-player game focusing on the story of Alex Taylor, an asthmatic college student doing her best to survive the end of the world. You won’t play co-op or versus in this tale.</p>

While a number of fans guessed ILCA, Next Level, or even a new studio made up of former AlphaDream developers, the actual answer seems to be Acquire, co-developers behind Octopath Traveler.</p><p>We (probably) know this from various screenshots posted from one of the game's official pages being shared around online, which attributes the copyright to the game to both Nintendo and Acquire. While it's always possible all these images going around are doctored somehow, this is also how we found out that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-really-didnt-want-us-to-know-who-developed-the-super-mario-rpg-remake">Super Mario RPG Remake was made by ArtePiazza</a>, so it's pretty unlikely.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">CONFIRMED: Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership was co-developed by Acquire (Octopath Traveler, Tenchu, Way of the Samurai) <a href="https://t.co/MNZvtqdcPE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/MNZvtqdcPE</a></p>— Nintendeal (@Nintendeal) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendeal/status/1848377416328323547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Acquire is one heck of a storied studio. It's a Japanese company founded waaaay back in 1994 that made its mark with the Tenchu: Stealth Assassins franchise, and has since gone on to make a number of games across several platforms. It was especially productive on the PlayStation Vita and PSP, but its most notable contribution perhaps is as a co-developer on Octopath Traveler and Octopath Traveler 2. Over the years it's been acquired by GungHo Online Entertainment, which owned it from 2011 until this year, when it was picked up by FromSoftware owned Kadokawa Corporation.</p><p>This year alone, Acquire released Ancient Weapon Holly, C.A.R.D.S RPG: The Misty Battlefield, Scars of Mars, and something called Hookah Haze. It also co-developed Amedama and All in Abyss: Judge the Fake.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Given Acquire's track record, especially with Octopath Traveler, the news about Acquire's work on Brothership is being received fairly well, although with some surprise. This is Acquire's first time developing a first-party Nintendo title, and it's interesting to see Nintendo branching out to even more external developers beyond its usual stable of Game Freak, DeNA, Grezzo, Camelot, Next Level, Good-Feel, ArtePiazza, Intelligent, and others. </p><p>That said, it remains very weird that we have to play these goofy games of checking French copyright info to see who makes Nintendo's biggest annual titles. We did it with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-really-didnt-want-us-to-know-who-developed-the-super-mario-rpg-remake">Super Mario RPG Remake</a>, we did it with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-interview-reveals-host-of-new-details-including-confirmation-of-series-first-woman-director">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/princess-peach-showtimes-director-developer-have-finally-been-revealed">Princess Peach: Showtime</a>, we even dealt with something like this when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-wonder-mick-wingert-nintendo">Mario got a new voice actor</a>. Just tell us upfront who the devs are, Nintendo! We promise we won't get mad.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social.

Wukong physical edition listings currently have placeholder dates, but we'll update this article once an official release date is revealed.</p><p>Developed by Chinese game studio GameScience, Black Myth: Wukong is a fast-paced action-RPG game inspired by the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-the-novel-that-inspired-black-myth-wukong-and-dragon-ball/1100-6525794/" data-ref-id="1100-6525794">classic Chinese novel Journey to the West</a>. As The Destined One, players have to navigate a dangerous world full of mythical monsters.</p><p>"It's not uncommon to go from one boss fight into another and then another, and it's in these elaborate battles where Black Myth: Wukong shines," Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's 8/10 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-monkey-business/1900-6418269/" data-ref-id="1900-6418269">Black Myth: Wukong review</a>. The moments in between, however, aren't quite as strong, sometimes devolving into aimless tedium. But its satisfying combat and unique variety of boss fights mostly manages to overcome these flaws."</p><p>The release date for the upcoming Xbox Series X|S version of Black Myth: Wukong hasn't been announced yet, although this is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-isnt-on-xbox-yet-due-to-sony-exclusivity-deal-report/1100-6526196/" data-ref-id="1100-6526196">reportedly due to a non-publicized exclusivity clause</a> between Sony and GameScience.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2765" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6527290 - Black Myth Wukong PC Controller (for PS5 physical preorder guide)" data-collection="" title="6527290 - Black Myth Wukong PC Controller (for PS5 physical preorder guide)">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-PC-Joysticks-Remappable/dp/B0DB4LXDP7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-PC-Joysticks-Remappable\/dp\/B0DB4LXDP7?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-PC-Joysticks-Remappable/dp/B0DB4LXDP7?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Black Myth: Wukong 8BitDo Ultimate 2C Controllers for PC</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-PC-Joysticks-Remappable/dp/B0DB4LXDP7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-PC-Joysticks-Remappable\/dp\/B0DB4LXDP7?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-PC-Joysticks-Remappable/dp/B0DB4LXDP7?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$35 for wireless | $25 for wired</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Meanwhile, PC gamers looking to master a fresh run in the game can get their hands on an 8BitDo Black Myth: Wukong-themed controller. Available in budget-friendly <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-PC-Joysticks-Remappable/dp/B0DB4LXDP7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wireless</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-PC-Joysticks-Remappable/dp/B0DB4NRTBP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wired</a> editions, the controller is part of an official collaboration with GameScience and is based on 8BitDo's Ultimate 2C model.</p><p>Externally, it has a transparent shell decorated with emblems and art from Black Myth: Wukong, and internally, it has the same look and feel of an 8BitDo Ultimate 2C controller.</p><p>This means you're getting durable Hall Effect joysticks and triggers, a turbo button, and an extra pair of remappable shoulder buttons that can be programmed on the fly without an app. It's worth noting that the Ultimate 2C, as the budget option in the Ultimate lineup, isn't compatible with 8BitDo's customization app.</p><p>If you like the look of the 8BitDo Ultimate 2C but want a higher-end model, you can forgo the Wukong-themed design in favor of one of 8BitDo's other Ultimate controllers.</p><p>The original 8BitDo Ultimate Wireless and 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller can be synced to the official Ultimate software on PC or mobile to adjust stick and trigger sensitivity, set up custom profiles and macros, create stick deadzones, and more. Both controllers have remappable back buttons rather than shoulder buttons, three custom profiles, rumble support, and come bundled with a charging dock. They support the same platforms as the Ultimate 2C--PC, Steam Deck, Mac, mobile--and the Ultimate Bluetooth also works on Nintendo Switch.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Charging-Gaming-Console/dp/B0B9BDMWWN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller is available for $54 (was $60)</a> at Amazon, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC/dp/B0CX3YXZ8Z?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate 2.4GHz Wireless Controller is on sale for $45 (was $50)</a>.</p><p>There's also the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Joysticks-Controller-Charging-Wireless-PC/dp/B0D3HBXFGQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate 3-Mode Xbox Controller</a>. If you're planning on getting Wukong for Xbox and also game on PC, this officially licensed controller is available for $63 (was $70). The "3-Mode" aspect is what's a bit confusing here, as it works via Bluetooth on mobile devices, wirelessly with a 2.4GHz dongle on PC, and as a wired controller on Xbox. The 3-Mode controller otherwise has the same advanced features, including support for an Xbox version of the Ultimate software.</p></div>                      </div>
