That number is no doubt in part thanks to the fact that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1237950/STAR_WARS_Battlefront_II/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefront 2 is currently on sale</a> for $4 and is one of Steam's top-selling games. The game is also available on Xbox and PlayStation consoles, though Battlefront 2 doesn't support cross-play between platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefront 2 has been steadily working its way up Steam's most-played games list since early May, when the game first began to climb from its usual player counts of around 1,000-1,500 in April to 5,000 concurrent players and beyond. In late May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-2-is-super-popular-again-on-steam-as-fans-petition-for-a-third-game/1100-6531753/" data-ref-id="1100-6531753">Battlefront 2 broke its previous concurrent-player record</a> on Valve's platform and later peaked at nearly 19,000. Those player counts then dipped back down below 10,000 in subsequent weeks, only to skyrocket once more in the past few days to even higher heights.</p><p dir="ltr">Where, exactly, the huge surge of interest in Battlefront 2 came from eight years after the game's launch is up for debate, but it looks to have begun around the time Andor season 2 concluded on Disney+. The show in large part focuses on the formation of the Rebel Alliance and its struggle against the Empire in the leadup to Rogue One and A New Hope. The show also prominently features the Rebel base on Yavin 4 as a key location--an iconic Star Wars setting that just so happens to be a playable map in Battlefront 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Renewed interest in the Star Wars shooter has translated into calls from Andor <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-andor-actor-joins-calls-for-battlefront-3-as-battlefront-2-popularity-spikes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">actor Muhannad Ben Amor</a> and players for EA to make a Star Wars Battlefront 3. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-expect-star-wars-battlefront-3-anytime-soon-or-ever-despite-recent-surge-in-players/1100-6531786/" data-ref-id="1100-6531786">players shouldn't expect Battlefront 3 anytime soon</a>, as a former DICE producer who worked on Battlefront 2 said it would be "challenging" to bring back the original development team, as they are now "spread far and wide."</p><p dir="ltr">It's been reported previously that despite DICE's two modern <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/despite-the-loot-box-controversy-eas-star-wars-bat/1100-6471006/" data-ref-id="1100-6471006">Battlefront games selling more than 33 million copies combined</a>, EA allegedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-rejected-star-wars-battlefront-3-pitch-report/1100-6498250/" data-ref-id="1100-6498250">rejected a pitch for Battlefront 3 due to licensing costs</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Funcom has announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/dune-awakening-tips-for-surviving-arrakis/">Dune: Awakening</a> has surpassed&nbsp;<strong>1 million copies sold<em>&nbsp;</em></strong>as part of an infographic that includes several statistics about how the game's launch has gone for players. The sales milestone also makes it Funcom's fastest-selling game to date.</p>
<p>According to the infographic, 816,720 players have been swallowed up by Shai-Hulud while surveying 25,529,505 square kilometers of Arrakis and consuming more than 6,110,692,000 grams of spice.</p>
<p>That's all well and good, but the Sleepers of Arrakis are likely happier to hear about the changes coming to the endgame, particularly those who would rather engage with the PvE gameplay in Dune: Awakening, and don't want to be bothered with PvP.</p>
<p>Joel Bylos, creative director of Dune: Awakening at Funcom, released a <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/a-message-from-the-creative-director-on-pve-and-pvp/">statement</a> to players today, beginning by saying, "<em>Our goal is not to force PvE players to interact with a PvP system that they may have no interest in.</em>"</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:3texdztqd4ued4siymm5thqc/app.bsky.feed.post/3lsbtlpe4cc27" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidqbgaaa5jcymkui276dk4nsx2q676sgwze4j43pfsfgjrc5txqeq">
<p lang="en">The Deep Desert is evolving. PvE players will have more space to explore and progress without unwanted conflict. The Landsraad is getting more variety, better pacing, and stronger rewards.Check out the letter from our Creative Director to know more about our plans:bit.ly/Dune_Awakeni...</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3texdztqd4ued4siymm5thqc?ref_src=embed">Dune: Awakening (@duneawakening.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3texdztqd4ued4siymm5thqc/post/3lsbtlpe4cc27?ref_src=embed">2025-06-23T14:54:25.908Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>"<em>We still believe in the core concept of the Deep Desert - an endlessly renewing location that resets every week and creates an activity loop for great rewards. The tension of heading out there, head on a swivel, eyes peeled for foes as you enter the most dangerous part of the most dangerous planet in the universe.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Our wish was that players would embrace this loop, forming guilds to work together to overcome the bleakness of the Deep Desert. But as Stephen King says, 'Wish in one hand, shit in the other, see which one fills up first.' One of my hands is overflowing right now and sadly not with wishes.</em>"</p>
<p>Bylos goes on to describe how there have been many players complaining that their time with Dune: Awakening is ending prematurely, "<em>due to the extremely competitive nature of the Deep Desert</em>." So, beginning "<em>soon</em>," there will be areas of the Deep Desert that are flagged as&nbsp;<strong>Partial Warfare (PvE)</strong>, while the majority of the Deep Desert will still be flagged as&nbsp;<strong>War of Assassins</strong><strong> (PvP</strong><strong>)</strong>.</p>
<p>The new PvE areas of the Deep Desert will allow those solo, PvE-focused players to harvest endgame and T6 resources "<em>without the threat of conflict they may not want</em>."</p>
<p>Bylos still stipulates though that those solo players will still find it to be a grind if they go that route, as the game is "<em>balanced around guilds and groups</em>." He also clarifies that the PvP areas of the Deep Desert will still be where the best resources can be found, and that they will remain "<em>high reward, high risk areas</em>."</p>
<p>Other changes are coming to PvP play, specifically around scout ornithopters. In the next batch of changes, scout ornithopters with rocket launchers attached will have their speed maneuverability reduced, and rockets fired from scout ornithopters will generate more heat.</p>
<p>Scout ornithopters without rocket launchers and equipped with thrusters will have a max speed boost regardless of wings to ensure they remain the fastest ornithopters available, and a T5 infantry rocket launcher will be added "<em>to help improve the dynamics of vehicle/ground combat</em>."</p>
<p>There are also more changes coming to the Landsraad, as Bylos says the team is "<em>addressing some key flaws in the Landsraad design</em>," such as how stockpiling items is currently rewarded, despite that not being the studio's intention with how it wants the Landsraad to function.</p>
<p>Bylos ends his statement asking players to be patient as Funcom works to improve Dune: Awakening and build it in collaboration with players based on their feedback.</p>
<p>"<em>Once a live game launches, it becomes a collaborative effort between the developers and the players to make it something amazing. We appreciate your feedback on what we hope is the beginning of a long journey together. Bear with us - our intention is to be clear and open in our communications and make Dune: Awakening a game that everybody can enjoy</em>."</p>
<p>The reaction from players to everything Bylos talked about in his statement has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1limep2/never_change_reddit/">unsurprisingly mixed</a>. Some think he's taking the game in the entirely wrong direction, and rug-pulling Dune: Awakening into an entirely different game. Others are rejoicing for the changes, thankful that they'll be able to take part in more endgame activities.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Dune: Awakening hasn't even been out for a full month. It'll take time for it to evolve as the meta changes and <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-will-add-more-hagga-basin-like-maps-in-future-dune-awakening-updates-new-pve-content-aimed-to-be-out-every-3-4-months/">new content is introduced</a>. And based on the fact that it has had an undeniably strong launch, it seems like Funcom is going to have the chance to evolve it for years to come.</p>

                <p><i>Batman: Arkham Knight is celebrating its 10-year anniversary today, June 23, 2015. Below, we look at how it raised the bar for not only superhero games, but for the third act in video game trilogies.</i></p><p dir="ltr">There's an old adage that good things come in threes, and that's an idea that applies perfectly to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/batman-arkham-knight/">Batman: Arkham Knight</a>. Rocksteady's final chapter in its Caped Crusader saga turned 10 years old this week, and it's still a masterpiece of superhero action that has stood the test of time. There's a lot to love about the game, from its dark storyline to its shocking twists--the Arkham Knight was a <em>red hood herring</em>--and more, but the lasting legacy of the game is that it solved the problem of video game trilogies a decade ago.</p><p dir="ltr">Here’s a familiar scenario: You fire up the third game in a beloved series, ready to be wowed. It’s good. You're having fun. But you can’t shake the feeling that you’ve done it all before. "More of the same" is a common criticism against video game trilogies' final chapters--but it's one Arkham Knight skillfully sidestepped.</p><p dir="ltr">If Arkham Asylum laid the foundation, then Arkham City was the stately Wayne Manor built atop it--bigger, bolder, and more refined. But by the time Arkham Knight came around, there were fears of fatigue. It followed the release of Batman: Arkham Origins in 2013 by Warner Bros. Montreal, which wasn't part of Rocksteady's trilogy but received considerably less acclaim. Could Rocksteady keep the momentum going?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519184-bak-8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519184" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519184-bak-8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519184"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519184-bak-8.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It did--by pushing every idea of its Batman to the extreme.</p><p dir="ltr">Arkham Knight is a finely tuned power fantasy built on three pillars: detective work, stealth, and bone-crunching combat. One moment you’re reconstructing crime scenes with high-tech forensic tools; the next, you’re a silent predator stalking armed militia; and then you're diving into balletic brawls that stitch gadgets and combos into a brutal symphony of chaos.</p><p dir="ltr">At this stage, Rocksteady trusted players to know how to be Batman. And in return, it gave them the tools to break past the limits of earlier games. Combat flowed with graceful brutality as you weaved through enemies using freeze grenades, shock rounds, and precision counters. In stealth segments, the fear mechanic hit new highs, as nothing quite matched the rush of trapping a squad of militants with a smoke bomb cloud and then quickly eliminating them one by one using new gameplay mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">But the game didn't just empower players--it challenged them. With the Arkham Knight and his private army escalating the threat level, players had to evolve. Rocksteady walked the razor’s edge between power fantasy and overpower fantasy, and never lost its balance along the way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519185-bak-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519185" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519185-bak-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519185"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519185-bak-6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Then there was the Batmobile. What if Batman were a car? That’s the question Rocksteady answered by transforming Gotham’s most iconic vehicle into a game-changing mechanic. Not just a way to move across the city, the Batmobile became an extension of the Dark Knight himself--solving puzzles, charging into battles, and even taking on tanks. There's something surreal and satisfying about sneaking up on Deathstroke’s armored convoy in a 1,200bhp crime-fighting machine that could somehow still meet strict European noise-pollution requirements.</p><p dir="ltr">In the end, Batman: Arkham Knight <em>is </em>more of the same, but pushed to its absolute extreme. It's a fitting finale to the Arkhamverse--especially if you choose to ignore Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League--and a celebration of Batman that still shines a decade later.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519186-bak-12.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519186-bak-12.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519186"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519186-bak-12.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you're looking to grab the game and celebrate its anniversary, then now is a great time to do so. The Arkham Knight Premium Edition regularly sells for an absurdly low price--<a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=10+Years+Ago%2C+Batman%3A+Arkham+Knight+Solved+The+Video+Game+Trilogy+Problem&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-06-23+09%3A55%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-23+09%3A55%3A18&amp;fnarticle_id=6532637&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=Features&amp;fntype3=Standard+Feature&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fbatman_arkham_knight_premium_edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2F10-years-ago-batman-arkham-knight-solved-the-video-game-trilogy-problem%2F1100-6532637%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">GOG has a DRM-free version for just $6</a> as part of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gog-summer-game-sale-2025-best-deals/1100-6532543/">2025 Summer Sale</a>--and it's incredibly good value for money. Not only do you get the base game, but there’s a Batcave of DLC to dig into that ranges from challenge maps to standalone episodes focusing on Nightwing, Robin, Batgirl, Red Hood, Catwoman, and Harley Quinn.</p><p dir="ltr">If you've picked up a Switch 2, the game has also been substantially improved on the Nintendo platform as part of the Arkham Trilogy.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoE41LJyXh0"> According to Digital Foundry</a>, it's not entirely perfect, but it does run at a locked and mostly stable 30fps when compared to the sluggish performance on the original Switch.</p>

<p>The numbers were accidentally included on the company's latest fiscal report and have since been swiftly removed, but not before fans shared the numbers on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-sammy-fiscal-report-mishap-reveals-sales-numbers-for-a-dozen-titles-lad-iw-1-66m-p3r-2-07m-sonic-frontiers-4-57m-p5r-7-25m-and-more.1224501/">ResetEra</a>.</p>
<p>Total sales of Sonic Frontiers were 4.57m, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-superstars">Sonic Superstars</a> was 2.43m, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-sonic-racing">Team Sonic Racing</a> was 3.5m.

<p>Elsewhere in the leak, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-royal">Persona 5 Royal</a> has sold 7.25m units - as expected - while Persona 3 Reload just 2.07m units. Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth sold 1.66m units, and Like A Dragon: The Man Who Erased His Name just 960,000.</p>
<p>Sega also officially revealed Metaphor: ReFantazio sold 2m units.</p>
<p>The company critically had a great year in 2024. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> was well received by series fans, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-review">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> was an outstanding new RPG, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> was one of the best-reviewed Sonic games in recent memory. But this reception seemingly hasn't translated to strong sales.</p>
<p>Still, the figure for Sonic Frontiers does stand out. Released back in 2022, it proves the game has had a long sales tail - even if that's been spurred on by discounts. And, as the pre-eminent 3D game in the series, its sales have continued alongside both the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and 3 films.</p>
<p>Back in November 2022, Sonic Team head <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-frontiers-is-cornerstone-of-future-sonic-games-says-sonic-team-head">Takashi Iizuka stated Sonic Frontiers' open zone design was the "cornerstone of future Sonic games"</a>. There will be high hopes, then, for its presumed sequel.</p>
<p>Sonic Frontiers established the "open zone" design (rather than open world), which emphasised exploration as well as speed and took advantage of current hardware technology (despite its egregious pop-in).</p>
<p>Sonic Superstars, released a year later, has just over half the sales of Sonic Frontiers. A 2D game, it perhaps didn't sit well with fans after the forward-thinking Frontiers.</p>
<p>As for Sonic X Shadow Generations, it has sold well since its release last year, spurred on by the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film. However, it's still a remake of an older game. And it seems, as much as Sega trades in nostalgia, it's the open zone advancement in design that fans have responded to with their wallets.</p>
<p>The fact Team Sonic Racing has outsold more traditional platformers also bodes well for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-might-be-the-most-mechanically-rich-kart-racer-ever-made-hands-on">forthcoming Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>.</p>
<p>In short, Team Sonic is heading in the right direction, and expectations will be high for the original game that follows Sonic Frontiers.</p>
<p>As Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-ago-we-were-fighting-to-survive-its-totally-different-now-segas-franchise-guru-on-sonics-redemption-arc">discussed with Iizuka recently</a>, Sonic has gone from "fighting to survive" to a global megastar in the past 10 years.</p>
<p>"When I moved over from Tokyo to Los Angeles, it was like an ‘oh my god' moment," Iizuka said. "Like, we need to save the brand, or this brand isn't going to be around for much longer."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-leaked-sales-figures-show-sonics-new-frontier-is-heading-in-the-right-direction]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Good news if you've been a bit frustrated with how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> handles PvE and PvP, specifically in terms of its treacherous Deep Desert. The game's creative director Joel Bylos has announced some changes coming in response to player feedback on both those and the Landsraad.</p>
<p>Basically, it looks like Funcom have switched up their plans to take the concerns folks have cited into account, aiming for a nice compromise between the original ideas and the practicalities of what's been happening since the game dropped in full.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/a-message-from-the-creative-director-on-pve-and-pvp/">lengthy letter</a> to DA players, Bylos wrote that while the devs still believe their core concept of the Deep Desert as a dangerous, constantly changing place you go to get the rarest stuff, they're not aiming to force PvE enjoyers to engage with PvP just to get the good stuff.</p>
<p>So, to ensure those folks don't get locked out of the endgame, the director revealed that "starting soon, some areas of the Deep Desert will now be flagged as 'Partial Warfare (PvE)' areas where players will be able to explore testing stations and harvest T6 resources without the threat of conflict they may not want". The likes of "Landsraad control points, shipwrecks and the largest spice fields" will stay as PvP areas, to preserve the biggest rewards coming with the biggest risk.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We’ve been listening.</p><p>The Deep Desert is evolving. PvE players will have more space to explore and progress without unwanted conflict. The Landsraad is getting more variety, better pacing, and stronger rewards.</p><p>Check out the letter from our Creative Director to know more about… <a href="https://t.co/ZbHKgEBDwk">pic.twitter.com/ZbHKgEBDwk</a></p></div>— Dune: Awakening (@DuneAwakening) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuneAwakening/status/1937161730649452781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Speaking of PvP, Bylos wrote that the devs are "planning to make more changes to the Deep Desert to accommodate ground battles and reinforce the use of player builds", outlining some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-will-get-a-big-update-in-early-july-and-funcom-have-a-three-pronged-plan-to-improve-deep-desert-pvp">already incoming scout ornithopter tweaks</a> designed to help ensure air superiority isn't the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-players-kept-getting-squashed-by-ornithopters-so-an-update-has-made-everyone-invulnerable-to-vehicle-bashing">be all and end all</a>. There'll also be "additional changes to mechanics like respawn timers, vehicle storage tools, hand scanners, and other mechanics that we see being abused in the Deep Desert".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Funcom are aiming to address some "key flaws" in the Landsraad that folks have cited. These include problems with tasks being turned in very quickly, and folks being able to do nothing with them once they're completed. "Stockpiling is currently rewarded, but that is not our intention for this system, and we will make some changes to address it as best we can," the director wrote, adding that the system will also be "updated to provide micro rewards for solo/small group players".</p>
<p>It's nice to see the devs finding a way to balance their vision for DA with making the changes folks want. Judging by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1liirqh/a_message_from_the_creative_director_on_pve_and/">the socials</a>, the worm lovers who've been doin' the Dune are glad to see these steps are being taken, even if there's no concrete timeline on a lot of them at this point.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-deep-desert-is-getting-partial-warfare-pve-areas-so-you-can-gather-endgame-resources-without-being-pvped-to-death]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It's, uh, <em>hot</em> out. Hot enough that one shouldn't be outside. Hot enough that we're not streaming on Tuesday because Rob's afraid he would begin to melt. I kept telling my children they needed to hustle out the door this morning a few minutes earlier than usual, because every second that passed was a chance for the temperature to rise before I had a chance to mow the lawn. (It was still hot, but mustering all my fatherly energy, I got the job done. 💪) I also installed the father's gift I got a few weeks back: <a href="https://poolhacker.com/products/poolside-bar-for-aboveground-pool?ref=remapradio.com">a poolside bar attachment for our above ground pool</a>. I'm going to put it to good use almost immediately, folks. But if I enter that pool in 100-degree weather, I might not leave it, either.</p><p>-pk, who's now browsing all sorts of other goofy pool accessories</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>SGF Interviews [Part 2]</em> – At the end of the day, reporting is what makes me enjoy this job the most. It's one of those things I need to figure out with <em>Remap</em>'s future: how can I find ways to fuse this with <em>Remap</em>'s day-to-day more often? The bandwidth to do long articles isn't really there, but I'd like to find a format that's beyond me chatting with developers at the few events that I make it to every year. I've long kicked around doing a more timely interview-y show that was focused on a topic, i.e. an hour podcast talking with a Monster Hunter expert when <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> comes out. (That idea came to mind because of <em>Death Stranding 2</em> reviews hitting. How do we cover, or find our way into, games we're not all playing? We know lots of people.)</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>FGC: Firebreak</em> – We're skipping a Tuesday stream because of the heat wave that's moving through the Midwest and East Coast. My house can manage those temperatures pretty well but that's not the case in Rob's spot, which turns into a sauna. Playing a Remedy game in a literal sauna would be kinda funny, but we'd also like Rob to still be with us after the stream was over.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Wheel of GeForce NOW</em> – I think this is our last one in this batch? I'm not sure how much I'll be around for this one, because I'm prepping for a long drive for a family reunion that day. I'll try to pop my head in, though.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series</em> – I've had a pretty good idea where these were going the last few weeks, but that's just not true this week. In this essay, I will tell you what it's like to melt in the heat.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio </em>– Been really enjoying our podcasts lately, feels like we've been in a real groove. Hope you've been enjoying them, too. (There's a chance I'm missing next week, which would be funny, because it's the 100th episode of the podcast. I also missed the <em>first</em> episode while attending SGF. Alas!)</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

He plays <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694">Gustave, the swordsman and gunslinger</a></span>, the first playable character you inhabit in the RPG. Notably, Cox hasn’t been that present in promoting the game, with Starr, English, and others in the cast making more appearances in trailers and panels. This isn’t too surprising, as Cox has been a bit preoccupied with his role in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/daredevil-born-again-disney-marvel-news-1851714637&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/daredevil-born-again-disney-marvel-news-1851714637"><em>Daredevil: Born Again</em></a></span>, but as <em>Clair Obscur </em>has risen in popularity, it seems Cox has been caught off guard by all the hype.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197586" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="128" data-playlist="197586,197585,197583" data-current="197586"><div><p>Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23107.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This weekend, Cox was a guest at the Washington State Summer Con in Puyallup, where he took part in a <em>Daredevil </em>panel alongside co-stars Elden Henson, Vincent D’Onofrio, and Wilson Bethel. While the group primarily talked about their time in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Cox was asked about his work on <em>Clair Obscur</em>.t The actor admitted he hasn’t actually played the game himself, and seemed a bit frazzled talking about the game, given his knowledge of it is limited to the four hours he spent in the booth recording Gustave’s dialogue.</p><p>“I don’t mean to minimize it in any way, and it’s so cool [that] apparently the game’s awesome,” Cox said to the audience. “I’m not a gamer. I have no idea. I haven’t played it. My agent asked me if I wanted to go and do a voiceover. I was in the studio for four hours, maybe? People keep saying how amazing it is and ‘congratulations,’ and I feel like a total fraud. But I’m so thrilled for the company, and I’m so thrilled it did really well. That was it. Just FYI. Ask someone else a question, I feel uncomfortable.”</p><p>It was an endearing moment. Sometimes, a voice acting role is just something you hop into a booth for one day, and it doesn’t become a months-long gig. Given how quickly Cox was in and out, it’s amazing his performance is as good as it is. Gustave is one of the most endearing characters in <em>Clair Obscur</em>, with a ton of emotional range. Cox may be surprised that Sandfall Interactive’s RPG has blown up the way it has, but I hope he also realizes how much his character played a part in its success. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-charlie-cox-gustave-voice-1851784940]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The veil shrouding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>'s upcoming Midnight expansion is set to be lifted at Gamescom 2025, with Blizzard confirming news and updates at the show about the next chapter in the game's Worldsoul Saga trilogy.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard announced fans can expect "exclusive news and updates" about Midnight "directly from the development team, along with a few additional surprises" during the five-day show in Cologne, Germany that runs August 20-24.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CE8zcDHcMA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2CE8zcDHcMA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It isn't much to go on, but Blizzard has in recent years used Gamescom for major announcements. Blizzard revealed the release date for the game's current The War Within expansion at Gamescom 2024 as part of an Xbox showcase, for example. While it's still unclear if Midnight will be released this year, it wouldn't be surprising if Blizzard gave it a definitive release date at the show.</p><p dir="ltr">Not much is currently known about Midnight. Blizzard announced an entire <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-next-three-expansions-revealed-all-at-once-including-2024-the-war-within/1100-6518914/" data-ref-id="1100-6518914">trilogy of expansions back at BlizzCon 2023</a>, including Midnight, but only revealed a handful of details about what the expansions beyond The War Within would entail. In Midnight's case, it will see players revisit the homeland of the Blood Elves, Quel'thalas, as they look to stop the forces of the Void from claiming the Sunwell.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the "additional surprises" Blizzard has in store, it's hard to imagine more information about player housing, and a possible release date for the feature, aren't among them. Player housing is easily the most anticipated feature in the MMORPG's 20-year-history, and Blizzard has already teased that it will be coming ahead of Midnight proper, either as part of the expansion's pre-patch update or possibly even sooner. We came away impressed after a recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/" data-ref-id="1100-6531566">hands-on preview of WoW's player housing</a> decoration tools, stating that even the early test version we played felt loaded with endless possibilities.</p><p dir="ltr">There is still plenty to tide WoW players over in the meantime. Blizzard recently revealed what's coming in The War Within's major 11.2 update, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-ghosts-of-karesh-update-is-the-tbc-sequel-we-didnt-know-we-needed/1100-6532500/" data-ref-id="1100-6532500">Ghosts of K'aresh</a>. The update will introduce the largest raid boss in WoW history as well as asynchronous multiplayer features for Delves that definitely feel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-next-major-update-will-add-one-of-dark-souls-most-innovative-features/1100-6532496/" data-ref-id="1100-6532496">inspired by From Software's Dark Souls series</a>. Players are additionally convinced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-are-convinced-a-new-way-to-play-demon-hunter-is-coming-soon/1100-6532569/" data-ref-id="1100-6532569">Blizzard is teasing a new Demon Hunter specialization</a>--one that could also make for a nice Gamescom surprise.</p>

Now, Xbox Insiders can get the first look at how that might work on the dedicated handheld devices when they launch later this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Revealed in a new <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/23/xbox-insiders-aggregated-gaming-library-is-coming-to-the-xbox-pc-app/"><em>Xbox Wire</em> blog post</a>, Xbox Insiders enrolled in the PC Gaming Preview can get the first look at the "aggregated gaming library" in the Xbox PC app for Windows 11 computers and handheld devices starting this week. Microsoft says this new library feature will be available this holiday with the Xbox Ally devices. With this feature, users will see their Xbox library, available Game Pass titles, and "all your installed games from other PC game stores" in the aggregated library.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIVmyOIV1MQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIVmyOIV1MQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>That means games from Xbox, Game Pass, Battle.net, and other leading PC storefronts like Steam can be found and launched from this <span>single library within the Xbox PC app. "Whether you're on a Windows PC or a handheld device, your Xbox library, hundreds of Game Pass titles, and all your installed games from leading PC storefronts will now be at your fingertips," the blog post reads. "When a player installs a game from a supported PC storefront, it will automatically appear in 'My library' within the Xbox PC app, as well as the 'Most recent' list of titles in the sidebar – making it easier than ever to jump back into your games."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>To access this aggregated library, Microsoft says, "As long as you have game titles from supported PC stores, you should see them listed in both My Library and the Most Recent section."

Despite only earning $44 million globally after its first weekend and being called a bomb or flop by many online, the animated rom-com kept on earning money. By the end of its run, thanks largely to positive word of mouth and solid reviews, <em>Elemental </em>earned $496 million globally. That could happen with <em>Elio</em>, too. The movie is receiving rave reviews from both audiences and critics. However, <em>Elio</em> does have to compete with the live-action <em>How To Train Your Dragon</em> film, which was the number one film at the box office over the weekend for a second week in a row, so it might struggle to turn things around. We shall see. </p><h2 id="h284"><a id=""></a>Pixar might be forced to crank out sequels</h2><p>Regardless of what happens, <em>Elio </em>and <em>Elemental’s </em>lackluster opening weekend likely isn’t good for Pixar. While the studio can still produce big box office hits, like 2024's <em>Inside Out 2</em> and 2019's <em>Toy Story 4,</em> a problematic pattern is forming.</p><p>It appears Pixar is struggling to create new, original hit films that blow up and become pop culture icons like <em>The Incredibles </em>or <em>Monsters Inc</em>. If Disney sees sequels as solid money earners and original films, like <em>Elio</em>, as risky bets that have to rely on long theatrical runs to become profitable, it could lead to the Mickey Mouse empire changing up Pixar’s output. The studio might become entirely focused on sequels, with its few original projects sent to Disney+ to appease the content gods. It would be a sad fate for a studio that once had one of the best original film track records in Hollywood. And this seems to already be happening, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pixar_films&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pixar_films" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with only two of Pixar’s six announced movies being original projects</a></span>.</p><p>But in 2025, it really does seem like kids want stuff they know, l<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-box-office-opening-weekend-300-million-1851775046&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-box-office-opening-weekend-300-million-1851775046">ike <em>Minecraft </em>and live-action remakes</a></span>, and aren’t screaming to see original animated movies. <em>Or </em>their parents don’t want to risk spending $20+ on seeing a new movie, instead bringing their kids to Hollywood’s latest reheated leftovers. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/elio-worst-box-office-bad-pixar-disney-dragon-weekend-1851784926]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The layoff process has begun at MindsEye developer Build A Rocket Boy, according to a new report. This follows an absolutely disastrous launch for the studio's first title, which is currently the worst-reviewed game of 2025.</p><p>A source at Build a Rocket Boy <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">told IGN</a> that the company has begun the 45-day consultation process required by UK law prior to layoffs. A specific number of affected developers has not been revealed, but IGN points out that the UK law in question only applies when an employer is going to make 100 or more redundancies at their company within a 90-day period. IGN estimates that Build a Rocket Boy has around 500 employees worldwide, with 300 of them in the UK. Build a Rocket Boy has not publicly commented on the layoffs yet.</p><p>Build a Rocket Boy is a studio founded by Leslie Benzies, a former Rockstar Games producer and executive who left the studio between the launches of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v/" data-ref-id="5000-108839">Grand Theft Auto V</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2/" data-ref-id="5000-458780">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>. Benzies founded Build a Rocket Boy and announced a Metaverse-like project called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/everywhere-build-a-rocket-boy/" data-ref-id="5000-570874">Everywhere</a> in 2021. Ultimately, MindsEye was the first game to be released by the studio. It's a sci-fi narrative-driven third-person shooter, but was also meant to have a tail of live-service support that would allow both the developers and players to create new content for MindsEye.</p><p>When MindsEye did eventually come out, it was ravaged by customers and reviewers alike. The game currently sits at an <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggregate score of 38</a> on sister site Metacritic. Players have complained about rampant bugs, performance problems, and design issues. While Build a Rocket Boy has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-dev-outlines-what-its-doing-to-try-to-fix-the-game/1100-6532388/" data-ref-id="1100-6532388">committed to fixing the game</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/worst-reviewed-game-of-2025-gets-an-update-to-address-some-of-its-issues/1100-6532547/" data-ref-id="1100-6532547">released an update</a> resolving some issues last week, it looks like it might have fewer people to help do so.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mindseye-review/1900-6418374/" data-ref-id="1900-6418374">GameSpot gave MindsEye a 3/10</a>. "As it is, issues like broken AI and uneven car physics simply exacerbate the problems with its archaic and insipid design," reviewer Richard Wakeling explains. "Impressive visuals can't compensate for a lack of substance, whether that comes from its pointless world, tedious combat, or any number of other egregious shortcomings."</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Black Ops 7</a> teaser comes from an old YouTube channel that longtime fans will remember from Black Ops 2's marketing campaign. The video is only a 14-second teaser, but it's already creating some speculation about Black Ops 7's storyline.</p><p dir="ltr">Twelve years ago, Treyarch and Activision used an entirely separate YouTube channel from the official Call of Duty account to help promote Black Ops 2. Using the "Cordis Die" channel, a brief seven-second clip was posted, which featured a short message from the game's main antagonist, Raul Menendez. The video was titled "<a href="https://youtu.be/__F0okDFRDQ?si=-6VwVPewWBtCeZYs" rel="nofollow ">New World</a>," and while the screen remained black, there was one line of audio. "Come my friends; it's not too late to seek a New World," Menendez said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chBF_rFHSCQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/chBF_rFHSCQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This was the only video ever shared on the Cordis Die YouTube channel until a few days ago. On June 20, a second video titled "<a href="https://youtu.be/chBF_rFHSCQ?si=KPKPfK7t7lKksanT" rel="nofollow ">The Lesson</a>" was posted, and this new teaser features a man standing in front of several TV screens. While we only see the character from the back, it's presumed to be Raul Menendez with a new message. "2025 was just the beginning. A necessary first step. Once again, you shall know fear," Menendez says.</p><p dir="ltr">So, what does this tease mean for Black Ops 7? Fans are already left speculating if Menendez is going to be an antagonist in the flesh or if he'll be an enemy inside David Mason's mind.</p><p dir="ltr">In the initial <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-announced-marks-first-back-to-back-black-ops-release-eve/1100-6532238/">Black Ops 7 reveal trailer</a>, the story seems to suggest that David Mason might be hallucinating his confrontation with Menendez or is inside of some kind of AI simulation. The new Cordis Die trailer might suggest otherwise, with Menendez watching footage of war and chaos seemingly caused after the events of Black Ops 2's ending.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 2 had two potential endings, with Menendez either living or dying based on player choice. The canonical ending is supposed to be the player killing the antagonist, so Menendez is likely still dead in Black Ops 7, making the more likely theory that the character is only inside David Mason's mind.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Activision has described Black Ops 7's story as the "most mind-bending" ever, and teased that the "world is on the brink of chaos, ravaged by violent conflict and psychological warfare." The game's tagline is also "Embrace the madness."</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, we won't know the full story until the game releases. Black Ops 7 launches later this year for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. Activision hasn't announced a specific release date, but the game's full reveal is coming later this summer.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a> has passed one million sales, making it the best performing Funcom game ever.</p>
<p>Just 18 days since the early adopter launch, the game has managed to do what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/conan-exiles">Conan Exiles</a> took a year to achieve. Even now, the game is pulling in roughly 175,000 concurrent player peaks.</p>
<p>In an infographic released alongside the milestone announcement it's been revealed players have been eaten by worms 816,720 times, 628,807 deaths have occurred in the game's endgame PvP Deep Desert, and 121,941 guilds have been formed among other interesting tidbits</p>

<p>The game kicked off to a mighty start and has shown little sign of losing momentum. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-hits-142000-concurrent-players-during-full-launch-smashing-past-record">blasted past 142,000 concurrent players on 10th June following its public release</a>. There's been a little bit of controversy via the PvP Deep Desert, as many players aren't finding the fun in perilous free-for-alls. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-changes-next-update">The director initially stood firm on the direction of the endgame</a>, but has earlier today announced plans to expand the PvE portion of this region.</p>
<p>Alongside this future change to the Deep Desert, hints at what future major content updates will look like have also been revealed. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-new-maps-hagga-basin">We know every three-to-four months a Hagga-Basin-style map should be added</a>, which should do wonders for the crowd who like popping back in to play every once in a while.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Virtual reality superbike sim VRider SBK is coming to PSVR 2 this week on the 27th June. This is an upgraded and enhanced version of the game already available on Meta Quest and Pico standalone platforms, and is also coming to to SteamVR sometime soon.</p>
<p><iframe title="VRider SBK - Release Date Announcement Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OASWt2XLsMQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>VRiders SBK does what it says on the tin, translating superbike racing into VR, having your twist and tilt your hands and arms while embodying a racer. This is intended to be a ‘simcade’ experience, making the most of the Superbike World Championship license.</p>
<p>The game features 14 real-world tracks, now including Cremona and Estoril, and lets you race on five bikes from Ducati, BMW, Kawasaki, Honda, and Yamaha. In addition to a solo Tournament mode and Ghost races against the clock.</p>
<p>With the PSVR 2 version of the game compared to the standalone headset game, Funny Tales has been able to improve the bike modelling, animate the skybox, feature more realistic tarmac, animated crowds, greater trackside detail and more. Additionally, there can be up to 22 AI racers on track in single-player.</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart world 'bug'" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a026f2d866e19/mario-kart-world-bug.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Whilst most of us gamers will make do with cheering loudly to ourselves when we (accidentally) come first in an online race in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, or <em>maybe</em> have an extra spoon of delicious Gamer Gruel™ as a reward for getting gold in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-world-how-to-unlock-mirror-mode">Mirror Mode</a>, some others prefer to...well, they prefer to break things then call 'em broken. A damn fine tradition.</p>
<p>And so it is with the clip you can see below, showing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Icy-ConcentrationC/">Icy-ConcentrationC</a> managing to bug the game out in a fun way, by using the rewind feature to line up a very specific jump off the game's Mario Circuit track via safety barriers located on one of the main stadium's turns.</p>
<p>The result is fairly spectacular as these things go:</p>

<p>To break things down, jumping into Free Roam mode, they've used a mushroom to boost across the dirt trap in front of the barriers, then combined that with a jump boost from the top of the barrier with a feather jump at the apex of the boost. This sequence, it seems, breaks you free of gravity for a while (at least if you're Rosalina riding a pipe-framed kart doing exactly what the video shows) and results in a very floaty princess indeed.</p>
<p>Of course, while the poster suggests the game is broken, this is very much a case of pushing and prodding in a specific way to force a problem, rather than any sort of real or problematic bug, per see.</p>
<p>Indeed, this very writer has just spent a few moments trying this stunt in the game and, alas, isn't skilled enough to make it work, apparently. But please do let us know if you can do it as is shown above!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Build a Rocket Boy, the studio behind the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=9">worst-reviewed game of 2025 so far</a>, MindsEye, has reportedly begun the process of enacting mass layoffs, which could impact at least 100 employees.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say">IGN</a>, a source tells them that it's unclear how many employees will be let go, but the studio began a 45-day consultation period today, on June 23.</p>
<p>Build a Rocket Boy has a main studio based in Edinburgh, Scotland, and under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/redundancy-your-rights/consultation">UK law</a>, the 45-day consultation begins when a company plans "<em>100 or more redundancies.</em>" IGN adds that Build a Rocket Boy has approximately 300 employees in the UK and another 200 outside the UK. If only 100 people are let go, that's still one-fifth of the studio gone.</p>
<p>To say that MindsEye's launch has gone badly would be an understatement. There were a number of signs before the game launched that things wouldn't be great, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aob_eBUBwNU">unenthusiastic previews from content creators</a>, negative <a href="https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Build-a-Rocket-Boy-Reviews-E2397452.htm?filter.iso3Language=eng">Glassdoor</a> reviews from former and current staff that described a studio with deep internal turmoil, claims from one of the co-chief executive officers that there was someone paying people to <em>"<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments">trash the game and the</a></em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments"> <em>studio</em>,"</a> and two seemingly prescient <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">chief executives who departed the studio a week before</a> the game launched.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-releases-statement-warning-a-major-day-one-patch-will-be-missing-from-mindseye-physical-copies-after-early-copies-appear-in-the-wild/">physical copies of the game were out ahead of launch</a>, with retail stores breaking MindsEye's street date, and Build a Rocket Boy releasing a statement warning players that those copies were missing "<em>a major</em>" day-one patch, though it wasn't exactly convincing that the patch would fix the issues MindsEye has.</p>
<p>All of this made it no surprise that when MindsEye did eventually launch on June 10, it did so in a broken state. High-end PCs struggled to run the game at all <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-unreal-engine-5-gpu-destroyer/">due to its technical issues</a>, while players on PS5<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/"> began requesting (and getting) refunds from PlayStation</a> due to the game's poor performance and false advertising, as it was claimed ahead of launch that MindsEye would run at 60 FPS on PS5 Pro. On all consoles, MindsEye is currently capped at 30 FPS.</p>
<p>Two days after the official launch date, the studio published a statement that it was "<em>heartbroken</em>" with how the launch had gone, seeing all the issues players were<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEye/comments/1lgs7j6/even_more_awful_hilarious_and_absolutely/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"> reporting</a> and the negative feedback the game had received. It promised a series of fixes, two of which have already been released, though even after those hotfixes went live, the technical testing wizards at Digital Foundry reported that MindsEye has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-mindseye-has-abject-technical-performance-even-after-its-latest-patch">"<em>abject technical performance</em>,"</a> even with the latest patch.</p>
<p><iframe title="MindsEye - How Bad Does It Get? - PS5/Pro/Xbox Series X|S DF Tech Review" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fw_hsVgdfE0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Build a Rocket Boy has yet to comment on the layoff reports, or release a new statement beyond its latest hotfix last week. The studio did also deny that it was <a href="https://x.com/buildarocketboy/status/1935040621124972727">using bots to reply positively to negative reviews</a>, a claim that was brought up after a few people online noticed some similar wording in posts claiming that MindsEye gave players <a href="https://x.com/MckKirk/status/1934880019353928189">"<em>goosebumps,</em>"</a> or that they had<a href="https://x.com/MikeChannell/status/1934689743574344094"> only experienced a few bugs, and that the game reminded them of Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>It's unclear where MindsEye sits in the sales charts, but with layoffs already on the table, it's likely that it underperformed, to say the least, which brings into question whether Build a Rocket Boy will deliver on any of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">post-launch plans for MindsEye</a>.</p>
<p>MindsEye's poor launch also brings into question what will happen with what was supposed to be Build a Rocket Boy's flagship product, <a href="https://wccftech.com/everywhere-a-new-game-by-ex-gta-producer-revealed-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2022/">Everywhere</a>. MindsEye was originally billed as a premium experience players <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-everywhere-gta-producer-leslie-benzies-teaser-new-details/">could play within Everywhere</a>, which itself is meant to be this massive platform through which players could make their own creations and play games made by Build a Rocket Boy, similar to what Epic has built with Fortnite.</p>
<p>That plan was later changed, with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hitman-maker-io-interactive-teams-with-build-a-rocket-boy-to-publish-mindseye/">MindsEye being a standalone release</a>, and Build a Rocket Boy having to put out a statement that Everywhere had not been "<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-future-of-gta-producers-everywhere-is-in-doubt-as-mindseye-adopts-its-creation-suite/"><em>abandoned</em></a>." Now, however, it could likely be abandoned, since we don't even know if Build a Rocket Boy will be around long enough to make it.</p>
<p>This is just speculation, but it seems like MindsEye was meant to be a sort of proof-of-concept for the creation platform that Build a Rocket Boy envisioned Everywhere to be. If MindsEye had been a massive success, that would be the foundation for building out Everywhere, and the ultimate showcase for what's possible in the platform Build a Rocket Boy were creating. You could say MindsEye's success was meant to be the fuel for the rocket that would be Everywhere.</p>
<p>If that was the plan, it seems fair to say that it has failed, at least for now. Who knows, this could still potentially be the beginning of MindsEye's own arc where Build a Rocket Boy patches it into an entirely different game, something that players actually like and want to play.</p>
<p>Or, these layoffs, should they be confirmed, could be the beginning of the story players are more familiar with, the one where, within a year's time, Build a Rocket Boy is another shuttered studio.</p>

The drama-fueled, high-stakes thriller ends just before the biggest <em>Star Wars</em> battles kick off in<em> Rogue One </em>and <em>A New Hope</em>. A true feeling of catharsis to the galactic conflict only existed off screen, leaving fans looking for ways to reenact the showdowns for which <em>Andor</em> lays the groundwork.<br></p><p>It helped that one of the show’s actors, Muhannad Ben Amor, used the spotlight to share his <em>Battlefront 2</em> love in an Instagram story <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/WeWantBattlefront3/comments/1ksf0gq/muhannad_ben_amor_who_plays_wilmon_in_andor_has/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WeWantBattlefront3/comments/1ksf0gq/muhannad_ben_amor_who_plays_wilmon_in_andor_has/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that subsequently went viral</a></span>. He said he played almost 500 hours of the game when he was younger (he was only 12 when it released) and called for a sequel.  “Grew up with <em>Battlefront 2</em>—been a veteran since day one,” Amor said. “Let’s HOPE <em>Battlefront 3</em> happens.” He wasn’t the only one trying to manifest <em>Battlefront</em>’s return on social media. </p><p>The Reels and TikTok algorithms were full of <em>Star Wars </em>memes after <em>Andor</em> wrapped, and they instantly became a pipeline to nostalgia-bait of people playing and talking about <em>Battlefront 2</em> like it was a lost treasure from a bygone era. The flood of content was a mix of players reliving the game’s greatest hits, like transforming into Yoda or Darth Vader and demolishing opponents on the battlefield, or putting life on hold to finish Supremacy matches like school had just let out for the summer  in the late, pre-pandemic 2010s.</p><p>Social media platforms convincing you that everyone else is doing a thing can be a powerful incentive. FOMO is a hell of a drug. It also helps that<em> Battlefront 2 </em>is currently dirt cheap. The game is on sale for just $4 on PC and disc copies are still bargain bin fodder at places like GameStop. But I think another major dynamic to the <em>Battlefront</em> renaissance is a recent frenzy of <em>Titanfall</em> rumors <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/respawn-layoffs-star-wars-jedi-apex-legends-titanfall-1851778330&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/respawn-layoffs-star-wars-jedi-apex-legends-titanfall-1851778330">that culminated in the news</a></span> that a mech-based multiplayer incubation project had just been canned at EA. Amid fresh layoffs even as the<em> Madden</em> publisher lavishes shareholders with stock buybacks, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ksngo8/comment/mtoqfhz/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ksngo8/comment/mtoqfhz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the calls for <em>Battlefront 3</em></a></span><em> </em>have reached a fever pitch at the exact moment when it seems the least likely to ever become a reality.</p><p>The role of <em>Battlefront 2</em> as a “throwback” to a better time is an ironic one considering <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/battlefront-2s-complete-history-from-launch-to-its-fin-1843248296&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/battlefront-2s-complete-history-from-launch-to-its-fin-1843248296">its greatest legacy remains a pay-to-win loot box cash grab so brazen</a></span> it forced the entire gaming industry to back off of the microtransaction trend. But with that controversy no longer shading every aspect of the conversation around the game, the parts of <em>Battlefront 2</em> that were fun have been able to shine more than ever. Unburdened by the hype and new release expectations of a $60 game, <em>Battlefront 2</em> can just be that multiplayer distraction that hits all of the <em>Star Wars</em> fanservice sweet spots. <em>Battlefront 3</em> might never happen, but the dream of one has never been more alive. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-andor-sequel-steam-ps5-cheap-1851784922]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Deus Ex is celebrating its 25-year anniversary today, June 23, 2025. Below, we chat with designer Steve Powers about how he created one of the most franchise's most iconic stages.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Steve Powers has never visited Hong Kong, but he’s been there in his dreams.</p><p dir="ltr">As a designer on the original Deus Ex, he walked the city’s in-game streets every day for more than two years. Development was, he says, "a bit of a haze" of hard work and at least once, when he closed his eyes at night, he saw those virtual canals and neon-lit alleys: those sides of meat hanging in the market and the fog draping a temple in the city center.</p><p dir="ltr">Powers, the lead designer of the Hong Kong level, says he wanted to give players a "John Woo fever dream"--and 25 years after the immersive-sim classic was released, the space he created feels as evocative, generous, and extravagant as it did then, from its underground nightclub flashing with strobe lights to the precarious balconies a dozen floors up, coaxing the player to leap into the grey night.</p><p dir="ltr">Hong Kong is just one of 13 levels in Deus Ex, but it feels like a game hub in itself. It is a warren; its connected spaces feel, at once, utterly unique and yet still from the same world, or at least the same mind. From speaking to Powers on a video call from his home in Texas, it’s clear that Hong Kong’s undeniable flow comes from his singular, personal, and admittedly inauthentic vision of what that city should feel like--and from a clear desire to reward players’ curiosity.</p><p dir="ltr">He was one of four designers who each owned a chunk of Deus Ex, and these pieces had prescribed inputs and outputs. For Hong Kong, the player--JC Denton--is arriving to learn more about shadowy antagonists Majestic 12 and the mysterious Maggie Chow, as well as to find the scientist Tracer Tong so they can neutralize their self-destruct "kill switch". The player must leave Hong Kong having learned the truth about the links between Majestic 12 and a worldwide plague, and having acquired a powerful weapon for the game’s second half: the iconic, glowing Dragon's Tooth Sword.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4519129-maggiechow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519129" data-ratio="1.4230139230139" data-width="4884" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4519129-maggiechow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519129"></a><figcaption>Maggie Chow concept art</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4519129-maggiechow.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Within those parameters, Powers had near-total creative freedom. Developer Ion Storm couldn’t pay for a Hong Kong trip, so he drew on his love of the action director John Woo, and turned to the monumental book collection of the game’s director, Warren Spector. "He had a giant shelf full of picture books from Hong Kong, so I’d literally flip through those and put post-its on pages," he says. "That's where it came from: John Woo, Hollywood, and stacks and stacks of books."</p><p dir="ltr">The image in his head was of a busy, smoky street at night, lit only by vertical neon signs--that became Tonnochi Road, named after the real-life Tonnochy Road in Hong Kong’s Wan Chai district. He bolted bits on, "like building with LEGO," and this unguided, free-flowing approach led to "happy coincidences."</p><p dir="ltr">For example, he created a tall building and hollowed out a cosy apartment, designed so that players could learn more about their brother, Paul Denton. Powers went into the engine and peered out the window, as a player would.</p><p dir="ltr">"And there's this tall building [opposite], and I think, it'd be cool if I could see something up there. And then the pieces just start coming out of that--oh, that’s where Maggie Chow [should] live. If I was Paul Denton, I could be spying on her from here." Immediately, he hopped over the road and built Chow’s apartment, where the player will later find the Dragon’s Tooth Sword.</p><p dir="ltr">"The way I like to work is just to get in a level that’s blocked out, and put on my 'player glasses,'" Powers says. "I’m not going to think about level design, or the academic principles of making a game, I just go, 'What do I want to do right now?'</p><p dir="ltr">"I love getting to a place and looking down and you get a little tingle in your tummy because it’s so high up … And I want to run, and leap over a chasm, and land on a balcony on the other side. That sounds cool. And then I figure out why it’s there after the fact." In the finished game, players can indeed leap from Maggie Chow’s building to that first apartment Powers built.</p><p dir="ltr">His building upwards and outwards was by no means random, he says, and was guided both by the plot--players must visit a market, a club, a triad base, and a hidden laboratory belonging to the VersaLife corporation--and by a desire for changes of rhythm. But the result feels serendipitous. You know when you turn a corner that the music, the color palette, and the vibe will shift, and you’ll find something worth investigating.</p><p dir="ltr">In replaying the game, I visit Hong Kong’s canals and get lost on its walkways, passing barges and rowing boats. I take a narrow alley, emerging into a frosty room with meat hanging on hooks and a figure lurking in the shadows. Powers made that space, a freezer room for the Old China Hand waterside bar, specifically to break up the warm neon colors of Hong Kong with cool blues, he says.</p><p dir="ltr">His desire for a huge, varied world made adapting to player choice, a hallmark of Deus Ex, more complicated. Players are supposed to meet Maggie Chow before finding the Dragon Tooth’s Sword, which will, in turn, prove her part in a major conspiracy. But her apartment has multiple entrances, including through a skylight, and you can break in to find the sword without talking to her. If that happens, she’ll confront the player much later on, berating them for their "terrible manners".</p><p dir="ltr">"For every single opportunity I would give the player to do things out of order, it exponentially complicated some logic," says Powers. "What is Maggie Chow going to say to you if you already have the sword the first time you meet her?"</p><p dir="ltr">That, to many players, and to Powers, is the joy of Deus Ex. "What are all the things the player could've done before getting here, and let's have the game respond, make sure that's accounted for. It makes the game feel alive and real."</p><p dir="ltr">You can break the fiction, "but it holds together just enough where sympathetic players create their own logical leaps," Powers says. "If the player has enough reason to believe that everything is accounted for, then when they're presented with something that doesn't work out that way, they'll solve it themselves--they'll help us out a little bit."</p><p dir="ltr">It’s easy to become one of those sympathetic players in Hong Kong. You not only forgive leaps of logic, but you begin telling stories in your head to fill in the graphical gaps and the empty streets--about why that canal boat is parked right next to that freezer room, for example. "The fidelity is really lacking in Hong Kong," Powers says, "but the idea is, let’s show how this world actually works. A barge comes in from the bay and down the canal and comes here, and offloads all these frozen goods, and this is where they store them for the kitchen. I wanted it to make sense as a liveable space."</p><p dir="ltr">Not every part of Hong Kong has aged well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4519134-market.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519134" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4519134-market.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519134"></a><figcaption>The market area in Deus Ex.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4519134-market.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Even at the time, the local accents sounded like exaggerated stereotypes. Powers recalls criticism after the game was released. But many of the characters, he says, were voiced by local people--they just weren’t professionals. "I remember getting dinged, 'The accents are so weird and fake,' and I was like, that was real people from Hong Kong reading those lines. They were just bad actors so it came across as stilted and weird."</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the characters, however, were voiced by Western actors, including both Maggie Chow and Tracer Tong. Powers says he wasn’t involved in the casting and recording, but knows that, for most of the team, it was the first fully voiced game many of them had worked on.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm certain that a number of things would be done differently today," he says. "On Prey and Redfall we cast actors that suited the ethnic and cultural backgrounds of the characters, and when we had writers generating dialog for a culture that wasn't their own, we hired the appropriate consultants to review and comment on the content so that we could adjust. I'm sure if we were making Deus Ex today, we'd have similar values."</p><p dir="ltr">This is not an authentic version of Hong Kong. "Anyone going to Hong Kong is not going to see any of this," he says. He’s "sure it was on his mind" that he was portraying a different culture and that people from Hong Kong might play the game, but "there's never any intent to do anything other than to do a respectful presentation [of local culture]. That was the hope."</p><p dir="ltr">This is Steve Powers’ version of Hong Kong, his own "John Woo fever dream", his vision of a city.</p><p dir="ltr">As if to illustrate the point, Powers even modelled one of his body parts into the game, after programmers on the team showed him how to make complex shapes, he says.</p><p dir="ltr">It sits on a plinth in the lobby to the VersaLife headquarters, reflecting off the red marble floor, and slides back to reveal an underground laboratory where the Gray Death, the plague threatening the world, is being manufactured.</p><p dir="ltr">It is a giant hand, reaching towards the player, grasping at a globe, a metaphor for power.</p><p dir="ltr">On our call, Powers stretches his fingers towards his webcam.</p><p dir="ltr">"That’s this hand."</p>
