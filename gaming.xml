            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the desperate arguments for AI is that it will help people be creative without all the practice and hard work that goes into actually creating something–that, as science fiction writer Ted Chiang wrote at <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/why-ai-isnt-going-to-make-art" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New Yorker</a> last year, “art can be all inspiration and no perspiration.” A world where whatever enters your head can be immediately externalized is already one of the best reasons for deleting all your social media accounts, but lately we’ve seen politicians use generative AI to show us the unfettered horrors of their brains, and completely remove the wall between them, their cruelty, and the rest of us.</p><p>Donald Trump is of course a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/13/ai-is-opening-a-maga-trump-split-00534925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan</a>, creating AI videos that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/01/trump-racist-deepfake-video-jeffries-schumer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mock Democratic leaders</a> and, after last weekend’s No Kings protests, depict him <a href="https://www.404media.co/trump-no-kings-ai-poop-jet-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dumping shit</a> on protestors from a fighter jet. Vice President JD Vance called the Democrat videos “funny” and told reporters they would stop if Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries did what Republicans wanted; <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5563504-speaker-johnson-trump-no-kings-ai-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaker Mike Johnson</a> called the plane shit video “satire” and praised Trump for using “social media to make the point. You can argue he’s probably the most effective person who’s ever used social media for that.”</p><p>Lately, NYC mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo has gotten into the AI game, saying during the first of NYC’s two mayoral debates last week that one his <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/22/nx-s1-5581418/mamdani-cuomo-nyc-mayor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">takeaways</a> from his rout in the primary was that he “did not do enough on social media” compared to his opponent and front runner <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-zohran-mamdani-fifa-sim-city" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zohran Mamdani</a>. On October 1 he released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkCgSirfbjc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partially AI video</a> of himself doing jobs he doesn’t actually do, like window washer and stage hand. This week, he released an utterly bizarre AI-generated smear ad against Mamdani, a riff on <em>Austin Powers’</em> Mini-Me that compares Mamdani to former NYC mayor Bill de Blasio. “There’s no such thing as talent; socialism means we’re all equally dumb!” a squeaky-voiced rendering of Mamdani cheers, while fake de Blasio looks everywhere but at the viewer as if even he knows how dumb this is.</p><p>This ad is off-putting and desperate and dated, but at least its contents just feel like an off-putting and desperate and dated political ad from Cuomo, a man who is himself all of those things. The same can’t be said of another AI video reportedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/cuomo-zohran-mamdani-ai-ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uploaded and then deleted</a> by the official Cuomo Twitter account during last night’s debate. Shared by Zeteo reporter Prem Thakker, the over two minute video shows various AI-rendered people identifying themselves as “criminals for Zohran” and celebrating the idea that he’ll make their crimes–which include shoplifting, drunk driving, and domestic abuse–legal.&nbsp;</p><p>The video starts with an AI-generated Mamdani frollicking through NYC’s streets and eating rice with his hands, and then continues to be awful: a guy who looks a lot like Idris Elba puts on a medical mask and keffiyeh before shoplifting from a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24025691/shoplifting-scare-criminal-justice-reform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pharmacy</a>; a cliche 1970s movie pimp stands before a windowless van full of presumably sex-trafficked women. In a nod to equality, I guess, white people are also portrayed as criminals, with an old lady driving around drinking out of a paper bag before crashing her car, and a scene where a woman with a name tag that says “social worker” encourages a man it’s suggested is beating his wife to take deep breaths to “kumbaya the situation.” “Globalize the intifada,” one of Cuomo’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/nyc-mayoral-debate-takeaways" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorite phrases</a> to hurl against Mamdani, makes an appearance as pro-Palestinian protestors burn an American flag. Because it’s AI, several of these offensive, NYC scaremongering stereotypes become different people through the course of the ad; the old lady, the pimp, and Idris Elba all look younger at points. But even if AI can’t even give us consistent characters to follow along on their crime sprees, the essential message comes through: New York is full of bad guys, and if Mamdani becomes mayor, those bad guys will burn the city to the ground, as seen in the last shot of the video.</p><p>This would be an appalling ad even if it featured real actors and locations, but I suppose you could argue it would have created some local jobs and thus contributed to the economy Cuomo wants his hands on. But as AI, with all the technology’s wobbles and flaws and weird lighting, it lays bare exactly <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-stupid-do-they-think-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how stupid</a> Cuomo thinks voters are–that we are so weak and terrified that we would take this message seriously no matter the grubby package it comes in. This isn’t a surprise coming from the angry, self-righteous man we’ve seen on the campaign trail, one whose supporters considered trying to freak us out with an altered image of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/12/nyregion/cuomo-mamdani-debate.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mamdani with a thicker beard</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We already know this about AI, that its boosters think we will guzzle <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/762594/fable-showrunner-edwatch-saatchi-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">any slop they feed us</a> simply because <em>they</em> are the ones feeding it to us. But these AI posts reveal less about the general population’s tastes and insecurities than they do the people making them. With AI providing a direct route from Trump and Cuomo’s brains to our screens, we get an unrestricted tour through their heads. They can show us exactly how angry and afraid they are, without even an actor to try to put a spin on it or a local street corner we can recognize. It’s the kind of stuff you could imagine them dumping out in a therapy session with Cuomo’s fake social worker: <em>I am scared everyone is out to get me, I would like to take a big wet crap on people who are mean to me</em>. Fake de Blasio can’t look us in the eye because AI doesn’t understand eye contact, but it also gives Cuomo’s gross fantasy a sense of shame, like some part of him knows these are not the kinds of thoughts you should shout out in public, like he knows these are not the kinds of emotions that should rule a person’s life.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a sort of intimacy here that could almost be humanizing. The vulnerability in art made by humans can help us understand why people do the bad things they do, but stripped of craft or the self-reflection required to <em>make</em> something, the videos show them as not just vicious but also lazy, like even expressing their deepest insecurities isn’t worth their own time. AI gives us <em>too much</em> intimacy with these men. It gives them the uncut ability not just to externalize their crap in the limited words of Twitter and Truth Social, where a reader would then have to translate it into their own imagination, but in sound and color and the wavering facsimile of humans, the way they must experience their fantasies when they close their eyes and indulge them. They can show us, effortlessly, exactly what they see in their heads, without anything to get between us and their thoughts. We can live in their brains with all the vivid, inescapable impact that they want to bring to bear on the real world. </p><p>Using AI isn’t just a quick way for them to make their videos. It’s another expression of the power they have, and what they’ve turned power into: not just the freedom to shape laws or economics to their desires, but the freedom to be easily and unreservedly their worst selves at all times and make the rest of us live with it. This is in line with the whole AI industry, which is getting<a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/how-big-tech-is-force-feeding-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> forced into our lives</a> whether we want it or not. AI has long stopped being about human welfare or whatever <a href="https://ia.samaltman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lofty bullshit</a> its creators once claimed to believe, and more about keeping its own <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/longcon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expensive con</a> running at all costs. Men like Trump and Cuomo, as hollow and clumsy and selfish as the things AI spits out, are right at home in it.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-twitchcon-2025-security-emiru-assault-irl-streamers"><h3>Beefed Up TwitchCon Security Couldn’t Stop The Internet’s Issues From Spilling Over Into Real Life</h3></a><p>A high-profile assault and toxic IRL streamers have forced the Twitch community to reckon with deeper-seated problems</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/criterion-mobile-closet-picks-peter-decker-interview-chicago-international-film-festival"><h3>Criterion’s Mobile Closet Wasn’t About The Van—It Was About IRL Friendships We Made Along The (Five-Hour) Way</h3></a><p>Criterion president Peter Becker reflects on how Closet Picks evolved from a spontaneous idea into a beloved ritual among cinephiles for its 40th anniversary roadshow celebration.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bluesky-resistance-bots"><h3>Why Are My Bluesky Bots So Into Irish</h3></a><p>If I have to have uncomfortable social interactions, they should at least be with real people</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/ai-trump-cuomo]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sneaky...</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo and Ubisoft have finally confirmed the world's worst-kept secret: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is launching on the Switch 2 on 2nd December 2025. Darn, that is a <em>packed</em> first week of the last month of 2025, isn't it?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-rating-spotted-online">Rumours have</a> been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/rumour-assassins-creed-shadows-on-switch-2-may-clash-with-metroid-prime-4">swirling about</a> this one for a few weeks now, but the announcement confirms a couple of rather lovely features. It'll cost <strong>USD</strong> <strong>$59.99</strong> and will be available on the eShop or as a Game-Key Card.</p>
<p>First up, cross-progression is available as long as you have an Ubisoft Connect account! So if you've been playing on another console up until now and want to swap to the hybrid system for the holiday season, you won't lose your progress.</p>
<p>Secondly, here's something we didn't expect: touchscreen support. All the in-game menus will allow you to use the touchscreen when playing in handheld mode. That includes the world map, too.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/6RbmYrpsP24PJYtPlpJ2mX/assassins-creed-shadows-fall-roadmap-update">a blog post</a>, Ubisoft has also detailed Title Updates 10 and 11 for the game. Those updates will be available on the Switch 2 version from release, and these bring Corrupted Castles, parkour updates, new free story updates, and new environmental puzzles. Note that the Claws of Awaji expansion won't be available until early 2026.</p>
<p>For those who missed it earlier in the year, Assassin's Creed Shadows launched on other consoles on 20th March 2025. Taking the series to Feudal Japan, you play as both the shinobi Naoe or the samurai Yasuke, both of whom play very differently. Naoe feels like your more traditional series protagonist, focusing on stealthy gameplay, while Yasuke is much more direct in combat.</p>
<p>Our sister site Push Square were fans upon its original release, awarding the game <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/assassins-creed-shadows">an 8/10</a>, concluding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While Assassin's Creed Shadows is unlikely to win over those who struggled to push through Odyssey or Valhalla, this is still one of the strongest overall entries in the series — and arguably the best of the open world RPG bunch."</p>
</blockquote>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/project-tal-is-a-stunning-new-open-world-action-rpg-slated-for-2027.1333045/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>South Korean publisher WEMADE MAX and developer MADNGINE have unveiled a new open world action RPG called Project TAL with a stunning trailer. </p>



<p>In this single player game, which is currently scheduled to arrive on PC and consoles in 2027, players will explore a reimagining of Korea's traditional Tal masks and the mythology and folklore surrounding them. Project TAL features cinematic and fast-paced combat where players can leap onto massive monsters to deliver powerful attacks, exploit enemy weak spots, and perform tactical counterattacks and skill combos.</p>



<p>One of the game's core features is a companion system that responds dynamically to the player’s combat style and the environment. Each NPC companion featured in the game has unique abilities, personalities and combat roles ranging from defence and support to melee, ranged and magic. Players will experience seamless moments of cooperation in Project TAL, such as catching a falling companion in the heat of battle or witnessing a support companion deploy a magical barrier to deflect enemy attacks away from the party.</p>



<p>Sohn Myun-seok, CEO of WEMADE MAX, stated:</p>



<p><em>Project TAL combines an emotionally resonant story about healing a wounded world with the exhilarating combat of a classic action RPG. With MADNGINE’s technical expertise and artistic vision, we’re creating a AAA open-world title built to compete on a global stage.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>WEMADE MAX and MADNGINE previously worked together on the MMORPG Night Crows, which launched in Korea in 2023 and globally last year. However, Project TAL is a far cry from it, being a single player action-oriented roleplaying game for PC and consoles, whereas Night Crows is an MMORPG for PC and mobile with blockchain-powered play-to-earn features.</p>



<p>According to the press release, MADNGINE has recently established a 'multi-production creative structure' to develop multiple new franchises, such as Project TAL. Going forward, it will focus on high-end genres, platform diversity and technological scalability.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of the worst-kept secrets of 2025 has finally been officially announced by Ubisoft.<a href="https://kotaku.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows"><em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a>, the latest entry in the publisher’s sneaky-stabby series of open-world games, is getting a Switch 2 port later this year.</p> <p>On October 23, <a href="https://youtu.be/OzyD_EFZzgc">Ubisoft officially revealed</a> that <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 on December 2. This version of the game will support full cross progression across all platforms and will also feature touchscreen support for all in-game menus, though you’ll be able to use a controller, too. The recently released expansion for <em>AC Shadows</em>, <em>Claws of Awaji</em>, won’t be available for Switch 2 players until “early next year.”</p>

 <p>Here’s the first trailer for the Switch 2 port of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows,</em> which appears to show a seemingly impressive-looking port of the massive and <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-graphics-seasons-screenshots-1851770252">gorgeous open-world game</a> set in feudal Japan.</p>  <p>“We are delighted to bring <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> to Nintendo players,” said <em>AC Shadows</em> director Charles Benoit in a press release announcing the port. “Whether slipping through the shadows as Naoe or facing foes head-on as Yasuke, players will be able to roam the streets and rooftops of feudal Japan at home or anywhere their journey takes them on Nintendo Switch 2.”</p>

 <p>Ubisoft’s incredible-looking and playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465">Switch 2 port of<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em> earlier this year</a> showed that the company can bring its high-end blockbusters to Nintendo’s less-powerful hardware while still making sure the games look great. And this first trailer for <em>Shadows</em> running on Switch 2 looks equally impressive, with lots of detail and realistic lighting. Sure, it’s not as sharp as <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> running on a PS5 Pro connected to a 4K TV, but I bet it will look fine on the Switch 2’s smaller screen.</p> <p>Of course, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> arriving on Switch 2 isn’t exactly a surprise. <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-preorder-release-date-2000634141">The game was leaked earlier this month</a> following months of rumors. Still, it’s nice to have it officially announced, and it’s great that more people will have a chance to check out what I think is one of Ubisoft’s best games in a long time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Even in a packed year for kart racers, <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> is playing for keeps. Will it earn a place alongside <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-free-roam-open-world-burnout-paradise-1851776569"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-crossover-review-hatsune-miku-2000626583"><em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</em></a>? Director Masahiro Sakurai hopes so. The legendary developer said he doesn’t plan on continuing the series; the upcoming Switch 2 exclusive is a one-and-done. “I’ve thrown everything I have into this game,” he said during its latest livestream preview. He certainly has. Just when you thought you knew everything<em> Kirby Air Riders</em> has to offer, Sakurai announces even more modes, characters, and features, including a roguelike adventure called Road Trip.</p> <p>In a second hour-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZHYjYHHiBM">Direct-style presentation for <em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> that went live on Thursday, the famed<em> Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> director reminded fans why he’s the king of content maximalism. If you thought Nintendo’s latest racing game, out November 20, would be just a racing game with a sandbox mode, you would be sorely mistaken, my pink, puffy friend. Some are already calling it the “<a href="https://x.com/TAHK0/status/1981361888173969671">Kirby game of all Kirby games</a>.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sorry to break the order of my reporting of the Kirby Air Riders Direct, but I needed to share Sakurai's closing speech because what a guy! He is a masterclass in game development. <a href="https://t.co/ngXoBgcj4X">pic.twitter.com/ngXoBgcj4X</a></p> <p>— Kābī (@KirPinkFury) <a href="https://twitter.com/KirPinkFury/status/1981362564576551304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This is far from the full list of newly revealed features players will get to mess around with:</p> <ul> <li>Top-down camera view race mode called Top Ride</li> <li>Roguelike mode with random challenges from other modes and unique story beats called Road Trip</li> <li>Match lobby called Paddock where you can interact and move between different online races</li> <li>Variant of Air Ride called Swap Relay where you change machines every lap</li> <li>Machine that can switch configurations called Transform Star</li> <li>Set of achievements called Checklist that lets you chase unlockables throughout the game</li> <li>Global Win Power shows how many times you’ve won in addition to your online class ranking</li> <li>Custom licenses to show off your personality online</li> <li>Boss battles</li> <li>Expanded roster including the spider Taranza, wily duo Lololo &amp; Lalala, the bug-eyed Marx, and others</li> </ul> <h2><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> feels like a direct attack on <em>Mario Kart World</em></h2> <p>Like I said, this is an incomplete and abridged rundown of all of the gameplay elements Sakurai dove into during the latest and likely final preview of <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> ahead of release. He also mentioned how players will earn miles by playing that are spent to unlock more parts of the Machine Market to outfit your ride. Plus there are new collectibles called Gummies. They sound a bit like the stickers from <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>. “Who knows, maybe you’ll become a Gummillionaire!” Nintendo’s words, not mine.</p>

 <p>But wait, there’s still more! <em>Kibry Air Riders</em> is also getting dedicated amiibo figures. There are three, all launching next year starting on March 5 with Meta Knight &amp; Shadow Star, followed later on by King Dedede &amp; Tank Star and Chef Kawasaki &amp; Hop Star. Like the new amiibo Nintendo’s been rolling out, these are bigger, more complex, and will likely have those bigger $30 price tags to match. Has Nintendo given Sakurai a blank check to do whatever he wants with <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> before he makes the next <em>Smash Bros.</em>? Probably.</p> <p>We’ll see how it all adds up in practice, but on paper at least, the game is certainly shaping up to satiate even the most ravenous fans’ demands in a way the somewhat content-lite <em>Mario Kart World</em> maybe didn’t when it debuted back over the summer. “Just so you know, we’re not planning DLC, everything is here,” Sakurai said of <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>. Ouch! Switch Online subscribers can try the game for free during Global Test Ride events on Nov. 8-9 and Nov. 15-16.</p>

<p>"This was a complete shock to the community," he said. "This completely changes the supply of Counter-Strike's most sought-after and expensive tier of items."</p><p>A huge number of players have been affected by this update. One 20-something trader Bloomberg spoke with had $1 million of digital items in his inventory on Wednesday, but by Thursday, he had lost upwards of $270,000. Chinese players, who Bloomberg noted are some of the game's primary traders, criticized the price shift on the ByteDance-owned, short-form video platform Douyin. This all led MacDonald to believe the "bubble" had burst.</p><p>In other Counter-Strike news, a troupe of modders announced a remake of the 1.6 version of the game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modders-announce-cs-legacy-a-standalone-counter-strike-1-6-remake/1100-6530176/" data-ref-id="1100-6530176">Counter-Strike: Legacy</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-silver-bullet-switch-a-gothic-arcade-shooter-full-of-tricks.1332994/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/silver_bullet">Silver Bullet</a>’s aesthetic is dark, cartoony, and full of Halloween charm. But beneath its playful premise of a pint-sized Van Helsing rescuing puppies from the forces of darkness lies a razor-blade-stuffed apple - an arcade game with a wicked edge.</p>
<p>Mashing genres into something unique, its crosshair shooting setup is reminiscent of Cabal or Wild Guns, but eradicates ambiguous pseudo-3D trajectories by flattening everything onto a pure 2D plane. You trace your crosshair about the screen to gun down ghouls and dash to avoid bullets, while giant bosses - everything from fiery skeletons to undead dinosaurs - rain down fun and fearsome bullet hell-style patterns that are both inventive and thrilling to work through.</p>
<p>Helsing has a regularly refilled super attack that can be aimed and fired in a straight line, bleeding point icons as it wipes out enemies, and a close-encounters button-tap parry for expert use. His dash manoeuvre can also destroy enemies and certain obstacles, essential for tidying cluttered screens.</p>
<p>The goal is simple: don’t die and make your super shots count. Fine-tuned for scoring, each stage is plumbed with tricks to propel you up the leaderboards, with an accuracy meter that rises when hitting an object, multiplying your points, and falling when firing on dead air. A death, however, cuts this right down. Coins can be teased from each stage to be spent in a shop, doubling your super usage and improving accuracy, amongst other effects, implemented to incrementally improve your chances.</p>
<p>There are six stages and six interim, viciously creative bonus games that are frankly very tough to crack, borrowing ideas from Namco’s <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/point_blank">Point Blank</a> and Capcom’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/pang">Pang</a>, amongst others. There’s a challenging score attack mode and a novel <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/tetris">Tetris</a> shooting-hybrid called Terror Blocks to unlock, with a unique scoring system all its own.</p>
<p>If you don’t care about points, continues are freely available to get you through the game. At only 35 minutes in length, however, Silver Bullet shines brightest when you attempt a one-credit clear, and it's meticulously engineered around this. Extra lives appear at certain waypoints, and pocketing coins to rapidly empty the shop is a smart approach. Challenging though it is, the reward for success is all the more elating. This is owed largely to a clever arrangement that, once understood, keeps drawing you back for another go.</p>
<p>Yet, there are a few frustrations. It's occasionally difficult to discern which objects you can safely dash through, and positioning with walk or dash isn't entirely foolproof. Silver Bullet’s most prominent foible, though, is its control dilemma. Designed around a twin-stick setup - one for Helsing’s movement and the other for crosshair positioning - it's awkward to have button work restricted to the shoulders and triggers. Switching to traditional controls is far more comfortable, but then you can’t move the crosshair independently unless you’re firing at the same time. This negatively impacts your accuracy and, in turn, your scoring.</p>
<p>It’s not a colossal problem, and casual gamers will have a great time with its cleverly devised stages, but those aiming to play as intended face a tough choice: master the twin-stick controls or accept reduced scoring potential in favour of a more intuitive experience. It's a thorny choice, but regardless of how you choose to play, Silver Bullet is a bewitchingly fun little Halloween title that will have arcade enthusiasts howling at the moon.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/silver-bullet]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-final-story-dlc-out-november-11/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii%E2%80%99s-final-story-dlc-is-out-on-november-11.1332991/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, publisher Plaion and developer Warhorse Studios announced that the final story DLC planned for Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, titled Mysteria Ecclesiae, will be released on November 11.</p>



<p>In this expansion pack, Henry, the game's main character, becomes Sigismund Albicus's assistant. Albicus is a renowned healer with ties to King Wenceslas himself. Henry is tasked with a clandestine mission within the monastery's ancient walls and finds himself entangled in a web of intrigue and a deadly, mysterious plague, where each faction harbours its own hidden motives.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II players can explore the fascinating Sedletz Monastery and meet its elusive inhabitants. A sudden epidemic has hit the area, and it is imperative to discover its origin. Warhorse promises a rich, cinematic quest that will test the player's deductive and sleuthing skills.</p>



<p>Unraveling the secrets of Sedletz Monastery will require interacting with its inhabitants and discovering their hidden agendas. They will engage with various factions, each with its own motivations, and shape the course of events with their decisions. Players will traverse the diverse areas of the historically accurate Sedletz Monastery, gradually unlocking new sections as they solve mysteries and uncover hidden secrets. As you would expect from such a DLC, the developers have introduced new outfits, weapons, potions and books to expand Henry's knowledge and abilities.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Mysteria Ecclesiae can be purchased at $13.99 on its own, or as part of the Expansion Pass, which is priced at $29.99. That also includes the other two previously released story DLCs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-brushes-with-death-story-dlc-out-now-on-all-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brushes with Death</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-legacy-of-the-forge-dlc-update-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legacy of the Forge</a>. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Gold Edition owners will get Mysteria Ecclesiae automatically, since the Gold Edition includes the Expansion Pass.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II has been a great success for both Plaion and Warhorse Studios, having sold over three million units to date. The game also received outstanding acclaim from critics, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including a perfect score from Wccftech's Chris Wray</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Warhorse Studios and publisher Deep Silver have announced the final&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II&nbsp;</em>story DLC, and it'll take Henry to a plague-stricken monastery to investigate the deadly disease's origin next month.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Mysteria Ecclesiae&nbsp;</em>will serve as the celebrated medieval RPG's last major expansion, and it's set for release across all platforms on November 11th.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Mysteria Ecclesiae</em>, you'll serve as the assistant to renowned healer Sigismund Albicus, and together with that venerated figure, you'll be investigating the Sedletz Monastery, where "a web of intrigue and a deadly, mysterious plague" await you, as well as factions with their own "hidden motives".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-final-dlc-monastery.jpg?itok=dXRM_Tco 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-final-dlc-monastery.jpg?itok=HRYkLbut 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II&nbsp;</em>is getting one final story DLC next month.</figcaption></figure><p>As you'd probably expect from&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, the Sedletz Monastery will be a "historically accurate" area in which you can expect "diverse areas" to explore, as well as "hidden secrets" to uncover.</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll also be able to take advantage of a brand new outfit for Henry, as well as new weapons, potions, and books to help you "expand [your] knowledge and abilities to new horizons". In short, if you loved the base game, it'll almost certainly be worth checking this DLC out.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, it's the sequel to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">hugely successful</a> 2018 action RPG&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, and like its predecessor, the sequel emphasizes historical realism and accuracy over fantasy elements.</p>

<p>You'll once again take the role of Henry of Skalitz as he sets out on a journey to avenge the murder of his parents, and along the way, you'll discover plenty of medieval court intrigue to get wrapped up in.</p>




<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II&nbsp;</em>is no slouch in the sales department either; at last count, the game had managed to rack up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">three million sales for itself</a>, and it's almost certainly topped that figure by now as well.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Mysteria Ecclesiae&nbsp;</em>expansion when it launches on November 11th. The game itself is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9N4W31HSMVVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can read our review <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-review-deliciously-executed-revenge" rel="nofollow">right here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Elden Ring Switch 2 Version Delayed for "Performance Adjustments"]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-switch-2-delayed-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-switch-2-version-delayed-for-performance-adjustments.1332985/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco have announced that the upcoming Switch 2 version of celebrated open-world action RPG&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>has been delayed into next year.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, the two studios say that while development on the game's Switch 2 port "continues wholeheartedly towards release", a delay is necessary in order for the developers to implement "performance adjustments".</p>

<p>No new release date has been given; all we know is that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</em>, for 'tis its name, is now due to arrive on Nintendo's new console sometime in 2026.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-switch-2-delayed-margit.jpg?itok=ggS7d90b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-switch-2-delayed-margit.jpg?itok=7L1R1DRX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>won't be hitting the Switch 2 this year.</figcaption></figure><p>News of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s delay on Switch 2 follows reports that the game's performance on the console was lackluster, to say the least; during a hands-on at Gamescom, IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/elden-ring-on-switch-2-is-a-disaster-in-handheld-mode-gamescom-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">described</a>&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s Switch 2 handheld performance as "a disaster".</p>

<p>The publication said that frame drops were "significant" when turning the camera outside of the game's initial tutorial area, and that the Switch 2 version of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>also sported a "confusing button layout", which is odd considering the console's controller setup is pretty much the same as any other.</p>

<p>IGN didn't say anything about&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s docked performance on Switch 2, but it presumably won't fare much better than the handheld version, so hopefully, this extra time gives FromSoftware and Bandai Namco time to polish up&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>on Nintendo's new machine before release.</p>

<p>When it does eventually launch,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition&nbsp;</em>will bring the full game experience to Switch 2, including last year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree" rel="nofollow">excellent</a>&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC and all updates that have been released since the game's initial 2022 launch.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition&nbsp;</em>when it launches sometime next year on Switch 2, and the game is also currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/elden-ring/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring/9P3J32CTXLRZ/0010" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> (albeit with the DLC sold separately).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising</em>, the latest expansion for the mobile smash hit&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, and it's due to bring a game-changing new set of 'mons to the digital card game next week.</p>

<p>Launching on October 29th,&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising&nbsp;</em>makes good on a promise made by The Pokemon Company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-evolution-fall" rel="nofollow">back in August</a>&nbsp;by introducing Mega Evolved Pokemon into the mix. As you'd imagine, these are powerful cards, but they come with risks, too.</p>

<p>Mega Evolved Pokemon will have higher stats and attack power than regular creatures, but if you manage to knock them out, you'll win three whole points for yourself. That's right; defeating a Mega Evolved Pokemon wins you the match, regardless of where things currently stand.</p>

Here's hoping its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-production-issue-plagiarism" rel="nofollow">provenance is legit this time</a>, eh?</p>

<p>Mega Evolved 'mons include the likes of Blaziken, Gyarados, and Altaria, and you can also expect new art for existing Pokemon like Pidgey, Growlithe, and Jirachi, among others. It's a real smorgasbord of beautiful Pokemon drawings.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you can also look forward to accessories based on Mega Blaziken, which will be available starting from October 31st to give you the opportunity to "make your hottest cards look even more scorching".</p>

<p>You can take a look at the (appropriately epic) announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising&nbsp;</em>expansion, which shows off some of the expansion's beautiful artwork and new cards, right here.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising&nbsp;</em>expansion when it launches on October 29th. The game is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-profit-margins-30-percent-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-reportedly-pushing-xbox-to-hit-sky-high-30-profit-margins.1332976/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox is reportedly being pushed by parent company Microsoft to achieve profit margins far in excess of those towards which the rest of the industry aims, according to a new report.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> (which, of course, cites "people familiar with the business"), Microsoft has set goals of 30% for Xbox's "accountability margins", which is apparently the term Microsoft uses instead of "profit margins". Start brushing up on those corpo-jargon dictionaries now.</p>

<p>Bloomberg reports that average industry profit margins sit between 17% and 22%. Xbox's have generally been lower than that over the past few years at between 10% and 20%, so this 30% profit goal is a massive jump even for Xbox, let alone for the rest of the industry.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-xbox-profit-report.jpg?itok=q8T0vi_o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-xbox-profit-report.jpg?itok=fzU76ZfK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox is reportedly being pushed to hit 30% profit margins by overlo-er, parent company Microsoft.</figcaption></figure><p>S&amp;P Global analyst Neil Barbour told Bloomberg that the 30% target is one "usually reserved for a publisher that is really nailing it". Given the controversy surrounding <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">recent Game Pass changes</a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">project cancellations</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a>, I'd say you'd struggle to apply that descriptor to Xbox right now.</p>

<p>Speaking of Game Pass, Bloomberg's sources say that Xbox's requirement for all first-party games to launch on Game Pass on day one "has hurt Xbox game sales".</p>

<p>According to Bloomberg, Xbox offers a developer incentive that is calculated based on "several factors", one of which is the number of hours players spend on Game Pass titles. Naturally, that means these rewards will be given more often to developers of live-service titles or those without finite campaigns.</p>

<p>In previous years, Xbox staff weren't given specific numerical figures as profit goals; this change, according to Bloomberg, came in 2023 and was introduced by CFO Amy Hood, who's been taking "a larger role in the gaming business" alongside her team recently.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-xbox-profit-margin-report.jpg?itok=N5fYh_Q6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-xbox-profit-margin-report.jpg?itok=RUcgzQTr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Game Pass apparently continues to cause problems for Xbox developers.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time we've heard of Game Pass reportedly causing problems for developers and Xbox insiders. Back in September, former Xbox VP Shannon Loftis said the service <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-shannon-loftis-comments" rel="nofollow">creates "weird inner tensions" among developers</a>, with Game Pass adoption coming "at the expense of retail revenue".</p>

<p>It's not hard to see how that might make hitting the aforementioned 30% profit margin difficult, and if Bloomberg's report is to be believed, the publisher is still being expected to hit this target even when taking day one Game Pass games into account.</p>

<p>If it's accurate, the 30% profit margin figure might explain some of Xbox's recent moves, including hiking the price of Game Pass, cancelling projects left and right, and shutting down studios.</p>

<p>For its own part, Xbox told Bloomberg that success "doesn't look the same across every project", and that the company sometimes has to make "hard decisions" while "shifting resources towards the projects that are more aligned with [its] direction and priorities".</p>

She’s <a href="https://x.com/natalie_thenerd/status/1980151692625842526?s=61">currently developing a kit</a> so <a href="https://nataliethenerd.com/products/brick-boy-in-stock-notification">anyone can upgrade Lego’s Game Boy</a> to actually play games, but the creators of the BrickBoy have beaten her to the punch by taking a few shortcuts.</p></div><p>Natalie’s Lego Game Boy upgrades were all the more impressive because she had to create a custom circuit board, smaller than a Game Boy cartridge, to fit inside the replica using original chips so it could play actual cartridges. The BrickBoy is instead a custom self-contained module that slots into the Lego Game Boy’s cartridge slot and plays games through ROM files and emulation.</p><p>The BrickBoy’s creators claim it takes about five minutes to integrate the kit into Lego’s model, including installing a 2.4-inch LCD screen module, aligning magnetic sensors beneath the action buttons and D-pad, and reassembling it all. It looks easy enough, but those concerned with aesthetics may be disappointed to see that one version of the cartridge module does appear to stick out of the back of the Lego Game Boy because it houses a pair of AAA batteries.</p><p>The BrickBoy will be <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brickboy/brickboy-the-kit-that-makes-the-lego-game-boy-come-alive">available for preorder through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign</a> that’s set to launch on October 28th, 2025, in three versions. The Essential Kit can play Game Boy games in grayscale and includes a mono speaker, while the Gamer Kit adds support for Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance titles, Bluetooth headphone connectivity, and a rechargeable battery. There will also be a Collector’s Edition with a permanent power supply for those wanting to display their Lego Game Boy running demos, but pricing for the various kits hasn’t been announced yet.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/805376/lego-game-boy-brickboy-emulator-kickstarter]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-50-fire-tv-comes-with-a-soundbar-and-is-160-off-2000637805</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re kicking yourself still for not jumping on any of the deals from a couple weeks ago over at Amazon for Prime Big Deals Day, something wonderful just dropped into your lap. Right now, Amazon has one of its Fire TVs on sale for 31% off. And this isn’t a Fire TV Stick, this is a full 50-inch TV with a Fire TV interface.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4953/"> That discount brings the price down from $520 to just $360, saving you a whole $160</a>. <strong>If that’s not enough to get you excited, it also includes a free Fire TV Soundbar.</strong> Those start around at least $100 and it’s bundled here for no extra charge.</p>
<p>The Amazon smart TV measures across at 50-inches making for a pretty sizable display for a living room, den, or any shared space really. This is the 4-series model from 2024. It supports vivid 4K entertainment withy HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Digital Plus which all work together to make an impressive picture for your enjoyment with clear clarity and bright colors.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4953/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>As an Amazon smart TV, this comes with an Alexa-enabled remote. The Alexa remote is a complete gamechanger when it comes to browsing for content. Those on-screen keypads can be so cumbersome to type on. Every app lays them out differently, with some being in alphabetical order and others following the popularized QWERTY layout. And all you have in the little directional pad to hop over one letter at a time. That can take forever to type out a long title like “<em>Only Murders in the Building</em>.” Sweat not, because with the Alexa remote, you can just hold the button and speak the title aloud, then be brought right to it.</p>



<h2>Fire TV Soundbar Included</h2>
<p>TV speakers have gotten better and better over the years, but they’re still no comparison to a dedicated surround sound system or sound bar. What a treat it is that this TV comes with its own soundbar free of charge. This can be set right in front of your TV on top of your media center so you can enjoy rich, three-dimensional virtual surround sound. It supports DTS Virtual:X and even more detail with Dolby Audio. It’s easy to set up too. Just plug it into the TV with the included HDMI cable to the HDMI eARC/ARC on the TV. Presto, now the soundbar will work just like that.</p>
<p>The TV has three additional HDMI ports along with that HDMI eARC/ARC port so you can connect to a cable box or multiple gaming consoles if you wish.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has a release date for the Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>On Thursday, it was announced that the latest game in the long-running Ubisoft series will come to Nintendo’s latest console on December 2. Its launch marks the first time a current Assassin’s Creed game will release on Nintendo Hardware. </p>



<p>“Experience Feudal Japan as shinobi Naoe or samurai Yasuke while enjoying cross-progression and touchscreen support on all menus,” the announcement reads.</p>



<p>The game will cost $59.99 and will come with all post-launch updates included. The recently released Claws of Awaji DLC, which adds roughly 10 hours of content for players, will come to the platform early next year. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Earlier rumors suggested a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-release-date-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">December 5 release</a> date for the game. That would’ve seen the game release on Friday of the same week as opposed to Tuesday. Turns out, however, Ubisoft wanted the game out a few days earlier.</p>

<p>Counter-Strike 2 fans worldwide are ruing a recent change made by Valve that has drastically impacted the CS skins market. In an update to how players can obtain and trade Counter-Strike skins, Valve has made it so that players can offer up five Covert-quality skins for a <strong>guaranteed knife </strong>or <strong>pair of gloves</strong>. Before the update, these were some of the most valuable items on the market.</p>



<p>This tweak to the pre-existing trade-up system has meant that items once considered rare and expensive have crashed in value, slicing some players’ inventories a considerable amount.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-did-valve-destroy-the-skins-market">Why Did Valve Destroy The Skins Market?</h2>



<p>Valve has long had a tentative relationship with the wider skins market. The nature of the market has lent itself to some dubious practices rising in recent years, especially around the concepts of skin gambling and off-platform trading.</p>



<p>The most valuable Counter-Strike skins can run up price tags in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and private collectors have parted ways with that much without thinking about it. That might be about to change, thanks to an update made by Valve that caused the skins market value to shatter, dropping by $2 billion overnight.</p>



<p>Valve has made these changes to shift market dynamics, rebalance the economy, make high-tier items much more attainable, and potentially even <strong>democratize </strong>rare cosmetics. Covert skins will now have their prices skyrocket as knife and glove prices, some of the highest in the game, will deflate.</p>



<p>Overnight, some of the most valuable knife and glove prices in Counter-Strike 2 dropped by as much as 40%. The hit caused the overall market cap for Counter-Strike skins to collapse in on itself. Before the change, the skins market was estimated to be worth as much as <strong>$5 billion</strong>.</p>



<p>For some, it’s a critical change that has drastic financial implications, especially for those who were HODLing their skins and weathering the market. For others, it’s a healthy correction that could make the cosmetic market in Counter-Strike 2 a little more accessible.</p>



<p>From a competitive perspective, this could have a knock-on impact on sponsorships, special events, and streamers opening cases and such to keep their community engaged.</p>



<p>Do you think this change was worth the hit, or should Valve rethink this action? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> players are up in arms after first information about Season 1 revealed what they believe is an out of place soldier skin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have waited weeks for a first look at Season 1 and its new maps, modes, and guns. However, after EA and Battlefield Studios finally pulled back the curtain with a trailer yesterday, the only thing on the community’s mind was a question: could this be the beginning of the end?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New Battlefield 6 maps like Blackwell Fields and Eastwood certainly served as meaningful attention grabbers, but it’s just one skin that has completely controlled the conversation. The cosmetic in question is Wicked Grin, a new skin for the Assault Class. A sneak peek at the suit arrived via various Battlefield 6 Season 1 previews that hit the web yesterday, revealing a wardrobe that fans feel ranges from grounded to gaudy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/battlefield-6s-first-batch-of-soldier-skins-is-more-tactical-than-tacti-cool-but-if-you-thought-that-one-green-skin-was-a-step-too-far-i-dont-know-what-to-tell-you/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PC Gamer</u></a> was one of a few sites to share an image of the skin, which features dark blue highlights from head to toe. It’s Class operator also sports a toothy smile painted across their bandana. It’s been more than enough to set off alarm bells among the Battlefield 6 community, especially considering the Wicked Grin skin description teases that it can be “unlocked as a free store gift.” It suggests Assault players could flood lobbies with those standout blues as soon as next week, potentially bringing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/youre-too-good-for-camo-battlefield-6-players-cant-help-but-poke-fun-at-absurd-orange-recon-skin">fans' fear of goofy skins</a> into reality. Even if this or any of the other Season 1 skins remain a far cry from the dozens of celebrity, superhero, and cartoon character crossovers present in other popular shooters <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-devs-paying-attention-to-community-feedback-on-goofy-skins">like Call of Duty</a> and Fortnite, tens of thousands of fans are clearly unhappy with what they’re seeing so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, weren't we supposed to have realistic skins for some time?” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oddt46/grounded_skins_for_a_while_18_days_exactly/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>popular comment from a fan</u></a> says. “Something that someone would really wear during a war? Yet it seems that with the start of Season 1, everything will turn to colorful mess, with no way of differentiating teams based on uniforms, the game will look more like a Paintball or [ActionSportGames] event.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I will not revive anyone wearing this kind of skin.

Still, the Season 1 skin is being perceived as a breach of trust after the community had been told to expect grounded visuals across the board for at least a while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are a gritty, grounded, realistic shooter,” Ripple Effect and BF Studios technical director Christian Buhl <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secretly-console-first-ripple-effect-talks-building-battlefield-6-and-lessons-learned-from-battlefield-2042"><u>told IGN</u></a> last month. “That's what we intend to be, and that's what the game is going to look like for a while.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many admit that there is still much ground to cover before Battlefield 6 stops looking like the grounded military shooter that it currently is and starts introducing some of the more outrageous characters seen in other games. There's also the fact that there are, of course, many other more grounded outfits both in the Battlefield 6 base game and coming in Season 1. As for what we’ve seen from Season 1 so far, though, fans are now more on edge than ever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Is it realistic? No,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oddt46/comment/nkt5oeo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>community comment adds</u></a>. “Is it more grounded then Beavis and Butt-Head, Peter Griffin, Sgt.

I would say yes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you want to use regular, realistic outfits, there are plenty," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oddt46/comment/nktdcmc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">someone else says</a>.

This update will feature a new toggle option named “Advanced Parkour.” It will remove all parkour barriers, allowing you to do side ejects and back ejects from any height. We also bring some tweaks with side eject on parkour down, giving you more freedom of expression.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The vertical ledge grab in regular parkour will now work in more situations, including non-standing objects, whether or not the advanced parkour toggle is on. From those non-standing objects, we are also introducing a new beam manual jump option.

Our two protagonists will learn new skills from each other:</p><ul><li>Naoe will learn how to perform her own spectacular version of Yasuke’s war kick ability.</li><li>Yasuke will learn how to <a title="Genres > Stealth [101 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a>ily dispatch enemies in a non-lethal way.</li></ul><p>As the name suggests, “A Puzzlement”, also introduces a brand new and intricate environmental puzzle that may hold the answers to a bunch of questions that you, the community, have been asking for a while.</p><p>But there is more! We are doubling down on free story drops because our next special collaboration is also dropping on November 25th.</p><p>You can also expect a bunch of freebies around the holiday season.</p><p><strong>■ Switch 2 Version</strong></p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is coming on the Nintendo Switch 2 on December 2. It will have all the recent updates and free content drops, except for the “Claws of Awaji” expansion that will come later in the new year. It will also work with cross-progression to Ubisoft Connect, so you will be able to pick up where you left off. Switch 2 also offers a new way to play with touch screen features in all menus including world map, store, and hideout.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Switch 2 Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="[ESRB] Assassin's Creed Shadows: Nintendo Switch™ 2 Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B011oT5j4iU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span><a title="Games > Fall Up [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/fall-up">Fall Up</a>date Roadmap Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="[ESRB] Assassin's Creed Shadows: Fall Roadmap Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qf2bP-Ri5mk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-on-december-2-fall-roadmap-announced]]></content:encoded>

Of course, there's an issue that brings you here, aside from toppling the regime of the Sovereign, which is to learn why skip drives are creating dangerous space rifts.

<h2>Choices Matter in a Colorful World</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rift-anomaly-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=wdqu51no 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rift-anomaly-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=2PkkWtal 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The main story is relatively straightforward, with some minor plot twists added in. You have six Companions you can recruit, starting right off the bat with two of them. You can go solo, with a single partner, or bring a max of two people with you when you leave your ship, the Incognito.</p>

<p>There are a variety of areas to explore, but many can feel too hard too quickly if you just follow the main quests. Upgrading your weapons and armor, as well as completing companion quests, are requirements for moving forward without struggling. While this is the case for many RPGs, it feels like side quests are more necessary than optional.</p>

<p>Speaking of side quests, they are the real star of&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>. I don't mean the Companion quests, which can often be resolved with little to no combat. Side quests have you hunting for Manticore pupa, taking out scavengers, finding magazine issues, or finding patent schematics. These involve combat, use a variety of skills, can bring you to new places, or offer a trophy for the Incognito.</p>

<p>While most of the main quests use the same skills or traits, these other missions give you more opportunities to explore what makes your Commander unique, hone in on your individual playstyle, and potentially earn some sweet perks.&nbsp;While all the writing is passable, the side quests are where the different, and often wacky, personalities shine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most interesting aspect of&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>&nbsp;is how your actions, or lack of actions, impact the game. This can be seen quickly, as well as in the long term. Some decisions can cause you to lose companions, be attacked on sight by a whole faction, or destroy a location. These change the general feeling of the game, while the main narrative stays the same. Your interactions with companions and NPCs can take on a completely different tone and direction.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bibliomania-flaw-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=Pa5ve57O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bibliomania-flaw-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=ciPdEeh- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Large choices obviously have larger consequences, but small actions also have an effect. As you progress through the game, you'll start racking up Flaws. Crouch often? You may have a Flaw discovered that your knees start to crack, reducing your stealth. If you steal frequently, you may end up as a Kleptomaniac, causing you to steal regardless of your current surroundings when you hover over an item. You don't have to accept a Flaw, but they can open new avenues for you to experience the title.</p>

<h2>More of the Same</h2>

<p>Even though there are a number of Flaws that can influence your playthroughs,&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>&nbsp;story focuses on the utilization of very few traits, skills, or perks. When it comes to impact, many of the perks you can select, and about half of the skills, don't seem to really affect the overall gameplay. All you need is Lockpicking, Brawny, Hack, Science, and Leadership (or Speech) to make it through the storyline quickly and easily. By the time that I reached the endgame, it was apparent that you should focus on three or four Skills and ignore the rest to reach the high-level requirements seen in the final missions.</p>

<p>The main way the majority of Traits and Skills are seen is through different dialogue options. Outside of that, interacting with the world, completing quests, or finding unique items, mainly require the same things over and over again. Even talking to people with specialized dialogue can become repetitive.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outer-worlds-2-perks-menu-scrabbles-perk-description.jpg?itok=NcufFWYE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outer-worlds-2-perks-menu-scrabbles-perk-description.jpg?itok=EqIqU-hx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Repetition isn't necessarily bad, especially when dealing with the strict dogma ingrained in the three factions found in <i>The Outer Worlds 2</i>. Getting the extent of brainwashing or cultural control across is one of the themes present. It gets to the point, however, that the game becomes uninteresting. It doesn't necessarily reach the level of boring, but there were quite a few conversations I skipped through because they sounded exactly like the one before it, or my dialogue resulted in the same conclusions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of that, there were a couple of bugs that impacted the game. Loot chests not disappearing off the mini map, bodies dematerializing without creating an ash or goo pile, NPCs or enemies spawning partially in the environment, and game crashes made the experience less than streamlined. Most of the bugs don't greatly impact a playthrough. Other bugs could be occurring that make playing the title difficult, including one experienced by a colleague that pretty much blocks them from using guns at any point in time.</p>

<h2><em>The Outer Worlds 2 Review</em>&nbsp;| Final Thoughts</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/archivist-dialogue-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=MAzPIzrT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/archivist-dialogue-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=wQGpF294 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>The Outer Worlds 2 </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Compared to other single-player RPG releases this year,&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>&nbsp;just falls flat. While there's nothing intrinsically wrong with the game, there's nothing that makes it stand out against star performers like <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="07f3b1f2-234f-4782-8556-c21c1fb23302" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" rel="nofollow">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</em>&nbsp;There wasn't any amazing writing, the focus on different societal structures and themes felt surface-level, and repetitive interactions made the title uninteresting. There was no hook that kept me wanting to play beyond reaching the end of the main story in the hopes that something amazing would wow me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For fans of&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cd8a1852-2307-4184-b0df-b9afab69154e" href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds" rel="nofollow">The Outer Worlds</a>,&nbsp;</em>the sequel is more of the same. Newcomers to the franchise can find humor laced throughout the game, unique weapons, and a mostly bug-free experience. Those looking for exquisite writing with a fresh take on RPG mechanics will not find great pleasure in&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have come to the conclusion that it was a mistake to play the demo for cyber <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a> Oneway.exe on my lunch break. I'm not going to tell you what I had for lunch - I think if I describe it in full, I will throw up. But I will say that it featured red peppers and purple onions, and I now wish never to see those colours ever again. 
</p>
<p>Also, it's possible that I'm <em>still</em> playing the demo for Oneway.exe, because the game takes place inside an off-brand mock-up of a desktop operating system. Yes, we are in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everything-is-going-to-be-ok">Everything Is Going To Be OK</a> territory. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hypnospace-outlaw">Hypnospace Outlaw</a>-ville. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pony-island">Pony Island</a>, er, land. But you never saw quite such... sights in either of those games, as far as I can remember. You never saw such reds and purples. You never saw such delightful little piggies. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>There is only one way to tell if I have successful exited Oneway.exe's demo, and that is to drag random images from my screenshots folder into the middle of this screen, and see if they are eaten. Let's try that now. Oh thank god. 
</p>
<p>Now, let me turn around slowly, just in case there is a hideously disfigured catgirl leering behind me. Ah phew, we're in the clear. All I can see is some guy having lunch in the house across the street. Argh, lunch. Let's not dwell upon such matters. Let's talk about the game, I guess, now that I have determined beyond reasonable doubt that I have ceased playing it.

<p>Created by Disordered Media - who wholesomely <a href="https://disorderedmedia.itch.io/">describe themselves</a> as "a husband and wife duo with a small group of friends with the shared passion of creating" - Oneway.exe is about being stuck inside another, abandoned game, Untitled.exe, and trying to work out what happened to its three developers, whose notes litter the desktop, and who are hopefully fictional.</p><p>It combines snatches of first-person exploration and puzzling with a seeping collage of impressively parodied aesthetics from across the history of the internet: gobbets of MySpace, video streams of a Minecraft-like game, discussions of "controversial indie games" on "Glitch", you get the idea. It's both a celebration of digital culture, and a putrid palimpsest of "the worst aspects of internet nostalgia", to cite a trailer blurb. It is windows upon windows upon windows, incoherent and hungry. 
</p>
<p>While firing up the game within the game, you're treated to some urban legends about a woman who had her skin peeled off. Then you're transported to a dark hallway of locked, labelled doors, plus one unlocked "Meaty" door leading to a bedroom. One wall of Meaty's bedroom is covered by what looks like a character editor from a noughties Barbie Flash game, which lets you toggle between dresses, hairdos and accessories in return for cake. The cake is used to feed a happy little mutilated piggy inside a virtual pet game on another wall.</p>
<p>A third wall carries a projection of a blog, where an unknown poster gushes in curly fonts about creativity and dressing up and did you ever think about how a blog is like a body with organs? (&gt;w&lt;) (&gt;w&lt;) The blogger boasts of having a "closet full of handmade dresses". Do not look in the closet. Lot of red and purple in there.

<p>Oneway.exe's body horror metaphors aren't exactly subtle, so far. Often, it just feels like a gleeful B-movie atrocity - squirming, cackling pulp. I doubt it has the wit, eerieness and pathos of Nathalie Lawhead's work. Still, there's a depth to its depthlessness. All the bloody, bony objects you find in Meaty's room are also flat images, invisible from the side. The New Flesh is still figuring out its own contours - there's a sense that all it can be, at the moment, is skin. But perhaps if you keep feeding it cake...
</p><p>The game's first "module" is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2349570/onewayexe_Module_10/">out now on Steam</a>, and it still has a demo as of writing. If you're interested in the demo, I strongly advise you look through the content warnings in the readme file on the game's simulated desktop, before playing Untitled.exe.</p>
<p>I also strongly advise that you consider the Steam reviews before buying, and maybe wait for the first patch - right now, there's talk of a glitch or two that blocks progress early on. As and when these technical problems are addressed, Oneway.exe has the makings of a memorable stomach-churner.

              <p>An easy way to breathe new life into a space is with lighting. You don’t need to swap out any furniture or rugs or anything like that. Simply adjusting where the light is coming from, how intense it is, and even the color can completely change how it feels to be in a room. A nice bright cool white for when doing chores like vacuuming or sweeping, a warmer soft white for when relaxing with a book, or vibrant colors that change on dime when jamming to some music or games — this is what’s possible with a set of Govee LED wall lights. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4952/">These RGBIC wall lights from Govee happen to be on sale at the moment.</a></p>
