                <p>One of the most annoying parts of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4's</a> endgame may soon see changes, as Blizzard has said it's looking to "fix" boss fight immunity phases.</p><p dir="ltr">In a response to a fan on <a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1938722534490546603" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a> (via <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/diablo-4s-boss-immunity-phases-might-soon-be-a-thing-of-the-past-377626?utm_source=bsky&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=250807&amp;utm_content=d4_immunity" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>) asking for Blizzard to remove the immunity phases from endgame bosses like Duriel, Andariel, and the Harbinger of Hatred, Diablo director of content and social marketing Adam Fletcher had a short-and-to-the-point answer.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1938722534490546603" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">There are plans to fix this up.</p>  — Adam Fletcher (@PezRadar) <a href="https://twitter.com/PezRadar/status/1938722534490546603?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 27, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">"There are plans to fix this up," Fletcher said.</p><p dir="ltr">Long immunity phases where bosses become invulnerable are currently a pain point in Diablo 4's endgame post-Season 8, which made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-season-8-is-making-endgame-bosses-stronger-simpler-to-access-and-more-rewarding/1100-6530970/" data-ref-id="1100-6530970">bosses harder but also more rewarding</a>. Even though a player may be capable of dealing enough damage to kill a Tormented boss in just a few blows, there are instead multiple periods where players are forced to endure various mechanics while the boss becomes invincible for a set amount of time.</p><p dir="ltr">The immunity phases are especially annoying (and have been basically since the game's launch) for the Echo of Lilith boss fight due to her attacks causing a stacking debuff that will eventually one-shot players. Add on the fact that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-8-players-are-fed-up-with-its-bugged-lilith-boss-fight/1100-6532596/" data-ref-id="1100-6532596">Lilith fight has been bugged</a> recently so that she sometimes never leaves her invulnerability phase, and players are largely fed up with having to wait to deal damage despite being strong enough to kill bosses outright.</p><p dir="ltr">What specific changes to Diablo 4's endgame bosses, or when they may arrive, are still a mystery, as Fletcher didn't elaborate further. However, Fletcher recently had this to say on social media following Blizzard's recent Diablo 4 Season 9 Campfire Chat livestream.</p><p dir="ltr">"Just know, your warcries of wanting more change aren't going unnoticed," Fletcher <a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1938720086338216264" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>. "The team has been cooking on some of the biggest changes that really hit home on things people have been asking for and more. We will share more as we get closer."</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 9 started July 1 and will run through September 23. Blizzard has not yet outlined more concrete plans for Season 10, but players can hope that some of the bigger changes Fletcher is alluding to will arrive around then.</p><p dir="ltr">In the meantime, players have recently discovered an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-now-has-a-very-easy-to-replicate-infinite-damage-bug/1100-6533026/" data-ref-id="1100-6533026">easy Diablo 4 infinite-damagebug</a> for the Sorcerer that will likely be fixed soon. In addition to changes for Diablo 4, Blizzard has also teased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cryptic-diablo-2-anniversary-tweet-is-giving-fans-hope-for-new-content/1100-6532876/" data-ref-id="1100-6532876">Diablo 2 news</a>, which fans are hoping is new content for the classic ARPG.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Time Flies has a simple and humorous premise. Players control a fly and must complete a long bucket list over a short life span. The game has been buzzing around since its reveal in 2022, but it’s finally landing later this month.</p><p>Developed by Playables designers Michael Frei and Raphaël Munoz, creators of similarly sparse abstract games such as <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/kids/standing-out-by-blending-in">Kids</a> and Plug &amp; Play, this hand-drawn black-and-white adventure tasks players with buzzing around a house to complete a checklist. This includes learning an instrument, becoming wealthy, or getting drunk. Goals are both explicit and obscure, and the challenge comes in figuring out how to accomplish them as a tiny fly before its brief life expires.</p><p url="https://youtu.be/FzAwgAIXn28?si=njDmdSiVMyocZEPZ" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FzAwgAIXn28" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The fly's average life expectancy ranges around 60 seconds, though this varies based on your physical location (which you’ll enter at the game’s start). Dying means starting the whole game anew, though your progress hastens as you learn how to complete tasks more quickly. Time Flies’ description succinctly sums up the thematic core of the experience: “Make the best of the time you have left, because we’re all going to die.”</p><p>“Flies are pretty annoying, and we’ve been listening to one every day for the past four years of game development,” says Michael Frei in a press release. “Please do your part and Wishlist the game now, I really need therapy.”</p><p>We played Time Flies during Summer Game Fest 2022, and were amused and engrossed during our short time with it.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/08/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-patch-adds-a-chronological-story-mode/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s a new update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a>, which adds a new way to play through the game’s story with the chronological mode.</p>
<p>The new feature is added today in patch 2.1.0 for PS5 and patch 1.5 for the game on PC via Steam and Epic.</p>


<p>The Last of Us Part 2 was released with a story that plays out non-linearly, showing Ellie and Abby’s stories in a jumbled up order that also blends in flashbacks alongside the present-day story.</p>
<p>“Through the new Chronological mode,” Naughty Dog’s Jonathan Dornbush writes, “we believe players will gain even deeper insight into Part II’s narrative. Players will be able to see how Ellie being gifted a guitar flows so neatly into her learning to play, for example, while the journey through Seattle will showcase the fascinating parallels between Ellie and Abby’s crisscrossing journeys. You’ll see just how close they come into running into each other, how their actions impact each other, and more.”</p>
<p>The studio still recommends playing the game as it was originally put together, but this gives a potentially fresh perspective. If you do play this way, however, you will be able to unlock two new skins that dress Joel up as Nathan Drake and Tommy up as Sam Drake, made available for the No Return roguelike survival mode.</p>

<p>That this update even exists is an unusual one, coming half a decade after the game’s original launch on PS4, and in some ways it feels like this echoes <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/12/04/going-back-to-beyond-two-souls-on-ps4/">the chronological story mode added to Beyond: Two Souls</a> for its PS4 remaster. It’s also strangely timed to release this after Season 2 of HBO’s The Last of Us adaptation, which inherited the non-linear story of the game. Surely if there was a time to reconsider how the tale was to be unspooled, it would have been through the TV series? Certainly, this could have helped with some of the most…. disliked narrative points in both game and TV show.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered Review –&nbsp;Is it worth upgrading?" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s7rBjOlu5NQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Looking back at The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered’s release for PS5, Gamoc said, “The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered refines and improves a much misunderstood masterpiece. It’s hard not to be amazed at how good this game still looks, and it comes with a new mode and some behind the scenes stuff to enjoy. It’s not as big a step from the original release as TLOU Part 1 was, and so feels like a less noteworthy release, but the price for upgrading from PS4 is reasonable for what you get. For those who haven’t played it, this will be the best version to play, even if it’s just for No Return to add some more longevity without all the incredibly intense emotional stress of the main story.”</p>

<p>Say hello to 'Ninsight'</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Ninsight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/602666d8c3dbf/ninsight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ninty Media</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ninty Media, the team behind magazines such as The Vita Lounge, Switch Player, and Ninty Fresh, has launched a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nintymedia/ninsight-the-new-nintendo-switch-2-magazine">Kickstarter campaign</a> for a new venture called 'Ninsight'.</p>
<p>With the first issue shipping globally in August, Ninsight aims to provide the latest Nintendo-themed news, reviews, and talking points in a premium, 80-100 page magazine with zero adverts. At the time of writing, over half of the Kickstarter's £5,000 goal has been achieved with 16 days remaining.</p>
<p>According to the overview, the move over to Ninsight was due to rising costs in maintaining production for Switch Player. Moving over to a new model which focuses on fewer releases and higher-quality content will hopefully result in a more viable business long-term.</p>

<p>You can offer up a pledge right now if you wish, with digital copies of the magazine costing £4 and physical versions costing £7. A premium edition at £20 will also include an art print of the cover art and a poster. Backers of the premium edition will also get an enamel pin badge and their names in the mag.</p>
<p>So if you miss the days of NGamer and ONM, then this might well be worth a punt. We'll certainly be keeping a close eye on it!</p>

			<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-digital-showcase-returns-on-august-1st/">THQ Nordic Showcase</a> that will take place at the beginning of next month, developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-qa-alkimia-talks-about-expanding-the-classic-rpg/">Alkimia Interactive</a> has published its latest 'Making Of' video going behind the scenes on the development of the Gothic Remake, this time focusing on the studio's approach to the game's art style.</p>



<p>"<em>We also decided very early on, we are not making an HD version of the art style of the original, that's not our goal</em>," says the game director and studio head at Alkimia Interactive, Reinhard Pollice, at the top of the video. Pollice and the studio's art director, Daniel Candil, continue to elaborate on how they were working with opposing forces in developing this remake, as they wanted to make it look grounded and realistic, while also properly displaying the more fantastical and magical elements of Gothic.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Gothic 1 Remake | Making Of #03: Art Vision" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YyM_6IzRFHY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The Gothic 1 Remake was first announced all the way back in 2019 with a surprise teaser demo being released for players to check out. It wasn't until <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-gothic-remake-is-happening-after-all-and-itll-be-grittier-than-the-demo/">2020, however,</a> that we knew for sure that the remake was in development, and it has been in the works ever since. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-killing-floor-3-and-titan-quest-ii-to-launch-by-march-2025-alongside-three-unannounced-games/">May 2024</a>, we learned that the remake was meant to be out by March 2025, though all we've received so far this year is a new demo that debuted during the year's first Steam Next Fest event in February 2025. Alkimia Interactive has even taken <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-gets-demo-update-following-communitys-feedback/">feedback from players who checked out the demo</a> and committed to making several significant changes. </p>



<p>Currently, there's still no proper release date set for the Gothic Remake, though it's entirely possible that we'll finally learn of when it'll be on store shelves during the upcoming THQ Nordic Showcase in August.</p>

That could have meant it was tricky to add him to the full roster, so they added him as a secret character, but they really wanted people to be able to play as him. It’s been nearly two decades since Bam was in a <em>Tony Hawk </em>game! So the devs set his price to something pretty low and made it easy to unlock him within minutes of booting the game, effectively making him a playable character right from the moment you start.<br></p><p>Regardless, you’ve probably stopped reading this blog ages ago because you went to unlock him<em>.</em> So I’ll just keep thinking about this grand conspiracy alone. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-bam-margera-how-to-unlock-easy-fast-tip-guide-1851785804]]></content:encoded>

That doesn’t detract from the original experience, nor does it make it any less the ‘canonical’ version of the story.” Sure, disembodied voice. Devoid of all other context surrounding this game and franchise, it just sounds like a neat way to experience a story the second time around. If it were an unlockable mode that becomes available after you finish the game for the first time, maybe I could buy into that.

This is why the flashback-heavy format is so crucial to the story it tells, and is one of the many reasons HBO’s show feels like a fundamental misunderstanding of the story it’s adapting. Denying the player cathartic, easy answers is a core part of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, and laying out its story in the most straightforward, literal way feels like capitulating to an audience that already didn’t like the story you told in the first place, whether they knew why Abby killed Joel early on or not. There are plenty of criticisms to be thrown at <em>Part II</em>, but you can’t say it wasn’t deliberate in the experience it was trying to convey.

            <p>
Activision has pulled the PC Game Pass version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-ww2">Call of Duty: WW2</a> offline while it investigates an unspecified "issue" some reports claim is a remote code execution exploit that's left some players grappling with app pop-ups, PC shut downs, and even screens full of pornography.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty: WW2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-games-list-this-month-price-6400">made its PC Game Pass debut at the end of June</a>, but the celebrations were short-lived. The shooter has now been taken offline, affecting both the Game Pass and the PC Microsoft Store release, but not those available elsewhere, including Steam and Battle.net.
</p>
<p>
As to why this has happened, Activision's <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085">official response</a> is vague, only saying the game was "brought offline while we investigate reports of an issue". However, there's evidence from the community that the newly released version of Call of Duty: WW2 may be vulnerable to remote code execution exploits, enabling an attacker to run malicious code on a player's PC.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty streamer Wrioh, for instance, posted to social media with claims of being "hacked". An <a href="https://x.com/wrioh75753/status/1940597447467979053">accompanying video</a> showed their gaming session being interrupted by a pop-up text window proclaiming to have "just RCE'd your ass", before it's revealed Wrioh's desktop wallpaper has been changed to an image of a <a href="https://labusinessjournal.com/advertorials/most-influential-intellectual-property-attorney-mm/">beaming lawyer</a>.
</p>
<p>
In <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1940639088576811516">another post</a>, the VX-Underground malware and cybersecurity research collective (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-ww2-pulled-from-pc-following-reports-of-remote-code-exploit-trolling-players-with-notepad-pop-ups-pc-shutdowns-and-desktop-wallpaper-of-a-lawyer/">PC Gamer</a>) shared additional images of a purported CoD: WW2 RCE attack, including an in-game error message featuring the phrase, "Your PC is now mine". In an accompanying message, VX-Underground referenced an "unpatched RCE exploit" and claimed, "Someone is trolling gamers with Notepad pop ups, PC shutdowns, and gay pornography."
</p>
<p>
VX-Underground member Smelly then <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1940889734269501446">provided an "educated guess"</a> as to what's happening in Wrioh's video. "The concern in this particular case," they summarised, "is that this means an attacker is capable of deploying information stealer malware, a RAT (remote administration tool), or ransomware. Thankfully, it appears this attacker is primarily interested in memeing and fucking with people." There's a little more technical detail in the full post.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty: WW2 for PC Game Pass and the Microsoft Store has now been offline since the weekend, with no sign of its imminent return and no update from Activision. While RCE vulnerabilities have been associated with numerous other games in recent years, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-patches-a-security-vulnerability-that-could-give-hackers-full-console-takeover">Nintendo's Mario Kart 8</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-fixes-cs-go-exploit-that-could-give-hackers-control-of-pcs">Valve's Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</a>, perhaps the most notable example is FromSoftware's Dark Souls series. It took over ten months for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-souls-remastered-finally-gets-its-online-features-back-on-pc">Dark Souls Remastered's online support to be restored</a> after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-souls-online-servers-are-down-following-reports-of-a-security-issue">being pulled in 2022</a>, so Call of Duty: WW2 fans will likely be hoping for a speedier resolution. We've asked Activision for comment.

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World Rainbow Road" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/053a632e731bd/mario-kart-world-rainbow-road.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has only been out for a month, but as you'd expect, speedrunners are already aiming to destroy race track times in the game's Time Trial mode, and a familiar face is already dominating the competition on one particular track (thanks <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/611310/mario-kart-world-rainbow-road-record-twitch">Polygon</a>!).</p>
<p>Twitch streamer and <strong>Geometry Dash</strong> expert <a href="http://twitch.tv/technicaljl">Technical</a> is the current world record holder in the new iteration of Rainbow Road after spending over a hundred hours perfecting the course and tricking his way to the best time.</p>
<p>In Time Trial mode, Rainbow Road is broken up into four sections, with each section taking over a minute on average for your garden variety Mario Kart World player. Yet Technical has managed to complete the entire course in 3:39:987, and he's currently on top.</p>
<p>The world record has been in flux ever since the game's release, with the leader changing 34 times over the course of the past month. Technical is the very first person to break the four-minute barrier, which means the game is well and truly on at this point. Have a watch below.</p>

<p>This <em>should</em><em>n't</em> be a huge surprise, however; Technical is also the world record holder for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mario_kart_8">Mario Kart 8</a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">8 Deluxe</a>'s Rainbow Road (<a href="https://mkwrs.com/mk8dx/display.php?track=Rainbow+Road&amp;m=200">on 200cc</a>). So you could say he's a bit of an expert at the multicoloured course.</p>
<p>Many thought hitting the sub-four minute mark would take a lot longer than it has, but many players have been extremely close to breaking that barrier, but a combination of track length and a late-race trick have proven difficult.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping an eye on this over the coming months — and likely years. Perhaps 3:55 is the next milestone?</p>
<p><em>What do you think of the new Rainbow Road? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>

		<p>The last things you want to hear from one of your friends and colleagues is "hey, I'm in the ER." This happened to <em>me</em> a few weeks back when my five-year-old broke her arm—which, thank <em>god</em>, we're nearly over with—and then today, as Rob informed Chia and I that he had, quoting a Discord message, "tripped on a fucking ottoman." Simultaneously, Chia said they had<em> sun sickness.</em> (It's been extremely hot in many places over the past few weeks.) So, we're a little battered and bruised at <em>Remap</em> this week.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Blue Prince </em>is one of the most acclaimed puzzle games ever made, yet I almost put it down for good within ten hours of playing. Don’t get me wrong, I love puzzle games and roguelikes. I just quickly felt overwhelmed as I tried to gather clues and contend with the ever-changing Mt. Holly manor every in-game day. I started to think that this acclaimed mystery just wasn’t for me…until my girlfriend sat beside me on my couch and started to enjoy it with me.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195891" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="156" data-playlist="195891,196013,195301" data-current="195891"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21406.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>No disrespect to Hazelight Studios’ stellar <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470"><em>Split Fiction</em></a></span>, but <em>Blue Prince</em> is one of my favorite co-op games of 2025. The <em>House of Leaves</em>-esque premise is reminiscent of tabletop puzzle games, and the roguelike structure is somehow perfect for two or more people to enjoy together. Here’s what a second set of eyes brings to this otherwise single player experience.</p><h2 id="h52335"><a id="1"></a>The notebook is a controller</h2><p>To solve every riddle in <em>Blue Prince </em>yourself, you’ll need pen and paper by your side. That’s not an exaggeration: The game <em>literally </em>tells you to take notes, as the clues you find in one room might become relevant several in-game days later in a totally different location. If you’re flying solo, this can feel overwhelming to manage. There’s just so much to take in that constantly stopping to jot down notes can seriously slow your progression.</p><p>This is where a second person helps a lot! Not only does it help to talk through certain puzzles (looking at you, Parlor Room), a pair of hands dedicated to note taking means you don’t have to constantly stop to record observations. Additionally, when a second person can focus on reviewing notes during downtime, you’re both more likely to find that one missing link you need to overcome any especially baffling puzzles.</p><h2 id="h52336"><a id="2"></a>The roguelike structure makes it easy to take turns</h2><p>Lest you think I’m encouraging player two to take on all the stuff you don’t want to do, the design of <em>Blue Prince</em> makes it easy to alternate who’s in the hot seat. Since this is a roguelike, the end of a run marks a convenient time to hand off the controller to your partner so you can become the notetaker for the next run. You’ll (probably) feel ready for a break after an hour-long run anyway, and your partner can start with a mostly clean slate as they get their bearings with the game.</p><figure id="" data-id="50f3305a824df27c317471c8a19ad070" data-recommend-id="image://50f3305a824df27c317471c8a19ad070" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Blue Prince.

It’s easy to get caught in a loop of exploring the same rooms repeatedly because you rely on certain items or resources. Watching someone else play lets you see rooms or details you wouldn’t normally notice yourself, or you might notice a clue that you want to pursue during your next run. <em>Blue Prince</em> is all about information gathering, and a different perspective makes that pursuit much easier.</p><h2 id="h52337"><a id="3"></a>All the action is cerebral</h2><p>This technically applies to all puzzle games, and it’s doubly true of <em>Blue Prince</em>. No challenge in this game is a test of reflexes or memorizing complex combos; you’re here to read books, gather clues, and solve riddles. For this reason, you don’t need to be in literal control of <em>Blue Prince </em>to <em>play</em> <em>Blue Prince</em>. Two or more people can easily contribute to looking around a room, pointing out details that might be relevant later, or dissecting a vague note that might be helpful later.</p><figure id="" data-id="a32879cb00a6193b9f465304cdbbfbe3" data-recommend-id="image://a32879cb00a6193b9f465304cdbbfbe3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Blue Prince.

Notes and pictures are pinned to a board." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>More importantly, <em>Blue Prince</em> expects you to crack these granular puzzles while you simultaneously manage your stock of keys, gems, and steps to make the most out of your in-game day. This can feel stressful, especially in the early game. However, with two or more people, you can divide up the cognitive load to make the game more digestible. For example, I typically handled the resource management and house layout, while my girlfriend specialized in room exploration and picking out details that’d become helpful later. </p><p><br>You don’t have to follow this formula to a tee, of course. For best results, chat with your unofficial <em>Blue Prince</em> co-op partner about your strengths and weaknesses when it comes to puzzle solving, and come up with a game plan that works for you. Regardless of what you come up with, just exchanging notes and hints with another person is one of the most fun parts of <em>Blue Prince</em>. It’s an experience well worth sharing, and if it still doesn’t turn out to be your cup of tea, well, maybe you can give <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470"><em>Split Fiction</em></a></span> the respect I’ve so wrongfully snubbed it of instead.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/blue-prince-puzzle-co-op-players-puzzles-roguelike-1851785805]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> Season 9 launched July 1, and it hasn't taken long for players to discover an infinite-damage bug for the Sorcerer class that is trivializing the ARPG's hardest content. Even worse, it's not hard to replicate.</p><p dir="ltr">As broken down by Diablo content creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6FLFrumkg0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mekuna</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/infinite-damage-strikes-again-as-diablo-4-players-overthrow-the-tyranny-of-mathematics-with-an-exploit-that-grants-sorcerers-the-power-of-the-gods-no-way-that-they-leave-that-in-the-game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), the bug revolves around the Sorcerer's Enlightenment Key Passive, which can be activated by casting skills of a different element to generate Enlightenment stacks. At 100 stacks, the Sorcerer becomes Enlightened and benefits from increased damage, mana regeneration, and attack speed for a limited time.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6FLFrumkg0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c6FLFrumkg0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That's simple enough, but the passive is currently interacting with a new seasonal power, Smoldering Embers, that for some reason causes the damage bonus from Enlightenment to go through the roof when entering portals to a new area. By proccing Enlightenment right before going to a portal, the Sorcerer's elemental damage multipliers start to go up exponentially, with Mekuna's video showing how at one point, after going through several portals using the bug, his Sorcerer had plus 581,000,000,000% more Lightning damage.</p><p dir="ltr">With such absurd numbers, any enemy in Diablo 4 becomes child's play. Pit 150, the current hardest challenge in Diablo 4, can be cleared in under a minute, as everything instantly melts around a Sorcerer taking advantage of the bug.</p><p dir="ltr">"Hopefully that's going to be fixed quickly," Mekuna said in his video explaining the bugged build. "We don't need that in the game."</p><p dir="ltr">Just a few days ago, players <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk6SW_yOZIg&amp;t=217s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> another bugged Sorcerer build that also took advantage of the interaction between Enlightenment and Smoldering Embers. That build, however, was much more difficult to replicate, as it required cycling Enlightenment with another modifier that, while possible, required far more precision.</p><p dir="ltr">This new version of the bugged build doesn't require any careful stacking of modifiers and is so easy that basically anyone can do it. For that reason it's almost certainly now on Blizzard's radar, but there hasn't been any official word on when a fix might be coming, though one would hope it's soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 9 is scheduled to run until September 23. In addition to letting players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-let-players-build-their-own-spells/1100-6531782/" data-ref-id="1100-6531782">craft their own Horadric spells</a>, Season 9 brought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-bring-big-permanent-changes-to-nightmare-dungeons/1100-6532690/" data-ref-id="1100-6532690">permanent changes to the game's Nightmare dungeons</a>.

            <p>If you have already played The Last of Us Part 2 on its initial PS4 release, plus again thanks to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-tech-analysis">souped-up PlayStation 5 Part 2 Remastered release</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-finally-gets-itself-a-pc-release-date">then once more on PC</a>, but still want to play through the game <em>yet again</em> but with another new twist, well now you can.</p>
<p>Developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> has today announced a free update for Part 2 Remastered across PS5 and PC, which will let you play through Ellie and Abby's stories chronologically. <strong>Please be aware of potential spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2 below. </strong></p>

<p>"Those who have already played will know its story is told non-linearly, as Ellie and Abby's motivations, realisations, and emotional stakes unfold across myriad flashbacks and present-day storylines," Naughty Dog wrote in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/introducing-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-experience-out-today/">blog post detailing this Part 2 update</a>.</p>
<p>"While this structure is very intentional and core to how our studio wanted Part 2's themes and narrative beats to impact players, we always wondered what it would be like to experience this story chronologically. And now finally, we can answer that question."</p>
<p>Naughty Dog hopes that replaying Part 2 with Ellie and Abby's stories more interwoven like this will give players a deeper understanding and insight into the game's narrative. It noted now, players will see Ellie receive her guitar from Joel and then her learning to play in a more fluid manner.</p>
<p>Then, when it comes to Seattle, players will see just how close Ellie and Abby actually come to crossing paths as they each make their way through the city on their own journeys of revenge and grief.</p>
<p>"It was no small feat to bring The Last of Us Part 2's story chronologically together, given that Part 2's story is so meticulously put together," Naughty Dog said, adding new trophies have also been added as part of this update for those who complete the game in chronological order.</p>
<p>In addition to base game tweaks, this update will also include two new skins for The Last of Us Part 2's roguelike mode No Return. In a Naughty Dog crossover, players who complete The Last of Us Part 2's narrative chronologically will be able to adorn Joel in Nathan Drake of Uncharted fame's garb. Tommy, meanwhile, has got himself a Sam Drake skin.</p>

<p>"We here at Naughty Dog are so grateful for all the love and support we've seen from The Last of Us fans these last few months," Naughty Dog closed. "From the launch of The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered on PC, to The Last of Us Complete on PlayStation 5, to seeing your weekly reactions to season two of the television series, it's been such a pleasure to celebrate this moment with you."</p>
<p>As for the TV series, The Last of Us season two wrapped earlier this year, with subsequent seasons still to conclude Part 2's narrative. Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">Naughty Dog studio head Neil Druckmann announced he was stepping away from the adaptation</a>. Soon after, Halley Gross - who co-wrote The Last of Us Part 2 with Druckmann, before also working on the show - announced she was also taking a step back from the HBO series to focus on other projects.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-now-play-the-last-of-us-part-2-in-yet-another-way-as-naughty-dog-releases-chronological-mode]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has announced that the Ghost of Yōtei gameplay reveal State of Play stream will take place this Thursday, 10th July at 10PM UK time.</p>
<p>The State of Play stream will bring around 20 minutes of new Ghost of Yōtei gameplay, hosted by Sucker Punch Creative Directors Jason Connell and Nate Fox.</p>


<p>In particular, we can expect to see Atsu’s new weapons, how you can personalise your journey through Japan, new special modes and more hints at the game’s story.</p>
<p>So, tune in at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayStation">the official YouTube channel</a> 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BST / 11pm CEST on 10th July for all those juicy details.</p>
<p>But here’s what we know so far.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> is not a direct sequel to Jin Sakai’s story, but is instead jumping forward in time by a couple hundred years and to a new location. Set in the Ezo region (modern day Hokkaido) around Mount Yôtei and in the year 1603, there’s a real Western vibe to some of the scenery and imagery that has been used for the game’s trailers.</p>
<p>That means there’s also a new Ghost to play as, named Atsu. Hers, as is so often the case for this kind of fiction, is a tale of revenge. A gang of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six killed Atsu’s family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree. But she’s not dead, and instead spent the last sixteen years learning to fight, kill and hunt. Now she’s returning to her home to track down The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito one by one and seek vengeance.</p>
<p>Looking back on out original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/14/ghost-of-tsushima-review/">Ghost of Tsushima review</a>, Aran said, “Ghost of Tsushima is an artistic triumph, capturing a real cinematic feel through its visuals, immersive world and soundtrack. However, Jin is a serviceable main character and he and his journey to save Tsushima is often overshadowed by secondary characters and smaller, more personal stories found in the side quests. Throw in some formulaic missions and an awkward user interface, and Ghost of Tsushima is at times more style than substance.”</p>
<p>Ghost of Yōtei will launch on 20th October for PS5.</p>

<p>"Man, that was seriously lame"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>You might remember prior to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3</a>'s launch in 2022 that a bit of controversy made the rounds online regarding voice actor Hellena Taylor.</p>
<p>Taylor, who had voiced the titular protagonist in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_2">Bayonetta 2</a>, had been replaced by Jennifer Hale following a pay dispute with PlatinumGames. This was brought to the forefront by Taylor herself via a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-given-the-voice-artist-controversy-will-you-be-boycotting-bayonetta-3">video message posted to social media</a>, with the resulting fallout leading to abuse thrown left, right, and centre to Taylor, Hale, and even the series' writer, Hideki Kamiya.</p>
<p>In a new video from Kamiya, the creator addressed the fallout from the controversy in response to a fan's question, opting to avoid discussing the controversy itself, but rather the way others had treated him online following the whole drama.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It was wild. My Twitter timeline was just flying by in real time – it was insane. Just nonstop scrolling. I kept blocking nonstop, though. But even my speed I couldn't keep up. So I was like 'What?! They're coming in faster than I can block them? WHAT?!'</p>
<p>"Anyway, that's not the point. People were saying whatever they wanted. Even famous people were jumping in and throwing comments at me. And then, once things calmed down, I went back and looked – and they had quietly deleted their tweets. Hey, apologise to me first before you do anything sneaky. That's some real coward s***.</p>
<p>"You posted it publicly on social media, right? So if you were wrong, you should publicly admit it. Say "Hey, I messed up" – own it. At least that's how I try to be. I may act like this, but I do have my own code. If I'm not wrong? Then no, I absolutely won't apologise. No chance. But when I am wrong, I'll own it properly.</p>
<p>"Man, that was seriously lame."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although not mentioned by Kamiya himself, one of the "famous people" he spoke about was supposedly the voice actor Bryan Dechart, who perhaps most notably played Connor in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/detroit_become_human">Detroit: Become Human</a>. As demonstrated by a screengrab shown on-screen in the video, Dechart had tweeted to Kamiya to say "Those who treat others well are treated well in return. You make us all sad. Greed is ugly".</p>
<p>Thankfully, it seems the controversy is, by and large, behind us now. Bayonetta 3 launched to widespread critical acclaim, though its future is undoubtedly uncertain following the departure from Kamiya from PlatinumGames. He is now working on a sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/okami">Okami</a> in collaboration with Capcom.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-mode-update/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-new-update-for-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-lets-you-play-the-story-in-chronological-order.1238361/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new update for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/">The Last of Us Part II Remastered</a> lets you play through the game's story in chronological order. That means instead of how the original game is structured, where you play through Ellie's three days in Seattle, followed by Abby's, you'll crisscross between them, jumping back and forth from Ellie to Abby in chronological order. </p>



<p>Anyone who has played The Last of Us Part II will know that this significantly changes how you experience the story. Controversial as it was, part of what made The Last of Us Part II a memorable game was how it challenged players to reflect on their feelings towards Abby in its back half, and to see her as more than just Joel's killer, which is all you know about her from the beginning of the game's story up until you swap to playing as her after the end of Ellie's third day in Seattle.</p>



<p>There's also an extremely significant scene between Ellie and Joel that takes place in Jackson, the day before he dies, that makes for an extremely impactful moment at the end of the game when it is revealed. Now, that scene will come at the very beginning, and like everything else that is getting switched around, it'll be interesting, to say the least, to see how many of the game's powerful moments retain their strength, or lose it, due to this new order. </p>



<p>"<em>Those who have already played will know its story is told non-linearly, as Ellie and Abby's motivations, realizations, and emotional stakes unfold across myriad flashbacks and present-day storylines,</em>" writes Jonathan Dornbush, editorial manager at Naughty Dog in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/introducing-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-experience-out-today/">PlayStation Blog post</a> announcing the update. </p>



<p>"<em>While this structure is very intentional and core to how our studio wanted Part II's themes and narrative beats to impact players, we always wondered what it would be like to experience this story chronologically. And now finally, we can answer that question."</em></p>



<p>"<em>Through the new chronological mode, we believe players will gain deeper insight into Part II's narrative. Players will be able to see how Ellie being gifted at guitar flows so neatly into her learning to play, for example, while the journey through Seattle will showcase the fascinating parallels between Ellie and Abby's crisscrossing journeys. You'll see just how close they come into running into each other, how their actions impact each other, and more</em>."</p>



<p>The update is out today, on PlayStation and PC, and also includes a number of bug fixes and performance updates. It also includes new skins for Joel and Tommy for the game's No Return mode. Joel gets an outfit making him look like Nathan Drake from Uncharted, while Tommy gets to don the look of Nate's brother, Sam Drake.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you're like me, and don't understand who would want this in the first place after playing the story as it was originally intended to be experienced, then you don't have to fret, since it is an optional mode that you can ignore whenever you return to The Last of Us Part II. And if you've never played The Last of Us Part II before, Naughty Dog still recommends you play it the way it was originally developed, before diving into this new mode.</p>



<p>"<em>It was no small feat to bring The Last of Us Part II's story chronologically together, given that Part II's story is so meticulously put together. We're grateful to the developers both at Naughty Dog and our partners at Nixxes to make the chronological mode as smooth as possible. And while we of course recommend players still new to the game to play through Part II's story as was originally developed, the team's hard work has paid off with a fascinating new way to enjoy this chapter</em>."</p>



<p>You can jump into this new mode once you've downloaded the update, or, if Naughty Dog's history is anything to go by, you can wait until the seemingly inevitable The Last of Us Part II Remastered: Chronological Mode Remake is announced and play it then.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Naughty Dog has released a new update for&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered&nbsp;</em>that allows you to experience the game's harrowing story of revenge in a completely new way.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/introducing-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-experience-out-today/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, the rather appropriately-named Chronological Experience lets you play through&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em>'s narrative in chronological order, rather than in the non-linear fashion in which it's originally presented.</p>

<p>The studio says that while the original structure is "very intentional and core to how [Naughty Dog] wanted&nbsp;<em>Part II</em>'s themes and narrative beats to impact players", the new Chronological mode will grant players "even deeper insight into&nbsp;<em>Part II</em>'s narrative".</p>

<p>The studio does stress that it still recommends newcomers play through&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part II&nbsp;</em>"as was originally developed", but that the new story mode is a "fascinating new way to enjoy this chapter".</p>

<p>It's not just the new mode, either. If you complete a Chronological playthrough, you'll be rewarded with&nbsp;<em>Uncharted</em>-themed skins for Joel and Tommy in the game's No Return mode. There's a Nathan Drake skin for Joel, as well as a skin based on Drake's brother Sam for Tommy.</p>

<p>The Chronological update is available now for&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part II&nbsp;</em>on both PC and PS5, and you'll also find "a host of additional bug fixes and performance improvements" contained in the update.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>news, co-creator Neil Druckmann recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-steps-down-hbo-the-last-of-us" rel="nofollow">vacated his creative role</a> on the successful HBO show in order to spend more time with Naughty Dog.

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531310/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_Remastered/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

No, it’s not like there was a recent golden era where the news bulletins were packed with incessant good cheer, but we’re a species that’s still reeling from the trauma of covid, inundated by news of wars, suffering, and the inevitable consequences of capitalism’s unchecked overreach, all while major nations elect cruel people incapable of tying their own shoelaces. </p><p>As I looked through the feeds and wires this morning, it all just felt too heavy. And honestly, under that weight, I couldn’t bring myself to plaster on a smile and report the (genuinely fun) news that Crocs are partnering with Nintendo to make <em>Animal Crossing</em>-themed plastic shoes. But no! I’m not going to let all the bad news squish me, and I don’t want it to squish you either. So instead I’ve put together a bunch of things that make me smile, that I want to share and hopefully cause you to smile too.</p><h2 id="h74983"><a id=""></a>Slings &amp; Arrows</h2><p>If you’ve met me in real life, there’s a very strong chance I’ve already recommended 2003's <em>Slings &amp; Arrows </em>to you, complete with terrible attempts on my part to deliver lines like main character Geoffrey Tennant (Paul Gross). Fortunately, you’ve likely been spared this, and instead I’ve put the scene I love to quote from above.</p><p><em>Slings &amp; Arrows</em> was a Canadian TV show, set in a fictional theater that hosts the annual New Burbage Shakespeare Festival. However, moments before the new season was due to start, director Oliver Welles (Stephen Ouimette) dies. The festival is forced to beg the return of Geoffrey Tennant, a former actor and director who left New Burbage after a massive falling out and a following  stint in a psychiatric facility. Each of the three six-episode seasons follows Tennant’s attempts to put on a specific Shakespeare play, battling against money-men, egos, and perhaps most of all, the ghost of Oliver Welles.</p><p>It is one of the most extraordinary pieces of television ever made. Its love for and knowledge of Shakespeare makes it an education, and its dark humor ensures it always feels punchy and passionate. Alongside the incredible Paul Gross (<em>Due South</em>’s Benton Fraser) is Martha Burns as Ellen Fanshaw, an actor coming to terms with now playing Gertrude rather than Ophelia, and <em>The Kids in the Hall</em>’s Mark McKinney as Richard Smith-Jones, a desperately useless manager who fails to please everyone.</p><p>All three seasons are a joy. Nearly every relationship is antagonistic, especially those between Geoffrey and absolutely everyone else, and yet the love and care and depth of understanding from the cast shines through it all in every moment. It is a thing of beauty that’ll make you want to understand Shakespeare more, just so you can feel like part of the gang. And if not, you’ve always got the glorious Seán Cullen’s sot critic, Basil, to have your back.</p><p>It’s not always easy to find these days, but <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/0MNKEGPHP8XR0XYEU7AEBEUBW6?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/saints-row-4-homestar-runner-sherlock-holmes-1851785792&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">right now you can buy it via Amazon</a></span>.</p><h2 id="h74984"><a id=""></a>Saints Row IV</h2><p>I will not tire of celebrating <em>Saints Row IV</em> in a world where I feel like this game gets short shrift. Here’s my declaration: <em>Saints Row IV</em> is funny in the most enormously elaborate ways. It’s a game that exists to make you laugh on  a vast scale. It feels like something that shouldn’t have been able to happen in an industry that’s so focused on the necessity of producing massive hits that it tends to shave the corners off everything to appeal to the widest audience possible. But <em>SRIV</em> thrives in its stupidity.</p><p>This is a game that begins with you disarming a nuclear missile you’re clung to while it’s in flight, crashing through the roof of the White House to be president, and then watching helpless as the entire world is destroyed by invading aliens. That’s the opening sequence. The rest of the game is set in a digital reproduction of the city from <em>Saints Row III</em>, all for the amusement of a tiresome alien overlord who comes across like a gormless boss who has no idea how disliked he is by his employees. Oh, and you now have superpowers.</p><p>This is a game that asked, “What if you could just do what you like?” Some people found it too much, too un-serious. I find it just a complete joy. And it helps that it delivers all these histrionics with the most incredible dialogue and acting. It’s just so, so funny. This is a game that gets the original actors back to re-enact the classic fight scene from <em>They Live</em> for <em>literally no sensible reason</em>. It just exists to be daft. And its closing joke over the credits made me laugh so hard I had tears streaming down my face.</p><p><em>Saints Row IV</em> is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/206420/Saints_Row_IV_ReElected/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/206420/Saints_Row_IV_ReElected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently $5 in the Steam sale</a></span>.</p><h2 id="h74985"><a id=""></a>A Good Hang With Amy Poehler</h2><p>I strongly suspect that A Good Hang With Amy Poehler exists for the very same reason this article does. Poehler makes clear her express wish that this new podcast offer friendly laughter in a world on fire. And it succeeds.</p><p>The weekly show is 18 episodes in, which means both that there’s an excellent pool to choose from, and that you’re not arriving so late as to be daunted by the backlog. Guests have included Jack Black, Paul Rudd, Michelle Obama, and Quinta Brunson. And Will Forte, Natasha Lyonne, Seth Meyers and Idris Elba. And Martin Short. Oh, and Kathryn Hahn. Look, she gets the <em>best</em> guests. And the purpose of the conversation is just to cheerfully reminisce, tell funny tales, and goof around.</p><p>It’s so low stakes as to be glorious, and Poehler’s positivity and eagerness to listen causes everyone to be incredibly human. In most episodes it’s two friends catching up, which removes all the Celebrity Interview nonsense, so much so that guests often forget to plug anything. The latest episode, which went up just moments before I started writing, features Andy Samberg, and I just cannot wait to hear the two of them fondly remembering <em>SNL</em> and making each other laugh.</p><h2 id="h74986"><a id=""></a>Homestar Runner</h2><p>You either know and adore <em>Homestar Runner</em> and are wondering why someone would even think this needed recommending, or you’ve not heard of it and are about to become the former. </p><p><em>HSR</em> is, astonishingly, 25 years old now. It began as a Flash cartoon in 2000, an early internet phenomenon created by two brothers, Matt and Mike Chapman (The Brothers Chaps). It was, from the start, both incredibly funny and deeply strange. Its incredible cast of characters, almost entirely voiced by the incredibly versatile Matt Chapman, includes the eponymous doofus Homestar Runner, the wonderfully brash and cynical Strong Bad (and his pet, The Cheat), the greedy and corpulent King Of Town, and my favorite, the implausible and unbound-by-reality Homsar.</p><p>As well as being the most essential website of the early internet, it also spun off a series of Telltale-made episodic adventure games, and most recently a spoof point-and-click called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/2023/09/dangeresque-the-roomisode-triungulate/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/2023/09/dangeresque-the-roomisode-triungulate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate</em></a></span>. The latter has so many layers of <em>HSR</em> in-jokes as to be impenetrable to anyone but long-term fans, but gosh, there are so many long-term fans.</p><p>The great thing is, nearly everything from the original Flash site <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@homestarrunnerdotcom&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@homestarrunnerdotcom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has been preserved on YouTube</a></span>, with new cartoons still occasionally being made and uploaded there. And more recently, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://homestarrunner.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://homestarrunner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the old website</a></span> has been revived for the modern world, Flash-free but feature complete. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://homestarrunner.com/sbemails&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://homestarrunner.com/sbemails" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Including all 209 Strong Bad Emails!</a></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Whether you watched it all at the time or have never heard of it before, there are few better ways to distract yourself from all <em>that.</em></p><h2 id="h74987"><a id=""></a>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</h2><p>I have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-beekeepers-picnic-sherlock-holmes-game-review-1851776762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-beekeepers-picnic-sherlock-holmes-game-review-1851776762">gone on</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/2025-best-games-monster-hunter-split-fiction-avowed-1851767689/slides/8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/2025-best-games-monster-hunter-split-fiction-avowed-1851767689/slides/8">on</a></span> about this game this year, and for really good reason. This gorgeous point-and-click adventure tells a new tale of Sherlock Holmes, following the adventures chronicled in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s novels, living in retirement after the First World War. When his erstwhile partner Watson returns from the front lines, Holmes welcomes him to his new Sussex home. Both are now elderly men, and Holmes—living in his rural idyll—is reflecting on just what a complete shit he was to Watson throughout his life. He simply wants to put together a picnic for his lifelong friend, so he can have a moment to tell the doctor what their friendship means to him.</p><p>You could interpret this as quite twee, but creator Helen Greetham is an expert in all things Sherlock Holmes, and by rooting the game in the stories—most especially by cleverly evoking the events at the end of the short story “The Adventure of the Three Garridebs”—Holmes’s motivations are grounded and understandable.</p><p>Sherlock Holmes tales are one of my happy places—most nights I’ll fall asleep listening to 1960s radio plays based on the stories, because they’re the perfect mix of gently entertaining and soporific. So yes, this is my wheelhouse. But I’m hardly alone! <em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em> understands the underlying gentleness of Doyle’s writing which often lies concealed just beneath Holmes’s acerbic nature, how he gives us a world in which smartness and wit always outdo cruelty and greed. Part of the game’s genius is that it gives us a tale of Holmes that exists entirely without the latter.</p><p><em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em> is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2248890/The_Beekeepers_Picnic__A_Sherlockian_Adventure/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2248890/The_Beekeepers_Picnic__A_Sherlockian_Adventure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently $11 in the Steam sale</a></span>.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/saints-row-4-homestar-runner-sherlock-holmes-1851785792]]></content:encoded>

While this structure is very intentional and core to how our studio wanted <em>Part II</em>‘s themes and narrative beats to impact players, we always wondered what it would be like to experience this story chronologically. And now finally, we can answer that question.</p><p>Through the new Chronological mode, we believe players will gain even deeper insight into <em>Part II</em>‘s narrative. Players will be able to see how Ellie being gifted a guitar flows so neatly into her learning to play, for example, while the journey through Seattle will showcase the fascinating parallels between Ellie and Abby’s crisscrossing journeys. You’ll see just how close they come into running into each other, how their <a title="Genres > Action [2,857 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s impact each other, and more.</p><p>It was no small feat to bring <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>‘s story chronologically together, given that <em>Part II</em>‘s story is so meticulously put together. We’re grateful to the developers both at Naughty Dog and our partners at Nixxes to make the Chronological mode as smooth as possible. And while we of course recommend players still new to the game to play through <em>Part II</em>‘s story as was originally developed, the team’s hard work has paid off with a fascinating new way to enjoy this chapter.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>And we also wanted to reward players for jumping into this new, transformative approach to our story.
