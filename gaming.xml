			<p>The date today is November 12, 2025, and besides the fact that it is the day after November 11 and before November 13, it's also the 5th anniversary of the release of the PlayStation 5. This past September, on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-games-almost-half-of-all-best-selling-playstation-games-in-us/">30th anniversary of the launch of the original PlayStation console</a>, Circana executive director and analyst Mat Piscatella shared a few interesting sales charts about the best-selling games on PlayStation consoles ever. As a follow-up, he's done the same for the 5th anniversary of the PS5, and the results are fairly similar.</p>



<p>Similar in the sense that when it comes to the best-selling games on the PS5 in the US, Call of Duty appears on the charts three times within the top-five best-selling games on the PS5 since it launched. Piscatella also shared that compared to other PlayStation consoles in the same time span, the PS5 is the 2nd fastest-selling console in the US in PlayStation history, trailing behind the PlayStation 2.</p>







<p>Of the top ten best-selling games on the PS5, three of them are Call of Duty titles, three of them are annualized sports games, and three of them are first-party, PlayStation Studios titles. Two of those games are Insomniac titles, which is arguably more just a result of the fact that Insomniac is one of the few PlayStation Studios teams that has released new games in the last five years, and not just remasters or remakes.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how this list changes, if it does at all, by the end of the PS5 generation. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo showcased its special Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct event today, which, ultimately, only confirmed a few things we didn't already know, like how it would've been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-collab-with-pillsbury-leaks-first-look-yoshi-super-mario-galaxy-movie/">a better surprise that Bowser Jr. is in the film if that hadn't leaked ahead of time</a>. That's not to say there wasn't anything worth checking out, since we did get new insight into the plot of this film, and two major new cast members were revealed.</p>



<p>Of course, we also got a new trailer for the film, which showed off more of Illumination's impressive animation work. While the first Super Mario Bros. Movie focused on introducing Mario and Luigi to the Mushroom Kingdom, the Super Mario Galaxy Movie picks up right where the first one left off, with Bowser still shrunk after eating a shrinking mushroom, and life in the Mushroom Kingdom relatively peaceful.</p>



<p>Enter Bowser Jr., played by Benny Safdie, who you'd recognize from his work in Oppenheimer and Uncut Gems, who is on a quest to save his father from what essentially looks like a small prison he's being kept in, so Mario and Luigi can keep an eye on him.</p>



<p>In a currently unexplained way, Bowser Jr.'s attempted rescue of his dad leads to a galaxy-spanning journey, which is also where Princess Rosalina comes in, played by Marvel star Brie Larson.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Super Mario Galaxy Movie – Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GuCejewteF8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Brie Larson's involvement isn't exactly a surprise, considering her outspoken love for Nintendo and involvement in multiple Nintendo Switch commercials. If anything, it's a shock that she wasn't already involved in the first film, and had to wait for the second one to come around to get a role.</p>



<p>Benny Safdie is a more intriguing choice, and from the sounds of it, will be a fun one as he steps into the junior Koopa feet of Bowser Jr., heir to his father's throne.</p>



<p>The trailer also includes a few hints at what's to come, like confirmation that the Sand Kingdom from Super Mario Odyssey will be one of the locations the film visits on its journey. Hopefully, since this is a galaxy-spanning film, we'll get to see multiple locations from across Super Mario games' history.</p>



<p>In the meantime, there are still a few big questions left unanswered, namely, who is playing Yoshi?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A tablet can come in handy when your phone feels too small, but you don’t want to carry your laptop around. These screens are great for being productive on the go, and even keeping your kids entertained (for a while at least). That said, you don’t always have to spend $300+ to get something that’s powerful enough to get through your busy days, yet easy to carry around.</p>
<p>Thankfully, early Black Friday deals are already rolling in, making it easy to grab a high-end option without paying the full price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/">Amazon has now dropped the price of the 11-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ to just $149, after a massive 32% off its regular price of $220.</a> This deal applies to the Graphite model, but if you prefer the Silver version, that one’s just a dollar more at $150. The only catch? It’s already selling fast, and stock might run out before the deal ends. It’s best to grab it while it’s still live!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Portable, Yet Powerful</h2>
<p>This sleek tablet comes with an 11-inch screen that’s big enough to open multiple windows side-by-side without feeling cramped. The WUXGA display (1920 x 1200) pushes vibrant, detailed visuals that bring content to life, whether you’re playing a game or watching a TV show. The 90Hz refresh rate keeps everything running smoothly, while the 480 nits of brightness ensure you experience exceptional clarity in both bright and dim settings.</p>
<p>Of course, good visuals are only half the experience. You will also enjoy quality sound with the tablet’s quad-speaker setup with Dolby Atmos support. Every movie dialog (even the whispers) will come through clearly, kids’ songs are going to sound better, and even video calls will feel more natural. Speaking of video calls, there’s a solid front camera as well, which makes you look your best while catching up with family and friends.</p>



<p>For power, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ packs a Snapdragon 695 processor, paired with <strong>4GB of RAM </strong>and<strong> 64GB of internal storage</strong>. That’s enough for some light multitasking, plus storing all your important files or media content in one place. If you ever need more space, you can always expand it up to 1TB with a microSD card.</p>
<p>It supports Smart View, which means you can cast your screen to a Samsung TV whenever you want to enjoy a bigger viewing experience, easily. And finally, the battery also lasts all day, plus charges back up quickly when you need it.</p>

In the trailer, we get to see and hear both of these new (to the movie franchise) characters in action. As <em>the </em>galactic protector, Rosalina is quite adept at tackling any challenge before her with her special wand and star friends known as the Lumas – we get to see her use that wand against a strange mechanical enemy and read a special book to her Lumas. As for Safdie's Bowser Jr., we see the character's more traditional look alongside a seemingly powered-up (perhaps mechanical) version of Bowser's child.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out in the new trailer for </strong><em><strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie </strong></em><strong>below:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GuCejewteF8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GuCejewteF8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see, alongside looks at returning and new characters, this trailer also shows us glimpses of the planet-hopping adventure the Mario Bros. crew will go on in the movie, highlighting that even Peach and Toad will do some galactic travel.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>When you set up a whole new studio and team specifically to create new and better ways to play VR games, you’d better deliver. The aim for nDreams Elevation’s first game was to transfer the classic action-adventure gameplay feel found in games such as Tomb Raider and&nbsp; Uncharted and make it work in VR. The issue for high action in VR has always been keeping you comfortable and without motion sickness, but Reach has put those worries aside, delivering on that classic action-adventure feel with ease.</p>
<p><iframe title="REACH OFFICIAL LAUNCH TRAILER | PS VR2, Meta Quest, and Steam | nDreams Elevation" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3E9uUjL63oQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You play as a reluctant hero Rosa, a stuntwoman who has returned to her hometown to film a new movie.&nbsp; After two fairly short introduction levels she finds herself in a magical underground world populated by living statues who are intent on making it to the surface and destroying the human race.&nbsp; Teaming up with Atlas, a friendly statue, and a Destiny-like Ghost companion, you have to jump, swing, and shoot your way through the world while solving fairly simple physical puzzles. You can play stealthily, sneaking around the corridors and ripping the spines out of unsuspecting statues, or go in all guns blazing. The plot is fairly generic without any major surprises, but it does the job.</p>


<p>You are armed with a crossbow that can fire four different types of shot including ice and fire, a grappling hook mechanism and a Captain America’ style shield. The latter is particularly fun, summoned by a hand gesture and then flung at enemies’ heads, ricocheting around the room and returning to your hand when activated. If you are sneaky, you can also steal the guns off the statues, but all your main weapons have an extra function; You can climb up arrows stuck in walls or jump on a shield wedged in a gap.&nbsp; It’s a shame that your bow requires both hands as it would have been great to take some shots whilst hanging from a ledge by one hand – proper action hero stuff!</p>


<p>I played a couple of hours of Reach at a preview event, including the first two missions. At that time I was taking things quite slowly, but when I fired up the game to review it was only at the end of the first mission that I realised I had speed-run the entire thing, chaining jumps together and flinging myself around like an acrobat. All the behind-the-scenes trickery that nDreams Elevation created really works.</p>
<p>One of their improvements is so obvious that it’s a wonder no one else had thought of it: you have to swing your arm to jump. It’s exactly what you would do in real life, using your arms to gain momentum, and a great extension of the motion controls in other titles where you pump your arms to walk around. It gives a greater connection&nbsp;between your body and the movement, tricking your brain into thinking you are jumping, thus allowing you to leap from platform to platform to ladder to zipwire in one smooth sequence without motion sickness.</p>

<p>The game also simulates your whole body movement rather than just your arms and head and this gives you a feeling of presence and weight, allowing for smoother transitions. For example, when reaching the top of a ladder, you can lean forward and instinctively know when to mantle up to the platform.&nbsp; The sense of freedom and physicality, the climbing, jumping, grappling and zip-lining feel all intuitive and immersive.</p>
<p>Reach has some fairly decent graphics, although some areas do seem a little empty, it’s not going to give Horizon VR anything to worry about, but that is on purpose. You are meant to be belting it through this game and too many extra details would distract you from the parkour.</p>

<p>I have two major issues with the game, one specific to myself and one in general. Firstly, there is no way to set your in-game height, and I would guess Rosa is about 5’6″, a foot shorter than me, so I did feel like I had a compressed spine all the time I was playing. My second issue is probably down to the game being developed for multiple VR platforms. After all the work that has gone in to making you feel like you really are in Rosa’s world, all of which works, you regularly get hit with black loading screens that drag you right out of the game. There is absolutely no need for those on a PS5, the levels are not big, but I would assume the limitations of other headsets forced the developers hand.</p>

<p>Out of this world</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo and Illumination have revealed the first proper trailer for <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, and it's a galactic banger.</p>
<p>We get our first look at Bowser Jr. and Rosaline, plus a whole bunch of new locations based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> and... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a>? Yep, there's representation from both games here.</p>
<p>New cast members have also been confirmed, with Brie Larson (<strong>Captain Marvel</strong>, <strong>Room</strong>) taking on the role of Rosalina, and Benny Safdie stepping into the shoes of Bowser Jr. If that name doesn't quite ring a bell, Safdie has acted in a number of projects, but is perhaps more notable for is directorial work on <strong>Uncut Gems</strong> and <strong>The Smashing Machine</strong>.</p>



<p>Of course, the trailer also reiterates the planned release date of <strong>3rd April 2026</strong>, which isn't too far off at this point. Like the first movie, it seems more than likely that we'll get another Direct / trailer at some point in the next few months or so, so be sure to look out for that.</p>

<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 2 Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160461/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Sega and developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio are seemingly on a mission to bring as many <strong>Yakuza</strong> games to the Switch 2 in as short a time span as possible. With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Kiwami</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Kiwami 2</a> joining <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a>, we’re already at three within five months of the console’s release. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> next February will make it four. Damn, Sega – keep going!</p>
<p>Kiwami 2 was originally released in 2017, and while that seems like a lifetime ago at this point (just ask <strong>Metroid</strong> fans), the underlying Dragon Engine makes it comfortably the most technically demanding entry on Switch 2 yet. I’m thrilled to confirm, then, that it’s a joyous experience from start to finish. It’s easily one of the best entries in the series, one that comes dangerously close to the highs of Yakuza 0.</p>
<p>So once again, you step into the shoes of protagonist Kazuma Kiryu who, after a short period of peace and quiet, is brought back into the criminal fold following a growing conflict between the Tojo Clan and the Omi Alliance. Kiwami 2 features the familiar sights and sounds of the Tokyo-inspired Kamurocho, but a good chunk of the game also takes place within the Osaka-inspired Sotenbori.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 2 Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160458/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Wielding the might of the Dragon Engine, which made its debut in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/yakuza_6_the_song_of_life">Yakuza 6: The Song of Life</a>, both main locations look absolutely incredible. Neon lights shine brighter than ever, buildings reflect accurately off Sotenbori’s main river, and streets are filled to the brim with well-rendered residents going about their day.</p>
<p>By keeping the literal size of these cities in check, RGG Studio is able to pack them with things to see and do, and in combining this with realistic diegetic sounds like distant arcade music and the casual chatter of NCPs, it makes for one of the most vividly alive settings I’ve ever seen in a game. Take note, Game Freak.</p>
<p>The notable improvement to visuals does come with one potential drawback: 30fps performance. Both Yakuza 0 and the original Kiwami reach a stable 60fps with the previous engine on Switch 2, and while moving directly from Kiwami to Kiwami 2 did make the drop much more apparent at first, it didn’t bother me at all once I actually started playing properly.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 2 Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160459/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It remains stable throughout, even during effects-heavy action sequences, and the improvements elsewhere more than make up for any initial disappointment. Not only does Kiwami 2 look <em>much</em> better, but transitions into fights and (most) interior locations are seamless, making for a significantly more modernised experience.</p>
<p>General gameplay is a familiar mix of exploration, minigames, and melee combat, with a sprinkling of RPG mechanics thrown in for good measure. Yakuza games have a remarkable ability to distract you from completing your primary objectives at every turn. So one moment you might be laying the smackdown on a formidable boss before watching the dramatic aftermath in a couple of sumptuous cutscenes, and two minutes later you’ll somehow find yourself in the men’s toilets having a literal peeing contest. It’s absurd, and I love it.</p>
<p>That’s just one of the <em>many</em> minigames. You can play darts, win prizes on claw machines, master mahjong, sing karaoke, clean up in a game of poker, and more. A true highlight was stumbling upon a Club Sega arcade joint, which houses fully playable versions of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/virtua_fighter_2">Virtua Fighter 2</a> and <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/saturn/virtual_on_cyber_troopers">Virtual On: Cyber Troopers</a>.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 2 Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160453/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The authenticity really helps the overall setting sing, and you can also buy real-life beverages like The Yamazaki and Hibiki, or dine in at a real-world eatery like Zuboraya. Stocking up on food and drink is encouraged to maintain your health, but I hardly need the excuse to browse Kiwami 2’s extensive, hunger-inducing range.</p>
<p>Watching your health is vital, mind you, since you’ll be getting into fights left, right, and centre. Naturally, a lot of scraps will take place as you progress through the main story, but the streets of Kamurocho and Sotenbori are also riddled with gangs of thugs who won’t hesitate to start wailing on you at any given moment.</p>
<p>Unlike previous entries, Kiwami 2 doesn’t feature multiple fighting styles to switch between. You’ve only got the one here, but as someone who never really bothered with the Beast style much in the first Kiwami, I appreciate the more streamlined approach. You still have melee weapons like knives and baseball bats, while upgrades add whole new abilities to your arsenal.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 2 Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160460/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Each fight grants a bunch of experience points, which you can spend on general stats, battle skills, heat actions, and life skills. Overall, it feels far less fiddly than previous entries' overwhelming upgrade paths, and you’ll find yourself purchasing upgrades at frequent intervals. Once you’ve added a few new moves to your belt, powered up your heat meter, and unleashed a blistering flurry of combos, you’ll feel just like a dragon.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this would matter one lick if it weren’t for the story at Kiwami 2’s core. It’s full of wild twists and turns, but the exceptional performances from Takaya Kuroda, Aya Hisakawa, Satoshi Tokushige, and more wonderful voice actors help keep everything grounded. RGG Studio's team are masters at storytelling, and they're only getting better with each new entry.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’re particularly fond of the fan-favourite Goro Majima, you can play as the character once again with a short but sweet side campaign accessed via the main menu after a certain point in the main game. This covers what Majima was up to after the first game, and it proves to be a strong, albeit inessential detour.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yakuza Kiwami 2 is a wonderful experience on Switch 2. The improved visuals and streamlined mechanics make for a delightful gameplay experience bolstered by a compelling narrative at its core.</p>
<p>There are so many ridiculous minigames to keep you entertained, and exploring Kamurocho and Sotenbori remains enjoyable five or even fifty hours into the game. It stands alongside Yakuza 0: Director's Cut as one of the finest entries in the series.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After a brief tease earlier this year, Nintendo and Illumination have finally released the first trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>. We see a fair bit of returning characters, but we also get our first look at Bowser Jr. and Rosalina, who are debuting in the sequel.</p>

  <p>After the events of the first movie, Bowser is still tiny and a prisoner of Mario and company, and his son Bowser Jr. is taking on the major villain role to save his father from the Mushroom Kingdom’s clutches. Rosalina is voiced by <em>Captain Marvel </em>star Brie Larson, and Bowser Jr. will be played by <em>Uncut Gems </em>co-director Benny Safdie. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqjMaKQskW8">During the Direct</a>, we heard both actors’ performances as Rosalina read bedtime stories, seemingly about Mario and Peach, to several Luma, and Bowser Jr. gave a villain monologue.</p>

 <p>Surprisingly, we didn’t hear anything today about Yoshi, who was teased in the first <em>Mario </em>movie’s post-credits scene. The character’s design was leaked earlier this week <a href="https://kotaku.com/your-first-look-at-yoshi-in-the-mario-galaxy-movie-comes-from-a-box-of-cookie-dough-2000642406">by a cookie dough box</a>, and while it wasn’t anything surprising, it did make me think Yoshi might be making his grand debut during today’s Direct showcase. A lot of&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>fans are wondering if Yoshi will have a full speaking role like certain other characters in the films who don’t usually speak in the video games. Mario himself usually doesn’t utter more than a series of “wahoo!”s and the occasional “Let’s-a go!” But Chris Pratt’s voice is forming full sentences in the films, unfortunately, so it’s not out of the question that Yoshi might speak in <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>.</p> <p>The sequel will premiere in theaters on April 3. Pratt is one of several returning actors reprising their roles from the original film. Jack Black made an appearance in the Direct presentation introducing Safdie as Bowser Jr., and his voice can still be heard as Bowser in the trailer, though pitched up because the pathetic little simp has been shrunken down by a Mini Mushroom.</p>

<p>The first trailer for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie has been released ahead of its debut in theaters later this month. </p>



<p>The trailer was released as part of a special Nintendo Direct for the movie and gave fans a first look at the overall story that sees Mario and his crew head into space. In addition to a look at the overall story, the trailer officially confirmed two new characters that weren’t in the original: Bowser Jr, and Rosalina</p>







<p>Bowser Jr., if you recall, was leaked just days ago thanks to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-yoshi-bowser-jr-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">box of Pillsbury cookies</a> on a grocery store’s website. Yoshi was also leaked on the box, but he wasn’t in the trailer as it appears that Nintendo is waiting to officially debut the popular green dinosaur. </p>



<p>Two new cast members were also confirmed for the movie. Rosalina will be voiced by Brie Larson, while Bowser Jr. is played by Benny Safdi. Larson is known for her roles in Captain Marvel as the titular character and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Safdi, on the other hand, is best known as a director in films like The Smashing Machine and Uncut Gems. He has played roles in various movies, however, such as the main protagonist, Frank Manatee, in Happy Gilmore 2.</p>



<p>You can check out the trailer for yourself, below. The Super Mario Galaxy Movie hits theaters on April 3, 2026, exactly three years after the original.</p>

Watanabe didn't detail the new enemies, instead merely teasing that they're "tormenting Limveld." Meanwhile, the new Shifting Earth event, The Great Hollow, will produce a "great cavity in the depths of Limveld" that features exotic ruins and temples, sacred towers, and crystals emitting life-draining miasma. Yikes.</p><p>The Forsaken Hollows will cost $15 by itself if you already own Elden Ring Nightreign. However, if you own the $55 Deluxe Edition or the $200 Collector's Edition of the the game, then you get access to The Forsaken Hollows as soon as it launches. Be wary, though: Watanabe noted that the Deluxe Upgrade Pack will be renamed to The Forsaken Hollows DLC on November 12, warning of potential duplicate purchases.</p><p>From Software's parent company, Kadokawa, had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-could-launch-by-end-of-march-2026/1100-6536096/" data-ref-id="1100-6536096">revealed in a recent earnings report</a> that Elden Ring's Nightreign DLC was "planned for release in FY2025." Since both companies are Japanese, and fiscal years are slightly different in Japan, the initial thought was that the the game's add-on content would be released by the end of March 2026. Well, we stand corrected.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign is available now on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. Once again, the game's DLC, The Forsaken Hollows, will arrive on December 4--just in time for Christmas.</p>

Nintendo has revealed the first full trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-2026">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>.
</p>
<p>
The follow-up to the record-breaking The Super Mario Bros. Movie from 2023, it's heavily inspired by the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> games (of course, as the name suggests). This trailer introduced Galaxy's cosmic heroine Rosalina, as well as Bowser Jr as the antagonist. Rosalina will be voiced by Marvel star Brie Larson, while Bowser Jr will be voiced by Uncut Gems co-director Benny Safdie.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo previously provided a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-your-first-look-at-the-mario-movie-sequel">first look at the film sequel</a> in its September Direct showcase, announcing its release date of 3rd April 2026 in the US and 24th April in Japan.

<p>Fans had been expecting a reveal of Yoshi, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doh-the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-leaks-come-from-the-most-unlikely-place">leaks earlier this week thanks to some Pilsbury cookie packaging</a>. But the green dinosaur is yet to be seen in an official capacity.</p>
<p>
Ahead of the film, Nintendo recently released ports of the Wii classics Super Mario Galaxy 1 + 2 on Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>. It's the first time the game sequel has been available on Switch consoles, although the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-galaxy-1-2s-ports-bring-two-all-timers-to-the-switch-2-but-i-wish-nintendo-made-that-just-a-little-easier-to-celebrate">ports do compromise on their controls</a>.
</p><p>
The Super Mario Bros. Movie remains the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">biggest video game adaptation ever</a> in terms of worldwide gross, though it's closely followed by the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-jockeys-past-550m-at-the-box-office">more recent A Minecraft Movie</a>. Nintendo will surely be hoping the Galaxy sequel smashes its own record.

<p>Out of this world</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo and Illumination have revealed the first proper trailer for <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, and it's a galactic banger.</p>
<p>We get our first look at Bowser Jr. and Rosaline, plus a whole bunch of new locations based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> and... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a>? Yep, there's representation from both games here.</p>
<p>New cast members have also been confirmed, with Brie Larson (<strong>Captain Marvel</strong>, <strong>Room</strong>) taking on the role of Rosalina, and Benny Safdie stepping into the shoes of Bowser Jr. If that name doesn't quite ring a bell, Safdie has acted in a number of projects, but is perhaps more notable for is directorial work on <strong>Uncut Gems</strong> and <strong>The Smashing Machine</strong>.</p>



<p>Of course, the trailer also reiterates the planned release date of <strong>3rd April 2026</strong>, which isn't too far off at this point. Like the first movie, it seems more than likely that we'll get another Direct / trailer at some point in the next few months or so, so be sure to look out for that.</p>
<p>And if you're interested in seeing the whole Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct, you can watch the Shigeru Miyamoto-hosted video below:</p>

But now and then, something interesting pops up and you see why movie studios are investing in these buckets of popcorn. </span><i><span>Now You See Me: Now You Don’t </span></i><span>is heading to theaters this weekend, and the magic-based crime drama has one of the better popcorn buckets I’ve seen lately, both because it’s actually practical as a popcorn bucket, and because it manages to capture the spirit of the movie without just being a replica of a character or item in the film.</span></p>

 <p><span>At a glance, the bucket looks like a pretty standard box with the </span><i><span>Now You Don’t </span></i><span>poster on the sides. However, it also uses an optical illusion to make it look as if the popcorn disappears, like it would in a magic trick. There’s a hidden compartment that helps sell the trick, and if you’re looking at it from the right angle, it does truly look like the kind of illusion you’d see in a magician’s stage show.</span></p>   <p><span>Like most optical illusions, if you know the secret, your eyes will probably adapt and see the truth, but it is still a pretty cool popcorn bucket that doesn’t just feel like an elaborate collectible statue with a popcorn-shaped hole on the side. The next question is: Is it worth going to see </span><i><span>Now You See Me: Now You Don’t</span></i><span> to get it? Eh. Despite the series’ stacked cast and neat premise of magic-based heists, they’ve never really gotten much critical acclaim. </span><i><span>Now You Don’t </span></i><span>is sitting at a series high on review aggregate site </span><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/now_you_see_me_now_you_dont_2025"><i><span>Rotten Tomatoes</span></i></a><span> with a 60 percent approval rating. So I guess they’re getting better? </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><em>Arc Raiders</em> is a great game</a> with a complicated legacy thanks to its use of generative AI to voice NPCs. It’s the same strategy Embark Studios used with <em>The Finals</em>, and the CEO of publisher Nexon now says fans should get used to it.</p> <p>“First of all, I think it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI,” Junghun Lee told Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/10/159294.html"><em>Game*Spark</em></a>, according to a <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/">translation by <em>Automaton</em></a>. “But if everyone is working with the same or similar technologies, the real question becomes: how do you survive? I believe it’s important to choose a strategy that increases your competitiveness.”</p>

 <p>He believes generative AI will increase the capabilities of game studios across the board, thus increasing the “average” quality of games.&nbsp; “AI has definitely improved efficiency in both game production and live service operations,” Lee said.</p>

 <p>His comments come after fellow South Korea game publisher Krafton revealed an “<a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-ai-first-%ea%b8%b0%ec%97%85-%ec%a0%84%ed%99%98-%ec%84%a0%ec%96%b8-1000%ec%96%b5-%ec%9b%90-%ec%9d%b4%ec%83%81-%ed%88%ac%ec%9e%90/">AI first</a>” plan to invest roughly $70 million in GPU clusters and related resources to build out an infrastructure for deploying agentic AI across the company. Krafton happens to own the makers of <em>PUBG</em>, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, and <em>Subnautica 2</em>.</p>

 <p>But the deployment of AI in games remains controversial and confusing, as proven by Nexon’s own <em>Arc Raiders</em>.</p> <h2>No one agrees on what counts as generative AI</h2> <p>“<em>Arc Raiders</em>&nbsp;in no way uses generative AI whatsoever,” design director Virgil Watkins claimed during a new interview&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use">with&nbsp;<em>PCGamesN</em></a>. But in addition to using machine learning during the development process, the hit Steam extraction shooter also uses text-to-speech models to voice all of the NPC barks for every random item and situation.</p>

 <p>“[Text-to-speech] allows us to increase the scope of the game in some areas where we think it’s needed, or where there’s tedious repetition, in situations where the voice actors may not see it as valuable work,” Embark Studios CCO Stefan Strandberg told Eurogamer last month. “So it’s a wide umbrella, but the experience of the game doesn’t use any generative AI.”</p>

 <p>Others disagree, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review"><em>Eurogamer</em>, &nbsp;whose review</a> became a flash point on social media this week after it critiqued <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ use of AI voices. “[Machine learning] is an interesting technology, and the effects it produces during matches are undeniably convincing,” wrote Rick Lane. “The same cannot be said about Embark’s generated voice lines, which are aggressively mediocre and a stain on the experience.”</p> <p>There are also those who take issue with the assumption of Nexon’s CEO that everyone must be racing to embrace generative AI more generally. “Hello, not only do we not use AI, we would rather cut off our own arms than do so,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/necrosoftgames.com/post/3m5fpw7lp7s2d">wrote</a> indie team <a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-demonschool-delay-silksong/">Necrosoft Games</a>. “<em>Demonschool</em> is 100% human made.”</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Drift 36 monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free cash and other rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Drift 36 is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-grow-a-garden-film-adaptation-story-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience that drops players into the middle of a high-octane drifting and car racing circuit. Players are required to buy their first car upon launch, and from there, progress through the game to get the best automobiles available. With Roblox versions of highly sought-after vehicular brands like Porsche, Lamborghini and Koenigsegg on offer, car enthusiasts will have a fantastic time playing Drift 36.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having been released in the early months of 2025, Drift 36 has gradually gained traction over the course of the year and now boasts a fairly dedicated player base. Although simply participating in the various events the game offers is enough for players to keep upgrading their cars, using redeem codes to get some extra cash is never a bad idea.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>It is understood that Sony and Microsoft are working on new console platforms--the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-6-everything-we-know-about-sonys-next-generation-console/1100-6533561/" data-ref-id="1100-6533561">PS6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">next Xbox</a>--but when might they be released? According to Piers Harding-Rolls, the research director for games at Ampere Analysis, these new consoles could launch later than expected due to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> delay. This could happen, but it's not what Ampere expects.</p><p>He told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-games-industry-reacts-to-the-delay-of-gta-6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that the delay of GTA 6 will have a "significant impact on console sales dynamics in 2026." This is because, with GTA 6 now coming in November 2026 instead of May 2026, console sales will be "even more back-loaded" than normal. How does the GTA 6 delay impact the next-generation console release dates? Harding-Rolls said his company is modeling the new systems to launch in late 2027, but that could change if the platform-holders want to squeeze more juice out of GTA 6.</p><p>"Might the console companies be tempted to get more from the current console generation by riding the GTA 6 wave and waiting until 2028? The fact that games are now cross-gen makes this less of a factor, perhaps, but such is the size of the GTA franchise, the launch timing will get all areas of the games business thinking about their product strategies," he explained.</p><p>Harding-Rolls went on to say that GTA 6 is going to be "such an important driver of hardware sales," and not just when the game comes out, but for multiple years to follow. "Sony and Microsoft will have wanted a much earlier release than late 2026 so they could generate momentum earlier in the cycle," he said.</p><p>One of the reasons that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">GTA 5 sold so well</a> was because the game launched later in the PS3 and Xbox 360 lifecycles, coming multiple years after those consoles arrived. This meant that the install base of those machines was big at the time, and then Rockstar re-released GTA 5 for PS4 and Xbox One when those consoles came out in 2014.

<p>ARC Raiders’ latest update brings the Duo Matchmaking table along with adjusted cosmetic prices and a free Raider Deck. </p>



<p>Embark Studios’ latest extraction shooter, ARC Raiders, has blown the competition out of the water, with the game hitting a concurrent peak of over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embark-reveals-arc-raiders-player-count-steam-majority/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">700,000 players across all platforms</a>. As the game continues to break records, the developers have released a new update that adds a much-requested feature to the title, along with some additional changes. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-duo-matchmaking-was-being-silently-tested-since-the-beginning-of-this-week">ARC Raiders Duo Matchmaking Was Being Silently Tested Since the Beginning of this Week</h2>



<p>According to a new <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/duo-and-store-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, ARC Raiders’ duo prioritised matchmaking has been silently tested since earlier this week. The developers first prioritise solo and squads to play separately. Post that, duos are prioritised to play with other duos, and the same applies to trios. The developers have also cautioned players that “this is not a 100% guaranteed system”, which means that they “may at times run into differing constellations of players other than your own.” </p>



<p>Along with the duo matchmaking for ARC Raiders, the developers are also making adjustments to store cosmetic prices based on feedback. They have reviewed the prices and “made adjustments to lower prices where applicable”. The new prices will be reflected from Thursday, November 13, at 10:30 CET. Moreover, Raiders who have already purchased at the old pricing will receive compensation for the difference, and their Raider Tokens will be refunded to their account within the coming week. </p>



<p>Lastly, one free Raider Deck is available to all players, and in the future, both free and premium decks will be offered. Players should note that gameplay items will be reserved for free decks as they help new raiders along the way and can be unlocked through progressions. Moreover, there will be no pay-to-win items in premium decks, and they will be based on cosmetics and convenience.</p>







<p>In other news, Embark Studios has defended ARC Raiders’ AI voices by saying ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-nexon-ceo-defends-ai-voices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every game company</a>‘ does it. Additionally, this game is the perfect extraction shooter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-perfect-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for gamers new to the genre</a>.

                <p>Capcom has announced a new collaboration with KFC in Japan, themed around Monster Hunter Wilds. Starting on November 19, KFC branches will sell two limited-edition meals with unique packaging and codes for in-game items redeemable in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p><p>The packaging shows off art of a Felyne partner that accompanies players in Monster Hunter Wilds (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/monster-hunter-wilds-is-teaming-up-with-kfc-in-japan-for-exclusive-in-game-items/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>), with the little critter cosplaying as KFC icon Colonel Sanders--complete with a trendy outfit and facial hair. The Feast Set comes with codes for a Luxury Ingredient Set of campfire cooking ingredients and the KFC Colonel Sanders Felyne charm, while the Spice Up Set includes a Hunting Item Set of consumable items and a KFC Barrel Felyne Charm. Upgrading a meal from standard to large will also get a themed sticker set.</p><p>Four KFC stores will also be decorated to make customers feel like they've entered the world of Monster Hunter, and the promotion will conclude on December 16. This isn't the first time that KFC has partnered up with a well-known video game, as back in 2021, there was a crossover with Genshin Impact in China. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/genshin-impact-kfc-real-life-crossover-event-canceled-due-to-covid-concerns/1100-6488787/">That collaboration was unfortunately cut short</a> over COVID-19 protocol violations.</p><p>Capcom has also teamed up with McDonald's Japan last month to release a line of Street Fighter-themed burgers alongside free ketchup-and-mustard-inspired costumes for the game's roster.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TkDxFIsI-g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0TkDxFIsI-g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Meanwhile, Monster Hunter Wilds sales have continued to decline since launch, with Capcom reporting that it only sold 160,000 units of the game over its last financial quarter that ended on September 30, 2025. This is a major dip from the previous quarter that saw 477,000 sales of Monster Hunter Wilds, and Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto suggested that the high price of the PS5--the "main platform" for Monster Hunter Wilds players in Japan--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5s-high-price-is-impacting-monster-hunter-wilds-sales-capcom-exec-says/1100-6534430/" data-ref-id="1100-6534430">was hurting sales of the game</a> in that region.</p>
