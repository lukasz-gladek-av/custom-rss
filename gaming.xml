            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-pc-specs-revealed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>PC specs you're going to need to play the game on your machine ahead of its October 4th release, and it looks like a fairly broad range of specs will be supported.</p>
<p>As with many of Sony's other PC releases, including&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-pc-specs"><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-system-requirements"><em>God of War Ragnarok</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-system-requirements"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a>, the PC version of&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>will feature advanced customization compared to the console version, so you'll be able to tweak it to your heart's content.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/until-dawn-pc-specs-screens.jpg?itok=yRZ42DvH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/until-dawn-pc-specs-screens.jpg?itok=66YYU3YR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>should be a pretty nice-looking game on PC, if you've got the hardware for it.</figcaption></figure><p>All of&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>'s presets will require either Windows 10 or Windows 11, and they'll also require 70GB of free space on an SSD, although Sony's High and Ultra presets require an NVMe SSD for best results.</p>
<p>Here are the specs you'll need to run&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>across its several presets!</p>
<h3>Minimum (720p, 30fps)</h3>
<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i7 4790K or AMD Ryzen 5 1500X</li>
<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 or AMD Radeon RX 470</li>
<li>8GB RAM</li>
</ul><h3>Recommended (1080p, 60fps)</h3>
<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5 8600 or AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</li>
<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 or AMD Radeon RX 6600XT</li>
<li>16GB RAM</li>
</ul><h3>High (1440p, 60fps or 4K, 30fps)</h3>
<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5 8600 or AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</li>
<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 or AMD Radeon RX 6800XT</li>
<li>16GB RAM</li>
</ul><h3>Ultra (4K, 60fps)</h3>
<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i7 11700K or AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D</li>
<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti or AMD Radeon RX 6900XT</li>
<li>16GB RAM</li>
</ul><p>As you can see, if you want to run&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>on a lower-spec PC, you should be able to do so, although you're going to be making some sacrifices in terms of graphical fidelity and frame rate.</p>

<p>As a reminder, this is a remake of the original 2015&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>rather than a PC port of that game. It's landing on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/until-dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PS5</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> simultaneously <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-release-date">on October 4th</a>, so stay tuned for more.</p>

Not enough Microsoft jobs have been splayed and flayed atop the Altar of Growth, so High Priest Spencer must once again perform the Rite of Strategic Repositioning. According to a leaked memo, Microsoft are laying off around 650 people "to organize our business for long term success". This is the same Microsoft that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">parted with around 1900 employees in January</a>, and the same Microsoft that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsofts-mass-layoffs-will-affect-starfield-halo-infinite-and-gears-of-war-developers">washed their hands of around 10,000 staff in January 2023</a>, all in the name of shoring up the business for future prosperity. That "long term success" is certainly taking its sweet time. Or at least, it is if you're one of the poor saps in the trenches of, in this case, "corporate and supporting functions".
</p><!--more-->
<p>
As with the previous round of cuts, this latest bout of belt-tightening is the result of Microsoft needing to recover some of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-finally-buys-activision-blizzard-as-last-legal-hurdles-fall-away">that money they spent inhaling Activision-Blizzard in 2023</a> - a $69 billion deal that has necessitated the departure of about 2,550 staff to date.
</p>
<p>
"For the past year, our goal has been to minimize disruption while welcoming new teams and enabling them to do their best work," Xbox chief Phil Spencer explained to Microsoft employees in an internal memo, sent this week and obtained by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff">IGN</a>. "As part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business, we have made the decision to eliminate approximately 650 roles across Microsoft Gaming - mostly corporate and supporting functions - to organize our business for long term success." US people let go will be supported "with exit packages that include severance, extended healthcare, and outplacement services to help with their transition" while the layoff terms will vary outside the US according to location.
</p>
<p>
"With these changes, our corporate and supporting teams and resources are aligned for sustainable future growth, and can better support our studio teams and business units with programs and resources that can scale to meet their needs," the memo continues. "Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games." Spencer doesn't specify which games have been "impacted", but he does add that "no games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today." 
</p>
<p>
The Acti-Blizz merger appears to have done reasonably well for Microsoft as a whole. According to the company's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-hardware-revenue-down-42-from-last-year-as-activision-acquisition-continues-to-boost-content-sales">most recent quarterly results</a>, gaming revenue was up 44% year-over-year, albeit with "48 points of net impact" from the acquisition. I don't quite understand what a "point of net impact" is, and I'm not convinced anybody else reporting on this story does either. But the upshot is that Microsoft executives continue to feel the need to trim the books. Back in May, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">announced the closures</a> of Prey developers Arkane Austin and Hifi Rush developers Tango Gameworks, though Tango and Hifi Rush were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pubg-owner-krafton-have-acquired-tango-gameworks-and-the-hi-fi-rush-ip">rescued by Krafton</a> in an 11th hour deal.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">one unofficial tracker</a>, there have been over 11,000 games industry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoffs</a> in 2024 so far. If you're one of the people affected by this week's reductions, best of luck with it all.

Episode five is one of the more potent examples of the prequel series setting the stage for events that take place in both <em>The Hobbit</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, weaving together plot threads that felt like they were blowing in the breeze for the last few weeks. <strong>Spoilers to follow!</strong><br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193831" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="226" data-playlist="193831,195410,196299" data-current="193831"><div><p>The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19283.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Episode five begins with dwarf king Durin using the ring bestowed upon him by the elves to find where to dig in order to restore the sun shafts to Khazad-dûm, which collapsed a few episodes back, threatening the city’s livelihood. He doggedly insists that the dwarves dig into a foundational wall, which immediately gives way to a massive ray of sunlight, justifying what his own son believed to be an act of folly. As the episode progresses, it becomes more and more clear that the ring is negatively affecting Durin, causing him to become angrier and more paranoid, and to enact a city-wide tax called, simply, the Ring Tax. His son, concerned with how much his father has changed, heads to Eregion to ask Celebrimbor what the hell kinda demon shit he put into this ring, but not before we see how Durin’s doggedness will lead to Khazad-dûm’s, well, doom. </p><p>You see, years ago, Durin set restrictions on how far down the dwarves could dig for a variety of structural and logical reasons. But thanks to the ring’s dark urges, he wants to ignore those restrictions and dig deeper into the mountain’s rock. Any self-respecting <em>Lord of the Rings</em> fan knows what happens soon after, and the episode gifts us with ominous growls just in case you forgot: The dwarves will soon awaken a Balrog that will destroy the kingdom of Khazad-dûm, also known as Moria. The same Balrog that the Fellowship of the Ring encounters when cutting through those mines to get to Mordor. </p><p>In another bit of foreshadowing, soon after Durin demands the dwarves dig wherever he says, we see the elves putting the finishing touches on a magical door that will be installed at one of the entryways to Khazad-dûm. Known as “Durin’s Door,” it can only be visible in the light of the moon, and can only be opened with a password told “to friends.” These are the very same glowing doors that the Fellowship struggles to get past in the first <em>Lord of the Rings</em>—though they eventually open after Frodo (or, in the books, Gandalf) figures out the password. </p><p>Along with the imminent demise of the dwarves of Khazad-dûm, episode 5 also lays out a path for the fall of Middle-earth’s men to the allure of Sauron’s rings. Still disguised as an elf, Sauron convinces Celebrimbor (after much deception and gaslighting) to create nine more rings for men, despite the latter’s concerns about the quality of their character. We know that men will not be able to resist the dark allure of the rings (Isildur fell victim to their power, and Boromir nearly did as well), and as the episode flits back and forth between the elves, dwarves, and humans of Númenor, we see why—many Numenorians, still reeling from the recent coup against Queen Miriel, are being persecuted by the new king’s men, who are callous and careless of the people’s religious beliefs. A surprise death hammers a message home: Men are capable of great cruelty, but so are dwarves, and so are elves, despite their holier-than-thou stance. <em>The Rings of Power</em> finally feels like it’s crafting a cogent tale of how Middle-earth came to be so broken. </p><p><em>The Rings of Power</em> season two episode six airs September 19 on Amazon Prime. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Xbox Game Pass Ultimate has risen from $16.99 to $19.99 a month and still includes all the typical benefits, but the Xbox Game Pass Standard tier is quite different from its predecessor.</p><p>It replaces Game Pass for Console (though those already subscribed don't have to upgrade) and includes significantly less benefits. Subscribers no longer gain access to day one titles or access to EA Play, Xbox Cloud Gaming, perks, Quests, and discounts on games in the Game Pass library. Microsoft said players would also be denied access to "specific entries to the Game Pass Ultimate library," and that list has now been revealed to be fairly extensive.</p><p>A total of 41 games are now available only through Game Pass Ultimate for new subscribers, including the aforementioned <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-single-player-campaign-review">Modern Warfare 3</a>, Starfield, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4-review">Diablo 4</a> but also Forza Motorsport, MLB: The Show 24, Octopath Traveler 2, Payday 3, Age of Mythology: Retold, and more.

The remaining 96 titles belong to the EA Play library, which is not included in Xbox Game Pass Standard.

Microsoft closed Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin as part of those cuts. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-studio-closures-ign-live-2024">Speaking to IGN in June</a>, Spencer said: "I have to run a sustainable business inside the company and grow, and that means sometimes I have to make hard decisions that frankly are not decisions I love, but decisions that somebody needs to go make."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>While Spencer has insisted Microsoft's video game franchise "are getting stronger", and Xbox console players "are as high this year as they’ve ever been,” the gaming business is now bringing a number of its games to rival platforms, including PlayStation 5.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-hardware-revenue-down-42-from-last-year-as-activision-acquisition-continues-to-boost-content-sales">Xbox hardware sales were way down again in Microsoft's Q4</a>, the latest financial quarter we have figures for, while gaming content sales skyrocketed again thanks to the company's acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Gaming revenue overall appears to be doing more than fine in terms of year-on-year comparisons, even setting quarterly records, but this was largely due to the boost offered by Activision Blizzard (it wasn't there to make money for the company last year, now it is, so the numbers have gone up). Gaming revenue was up 44% year-over-year, but with 48 points of net impact from the acquisition, which indicates that Xbox's not-Activision Blizzard-related business isn't doing as well as it was last year. Xbox content and services revenue faired better, up 61% year-over-year, with 58 points of net impact from the acquisition.</p><p>Overall, Microsoft's More Personal Computing division (which includes Xbox as well as other segments such as Windows) brought in $15.9 billion in revenue, up 14% year-over-year, during Q4.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company.</p></div><p>Speaking in August, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-explains-decision-to-launch-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5">Spencer said that Xbox’s multiplatform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business</a> — with the pressure now on to deliver following Microsoft’s acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.</p><p>“And we run a business,” Spencer said. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.</p><p>“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”</p><p>Microsoft is set to launch Activision's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> in October as the first mainline Call of Duty game to hit its Game Pass subscription service day-one.

        <p>Aside from adaptive charging for your controllers, all PlayStation 5 system update features mentioned in this blog post are available for all PlayStation 5 models. Let’s take a deeper look at what’s included in this update:</p><p><strong>■ Newly Announced Features</strong></p><p><strong>Welcome Hub</strong> (phased release)</p><p>We are introducing a new personalized space in your PlayStation 5 home screen called Welcome hub—a dedicated space you can customize with widgets, allowing you to see information at a glance before you begin your gaming sessions. For players in the U.S, Welcome hub will replace the current Explore tab with enhanced customizability and an upgraded user experience.</p><p><iframe title="PS5 Welcome Hub" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLUvxgY2wd8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>You can easily customize your Welcome hub by selecting from a variety of widgets, including console storage, battery levels for accessories, online friends, trophies, and many more. Use presets to quickly change your layout, and simply select and arrange a variety of widgets as you see fit. You can change the size of your widgets, expanding or shrinking them to give more focus to the features that are most important to you.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PlayStation%205-Update_09-12-24_001.jpg"></a></figure><p>In addition, you can also change your Welcome hub’s background. Choose from a range of designs, including some with cool animated effects, or pick out a screenshot from your own Media Gallery for a truly personal touch.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PS5-Update_09-12-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>Welcome hub will become available to select users in the U.S. starting later today. We will gradually expand support in other regions over the coming weeks, starting with players in Japan, followed by select countries in Europe, and finally releasing worldwide.</p><p><strong>Party Share</strong> (phased release)</p><p>In the next few weeks, we’ll also add the ability for you to share party voice chat links on any messaging or social media app. This will allow you to invite a friend whom you’re chatting with on any messaging app to join your party voice chat, even if you haven’t added them to your friends list on <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [45,961 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> Network.</p><p>To create a party link, open the voice chat card in the Control Center on PlayStation 5, select [Invite Players], then click [Share Party link] to generate a scannable QR code. Recipients can open the link on their mobile device and seamlessly join the party on their PlayStation 5 or from PlayStation App.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PS5-Update_09-12-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>In the coming weeks, we will also release an update for PlayStation App which will allow you to similarly generate a shareable party link from your mobile device.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PS5-Update_09-12-24_004.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>PlayStation 5 Beta Features Rolling Out Globally Today</strong></p><p>Here’s a closer look at some of the PlayStation 5 beta features that are rolling out globally today, including personalized 3D audio profiles for headphones and earbuds, the ability to enable Remote Play access for individual users, and adaptive charging for your controllers.</p><p><strong>Personalized 3D Audio Profiles for Headphones and Earbuds</strong></p><p>In this generation, 3D audio is one of the key ways that creators have enhanced the immersive quality of games. As individuals, we all hear sounds differently based on the size and shape of our head, ears, and ear canals.</p><p>We’re pleased to introduce a feature that lets your PlayStation 5 console create a personalized 3D audio profile just for you. With a set of headphones or earbuds, you can run through a set of sound quality tests to analyze a vast number of factors to create an audio profile that best fits your hearing characteristics. For example, your personalized 3D audio profile may enable you to better sense the positions of characters and objects in a game world more clearly than before, making the experience more immersive.</p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="PS5 UI | Personalised 3D Audio Profile setup" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QhZzPyc-Zas?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To create a personalized 3D audio profile for your headphones or earbuds, go to [Settings] &gt; [Sound] &gt; [3D Audio (Headphones)] on your PlayStation 5 console, and follow the steps displayed on the screen. Your audio profile will be saved on your PlayStation 5 per user, and you can also still select from 3D audio presets like before.</p><p>This feature builds on the 3D audio enhancements we’ve introduced to PlayStation 5 since launch, including 3D audio support for built-in TV speakers and support for compatible Dolby Atmos-enabled audio devices. These features give you additional options to immerse yourself more deeply in the rich variety of soundscapes in PlayStation 5 games, powered by Tempest 3D AudioTech.</p><p><strong>Enable Remote Play for Individual Users</strong></p><p>You can now adjust Remote Play settings per user and choose who is allowed to connect to your PlayStation 5 console using Remote Play. So, if your friends or family members come over and sign in to your PlayStation 5 console with their account for PlayStation Network, you can easily modify who can continue to access your PlayStation 5 console using Remote Play when they leave.</p><p>To adjust these settings, go to [Settings] &gt; [System] &gt; [Remote Play] &gt; [Enable Remote Play], and choose which user you want to enable access to your PlayStation 5 console through Remote Play.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PS5-Update_09-12-24_005.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Adaptive Charging for Your Controller</strong> (for the slimmer PlayStation 5 model and PlayStation 5 Pro)</p><p>Adaptive charging for the DualSense wireless controller, DualSense Edge wireless controller, <a title="Platforms > PS VR2 [201 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps-vr2">PlayStation VR2</a> Sense controllers, and Access controller is now available for the slimmer PlayStation 5 model, when the console is in rest mode (and will also be available for PlayStation 5 Pro when it launches). Adaptive charging helps save power by adjusting the length of time that power is supplied to your controller based on its battery level.</p><p>To use adaptive charging, go to [Settings] &gt; [System] &gt; [Power Saving] &gt; [Features Available in Rest Mode], and then select [Supply Power to USB Ports] &gt; [Adaptive]. After your PlayStation 5 enters rest mode, if a controller isn’t connected, the power supply to the USB port will stop after a certain period of time.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PS5-Update_09-12-24_006.jpg"></a></figure><p>We will continue to enhance your gaming and social experiences on PlayStation 5 by listening to community feedback on features and improvements.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-system-software-update-welcome-hub<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony is rolling out a new PS5 system software update that adds a "new personalized space" to the console's UI in the form of the Welcome Hub, plus more besides.</p>
<p>The Welcome Hub replaces the Explore tab, which was previously exclusive to US PlayStation users. Sony says it's rolling out "globally over the next few weeks", and select players in the US will get the new hub today.</p>
<p>The Welcome Hub lets you customize your home screen with widgets including accessory battery levels, trophies, and online friends, plus "many more". It comes with a range of presets you can use to quickly switch your widget layout, and you can arrange and resize widgets, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-system-software-update-welcome-hub.jpg?itok=iOTcJgmC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-system-software-update-welcome-hub.jpg?itok=TVCa62KY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new PS5 update brings with it a brand new Welcome Hub that's packed with widgets.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've been hankering for a return to the old days of PS4 wallpaper, you'll be pleased to know you can also change your Welcome Screen's background, and you can even use one of your own screenshots if you want.</p>
<p>According to Sony, US players will get the Welcome Hub update first, followed by Japanese players, then European gamers, and finally everyone else around the world. Hold tight, it's coming!</p>
<p>It's not just the Welcome Hub, though. The new Party Share feature is also getting a phased release with this update, and it'll let you send PS5 party chat links via any social media or messaging app thanks to the magic of QR codes.</p>
<p>Other new features rolling out as part of this PS5 update include personalized headphone and earbud 3D audio profiles, Remote Play settings for individual users, and adaptive controller charging (although only for selected models).</p>

<p>News of this update comes just a couple of days after Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november">announced</a> the PS5 Pro, a mid-generation refresh console that features improved technical performance and increased storage capacity.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro is one of two PS5 models that can take advantage of adaptive controller charging, alongside the Slim models that were introduced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-slim-officially-announced-coming-this-holiday-season">towards the end of last year</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out a full breakdown of everything that's coming with the new PS5 system software update <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/12/ps5-system-update-adds-welcome-hub-party-share-personalized-3d-audio-profiles-adaptive-controller-charging-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a>. Elements of the update roll out today, and a phased global rollout will take place over the next few weeks. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft to Lay Off Hundreds More Staff From Gaming Division]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-september</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-to-lay-off-hundreds-more-staff-from-gaming-division.978837/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-september<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has announced that it will lay off around 650 more employees from its gaming division, with those affected mostly working in "corporate and supporting functions" across Microsoft Gaming.</p>
<p>According to an internal email sent to Microsoft employees by gaming head Phil Spencer (<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-xbox-650" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via Game File</a>), the cuts are part of Microsoft's strategy of "aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business".</p>
<p>Game File cites "a source familiar with the matter" as saying that the cuts will mostly be focused on Activision Blizzard. According to Game File's Stephen Totilo, Spencer framed news of the layoffs in the context of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized">last year's record-breaking Activision Blizzard acquisition</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-microsoft-layoffs.jpg?itok=UYesjG-j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-microsoft-layoffs.jpg?itok=rKeQtMji 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The most recent Microsoft layoffs are apparently focused on Activision Blizzard.</figcaption></figure><p>In his email, Spencer says this round of layoffs won't result in any "games, devices, or experiences" being cut, which puts it in direct contrast to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">January's</a> Microsoft layoffs. That wave of cuts apparently resulted in "at least one game project at Blizzard" being cut, per Totilo.</p>
<p>According to another of Totilo's sources, no Xbox business unit leaders or gaming teams will be cut as part of these layoffs either. That means we won't be seeing any further studio closures akin to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">shock shutdown of Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin</a>, at least not for now.</p>
<p>Spencer closes his email by saying that while news of the layoffs may be "challenging", he has faith that Microsoft can "come together and show one another care and kindness".</p>
<p>These layoffs are part of an industry trend that has spanned the last couple of years, and it's not just Microsoft that's been affected, either. Companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">Sony</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs">Take-Two</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs">EA</a> have been affected, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-and-archiact-hit-by-layoffs">smaller indie studios</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-layoffs-immortals-of-aveum.jpg?itok=4YAn1X3J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-layoffs-immortals-of-aveum.jpg?itok=Dw7GoMVX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Microsoft isn't the only company to be hit by layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>The layoff wave has also seen a number of major studios closed, including&nbsp;<em>Saints Row&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition">Volition</a> and (reportedly)&nbsp;<em>Elex&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report">Piranha Bytes</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Since the majority of today's Microsoft cuts appear to be focused on Activision Blizzard's corporate division, it's unlikely this will affect the company's plans for upcoming games, but I'm sure that's small comfort for the employees being let go. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>Normally in gaming, a weapon getting Nerfed means that it will no longer be as useful or fun as it once was. But Bungie's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-review/1900-6416758/" data-ref-id="1900-6416758">Destiny 2</a> Ace of Spades replica gun <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-ace-of-spades-hand-cannon-has-been-nerfed-but-not-that-way/1100-6526386/" data-ref-id="1100-6526386">is an actual working Nerf hand cannon</a>. Now, a Destiny 2 fan has come forward to accuse the company of using a design that lifted from their original artwork for the Ace of Spades Nerf gun that was posted online nearly a decade ago.</p><p>On social media, a user who goes by Tofu Bunny posted a link to their original artwork for the Ace of Spades Nerf gun from 2015 and placed images of that artwork side-by-side with the upcoming release. There are definitely some strong similarities between the two, almost on a one-to-one basis.</p><p>Tofu Bunny <a href="https://x.com/Tofu_Rabbit/status/1833861584424177681" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">later clarified their belief</a> that a third-party contractor may be responsible for the alleged design theft, rather than Bungie itself. Regardless, Tofu Bunny adds that the entire situation "feels like a punch in the gut.

                <p>Microsoft has implemented another round of heavy cuts to its Xbox gaming team following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard. In this latest round of layoffs, Microsoft is eliminating about 650 positions from its gaming team, but no additional studios have closed and no other games are canceled as a result of the move, which Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer confirmed on September 12. In January, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/" data-ref-id="1100-6520601">Microsoft cut 1,900 gaming positions</a>, bringing the number of cuts to the company to about 2,550 since the $75.4 billion deal to buy Activision Blizzard closed in October 2023.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">memo to staff obtained by IGN</a>, Spencer said the cuts came as part of Microsoft's effort to align the company's "post-acquisition team structure and managing our business."</p><p>The approximately 650 layoffs from Microsoft Gaming "mostly" impact the "corporate and supporting" functions of the business, the company said. Affected staffers in the US are getting severance, extended healthcare, and outplacement services. Packages for those outside of the US are available, too, and vary by location.</p><p>"With these changes, our corporate and supporting teams and resources are aligned for sustainable future growth, and can better support our studio teams and business units with programs and resources that can scale to meet their needs," Spencer said. "Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games. No games, devices, or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today."</p><p>In March, Spencer said the initial round of job cuts announced in January were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-phil-spencer-reflects-on-recent-mass-layoffs/1100-6522156/" data-ref-id="1100-6522156">necessary to help Xbox become a profitable business</a> following the blockbuster buyout of Activision Blizzard.</p><p>In addition to laying off staff, Microsoft closed some of its studios entirely earlier this year, including Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, Roundhouse Games, and Alpha Dog Studios. Tango Gameworks was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-saved-by-pubg-publisher-krafton-hi-fi-rush-rights-also-acquired/1100-6525702/" data-ref-id="1100-6525702">saved by PUBG studio Krafton</a>, but the others have closed for good.</p><p>2024, like 2023 before it, has been a brutal for layoffs in the video game developers and staff at Microsoft and many other companies. Some estimates suggest there have been more than 11,000 layoffs in the video game sector in 2024 alone. A former PlayStation executive recently shared his thoughts on the cuts, claiming they are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-sony-exec-claims-that-industry-layoffs-arent-because-of-corporate-greed/1100-6526384/" data-ref-id="1100-6526384">not due to corporate greed alone</a>, but are instead part of general macroeconomic conditions. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">Ubisoft</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-layoffs-include-senior-execs-luke-smith-and-mark-noseworthy/1100-6525488/" data-ref-id="1100-6525488">Bungie</a>, and many others have also implemented dramatic cuts in 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-families-officially-launches-out-of-beta<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>After a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-launches-new-steam-families-household-game-sharing-tools">stint in beta</a>, Valve has opened up Steam Families to the wider public.</p>
<p>Steam Families replaces both Steam Family Sharing and Steam Family View, giving users a one stop shop to manage who can access what and when.</p>
<p>Up to five family members can be added to a user's Steam Family account, making for a total group of six maximum. These members can be managed from the Steam Client, mobile device or browser. Alas, it can't help you manage your children enough to get them to brush their teeth before bed, though.</p>

<p>Once a family group has been set up, members will then get access to the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Family Sharing</li>
<li>Parental Controls</li>
<li>Child Purchase Requests</li>
</ul>
<p>"When you join a Steam Family, you automatically gain access to the shareable games that your family members own and they will also be able to access the shareable titles in your library," Valve explained. "The next time you log in to Steam, this new 'family library' will appear in the left column as a subsection of your games list. You maintain ownership of your current titles and when you purchase a new game it will still show up in your collection."</p>
<p>Users can still play games from the shared library even if another member is online playing another game. If there are multiple copies of the same game in the library, more than one member can play that game at one time.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Valve</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The parental controls, meanwhile, will allow adults (Steam Family members are categorised as either an 'adult' or a 'child') to set limits for their small ones, such as what games they can play and when they can play them. Adults will also be able to monitor their children's activity (see image below).</p>
<p>These new parental control features let adults:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow access to appropriate games</li>
<li>Restrict access to the Steam Store, Community or Friends Chat</li>
<li>Set playtime limits (hourly/daily)</li>
<li>View playtime reports</li>
<li>Approve or deny requests from child accounts for additional playtime or feature access (temporary or permanent)</li>
<li>Recover a child's account if they lost their password</li>
</ul>
<figure>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Valve</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The last main feature arriving with Steam Families is a new payment option.</p>
<p>This option allows a child account within the family group to request an adult pays for their shopping basket of games. Once the adult approves their request, the purchase will be added to the child's account.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/purchase-approval-on-Steam.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Valve</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As a general point, if an adult leaves a Steam Family, they will need to wait for at least one year from when they joined the previous family to create or join a new family. Adults can, however, "kick any family member out of the Steam Family".</p>

            <p>Game studio Odyssey Interactive is launching a playtest for its latest "crazy" project but it may not even release if players aren't into it.</p>
<p>Byte Breakers, as it's currently known, is a 40-player Smash Bros-style Battle Royale. The studio shared a look at gameplay on social media alongside the playtest announcement.</p>
<p>However, this is one of many prototypes the studio has developed as it aims to "find a blend of genres that you haven't seen before, because as a studio we'd rather try something crazy and fail than just make a game that you feel that you've already played".</p>

<p>The game tease features colourful cartoon characters battling it out on floating platforms, but the camera eventually pans out to show huge arenas with tonnes of players fighting together.</p>
<p>"We hope you can see the potential," said the studio, admitting the footage is still early days. "We envision that by taking aspects of the multi-team environment, big open map, power progression, information asymmetry and just general strategic decision making of BRs, smashing those together with solid fundamentals from Smash, we can let players have wild experiences that they'd never find in a straight-up platform fighter.</p>
<p>"Parts of it will feel familiar, but we hope that as a whole it's a new experience."</p>
<p>The studio concluded: "We trust you and we trust your feedback".</p>

<p>The prototype follows the previous game from Odyssey Interactive, the "footbrawl" game Omega Strikers, but now it aims to develop the platform fighter genre and welcomes comparisons to Nintendo's iconic series.</p>
<p>It's certainly a bold move to launch a prototype that may never receive a full release, but more and more developers are looking to early access to gather feedback from players.</p>
<p>And when releases like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">Sony's Concord are removed from sale weeks after release</a>, perhaps an initial playtest before fully committing is a wise idea.</p>
<p>Byte Breakers is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2503080/Byte_Breakers/">available to playtest now over on Steam</a>. Will you be checking it out?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Another set of sweeping layoffs are hitting Microsoft’s gaming business, with 650 employees being made redundant across Xbox, Bethesda and Activision Blizzard. The news comes via an internal memo sent by Xbox boss Phil Spencer to staff.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff">Made public by IGN</a>, Spencer explains that the impact will mainly be felt in the corporate and support function positions, “to organize our business for long term success.” He also stated that “No games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today.”</p>


<p>All those being laid off in the US will receive severance pay, extended healthcare and outplacement services. The package will differ in other countries.</p>
<p>Following on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/25/microsoft-is-laying-off-a-staggering-1900-people-across-xbox-activision-zenimax/">layoffs at the start of 2024</a>, Microsoft has now cut 2,550 jobs since it acquired Activision Blizzard in late 2023. That acquisition had led to the company’s gaming workforce suddenly ballooning up to around 22,000 people at the end of last year, and with years of acquisitions that had brought multiple separate publishing arms and labels together, some kind of layoffs and restructuring were pretty much inevitable. Those earlier layoffs, however, saw the announced closure of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">Tango Gameworks</a> – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/12/tango-gameworks-is-back-as-krafton-revives-hi-fi-rush-studio/">since rescued</a> – and Arkane Austin, and the spin off of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/01/toys-for-bob-goes-independent-but-explores-partnership-with-microsoft/">Toys For Bob</a>.</p>
<p>There’s been a terrible toll taken on the staff of the games industry over the last couple years, as economic sands have shifted and company leadership decide to make job cuts. We wish all those affected by this latest round of layoffs all the best in finding new work.</p>

<p>Here’s Spencer’s full email to staff:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the past year, our goal has been to minimize disruption while welcoming new teams and enabling them to do their best work. As part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business, we have made the decision to eliminate approximately 650 roles across Microsoft Gaming — mostly corporate and supporting functions — to organize our business for long term success.</p>
<p>I know that this is difficult news to hear. We are deeply grateful for the contributions of our colleagues who are learning they are impacted. In the U.S., we’re supporting them with exit packages that include severance, extended healthcare, and outplacement services to help with their transition; outside the U.S. packages will differ according to location.</p>
<p>With these changes, our corporate and supporting teams and resources are aligned for sustainable future growth, and can better support our studio teams and business units with programs and resources that can scale to meet their needs. Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games. No games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today.</p>
<p>Throughout our team’s history, we have had great moments, and we have had challenging ones. Today is one of the challenging days. I know that going through more changes like this is hard, but even in the most trying times, this team has been able to come together and show one another care and kindness as we work to continue delivering for our players. We appreciate your support as we navigate these changes and we thank you for your compassion and respect for each other.</p>
<p>Phil</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-gaming-to-cut-another-650-jobs-mostly-in-corporate-and-support-games-wont-be-affected/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft is cutting another 650 jobs in its gaming division, Stephen Totilo <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-xbox-650?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=148802913&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=5eh0e&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> in today's Game File newsletter. The article includes a quote from an internal email sent this morning to employees by Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer:</p>
<p><em>As part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business, we have made the decision to eliminate approximately 650 roles across Microsoft Gaming—mostly corporate and supporting functions—to organize our business for long term success.</em></p>
<p>This time around, no games, devices, or experiences will be affected by the job cuts. That wasn't the case with the previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mass layoffs of 1,900 employees</a> across Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and Bethesda, which resulted in the cancellation of Odyssey, Blizzard's survival game based on a brand new IP.</p>
<p>It has been a year of layoffs across the whole industry. On January 22, Riot Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-11-of-workforce-shuts-down-riot-forge-to-refocus-on-core-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that 530 staff members had been laid off. <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-lays-off-8-of-playstation-workforce-london-studio-closed-guerrilla-naughty-dog-insomniac-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Electronic Arts</a> followed suit in late February, removing 900 and 670 employees, respectively. On the occasion, Sony also shut down the London studio that was making a modern fantasy online cooperative action game.</p>
<p>In March, SEGA <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-sells-relic-entertainment-cuts-another-240-jobs-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> Relic Entertainment and laid off around 240 employees across its European teams. The following month, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-lays-off-5-of-its-workforce-cancels-some-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take-Two's turn</a> to reduce its workforce by 5% and shut down OlliOlli developer Roll7 and Intercept Games, canceling some unannounced games in the process.</p>
<p>The bad news kept coming with Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shutting down</a> three studios in May, including Arkane Austin (Dishonored, Prey, Redfall) and Tango Gameworks (The Evil Within, Ghostwire: Tokyo, and Hi-Fi Rush), while Roundhouse Studios got folded into ZeniMax Online. Tango Gameworks (or what was left of it anyway, since about half of the employees had already found employment elsewhere) was subsequently <a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-and-its-hi-fi-rush-ip-have-just-been-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> by Krafton in August alongside the Hi-Fi Rush IP.</p>
<p>We would like to believe this latest round of Microsoft layoffs will be the final news of this kind we report this year, but there's a solid chance that won't be the case.</p>

The adaptive charging feature, which monitors and automatically adjusts the power supplied when controllers are connected to the console’s USB ports, is being released globally starting today — but only for the latest PS5 models.</p><p>In its announcement, Sony says adaptive charging is only available on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/10/23955005/sony-playstation-5-ps5-slim-size-comparison-photo-gallery-hands-on-impressions">PS5 Slim</a> and its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24167932/ps5-pro-sony-specs-announcement">upcoming $700 PS5 Pro</a>.

Sometimes we play video games to plunder the silty depths of our emotions, sometimes we play them to sharpen our wits and try the alchemy of engrossing systems, sometimes we play them to mud-wrestle with questions of power and responsibility, and sometimes we just want to wear cool sunglasses, have big arms, and fly around hitting stuff very hard.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Undefeated is a free open world homage to Superman and superheroes at large, created by three students from Vantan Game Academy, Osaka. Released on Steam in 2019, it's just received <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1116960/view/4585315413748320015?l=english">a chunky-ish update</a> alongside a surprise launch on PS5.
</p>
<p>
If you missed it back in 2019, here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1116960/UNDEFEATED/">Steam store page</a>, and here's a quick list of things you can do in Undefeated:
</p>
<p>
- Fly real fast with streaky lines and break the sound barrier
</p>
<p>
- Do a superhero one-knee landing 
</p>
<p>
- Ricochet between big mechy things, punching them
</p>
<p>
- Lift up big rocks
</p>
<p>
- Put out fires by clapping your hands (you don't have a copyright on the concept of wind, Dr Banner!)
</p>
<p>
- Do QTE counters on supervillains, then combo them like in Dragon Ball
</p>
<p>
- Chop your hands to do energy attacks while strafing
</p>
<p>
- Pose magnificently while soldiers shoot their wimpy little bullets at you
</p>
<p>
- Fly through hoops, Superman's greatest nemesis
</p>
<p>
- Rank up and get new powers, a bit
</p>
<p>
As of the update, it looks like you can also do heat rays from your eyes. There's also a new map event to experience, possibly related to those heat rays. Undefeated Man might have all the visual flavour and idiosyncracy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz8ssH7LiB0">the square hole</a>, but he certainly has a few tricks up his sleeve. On the technical side, the update adds support for 4K resolution (3840x2160) and WQHD resolution (2560x1440).
</p>
<p>
I doubt Undefeated will keep you occupied for longer than, oh, let's say 10 minutes, but it's well-made for what it is, and importantly, doesn't pretend to be anything more. Those who pine for noughties superpower fantasies like Prototype might get a real kick out of it. Also, people who pine for an actually decent official Superman game, which will absolutely never happen. Sorry, Clarkies and Kenters, but this particular comicbook property is clearly cursed. The best we'll ever get is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/injustice-2">Injustice</a>.
</p>
<p>
The developers are working on a paid sequel, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2088020/">Undefeated: Genesis</a>, which transports the proceedings to a big alien world full of mutants. In a scandalous flourish, the new incarnation of the protagonist has a spiky fringe and doesn't wear sunglasses. Beyond that, it looks a bit like an early prototype for BioWare's Anthem.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ps5s-latest-system-update-introduces-welcome-hub-party-share-and-more-features/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>PS5 has just announced a new software update that will introduce a host of new features for the console. These include the Welcome Hub, Party Share, Personalized 3D Audio Profiles, Adaptive Charging and Remote Play for individual users.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Welcome Hub is a new way players can personalize their home screen on the PS5. In the United States, this Hub will replace the current Explore Tab. Players can customize the Hub with various widgets, including console storage, battery levels for accessories, online friends, trophies, and more. Additionally, the size and layout of the widgets are adjustable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players can also set custom backgrounds for the Welcome Hub, which can be from various in-house designs or the console’s media gallery. Welcome Hub will roll out globally through a PS5 software update in the coming weeks. It is available for limited players in the United States <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/12/ps5-system-update-adds-welcome-hub-party-share-personalized-3d-audio-profiles-adaptive-controller-charging-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">starting today</a>.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Party Share is another feature that will be phased in and released globally in the coming weeks. This feature allows players to share party voice chat links on any messaging or social media app, allowing them to invite friends from whichever platform they are chatting on. The friend can use the link even if they aren’t on your friends list on the PlayStation Network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players can create a party link through the Control Center on the PS5, generating a QR code that can be sent to friends. Along with the PS5, the PlayStation App will receive an update in the coming weeks, allowing players to create a party link from their phones.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-ps5-beta-features-releasing-today">PS5 Beta Features Releasing Today</h2>



<p>Although the Welcome Hub and Party Share will take a few weeks to roll out globally, the PS5 has some new features that players can try today. These include personalized 3D audio profiles that can be set for headphones or earbuds, an option to enable Remote Play for individual users, and adaptive charging for controllers.&nbsp;Learn more about the new PS5 features <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-beta-rolls-out-tomorrow-with-personalized-3d-audio-new-remote-play-settings-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto VI Is Unlikely To Run At 60 FPS On The PlayStation 5 Pro If Rockstar Is Targeting 30 FPS On the Base Model]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-60-fps-playstation-5-pro/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-unlikely-to-run-at-60-fps-on-the-playstation-5-pro-if-rockstar-is-targeting-30-fps-on-the-base-model.978780/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-60-fps-playstation-5-pro/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite its increased power over the original mode, the PlayStation 5 Pro may not be able to run the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI at 60 frames per second for a few reasons.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts">IGN</a>, Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter revealed that the new console's CPU, which is the same one that powers the base PS5, could prevent the system from running the game at 60 frames per second if Rockstar Games is targeting 30 FPS on the base model. Most entries in the series have always run complex simulations that push the CPU hard, and this is why each one of them initially ran at 30 FPS or lower.</p>
<p>This is not to say that Grand Theft Auto VI won't look better on the PlayStation 5 Pro than on the base model. According to the Digital Foundry expert, the console will offer higher-quality visuals thanks to its considerable GPU improvements over the base model and could definitely deliver more stable performance, as the console's CPU, while the same as that of the regular PlayStation 5, received a 10% bump to clock speeds.</p>
<p>As Rockstar Games has only briefly discussed Grand Theft Auto VI and shown it off in only one trailer, it's definitely too early to say if the game will target 30 FPS on the base PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, and it may be a while before we hear more about the matter. As of now,<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-not-delayed/"> the game hasn't been delayed</a>, but its scale and complexity may cause a delay down the line and make it slip to 2026, something that could delay future reveals as well.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches late next year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

<p>Xbox’s Phil Spencer has announced in an internal email to staff that Microsoft will lay off approximately 650 people from its gaming team.</p>



<p>The news comes from Stephen Totilo from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-xbox-650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game File</a>, which Insider Gaming has been able to independently verify.</p>



<p>The full email reads,</p>



<p><strong>Subject: Changes to Microsoft Gaming</strong></p>



<p>“For the past year, our goal has been to minimize disruption while welcoming new teams and enabling them to do their best work. As part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business, we have made the decision to eliminate approximately 650 roles across Microsoft Gaming—mostly corporate and supporting functions—to organize our business for long term success.</p>



<p>I know that this is difficult news to hear. We are deeply grateful for the contributions of our colleagues who are learning they are impacted. In the US, we’re supporting them with exit packages that include severance, extended healthcare, and outplacement services to help with their transition; outside the US packages will differ according to location.</p>



<p>With these changes, our corporate and supporting teams and resources are aligned for sustainable future growth, and can better support our studio teams and business units with programs and resources that can scale to meet their needs. Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games. No games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today.</p>



<p>Throughout our team’s history, we have had great moments, and we have had challenging ones. Today is one of the challenging days. I know that going through more changes like this is hard, but even in the most trying times, this team has been able to come together and show one another care and kindness as we work to continue delivering for our players. We appreciate your support as we navigate these changes and we thank you for your compassion and respect for each other.</p>



<p>Phil”</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that it would be&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-microsoft-layoffs-affect-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laying off 1900 employees at the company</a>. In May 2024, it was also announced that Xbox would&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-shutting-down-four-studios-including-tango-game-works-and-arkane-austin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down four of its game studios</a>, including Tango Gamewords and Arkane Austin.</p>



<p>Let us know what you think of the latest round of layoffs on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forum</a>. </p>

            <p>Microsoft has laid off a further 650 Xbox staff, though no games have been cancelled or studios have been closed this time.</p>
<p>The news was shared by CEO of Microsoft Gaming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> in an internal memo obtained by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff">IGN</a>, with changes made to "organise our business for long term success".</p>
<p>The layoffs <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">follow the 1900 people who lost their jobs at the company in January</a> this year. It means Microsoft has now laid off 2,550 staff in the last year.</p>

<p>The roles affected are "mostly corporate and supporting functions," said Spencer</p>
<p>"For the past year, our goal has been to minimise disruption while welcoming new teams and enabling them to do their best work. As part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business, we have made the decision to eliminate approximately 650 roles across Microsoft Gaming - mostly corporate and supporting functions - to organise our business for long term success," reads Spencer's email.</p>
<p>"I know that this is difficult news to hear. We are deeply grateful for the contributions of our colleagues who are learning they are impacted. In the US, we’re supporting them with exit packages that include severance, extended healthcare, and outplacement services to help with their transition; outside the US packages will differ according to location."</p>
<p>Spencer stated now the company's "corporate and supporting teams and resources are aligned for sustainable future growth", but confirmed "no games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today".</p>
<p>On top of those 1900 layoffs in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Microsoft shut down three studios in June</a>: Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, and Alpha Dog.</p>

			<p>How, in the name of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, do you turn the delightfully inconsistent nature of Quidditch into a coherent sport for online multiplayer? Well, after many hours with Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, I’m still not entirely sure of the answer. I don’t think developer Unbroken Studios knows either, though they’ve had a ruddy good go of it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions - Official Launch Gameplay Walkthrough Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EMJpa5uyugw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Quidditch is a fantastic sport for scripted storytelling, be it in a novel or a film. Big, bombastic, dramatic, spectacular and a bit weird, those broomstick riding daredevils have been thrilling fans of the Wizarding World for years now. When it comes to a video game though, the narrative-led nature of Quidditch prove to be a bit messy. Unbroken Studios have attempted to bring order to the chaos with some clearer and more consistent rules.</p>


<p>Each team consists of six team members: three Chasers, one Beater, one Seeker, and one Keeper. As a solo player you can switch between the four roles at will, swapping to each character with the stab of a button, but in the 3v3 online, all players are assigned a Chaser and one of the other three classes. It’s a smart mechanic adapted other sports games, because when it comes to Quidditch, some positions are far more fun and meaningful to play in than others.</p>


<p>Being a Beater is terrific fun. Your job is to beat up opposing players and eliminate them from the match for a brief, but vital, period. You do this by summoning a Bludgeon – thankfully you don’t have to go find the Bludgeon, and instead you bring into existence with magic – and then launching it with wanton abandon at a teenager’s delicate and still developing skull.</p>
<p>Everyone wants to be a Beater, so chances are you’ll get to do this the least. Instead, judging by my experience, you are more likely to end up being the mostly pants Keeper and Seeker.</p>
<p>Being a Keeper is rubbish. Hanging out around the three hoop like goal posts, you can attempt to tackle player’s heading your way or intercept the ball – sorry, Quaffle. Controls are haphazard and the whole endevour feels fumbly. You’ll succeed and fail by accident, with skill or intention having little impact on proceedings. You can call plays, but it’s so ineffective on the outcome of a game – plus all the other players ignore you anyway – that it’s not worth your while.</p>

<p>Being a Seeker is slightly more enjoyable. You’ll spend most of your time doing nothing until a little flying ball called a Snitch is released. Then you need to leap into action, tracking the Snitch down, then chasing and catching it. Smartly, instead of securing your team 150 points and ending the match, you instead net 30 points and the game continues until 100 points is reached. Thing is, chasing a snitch, according to the Harry Potter books at least, should be thrilling and dangerous. Here it’s just a chore. You fly back and forth along the pitch, unable to fly particularly high due to restrictive invisible walls, waiting for a meter to fill until you finally are allowed to catch the snitch.</p>
<p>Finally, the Chaser is the more generic role that all players share in. Here you’ll throw and pass the Quaffle, launch tackles, and try to be a good team player. I say try, because teamwork doesn’t often happen in Quidditch Champions. Did you ever play in a football team when you were eight or nine years-old? You know the way that wherever the ball gets hoofed, every child, in every position, runs like their possessed after the ball? Well, Quidditch Champions is like that. You all chase after the Quaffle, passing and tactics be damned. The game just isn’t built for it. Maybe you get lucky, get the Quaffle and score, but you won’t get much satisfaction, there’s just too much random flukiness in this sport for that.</p>

<p>And yet, despite all these issues, there’s something occasionally oddly engaging about Quidditch Champions. Sometimes, not often, you get a decent match and everything makes sense. Plus, the visuals are lovely, the charming cartoon versions of Harry, Hermione, Ron, and co are filled with character. The voice over work is superb too, everyone sounding exactly as you imagined when reading the original books.</p>
<p>Then there’s the speed. This game plays fast, and boosting along on your broomstick feels just the right amount of punchy.Sadly, the camera can’t keep up. Rarely can you see where you want to go, following the action being near impossible. The HUD is weak too, failing to enable you to easily tell where the Quaffle even is, let along identify friend from foe – likely part of why everyone just flies from one end of the pitch to the other, refusing to pass. I mean, how can you pass if you can’t tell who’s even on your team?</p>
<p>At this stage of its release, with limited match options, arenas, characters, and outfits, you’ll likely have seen everything that Quidditch Champions has to offer in a few days. There is something here, a spark of a great game waiting to be, but Unbroken Studios are just going to have to put their collective broomsticks into overdrive to get there before their player base moves on.</p>

			<p>A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-update-24-05-09-60-00-performance-improvements/">PlayStation 5 system software update</a> is now live worldwide, introducing some new features, including those that were under testing the past few weeks with the latest beta firmware.</p>
<p>System software update 24.06 introduces the Welcome hub, a new personalized space on the console's home screen that players can customize with different widgets that display console storage, battery levels for accessories, online friends, trophies and many others. The size of each widget, as well as the background of the hub, can be changed at will. The Welcome hub will start rolling out for select users in the U.S. today, and support will be gradually expanded over the coming weeks starting in Japan and select European countries.</p>
<p>The new PlayStation 5 system software update also introduces a new Party Share feature that allows users to share party voice chat links on any messaging or social media app. This feature allows even users who haven't been added to the PlayStation Network friends list to join a voice chat. A PlayStation App update coming in the next few weeks will introduce a similar feature to the app.</p>
<p>Alongside these features, as already mentioned, the new PlayStation 5 system software update introduces new features that some users already got to try out with the latest beta firmware, such as personalized 3D audio profiles for headphones and earbuds and a new Remote Play setting that allows individual users to enable Remote Play. More information on everything the new system software update brings can be found on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/12/ps5-system-update-adds-welcome-hub-party-share-personalized-3d-audio-profiles-adaptive-controller-charging-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official PlayStation Blog.</a></p>

            <p>
Every man has his breaking point, and mine is the DP motion, aka the D-pad input used to perform Ken's Shoryuken uppercut in Street Fighter, and moves like it in other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighting</a> games. I've never been able to perform it consistently. It's one of many moderately fiddly special attacks - written down for posterity in a tear-stained journal I keep sorrowfully beneath my pillow - which have walled me out of enjoying fighting games, much as I love thinking about them. 
</p>
<p>
That wall grows ever higher as I age and my digits turn to dust and my dreams of launching Ryu like a sack of potatoes fade into the twilight. Still, at least I can still play and have fun with shooters, right? All you have to do in shooters is press a button once to make stuff go boom. Wait, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nightmare-operator">Nightmare Operator</a>, what are you doing? Nightmare Operator, no!

<p>
Nightmare Operator is a third-person "action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>" game in which you play Misha, a trigger-happy exorcist hunting folkloric abominations in a sumptuous low-poly, low-res Tokyo. Misha has a fancy modular gun, with modules inflicting different types of elemental damage and status effects. "Learning when your next shot is going to send a Youkai reeling or freeze them solid is key to survival," notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2957360/NIGHTMARE_OPERATOR/">the Steam blurb</a>, and yes, I am on board with this. I do like me a modular gun. I still think fondly of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rogue-trooper-remaster">Rogue Trooper</a>. But there is a twist: the game uses a Clutch system whereby you "rapidly switch between Weapons Modules using command inputs inspired by fighting games".
</p>
<p>
Please, DDDistortion. I can get my head around a Power Reload, but do not ask me to nail the fingering for a Zangief Screw Piledriver in order to plug in some ice bullets. From the looks of the just-released Tokyo Game Show trailer, above, Misha also gets a parry and melee counters. You'll need to keep a "level head". It's all so <em>technical</em>, ugh. And yes, they've got my old nemesis the DP motion in there.
</p>

<p>
The enemies themselves are a characterful bunch. They're inspired by yokai stories, but I don't know much about yokai, so will paraphrase them in the clunky lingo of the Clueless Westerner. You've got Wizard Dog, who throws X-shaped bursts of energy balls. There's also Knife-Wielding School Girl With Wonky Face, who likes to slink behind shelves and pounce on you. Stretchy Neck Dude seems fond of peeking around corners - he reminds me of those stampeding necromorphs from Dead Space 2. And let's not forget Floating Cyborg Head, who charges up an energy beam that seems easy to dodge, but will probably prove vexing when you're battling several spectres. 
</p>
<p>
Its an impressive line-up, honestly. And I'm sure the fighting game gimmick adds flair. I look forward to hearing about how fun these creatures are to battle from Brendy, our resident Tekkenite.
</p>
<p>
The game's PSX-styled setting is wonderfully crisp and dingy and full of cyber-90s detailing - glitching holograms, piles of boxy TVs broadcasting weird sigils, the sunken radiance of vending machines. There's a slice-of-life hangout element to wash down the exor-shooting. "Between missions, Misha and her team have nomikai at a local izakaya in the Quarantine City," explains the Steam blurb. "These sections will allow players to explore archives from the broken world of Nightmare Operator, interact with the inhabitants of the Quarantine City, and drool over low-poly izakaya fare." 
</p>
<p>
It sounds reminiscent of cooling off in the back alleys of Yakuza Zero. Again, thoroughly on board with this as a concept if not at the level of my thumbs. Still, perhaps if I play it and master it I'll be able to enjoy Street Fighter?

            <p>A fresh PS5 system software update is on the way that adds a new customisable Welcome Hub to the home screen.</p>
<p>The Welcome Hub will be a tab on the home screen - like the store or individual games - which players can customise with widgets for a personalised experience. Essentially, it's a reworked version of the Explore tab previously only available in the U.S.</p>
<p>Players in the U.S. will receive the Welcome Hub today, with Japan and select countries in Europe following "over the coming weeks", and then a full worldwide release.</p>

<p>Widgets include the likes of console storage, controller battery levels, online friends, trophies, and more. Widgets can be resized and the background can be altered to preset designs with animated effects, or your own screenshot.</p>
<p>Another addition in the system update is a phased release of Party Share, which will allow players to share a party voice chat link on any messaging or social media app via QR code. It means you can add any player to your voice chat without needing to be friends on PlayStation Network.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, some features included in a previous beta will roll out globally today. That includes personalised 3D audio profiles, the ability to adjust remote play settings for individual users, and adaptive charging for your controllers.</p>
<p>The latter helps save power by adjusting the length of time power is supplied to a controller when charging. However, this is only available for the PS5 Slim and newly announced PS5 Pro.</p>
<p>Full details can be found on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/12/ps5-system-update-adds-welcome-hub-party-share-personalized-3d-audio-profiles-adaptive-controller-charging-and-more/?sf274610465=1">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Sony finally announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">digital-only PS5 Pro</a>, which comes with a £700 price tag. It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-quietly-increases-price-of-playstation-5-dualsense-controller">quietly increased the price of a PS5 DualSense controller</a> before the announcement.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
