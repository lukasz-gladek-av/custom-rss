<p>Unity, maker of a popular cross-platform engine and toolkit, will not pursue a broadly unpopular Runtime Fee that would have charged developers based on game installs rather than per-seat licenses. The move comes exactly one year after the fee's initial announcement.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee">a blog post</a> attributed to President and CEO Matt Bromberg, the CEO writes that the company cannot continue "democratizing game development" without "a partnership built on trust." Bromberg states that customers understand the necessity of price increases, but not in "a novel and controversial new form." So game developers will not be charged per installation, but they will be sorted into Personal, Pro, and Enterprise tiers by level of revenue or funding.</p>
<p>"Canceling the Runtime Fee for games and instituting these pricing changes will allow us to continue investing to improve game development for everyone while also being better partners," Bromberg writes.</p>
<h2>A year of discontent</h2>
<p>Unity's announcement of a new "Runtime Fee that's based on game installs" in mid-September 2023 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230912135629/https://blog.unity.com/news/plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates">Wayback archive</a>), while joined by cloud storage and "AI at runtime," would have been costly for smaller developers who found success. The Runtime Fee would have cost 20 cents per install on the otherwise free Personal tier after a game had reached $200,000 in revenue and more than 200,000 installs. Fees decreased slightly for Pro and Enterprise customers after $1 million in revenue and 1 million installs.
</p><p>The move led to almost immediate <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/game-developers-unite-against-unitys-new-per-install-pricing-structure/">backlash from many developers</a>. Unity, whose then-CEO John Riccitiello had <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/theres-no-royalties-no-f-ing-around-riccitiello">described in 2015</a> as having "no royalties, no [f-ing] around," was "quite simply not a company to be trusted," wrote <a href="https://insertcredit.com/opinion/unity/">Necrosoft Games' Brandon Sheffield</a>. Developers said they would hold off updates or switch engines rather than absorb the fee, which would have retroactively counted installs before January 2024 toward its calculations.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Unity's terms of service <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/wait-is-unity-allowed-to-just-change-its-fee-structure-like-that/">seemed to allow for such sudden shifts</a>. Unity <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/unity-makes-major-changes-to-controversial-install-fee-program/">softened the impact of the fee</a> on Personal users, removed the backdated install counting, and capped fees at 2.5 percent of revenue. Unity Create President and General Manager Marc Whitten <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/unity-exec-tells-ars-hes-on-a-mission-to-earn-back-developer-trust/">told Ars at that time</a> that while the fee would seemingly not affect the vast majority of Unity users, he understood that a stable agreement should be a feature of the engine.
</p><p>However coincidentally or not, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-is-retiring-effective-immediately/">Riccitiello announced his retirement</a> the next month, which led to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/game-devs-say-riccitiello-leaving-unity-is-a-step-in-the-right-direction/">some celebration among devs</a>, but not total restoration of trust. A <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/unity-cuts-25-percent-of-workforce-as-it-refocuses-on-game-engine-business/">massive wave of layoffs</a> throughout the winter of 2023 and 2024 showed that Unity's financial position was precarious, partly due to acquisitions during Riccitiello's term. The Runtime Fee would have minimal impact in 2024, the company said in filings, but would "ramp from there as customers adopt our new releases."</p>
<p>Instead of ramping from there, the Runtime Fee is now gone, and Unity has made other changes to its pricing structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unity Personal remains free, and its revenue/funding ceiling increases from $100,000 to $200,000</li>
<li>Unity Pro, for customers over the Personal limit, sees an 8 percent price increase to $2,200 per seat</li>
<li>Unity Enterprise, with customized packages for those over $25 million in revenue or funding, sees a 25 percent increase.</li>
</ul>
<p>"From this point forward, it’s our intention to revert to a more traditional cycle of considering any potential price increases only on an annual basis," Bromberg wrote in his post. Changes to Unity's Editor software should allow customers to keep using their existing version under previously agreed terms, he wrote.</p>

            <p>There's no greater tool in video games than a grappling hook. 2022's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grapple-dog">Grapple Dog</a> knew that, making it the core ability of its platforming. The ability returns in sequel Grapple Dogs: Cosmic Canines, out today, although there's now a second character to play as for those fools who favour shooting over hooking.

<p>Pablo, the protagonist from the first game, returns with some new powers including fire-dashing, but players can also switch on the fly to a secondary pup, Luna. Luna seems to be Shadow to Pablo's Sonic: an edgy anti-hero with an arsenal of guns that might be better suited to certain enemies or challenges.
</p>
<p>Otherwise it seems to closely follow the formula of the first game. That won't please everyone. Matt Cox found the original pretty frustrating in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grapple-dog-review">Grapple Dog review</a>, as it killed him over and over with big gaps between checkpoints. 
</p>
<p>"Demanding mastery through repetition can work for platformers, but only if it’s done carefully and thoughtfully, where you don’t have to go slug through long trivial stretches before you get another go at the hard bit. The grappling here feels good when you’re allowed to build momentum, but too many levels are more interested in killing it," he wrote.
</p>
<p>That's pretty negative, and Grapple Dog never clicked with me either in the short time I played. Still, I watch every trailer of the first game and of this sequel and think, yeah, that looks like good stuff. I want to be good at that.
</p>
<p>So here's news of the sequel. I'll try getting into it again. Grapple Dogs: Cosmic Canines is out now and currently costs £12/$14.39/€13.99 with the 20% launch discount <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2278790/Grapple_Dogs_Cosmic_Canines/">over on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The break-in allegedly occurred at 3:30 A.M. while  store employees were closing up for the night. The thieves had what appeared to be a knife. After tying up the employees, the two robbers walked out with over $70,000 worth of valuable <em>Pokémon</em> cards.

According to police, before tying them up with rope and covering their mouths with tape, the duo asked the employees which <em>Pokémon</em> cards were worth stealing. The thieves then left with over 100 trading cards worth about $10 million yen or about $70,000 USD. So it seems the employees did a good job recommending which cards to grab.</p><p>Police say the thieves took the two staff members’ phones and wallets, too. No injuries were reported.

<p>As the buildup to the release of Civilization 7 continues, Firaxis Games held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjUdkPW3zLg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">developer livestream</a> on Thursday afternoon. This hour-plus long session gave players a look at the Antiquity Age in Civilization 7, along with a number of new features coming to the game.</p>



<p>In addition to gameplay from the Antiquity Age, the developers gave a preview of transitioning from Antiquity to the Exploration Age. There was also a new reveal of Greece as an Antiquity Age civilization.</p>



<p>If you want to watch the full stream, you can do so below. However, we’ve also put together a recap of all the key highlights you need  to know about the game.</p>



<p>Civilization 7 releases on February 11, 2025 for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. Let us know your thoughts on how Civilization 7 is shaping up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/civilization-7-antiquity-age-livestream-recap.157/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the all new Insider Gaming Forums!</a></p>



<h2 id="h-civilization-7-antiquity-age-livestream-gameplay-highlights">Civilization 7 Antiquity Age Livestream Gameplay Highlights</h2>



<ul>
<li>The first unit in the game are Founders. Founders create capital cities in Civilization 7 whereas Settler units establish towns. They are separate units.</li>



<li>Settlers won’t just get captured immediately when attacked. They can now attempt to defend themselves. However, they no longer get captured at all, instead they get destroyed.</li>



<li>Each civilization will have its own original soundtrack (OST) in the game.</li>



<li>Two types of rivers: minor and navigable.</li>



<li>Happiness is a full yield in Civilization 7.</li>



<li>Amina is a confirmed leader for the game.</li>



<li>The first unit you build in the Antiquity Age — Scout or Warrior — only take one turn, so you’ll have them by turn two.</li>



<li>Various terrain will end all movement. These include areas like vegetation (changes based on biome), rough terrain, and wetlands. Some units have the ability to move right through the difficult terrains.</li>



<li>Tech’s don’t unlock tile improvements. Instead, they unlock the yields for them.</li>



<li>No more workers/builders or unit. New Grow City action brings you options for what you can do on various tiles in your city.</li>



<li>City must grow linearly.</li>



<li>City expansion regarding tiles is the same as Civilization 6.</li>



<li>Scouts have a new search skill to reveal the area around them. There’s also a permanent lookout skill for the map.</li>



<li>Discoveries give you small narratives within the game, and options for the rewards you claim.</li>



<li>Each district can hold up to two buildings.</li>



<li>You can take areas such as a woodcutter, and move them to a different tile. You can then relocate the population somewhere else to still take advantage of them.</li>



<li>Eurekas and Inspirations are no longer part of the game. Similar goals still exist, but they don’t give any sort of boost to the tech tree. Instead, they are quests you can accept that yield various rewards.</li>



<li>Special districts are created by combining specific buildings that give bonuses based on the civilization.</li>



<li>Your Happiness yield will help determine your celebrations based on a threshold. The government within your civilization will change the celebrations offered.</li>



<li>Influence is used for diplomatic  actions within the game.</li>



<li>Settled downs can have specialties such as mining, farming, trade towns, etc.</li>



<li>If you go above city limits, you will suffer happiness penalties.</li>



<li>Great People are unique to civilizations.</li>



<li>Roads are created between cities automatically within a certain distance.</li>



<li>Every civilization has a unique wonder that can be unlocked in different ways</li>

<p>Another year, another Thunderpick World Championship. This ever-evolving Counter-Strike 2 tournament now boasts a $1 million prize pool, which is the largest single prize ever offered by a sportsbook in a competitive setting. Recently, the full roster of teams was locked in as Thunderpick announced the invited teams that’ll join those that qualified in a series of events held since April 2024.</p>



<p>Last year, the inaugural Thunderpick World Championship took place, boasting a $600,000 prize pool, the majority of which was claimed by FaZe Clan.</p>

<p>Later this year, the Thunderpick World Championship will come to a close in Berlin, Germany. It has been running in a qualification capacity since April, and in November, everything comes to a head. On a grand stage, some of the best Counter-Strike teams in the business will compete for the lion’s share of a massive $1 million prize, a record-setting sum.</p>



<p>It was recently announced that the following teams have been invited to compete in the final stages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Heroic</li>



<li>M80</li>



<li>Fnatic</li>



<li>Falcons</li>
</ul>



<p>They’ll be joining the teams that qualified through a string of events held earlier this year:</p>



<ul>
<li>Bestia</li>



<li>BIG</li>



<li>Cloud9</li>



<li>Imperial</li>



<li>Team Legacy</li>



<li>BLEED</li>
</ul>



<p>In anticipation of the landmark event, Thunderpick’s Kelly Sanders said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Thunderpick World Championship 2024 is shaping up to be one of the most exciting tournaments of the year. With the caliber of teams and record-setting prize pool, we can expect intense competition and high-quality gameplay that will captivate fans and players around the world.</p>
</blockquote>

It comes with gold Zelda-themed Joy-Con controllers, a white dock accented with the Hylian Crest and a circular pattern that matches the back of the console itself. The console does not come with the game, but you can grab a copy for a discount at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Breath-Wild-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B097B2YWFX?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>.</p><p>It's a big plus that this special-edition was made for the OLED console, the best of the three Switch models. It has the same internal hardware as the base model Switch, but with some welcome improvements like double the internal storage, a sturdier kickstand, and a wider dock with an ethernet port.</p><p>Naturally, the biggest improvement is swapping LCD for OLED screen tech. The 7-inch display is gorgeous. Nintendo games often have bright color palettes, and the Switch OLED has a wider and more vibrant color range. The other big benefit of OLED displays is they handle black and dark colors better than LCD displays.</p><p>If you decide to pick up the Zelda-themed Switch OLED ahead of Echoes of Wisdom's launch, there are some accessories you could pair it with.</p><p>The official <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Legend-Kingdom/dp/B0BZTFWHV9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tears of the Kingdom Switch Pro Controller</a> originally launched alongside the console for $75. It's been out of stock at major retailers ever since, but you can pick one up for $85 from a third-party seller with Prime delivery directly from Amazon.</p><p>That's a pretty solid price at this point, but you could opt for third-party Zelda controllers to save some cash. One option is this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Wireless-Nintendo-Switch-Controller-Officially/dp/B0BZMJTD6V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PowerA wireless controller featuring the Master Sword, Hylian Shield, and Hylian Crest</a>. It's on sale for only $27, down from $45, and it has two remappable back buttons.</p><p>The Zelda-themed Joy-Con controllers are certainly pretty, but Joy-Cons aren't the best in the ergonomics department. One way to fix that would be to pick up a Switch OLED grip that adds traditional controller handles for portable play. Satisfye released an excellent (unofficial) Zelda-themed grip specifically designed to match the Tears of the Kingdom console. You can pick up the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Satisfye-Compatible-Comfortable-Ergonomic-Accessories/dp/B0BZZDMYHW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ZenGrip Pro</a> for $45, or you can grab the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Satisfye-Compatible-Comfortable-Ergonomic-Accessories/dp/B0CDD9CFKN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">newer ZenGrip Ronin</a>--grants access to the kickstand when the grip is attached--for $50. A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Satisfye-Inc-ZenGrip-Accessories-Compatible-Nintendo/dp/B0CDNP22W6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ronin bundle with a matching carrying case</a> is available for $70.</p><p>The console comes with a Joy-Con grip for docked play, but if you want a Zelda-themed model, there are a few options for cheap. For $13.49, you can get a grip from PowerA featuring <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Joy-Comfort-Grip-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0B5S1KY83?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Princess Zelda</a>. PowerA also has versions featuring <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Comfort-Nintendo-Switch-Gaming-Console/dp/B0C8MCBRZ5?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Link</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Joy-Comfort-Grip-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0CT5HYJ2H?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Master Sword</a>.</p><p>Alternatively, you can keep your Zelda Joy-Con controllers pristine by swapping them out for the Tears of the Kingdom-themed Split Pad Pro by Hori.

Having teased <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s latest season of content last week, EA has more firmly detailed its upcoming Storybook Nursery Kit and Artist Studio Kit DLC releases, which are both now set to arrive next Thursday, 19th September.
</p>
<p>
Starting with The Sims 4's Artist Studio Kit, it includes - as you've probably already guessed - a bunch of new furniture items and decorative bric-a-brac that can be combined to make a suitably chaotic space for Sims to unleash their creativity.
</p>
<p>
"Set up your new easel in the centre of your studio," EA writes, "surrounded by tools of the trade – a variety of brushes, colourful paint cans and new inspiring still-life objects that Sims can paint from reference or draw creativity from." Expect drawers and shelves, tubes of paint, sketchbooks, palettes, plus a new tablet and woodworking table.

<p>
As for the Storybook Nursery Kit, this one's been developed in conjunction with renowned Sims 4 creator SixamCC. The theme here is 'balancing the joy of a new arrival with elevated charm', and its included ojects are all designed to look as if they were "passed down through generations and will be passed down to future generations, ensuring a legacy of elegance within each family".
</p>
<p>
"Bring your newborns, infants and toddlers into a space that balances sophistication and whimsy with delicately crafted toys, appealing wallpaper, a dreamy mobile, and more," continues EA's blurb, "available in colours that range from rich and moody darks to delicate pastels of a bygone era." It'll also feature "ornate cribs, bassinets and beds, a sweeping canopy and a tasteful chandelier".

<p>
Expect The Sims 4's Storybook Nursery Kit and Artist Studio Kit DLC to each cost around £4.99/$4.99 USD when they launch next Thursday, 19th September, on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Mac, and PC (via the EA App, Steam, and the Epic Games Store).
</p>
<p>
And as for what's next, EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-journeying-through-life-and-beyond-in-latest-expansion-this-halloween">previously revealed</a> the free Reaper's Rewards Event is coming to The Sim 4's base game on 24th September, and the still-mysterious Life and Death Expansion Pack is due to launch on 31st October - with more details being shared on 3rd October.

<p>Gray Zone Warfare hit the open market in early access back in April and has been turning heads ever since. With a fresh approach to the tactical FPS genre that fuses it with extraction shooter elements, ‘GZW’ was able to sell almost one million copies in just a few weeks.</p>



<p>Recently, the development team at MADFINGER released a lengthy roadmap that details the most major changes coming up to 2027.</p>

<h2 id="h-long-road-ahead">Long Road Ahead</h2>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare is a slow burner, that much is certain. It’s not a flash in the pan or a ‘built-in-a-day’ kind of project, and it certainly has legs and the dedication of a studio ready to unravel the production over several years.</p>



<p>I recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madfinger-ceo-interview-tarkov-extraction-shooter-gray-zone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sat down with the MADFINGER team</a>, including the studio’s CEO, at Gamescom, getting an exclusive look at some of the upcoming content.</p>



<p>Now, the squad has released one of the most ambitious roadmaps I’ve ever seen, covering updates through 2027 and up to the 1.0 release of the game:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It all begins with Night Ops, which drops in a few weeks. It’s the most major update MADFINGER has applied to Gray Zone Warfare thus far, and it’ll bring a day/night cycle to the game that completely changes the playing field.</p>



<p>Next year, Dark Revelations will surface, expanding the game’s story and lore. From there, the team will broaden GZW’s horizons with Elite Operator (Fall 2025), Battle Forge (Spring 2026), Shadow Strike (Fall 2026), and Rising Tensions (Spring 2027).</p>



<p>While these updates are being prepped, improvements and amendments will be made to the game to keep things fresh and smooth for both the new players and those who already consider themselves veterans of Lamang, the massive, open-world map that’s modelled on countries like Laos.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been given a date, but the 1.0 release of Gray Zone Warfare has been teased with the title ‘Ground Zero’. We all know that <strong>something </strong>happened at the core of the map, introducing an impassable area thick with radiation, but we don’t know what it is.</p>



<p>Colour me excited.</p>

                <p>With Sony announcing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/" data-ref-id="1100-6523695">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> earlier this week, a lot of attention has now shifted towards how the improved power of the console might be used to enhance both games on the market, and those that might launch soon. As one of the largest games on the horizon, it's unsurprising that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> has been included in the discussion, particularly around its potential to run at 60 frames per second.</p><p>Unfortunately, it seems that even with the additional GPU power of the PS5 Pro, this might not be possible. That's according to Richard Leadbetter, editor at renowned games and tech analysis outlet <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a>. Echoing statements he made during the initial reveal of Grand Theft Auto VI, Leadbetter says that the limiting factor when it comes to running games like GTA VI at higher framerates is the CPU, and not the GPU. And since the PS5 Pro shares the same CPU as the less-powerful base PS5, it's unlikely that Sony's new console will offer up much of an improvement.</p>

<p>"Grand Theft Auto games have always run complex simulations that push the CPU hard, which is why every GTA game has initially launched on their target platforms at 30fps (or lower!)," Leadbetter explained to <a href="https://za.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-vi/200624/feature/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "The PS5 Pro uses the same CPU as the PS5 and it would be extremely challenging to hit 60fps if the base PS5 version is targeting 30fps. This isn't a GPU problem, it's a CPU problem."</p><p>If you've been playing Rockstar's games on console exclusively, none of this should be too surprising. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v/" data-ref-id="5000-108839">Grand Theft Auto V</a> launched on Xbox One and PS4 in 2013, and was confined to a 30fps limit even after the launch of the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X. This only changed relatively recently, with the game being patched to support 60fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X in 2022. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2/" data-ref-id="5000-458780">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, another game that initially launched on the previous generation of consoles, is still locked to 30fps on current-generation hardware.</p><p>Sony revealed the PS5 Pro as an answer to customers that tired from having to choose between fidelity and performance modes in games. The console was pitched with the idea of being able to deliver image quality equal to (or better than) games on fidelity or quality modes, but with the smoothness of 60 frames per second. This doesn't mean that the option between performance modes will disappear entirely, and it's plausible that bespoke 30fps modes could return as developers attempt to use the additional resources available to enhance visual fidelity even further at the expense of framerates.</p><p>Grand Theft Auto VI is still in active development, and so nothing can be said for certain about regarding what the Rockstar might be targeting as a baseline for performance. But given the route the studio has historically taken, coupled with the reasoning behind why such an improvement might be possible on the PS5 Pro, it would seem optimistic to think otherwise. Grand Theft Auto VI is expected to launch in 2025, with no exact release date yet announced. The PS5 Pro launches on November 7th, starting at $699.</p>

            <p>There seem to be an infinite number of video game showcase streams these days, each one promising to be full of exciting indie games. Whatever my feelings about the entertainment value of these streams, I can't deny I watch all of them, or that they introduce me to games I might have otherwise missed.
</p>
<p>Next on the calendar is the Convegence games showcase on September 26th, which is a new event that - hey, what a twist - promises to feature exciting indie games. It does have some recognisable publishers onboard, including Secret Mode, Thunderful, and Kepler, among others.

<p>Thunderful are best known for the SteamWorld games, while Secret Mode published Still Wakes The Deep and A Little To The Left and Kepler are the folks behind the recent Flintlock: The Siege Of Dawn and Cat Quest 3 and the upcoming Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Other publishers with games in the showcase include Fireshine Games, Yogscast Games, Miju Games and The Arcade Crew, at least some of which I've heard of.
</p>
<p>The show will be hosted by the YouTubers and Twitch streamers ESO Danny, Dexbonus and Wanderbots, if those names mean anything to you. Dexbonus is the only streamer I have ever watched regularly, which means I get to feel marginally less out of touch than normal.
</p>
<p>I find most showcase streams blur together into a grey goo of badly scripted trailer intros, and that I can't remember most of the games featured minutes after the stream ends. I will remember one or two games, however, and anytime I've spoken to a developer about the efficacy of such streams, they've all pointed to spikes in Steam Wishlist numbers after being included. That means I should probably put my rain away and just watch the parade.
</p>
<p>The Convergence games showcase will be streamed on September 26th at 12pm PST/8pm BST via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@convergence_gs">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Convergence_GS">Twitch</a>, and the other usual places.

<p>Drama Studios, the developers behind the hyper-realistic first-person shooter Unrecord has announced that it’s raised $2.5 million in seed funding. </p>



<p>The French studio says that money will be used to improve its “core development team”. With a larger team, the company will work to bring the game to a “solid demo state” for players to experience. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Unrecord debuted <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tactical-shooter-unrecorded-offers-unprecedented-fps-immersion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to viral success</a> when people first saw a gameplay trailer that looked <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-unrecord-gameplay-footage-fake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a little too realistic</a> to be a game. Since then, the team at Drama has been working on the game while securing funding.</p>



<p>As far as the funding goes, most comes from The Games Fund. Despite getting interest from other publishers, the studio went with the VC due to their “aligned values and vision for the games industry”. </p>



<p>Drama will look for publishing and “strategic partnership opportunities” are the game gets to the aforementioned demo state.</p>



<p>Unrecord is a tactical shooter that plays out from the perspective of an officer’s body camera.</p>



<p>“The storyline in Unrecord can be compared to a detective novel or a thriller,” Drama Studios says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2381520/Unrecord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on the game’s Steam page</a>. “The player will have to investigate several criminal cases and confront a diverse cast of characters.”</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FLAPPY BIRD IS BACK!</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"It's been a decade-long, convoluted journey to get here, but we're so excited to finally begin sharing Flappy Bird once again with the world," a spokesperson for the Flappy Bird Foundation said of the game's upcoming reboot.</p><p dir="ltr">The Flappy Bird Foundation says that "the return of the viral game will debut in Fall 2024," but added, "Launches on iOS and Google Play are planned for 2025." GameSpot has reached out to the Flappy Bird Foundation for clarification, but it seems that players will get a taste of the game sometime near the end of 2024, before the game officially launches on browsers and mobile devices in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">"Flappy Bird will return to a variety of platforms, including web browsers and new dedicated apps planned in 2025 for iOS and Android, with other platforms to be announced," read a press release from the Flappy Bird Foundation, suggesting players may even see a console launch at some point.</p><p dir="ltr">The original Flappy Bird launched in May 2013 for iOS and January 2014 for Android, but was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-rise-and-fall-of-flappy-bird/1100-6417647/" data-ref-id="1100-6417647">removed from both Google Play and the App Store</a> on February 10, 2014, after its creator, Vietnamese game developer Dong Nguyen, became overwhelmed by the popularity of the game--and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lananhnguyen/2014/02/11/exclusive-flappy-bird-creator-dong-nguyen-says-app-gone-forever-because-it-was-an-addictive-product/" rel="nofollow ">its addictive nature</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/dongatory/status/432095426854912000" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I can call 'Flappy Bird' is a success of mine. But it also ruins my simple life. So now I hate it.</p>  — Dong Nguyen (@dongatory) <a href="https://twitter.com/dongatory/status/432095426854912000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2014</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Given the fact that the fan-founded Flappy Bird Foundation has acquired the rights to the game, one would think that Nguyen might have made a bit of money from the sale, but that doesn't appear to be the case. According to <a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pnam=Dong%20Nguyen%20Ha%20%20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">court documents</a>, it seems that <a href="https://x.com/samnchiet/status/1834246569857634352" rel="nofollow ">the trademark for Flappy Bird was considered abandoned</a>, which may have allowed the creators of the reboot to get their hands on the IP for free, though the details remain unclear. GameSpot has reached out to the Flappy Bird foundation for comments regarding the acquisition of the trademark.</p><p dir="ltr">Nguyen has yet to make a statement on the game's 2025 revival, but Michael Roberts--the chief creative behind the return of the game--seems ecstatic to be helming the return of the game, which includes a number of new gameplay features, like new game modes, characters, progression, and "massive multiplayer challenges for the world to flap together."</p><p dir="ltr">"We are beyond excited to be bringing back Flappy Bird and delivering a fresh experience that will keep players engaged for years to come," Roberts said of the game's return. "We have big plans for our little Bird!"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-mika-and-the-witchs-mountain-1851647091<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re a fan of bright and colorful cozy games with charming protagonists and cute mechanics, you may have stumbled upon <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em>. This adorable and vibrant title provides everything above in buckets, and it manages to offer up an enjoyable platformer-meets-<em>Kiki’s Delivery Service</em> hybrid in the process.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197209" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="319" data-playlist="197209,196923,196922" data-current="197209"><div><p>The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22759.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>If you’re wondering how long it takes to beat this delightful delivery romp, spoiler alert: Not very long. However, it should be noted that <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em> is currently in early access, and has a lot of additional free content planned, as developer Chibig continues to work on it, so that’s almost certain to change (at least somewhat) over time. For now, though, what you can expect from the game.</p><h2 id="h1825"><a id=""></a>How long is <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em>?</h2><p>If your goal is to simply see the credits roll in <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em> in its early access form, without tracking down collectibles or completing optional deliveries, it’s likely to take you a brisk <strong>three to four hours</strong>.</p><p>Doing everything currently available in the game won’t add a <em>huge </em>amount of time, either, as the optional content in <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em> is currently somewhat limited. Those aforementioned collectibles and optional deliveries will only add an extra hour or two for most.</p><h2 id="h1826"><a id=""></a>What’s on the way for <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em>?</h2><figure id="" data-id="9fcc5a0f427ffb2badfe9bd31e216b32" data-recommend-id="image://9fcc5a0f427ffb2badfe9bd31e216b32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mika delivers a letter to a lady, stood underneath a shelter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mika delivers a letter to a lady, stood underneath a shelter." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Chibig / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9fcc5a0f427ffb2badfe9bd31e216b32" data-recommend-id="image://9fcc5a0f427ffb2badfe9bd31e216b32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mika delivers a letter to a lady, stood underneath a shelter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Developer Chibig has plans for a lot more content over the coming months, so it’s clear the team is planning to beef things up in the long term. In 2024, Chibig has at least two free updates planned, and there’s likely to be even more well beyond that.</p><p>An October update will include two new mini-games: Churro Express, and Kitties, which will task Mika with delivering churros and rescuing some kittens, respectively. Although hopefully not at the same time. Imagine the mess in the fur. Completing these will grant in-game rewards, so it should provide a good reason to dive back in.</p><p>Meanwhile, a December update will include a fishing mini-game and the introduction of dungeons for Mika to explore. There’s not a lot of information about these available at this time, but they sound like exciting additions to the game that should increase playtime by a reasonable amount.</p><p>As of right now, however, there’s not a lot of meat on the bones of this cutesy platforming adventure, but it’s clear there’s plenty to come. In the meantime, if you’re just looking for a quick dopamine hit, <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em> might be just what you need.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sony’s big PlayStation-celebrating platformer is out now on PlayStation 5 and despite <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150">some glaring omissions</a></span>, it’s a delightful game worth playing. It’s especially rewarding if you’re a long-time PlayStation fan who has played a lot of the company’s games over the past 30 years.</p><p>If your experience with PlayStation is a little spotty, you might not recognize all the cameos and references scattered throughout its levels. So, if you’re looking to brush up on some of the lesser-known Sony games after seeing these characters in <em>Astro Bot</em>, here are a few recommendations that you can play on your PS5 right now.</p></div></div><div><p>Back in 2015, Media Molecule completely retooled <em>Tearaway</em>, an incredible Vita-exclusive platformer based entirely around the handheld’s built-in tech, to make it work on a PlayStation 4 controller. <em>Tearaway </em>was an underappreciated gem, as it was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-playstation-vita-the-kotaku-review-5884517&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-playstation-vita-the-kotaku-review-5884517">on a handheld console that only a few million people bought</a></span>, so it made sense for Sony to port it to the PS4. Media Molecule went the extra mile with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA01607_00-TEARAWAYUNFOLDED&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA01607_00-TEARAWAYUNFOLDED" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tearaway Unfolded</em></a></span> and remade most of it to accommodate the DualShock 4, such as pressing the touchpad causing platforms to bounce and give you some extra air time or the light bar illuminating dark areas. <em>Tearaway Unfolded</em> is a wonderful, joyous game that feels almost like a precursor to <em>Astro Bot</em>. It has a lot of the same design philosophies that make them both fun platformers and a technical showcase for their respective controllers. </p></div><div><p>Speaking of games that deserved a bigger audience than the Vita could offer, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA01130_00-GRAVITYRUSHHD000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA01130_00-GRAVITYRUSHHD000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gravity Rush</em></a></span> and its sequel <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA03694_00-GRAVITYRUSH20000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA03694_00-GRAVITYRUSH20000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gravity Rush 2</em></a></span> are some of the most underrated games from that era. These open-world action games star Kat, a young woman who has the ability to shift gravity, allowing her to “fall” across long distances. She can use the momentum to unleash devastating kicks against her enemies. <em>Gravity Rush </em>can be a bit disorienting, but there’s nothing like using Kat’s powers to send yourself barreling through an environment. Traversal has always been one of the biggest barriers for me in open-world games, because if it’s not fun to move through a space, I don’t care how big it is. <em>Gravity Rush </em>has such a simple, exhilarating answer to this question that it remains an old favorite of mine.</p></div><div><p>You will not get me to write about older PlayStation gems without me writing about <em>Sly Cooper</em>. Sucker Punch’s heist platformers are still some of the breeziest, most innovative mascot platformers to grace a PlayStation console, and yet Sony cannot be bothered to greenlight a fifth one and resolve <em>Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</em>’s cliffhanger.

The hip-hop rhythm games star the titular dog rapper as he lays down bars during the most mundane life events. Learning to drive a car? Rap about it. Get your first part-time job? Rap with a frog who sounds a lot like Shaggy. <em>Parappa the Rapper 2 </em>goes even more off the rails, but the charm is still there and the songs are all bangers. </p></div><div><p> I got a copy of Sony Cambridge’s <em>MediEvil</em> with my first PlayStation for Christmas 1998. I spent much of my kindergarten year thinking the game was terrifying, only to find out in adulthood the hack-and-slash game is goofy-as-hell and primed for a spooky season replay. It stars Sir Daniel Fortesque, a reanimated soldier who comes back from the dead to become a hero after actually being an embarrassing failure. In 2019, Sony and Other Ocean Interactive <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/medievil/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/medievil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remade the game for PlayStation 4</a></span>, and while the game still feels a little dated by modern standards, it’s still a really fun look into an era of PlayStation’s past that Sony doesn’t seem interested in recapturing anymore. </p></div><div><p>Some of the most acclaimed games we’re talking about here are Team Ico’s. <em>Astro Bot</em> has references to <em>Ico</em>, <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>, and <em>The Last Guardian</em>, but only the latter two are playable on PlayStation 5 right now. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/shadow-of-the-colossus/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/shadow-of-the-colossus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Shadow of the Colossus </em>got a full-blown remake</a></span> in 2018 and, after years of development hell, The<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/the-last-guardian/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/the-last-guardian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em> Last Guardian</em></a></span><em> </em>made its way to PS4 in 2016. Team Ico’s work is often defined by slightly clunky gameplay, offset by immaculate, artful stories. <em>The Last Guardian </em>is a shining example of a game that frustrated me to play but absolutely won me over in the end because its final moments are incredible. Team Ico may be gone alongside the rest of Japan Studio, but much of the team still remains under director Fumito Ueda’s new studio genDESIGN. Here’s hoping whatever they put out next is just as magical.</p></div><div><p>Tragically, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-order-1886-ps4-sale-ready-at-dawn-closure-1851617233&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-order-1886-ps4-sale-ready-at-dawn-closure-1851617233"><em>The Order: 1886</em></a></span><em> </em>isn’t represented in <em>Astro Bot</em>, but it <em>was</em> in the previous game <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>. Developer Ready At Dawn was recently shut down by its corporate owners at Meta, and it was just another reminder of that studio’s potential. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA00785_00-TO1886GAME000000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA00785_00-TO1886GAME000000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Order: 1886</em></a></span><em> </em>isn’t the best cover shooter to grace a PlayStation, but it had a really fascinating steampunk alt-history world that could have been the foundation for a great series. If things had gone a little differently, we could have seen sequels throughout the PlayStation 4 era. It’s a shame, but the game still has a lot of great moments worth checking out.</p></div><div><p>Y’all want one more underrated handheld game that made its way to consoles for the road? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA06171_00-UCUS987110000001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA06171_00-UCUS987110000001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Patapon</em></a></span> spawned a trilogy of rhythm games for the PlayStation Portable that were so well-loved they ended up mashed together with <em>God of War</em> on a <em>PlayStation All-Stars </em>stage. Thankfully, they haven’t been entirely lost as Sony leaves handheld gaming behind, as the first game and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA07321_00-UCES011770000001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA07321_00-UCES011770000001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its sequel</a></span> were remastered for PlayStation 4 and 5. Real shame they stopped there and didn’t also bring <em>Patapon 3 </em>to consoles.</p></div><div><p>Last on our list of PlayStation gems to go back to is the <em>Ape Escape </em>series. The first two games and the<em> Academy</em> and <em>On the Loose </em>spin-offs <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/search/ape%20escape&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/search/ape%20escape" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are all playable on your PS5</a></span>. If you’re too young to have played the PlayStation classics and were wondering what the first tribute level in <em>Astro Bot </em>was all about, it was an elaborate reference to these platformers. The series has been on ice since 2010, so it’s nice to see Sony at least acknowledge it in <em>Astro Bot</em>. </p><hr><p>Looking back at a lot of these games is bittersweet given the state of PlayStation’s first-party games right now. The PS5 has been mostly defined by carnage for PlayStation Studios between <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-shutdown-playstation-offline-delisted-store-1851638956&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutdown-playstation-offline-delisted-store-1851638956">cancelations</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547">studio closures</a></span>, so looking back at some of the more experimental and original games the company used to bring out feels bad. You, too can get nostalgic about what once was by looking at all those characters in <em>Astro Bot</em>, I guess.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It is a wild day when two massive esport organizations, such as Immortals and NRG, decide they are going to leave the League Championship Series (LCS). Especially when it is just two weeks until the 2024 League Worlds event. With the 2025 season just around the corner, both <strong>NRG</strong> and <strong>Immortals</strong> will be fully walking away from the league.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-nrg-and-immortals-to-walk-away-from-lcs">NRG and Immortals to Walk Away From LCS</h2>



<p>As reported by LCS insider, Travis Gafford, the two organizations will no longer be associated with the LCS going into the 2025 season. This drops the number of teams in the league from 10 to eight. </p>



<p>Immortals have not been in the League of Legends competitive limelight for quite some time. Their leave from the LCS does not come as much of a surprise to many esports fans. NRG, however, won the Championship last year, making them one of the more popular teams in the league.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The news comes after three of the LCS teams qualified for League Worlds 2024. Neither NRG nor Immortals were on this list. The three teams that qualified, however, were <strong>100 Thieves</strong>, <strong>Team Liquid</strong> and <strong>FlyQuest.</strong></p>



<p>Riot Games has also announced that in 2025, the North and South conferences will move forward with just six teams. As of now, the six teams taking part are <strong>100 Thieves</strong>, <strong>Cloud9</strong>, <strong>Dignitas</strong>, <strong>FlyQuest</strong>, <strong>Shopify Rebellion</strong> and <strong>Team Liquid</strong>.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-why-are-the-2-teams-leaving">Why are the 2 Teams Leaving?</h2>



<p>At the moment, there are no real answers as to why the two organizations have chosen to leave the League of Legends scene. For Immortals, it can be presumed that dwindling presence within the competitive scene is a large factor in why they are leaving.</p>



<p>NRG leaving LCS, however, has stumped quite a few people. As time goes on, hopefully, we learn more as to why the team is walking away from the league.</p>
