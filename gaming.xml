<p>A new take on Pokemon could be coming soon. According to <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1823123300756914568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DanielRPK</a>, a Pokemon live action series is in development at Netflix.</p>



<p>Details on the rumored series are scarce, however, there is some information on the main premise. The report claims that the show won’t feature Ash Ketchum or a new character as the game’s main protagonist. Instead, the main character of the show will be firs trainer from the history of the series, “Red”.</p>



<p>Whether it’s based on the original game’s story or a completely fresh take remains to be seen.</p>



<p>This obviously wouldn’t be the first live action Pokemon production after Detective Pikachu released in 2019. This would, though, be the first series in a live action environment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/halloween-getting-unreal-engine-5-game-john-carpenter-involved/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Halloween is a beloved horror franchise and one of the classics. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halloween-unreal-engine-5-john-carpenter-boss-team-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN announced</a> that two games are in production for the Halloween franchise. They are being developed by Boss Team Games, which is responsible for creating the Evil Dead and Cobra Kai games.</p>
<p>At the moment, the details of what these Halloween games may entail are incredibly limited. Still, it has been confirmed that both are being made in conjunction with John Carpenter, the original creator of the 1978 classic.</p>
<p>What is known is that at least one of the games being made is being made in Unreal Engine 5, giving the game plenty of potential for realism and horrifying scares.</p>
<p>"As a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horror-legend-john-carpenter-just-wants-to-play-video-games-watch-basketball-and-eat-popsicles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge gamer myself</a>, I'm thrilled to help bring Michael Myers to life again in this game, and my hope is to scare you silly," said John Carpenter, who is said to be "intimately involved" in developing this project.</p>
<p>From what we know, players will be able to relive iconic moments from the movies and play some of the classic characters from the franchise. While Boss Team Games is developing the games, they are also being developed in association with Compass International Pictures and Further Front to ensure they are close reminders of the movies.</p>
<p>It's becoming more common to see iconic horror movies become video games, such as Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, Alien, and more. Halloween is over 45 years old, and there have rarely been adaptations of this franchise that aren't movies. The franchise continues to grow, with the latest movie, Halloween Ends, being released in 2022.</p>
<p>The first and only video game released for the Halloween movies was a game released on the Atari 2600 by the development team Wizard Video. Around the same time, they also released a Texas Chainsaw Massacre video game.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't mean Michael Myers doesn't appear in other media. He is a very popular killer in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-by-daylight-team-reveal-2024-roadmap/">Dead by Daylight</a>, named "The Shape," and is one of the scarier killers that players can choose to play as.</p>
<p>"Everyone at Boss Team Games are huge fans of horror, and Halloween obviously holds a special place in the hearts of all horror fans. Getting to work with iconic characters like Michael Myers and build on John Carpenter's original vision is a dream come true," said Steve Harris, CEO of Boss Team Games.</p>
<p>They are also working alongside Malek Akkad, who was one of the original producers of the franchise and has continued to produce the most recent Halloween movies, too.</p>

Warner Bros. has now quietly stepped in to fix the issue, but not in time for those who bought physical versions of the movie at launch. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194566" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Let's Talk About Gotham Knights’ Predictable Ending" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="262" data-playlist="194566,196055,192862" data-current="194566"><div><p>Let's Talk About Gotham Knights’ Predictable Ending</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194566/194566_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194566/194566_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194566/194566_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194566/194566_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20022.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Ever since <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths Part 3</em> came out last month, fans have been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://old.reddit.com/r/DCAU/comments/1e4xpue/the_jokers_voice_in_crisis_on_infinite_earths/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DCAU/comments/1e4xpue/the_jokers_voice_in_crisis_on_infinite_earths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arguing about whether the Joker</a></span> in it actually sounded like Hamill or not.

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF71PqJrO0c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released this week, Funko Fusion teased Five Nights at Freddy’s gameplay, featuring iconic characters like Freddy Fazbear and Foxy the Pirate.</p>



<p>The gameplay reveals iconic settings, security cameras, potential objectives, and many familiar faces. It also confirms that Freddy Fazbear and Foxy the Pirate will be playable characters. </p>



<p>The trailer description adds that fans will “play through a level inspired by the first FNAF game.” </p>

</p></figure>







<p>Although fans already knew that Five Nights at Freddy’s was coming to Funko Fusion, there have only been brief glimpses until now.</p>



<p>Developer 10:10 Games first announced its partnership with Funko two years ago, and Funko Fusion got its first teaser trailer in 2023. The game combines a wide variety of popular IP, from Back to the Future to Shaun of the Dead. </p>



<p>The new gameplay trailer marks yet another major collaboration for Five Nights at Freddy’s. Just last week, the Dead by Daylight team confirmed that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-x-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover-coming-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossover with Five Nights at Freddy’s</a> is coming sometime in 2025. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, FNAF fans can also look forward to the live-action movie sequel, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-nights-at-freddys-2-updates-possibly-tease-october-filming-toy-bonnie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently teased Toy Bonnie</a> and corresponding animatronics should appear in the film.</p>



<p>Funko Fusion will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on September 13, 2024. It will arrive on PlayStation 4 and the Nintendo Switch later on November 15, 2024.</p>

                <p>Alien: Romulus will contain a nod to the 2014 survival-horror game Alien: Isolation. Director Fede Alvarez said recently that the Creative Assembly game taught him a lot about horror, and he is honoring the game with a little Easter egg in Alien: Romulus.</p><p>"The movie is set up in a way [that] every time something bad is about to happen, you will see a phone," he said on the <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/alien-romulus-alien-isolation-easter-egg-emergency-phone/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inside Total Film podcast</a>. "In the game, every time you knew there's a phone you'd go, 'Fuck, I'm about to go into some bad set-piece.' It's the same thing here. You'll see they're planted strategically throughout the film. When you see the phone, it's like: Brace for impact."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0XDEhP4MQs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x0XDEhP4MQs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Alvarez went on to say Alien: Isolation was an experience that "made me see that Alien could truly be terrifying and done well [today]."</p><p>"I was like, 'Fuck, if I could do anything, I would love to do Alien and scare the audience again with that creature and those environments.' I was playing, and realizing how terrifying Alien could be if you take it back to that tone," he said.</p><p>Alien: Romulus releases on August 16. It bills itself as a film that takes the series "back to its roots." A team of space colonizers are scavenging from a derelict space station when they encounter the big, bad Xenomorph. The movie stars Cailee Spaeny, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Isabela Merced, Spike Fearn, and Aileen Wu.</p><p>Ridley Scott, who directed the original Alien, is a producer on Alien: Romulus.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/reka-release-date-and-award-winning-lead-writer-announced.951816/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/reka-release-date-early-access<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Emberstorm Entertainment and publisher Fireshine Games have revealed the&nbsp;<em>Reka&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date, as well as the name of the project's award-winning lead writer.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Reka&nbsp;</em>on PC via Steam Early Access on September 12th, so it's safe to start thinking about how you want to lead your cozy cottagecore witchcraft life now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Mirror's Edge&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>writer Rhianna Pratchett will serve as the game's lead writer. Pratchett says that she's "never been one to shy away from the weird and wonderful", and that helping to create&nbsp;<em>Reka</em>'s story and world alongside the aforementioned studios has been "an absolute delight".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/reka-early-access-release-date-cottage.jpg?itok=VPfVP35i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/reka-early-access-release-date-cottage.jpg?itok=KnVDYvX6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We could all use our houses being a little more ambulatory from time to time.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Reka&nbsp;</em>is aiming to give you the experience of being a witch, only without all the pesky stake burnings and lake drownings (well, hopefully, anyway).</p>
<p>You'll play as the titular Reka, an apprentice to legendary witch Baba Jaga (also known as Baba Yaga in some parts of the world). Just like the witch of legend, you'll have access to your very own "chicken-legged cottage", which will provide a haven from an "unpredictable, sometimes dark world".</p>
<p>The game promises a "deep and diverging land" with several different biomes to explore, as well as full character creation that allows you to shape Reka in whatever image you desire.</p>
<p>If you want to see&nbsp;<em>Reka&nbsp;</em>in action and get a sense for what kind of game you're in for, you can check out one of the game's earlier teasers, which shows off the aforementioned "chicken-legged" house, right here.</p>

<p><em>Reka&nbsp;</em>will boast procedurally-generated landscapes, so no two players' games will look the same, and it'll also offer the ability to "discover and tame wildlife", with your animal companions either joining you on your adventures or waiting for you at home.</p>
<p>You can wishlist&nbsp;<em>Reka&nbsp;</em>ahead of its September release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1737870/REKA/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">right now on Steam</a>.

As is tradition with Square Enix games, a demo for <em>Visions of Mana </em>was released ahead of the game’s official August 29 release. That said, this <em>Visions of Mana </em>teaser plays by slightly different rules than most Square Enix demos. If you’re wondering if this action-RPG is right for you, then the demo will let you get a taste of the game’s world and combat mechanics.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196452" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="149" data-playlist="196452,196805,196572" data-current="196452"><div><p>Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22004.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Pre-order <em>Visions of Mana:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Visions-Mana-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CQ73WDH8/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/visions-of-manner-demo-guide-does-it-carry-over-1851618271&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0CQ73WDH8" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/clVDQrSgeMQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/clVDQrSgeMQ" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2F&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Bundle</a></span></p><h2 id="h145926"><a id=""></a><strong>What content is included in the <em>Visions of Mana </em>demo?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="e73c2e10913c301d94a9f9114d0b9e32" data-recommend-id="image://e73c2e10913c301d94a9f9114d0b9e32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The field of quests in the demo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The field of quests in the demo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e73c2e10913c301d94a9f9114d0b9e32" data-recommend-id="image://e73c2e10913c301d94a9f9114d0b9e32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The field of quests in the demo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After a brief cutscene, the <em>Visions of Mana </em>demo will start you and your party in a short, linear path through an icy field. This acts as a tutorial, and you’ll work your way through some basic platforming challenges as you familiarize yourself with the game’s mechanics.<br></p><p>Afterwards, the party will arrive in a wide open field, which introduces the Pikul mount for the party to ride on. This section features collectibles to find, side quests to complete, and even an optional battle arena against some relatively high level enemies. That said, none of these diversions are required to advance the story.</p><p>Finally, the demo includes a town where the party can purchase new equipment, take a few more side quests, and chat with some friendly NPCs. A handful of story events will occur here, which will eventually culminate in the party boarding a boat. After a prompt appears warning you that you’ve reached a point of no return, the party will face off against a Kraken boss battle. Once you defeat the naughty octopus, the demo will end with a few story sequences to conclude this chapter of the adventure.</p><h3 id="h145927"><a id=""></a><strong>How long is the Visions of Mana demo?</strong></h3><p>If you aim to clear absolutely everything the demo offers, it should take <strong>a little over two hours</strong>. If you skip past the open field section, you can probably cut the total runtime in half. It ultimately depends on how much you want to dig into the game’s mechanics, especially if you play with the options to customize your party.</p><h2 id="h145928"><a id=""></a><strong>Does progress from the Visions of Mana demo carry over to the full game?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="9de3024379abc5b9938cc221fcd75f4c" data-recommend-id="image://9de3024379abc5b9938cc221fcd75f4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's Pikul, your mighty steed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="It's Pikul, your mighty steed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9de3024379abc5b9938cc221fcd75f4c" data-recommend-id="image://9de3024379abc5b9938cc221fcd75f4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's Pikul, your mighty steed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>No…for the most part</strong>. The demo begins shortly after the start of the game, so it doesn’t function the way that, say, the <em>Dragon Quest X</em> or <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> demos do. That said, <strong>if save data from the demo is present on your system when playing the full game, you can obtain three bonus weapons for Val (the game’s protagonist) once you reach Chapter 1</strong>.

The <em>Mana </em>series typically places as much of an emphasis on its RPG systems as its combat. This means you’re rewarded for learning your active character’s combat mechanics, customizing your party members’ behavior in battle, and stopping the action to cast spells and use items.<br></p><p>Case in point: The protagonist Val starts as the <strong>Rune Knight </strong>class, which is the best damage dealer available in the demo. However, Val won’t really feel powerful until you unlock the <strong>Horizontal Slice </strong>skill, which unlocks a three-hit combo. To maximize your damage, wait for openings to attack, and then hold down the attack button to wallop enemies.</p><p>By upgrading your party’s Elemental Plots, you can also buff Val’s attack and crit stats by using spells and elemental enchantments. You don’t particularly have to worry about MP conservation in the demo, so go all out against tough enemies. Don’t neglect to use your Elemental Vessel by pressing R2 for some extra crowd control, and once your CS gauge in the bottom-left is charged, you can press L2 to unleash a devastating super move.</p><p>Finally, if you’re still having trouble, feel free to rush towards the town once you enter the open field area. You can purchase equipment upgrades that significantly increase your party’s power, and you’ll find side quests that will point you back to the open field. Or, if you’d rather save all this questing for the full game, you can skip ahead and experience the Kraken battle. The choice is yours.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/retrorealms-halloween-and-ash-vs-evil-dead-announced-for-october-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao3sM3nEhcI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released today, Boss Team Games announced RetroRealms: Halloween and Ash vs Evil Dead with a release date set for October 18, 2024.</p>



<p>RetroRealms turns both iconic properties into a 16-bit platformer. Although fans must purchase each game separately, buying both will allow players “to crossover worlds.”</p>



<p>Today’s trailer also reveals the pre-order bonuses. Pre-orders are available now, and fans who invest will receive DLC characters. Those include Laurie Strode for Halloween, as well as Kelly Maxwell for Ash vs Evil Dead.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Today’s announcement closely follows yesterday’s reveal from Boss Team Games. The team confirmed it is working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/boss-team-games-working-on-titles-based-on-halloween-john-carpenter-involved/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two titles based on Halloween</a>, and it seems RetroRealms was the undisclosed game from earlier this week.</p>



<p>While RetroRealms already has a trailer, Boss Team Games’ other Halloween game is built in Unreal Engine 5 and still “in early development.” </p>



<p>That second project based on the original Halloween will also “relive moments from the film.” Its development will also involve John Carpenter, Compass International Pictures, and Further Front.</p>



<p>Boss Team Games previously published Evil Dead: The Game, an asymmetrical multiplayer game based on the hit IP that launched in 2022. Evil Dead: The Game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/evil-dead-content-stopped/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ended its content cycle</a> late last year.</p>



<p>RetroRealms: Halloween and Ash vs Evil Dead will be available on PC via Steam, Nintendo Switch, and current or last-gen PlayStation and Xbox consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/red-dead-redemption-pc-port-seemingly-leaked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>PC port could be on the way very soon, if now-deleted text spotted in a PlayStation Store listing for the game is anything to go by.</p>
<p>The text seems to have been added to the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1004-CUSA36842_00-REDEMPTION000001" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 4 store page</a> for&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption</em>&nbsp;(that's the first game, not <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/red-dead-redemption-2">the sequel</a>), and although it's since been removed, you can see the listing <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1823224534159196470" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here courtesy of Wario64 on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</p>
<p>The listing invites players to experience&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>"now on PC for the first time ever", and while much of it is identical to the listing as it currently stands, the deleted text also contains a few PC-specific extras you can seemingly expect from the imminent PC port.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/red-dead-redemption-pc-port-rumor.jpg?itok=TNii1E3z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/red-dead-redemption-pc-port-rumor.jpg?itok=uaprPTrG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>be on its way to PC soon?</figcaption></figure><p>If the PC version of&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>is indeed on the way, it looks like it'll have everything you'd expect from a modern PC port.</p>
<p>This includes "support for increased resolutions and framerates", as well as multi-monitor support, "spatial surround sound", and more. The PC version will also seemingly boast all of the 2023 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/red-dead-redemption-ps4-switch-port">console version upgrades</a>.</p>
<p>It would make perfect sense for Rockstar to release&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>on PC, especially after the game was released on PS4 (although not PS5 or Xbox consoles, strangely) and Nintendo Switch last year.</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption 2&nbsp;</em>is available on PC and has been for quite some time, so it's a little odd that PC gamers can't enjoy John Marston's story in the same way they can experience Arthur Morgan's tale.</p>

<p><em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>was originally released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 all the way back in 2010. It tells the story of John Marston, a former outlaw whose family is kidnapped by a governmental organization that wants Marston to do its dirty work.</p>
<p>The game is available right now on PlayStation 4 and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/red-dead-redemption-switch/">Nintendo Switch</a>, and it looks like it'll be coming to PC sometime soon as well. Sorry, Xbox owners; looks like you're still out of luck. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://irpages2.equitystory.com/websites/rns_news/English/1100/news-tool---rns---eqs-group.html?article=34487406&amp;company=keywords" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>, Keywords Studios announced that it acquired Wushu Studios, a Liverpool-based game developer. </p>



<p>Keywords Studios CEO Bertrand Bodson said that the acquisition will “build out our game development offer globally.” </p>



<p>Bodson specifically mentions Wushu’s “skilled team” and “strong relationships” as advantages. They believe the Wushu Studios acquisition will “complement our existing Create studios.”</p>



<p>Wushu Studios founder Alan McDermott stated the Wushu team will “maintain our creative independence” while expanding its resources. There are plans to grow and take on “ever more ambitious projects” in the future. It will also “remain faithful to our people-first approach to development.”</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/wushustudios/status/1823313683516125595" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, developer Wushu Studios also praised the “shared values” and “passion for development” at Keywords Studios.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Keywords Studios offers a wide range of services, including everything from game development and localization to marketing services.</p>



<p>Wushu Studios is a longtime support studio that worked on a variety of popular projects. Some of the previous titles Wushu worked on include Fall Guys, State of Decay 2, The Ascent, Forza Horizon 5, and even the hit RPG Baldur’s Gate 3.</p>



<p>Fall Guys <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-fall-guys-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently joined Fortnite</a> with a limited-time mode and the opportunity for Fortnite Creators to publish new Fall Guys islands. Baldur’s Gate 3 fans recently enjoyed a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-closed-beta-has-launched-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patch 7 closed beta</a>, which released on Steam in late July.</p>

When you preorder the <a href="https://zdcs.link/wedAK?object_uuid=b75e402e-9f55-4586-99b7-6ae9d86df256&amp;t=article" target="_blank">game, you'll receive a limited-edition Echoes of Wisdom acrylic diorama</a>, valued at $9.99 according to Best Buy. While it might not be the most extravagant preorder bonus ever offered for a Nintendo game, it's still a nice addition and could become a sought-after collector's item in the future.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/13/zelda-acrylic-diorama-included-at-best-buy-with-echoes-of-wisdom-preorders-2-1723548073155.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom - Acrylic Diorama</figcaption></figure></output><p>Given that all major retailers are offering Echoes of Wisdom at the same price ($59.99), you’re not missing out on anything by choosing Best Buy, especially with the bonus on the table. If you're planning to preorder, it makes sense to go with the retailer that offers a little something extra.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a> marks a significant milestone as the first mainline Zelda game to feature <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced-for-nintendo-switch-with-zelda-as-protagonist">Princess Zelda as the protagonist</a>, a long-awaited development that fans have been eager to see for decades. Nintendo has finally answered this call, and the result is nothing short of thrilling. The game adopts a visually striking art style reminiscent of the almost claymation-like aesthetic seen in the Link's Awakening remake, which suits the world of Hyrule beautifully.</p><div id="202464" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</h3></p><div><p>Preoders include a free acrylic stand.</p></div></div><p>The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/10-things-you-need-to-know-from-the-new-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer">story begins with mysterious purple rifts tearing open across Hyrule</a>, pulling people into the unknown. While Link is among those trapped, Zelda manages to escape, leaving her to shoulder the burden of saving the kingdom herself. Though the exact reasoning behind the kingdom’s military being unable to assist her is a bit unclear, the premise sets the stage for an exciting adventure led by Zelda.</p><p>A key gameplay mechanic is the innovative use of "echoes." Armed with the Tri Wand, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-gets-deep-dive-in-traversing-hyrule-trailer">Zelda can summon echoes—items and enemies she has previously encountered</a>. These echoes play a crucial role in combat, puzzle-solving, and reaching new areas. This mechanic promises to challenge players' creativity, much like the inventive gameplay seen in Tears of the Kingdom. It's exciting to see such engaging and inventive puzzle-solving brought into a 2D-style Zelda game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In other Zelda news.

As Onnée explained, the four years of development was ideal for building the game, receiving feedback, and focusing on areas that needed work.</p><p>"We always want to go better, which is what we're trying to do with Shadows. We are pushing the limits of what we can do," Onnée said to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/four-years-offers-the-right-balance-to-make-a-new-assassins-creed-game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gamesindustry.Biz</a>. "It's always a balance between time and costs, but the more time you have, the more you can iterate. Yes, you can put more people on a project and do it in a shorter time, but that doesn't give you more time to iterate, because it takes time to get the feedback from your players, your team, and then see what works and what doesn't and how to improve it. Four years, I think, is the right balance to go from conception to production and get the feedback necessary to adapt."</p>

      </div>
<p>The previous mainline entry in the series, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, launched back in November 2020. Ubisoft did fill out the last couple of years with substantial expansions for Valhalla--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-valhalla-wrath-of-the-druids-dlc-review/1900-6417674/" data-ref-id="1900-6417674">Wrath of the Druids</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-valhalla-dawn-of-ragnarok-review-having-a-good-time/1900-6417841/" data-ref-id="1900-6417841">Dawn of Ragnarok</a>--and smaller spin-off games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage-review-back-to-basics/1900-6418126/" data-ref-id="1900-6418126">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on November 12, and will see the series explore 16th-century Japan through two protagonists. In a recent interview, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-denounces-online-attacks-after-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy/1100-6524573/" data-ref-id="1100-6524573">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot commented</a> on the "malicious and personal online attacks" directed at some of the company's employees following the reveal of Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p><p>Beyond Assassin's Creed Shadows, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-assassins-creed-remakes-in-the-works-including-potentially-black-flag/1100-6524576/" data-ref-id="1100-6524576">multiple remakes of Assassin's Creed games</a> are also currently in development, which could potentially help fill in the lengthy gap between mainline releases.</p>
