		<p>Rockstar has announced the release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, but the game won’t be coming out in 2025. Instead GTA 6 will launch on 26th May 2026.</p>
<p>The statement on <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026">the Rockstar site</a> reads:</p>


<p>:Grand Theft Auto VI is now set to release on May 26, 2026. We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank<br>
you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.</p>
<p>With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and<br>
deserve.</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing more information with you soon.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
Rockstar Games</p>
<p>This is both good and bad news for the rest of the games industry. Many companies were looking at late 2025 with trepidation, given that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">Take Two had constantly been stating that GTA 6 was on target for this year</a>, so even big budget games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/the-next-battlefield-is-set-to-release-before-april-2026/">the next Battlefield were being tentatively given a movable release window</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, that might have given developers the sense that they could easily slip back to 2026 if they needed the time, and there will suddenly be pressure to try and push for a 2025 release instead. Thankfully, with GTA 6 not coming until May 2025, there’s still a good window from late February through to early April 2026 that could still look like a good launch window for a game.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto VI takes us all back to Vice City for another crime story. The announcement trailer introduced us to Lucia, the series’ first female protagonist, as well an as-yet-unnamed male counterpart. Lucia seemingly starts off the game getting out of prison after a bit of “bad luck”.</p>
<p>It’s clearly a modern day setting in the fictionalised state of Leonida, with a handful of things like social media shown in the trailer, but that won’t stop there being plenty of iconic classic cars and inspirations from the breadth of American culture in the South East of the country and Florida in particular. From packed beaches to going across the swamps on hover craft, and partying at the tops of skyscrapers, there’s also jokes thrown into the trailer about battling crocodiles in back garden swimming pools, “Floridaman” antics – Leonidaman in the game – and plenty more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rockstar and Take-Two have announced the&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>release date at long last, but if you were hoping for the game to be released this year, then you're going to be disappointed.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1918265468076605706" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>will be launching on May 26th next year, which Rockstar acknowledges is "later than you expected". The studio gives a pretty standard reason for the game's delay; it needs time to "deliver at the level of quality" players expect, and it wants to "try and exceed your expectations".</p>

<p><em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025" rel="nofollow">first unveiled in December 2023</a>, with the game's debut trailer achieving a staggering <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-achieved-crazy-90-million-views-in-24-hours" rel="nofollow">90 million views in just 24 hours</a>. At that point,&nbsp;<em>GTA VI&nbsp;</em>was slated for a fall 2025 release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-masks.jpg?itok=SSe1GD3u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-masks.jpg?itok=waBZng3p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>finally has a release date, but the game has also been delayed out of 2025.</figcaption></figure><p>Since then, Rockstar and Take-Two haven't released much information about&nbsp;<em>GTA VI&nbsp;</em>at all; the game still only has one trailer, and no gameplay footage has been released yet.</p>

<p>Despite that, as late as February this year, Take-Two head Strauss Zelnick was claiming that&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-6-still-on-track-for-fall" rel="nofollow">still be releasing in the fall</a>, despite the fact that rumors (which turned out to be correct) were swirling at the time pertaining to the game's delay.</p>

<p>Of course, although this probably isn't the news Take-Two was hoping to deliver, it'll come as a relief to many publishers, who can now presumably breathe sighs of relief and release their games towards the end of 2025 without fear.</p>




<p><em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>will serve as the sixth numbered installment (although it's far from the sixth game overall) in the&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>We don't know much about the game at the moment; it'll be set in the fictional US state of Leonida, in which can be found the Miami-esque Vice City, and it'll feature the series' first major female protagonist. Other than that, it's all up for grabs.</p>

<p>Rockstar will release&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>on May 26th, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>If at some point over the last 20 years you’ve found yourself in an Internet argument or had a question in your head you just couldn’t seem to get rid of, chances are good that you’ve relied on an online wiki.</p>
<p>And you probably used <i>the </i>online wiki: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. But for video games, Wikipedia provides a more general, top-down view, painting in broad strokes what a game is about, how it was made, when it was released, and how it was received by players.</p>
<p>In addition, many games and franchises have their own dedicated wikis that go a step further; these wikis are often part game guide, part lore book, and part historical record.</p>
<p>But what does it take to build a game wiki? Why do people do it? I looked to one of my all-time favorite games for answers.</p>
<h2>The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages</h2>
<p>It had been at least 10 years since I last played <i>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</i> before this past fall, when I decided somewhat arbitrarily to put another 80-or-so hours into a new save. Rushing through the first few parts of the main questline, it felt like I was visiting home, right up until I was named “Hero of Kvatch.”</p>
<p>Then, though, it quickly began to feel like I was playing the game for the first time, and, to put it mildly, I was getting beaten to a pulp across Cyrodiil.</p>
<p>While it was great to re-explore the game that consumed so many hours of my life and discover again what made the 2006 release an instant classic, I was frustrated that I had forgotten how the game worked.</p>
<p>Without the official manual that came with my now surely sold-to-GameStop Xbox 360 edition of the game or the Official Prima Strategy Guide, I quickly found myself (as countless others do) on<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page"> The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages</a>.</p>

<p>Broadly, UESPWiki is an impressive information repository of The Elder Scrolls franchise. It also documents the dense, often convoluted lore of the franchise, as well as books and merchandise sold alongside the games, and the multiple tabletop games.</p>

<p>For all its uniqueness—the sort of early “Web 2.0” design style, limited advertisement space, and its namespace-centered way of organization—the UESP is an independent wiki at its core. It has all the bone structure that makes a wiki accessible and easy to use and is driven by a dedicated community of editors.</p>
<p>The wiki currently maintains over 110,000 articles. The phrase “We have been building a collaborative source for all knowledge on the <i>Elder Scrolls </i>series since 1995” is written at the top of the home page. This year, UESP is celebrating its 30th anniversary.</p>
<p>“The phrase I always say is ‘we’re older than Google,’” said 51-year-old Dave Humphrey, founder of the UESP. “Obviously, we’re not as big or as popular as Google, but we’re older than Google, and we’re older than a lot of websites. In fact, I don't think there's any other Elder Scrolls-related website that's older than us.”</p>
<p>The earliest version of the UESP wasn’t a wiki at all and is just a little older than 30 years. It was a message distributed through USENET called Daggerfall FAQ, originally published in the fall of 1994, and it featured prerelease content about <i>The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall</i>.</p>
<p>A year later, the Daggerfall FAQ would become a webpage, and a few months after that, it would become the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages, which was just a webpage at the time, to include information about The Elder Scrolls games.</p>
<p>When <i>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</i> released, it was the franchise's biggest game at that point, and Humphrey quickly became remarkably busy. He wrote hundreds of entries for the game and its two DLCs while maintaining his regular job. But the more he did, the more reader emails suggesting new entries and edits to the site came in. In 2005, UESP officially became a wiki.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          

<p>“It was too much for me to do as a full-time or second full-time job sort of thing,” Humphrey said. “That's when I decided instead of having a regular webpage, we’d move to a wiki-based format where instead of people, you know, emailing me, they can edit their own tips.”</p>
<p>In 2012, Humphrey officially made the UESP his full-time job, but he is largely no longer involved in the content side of the wiki. He instead maintains more of an overseer role, doing most of the back-end server maintenance, programming, and cluster design for the site.</p>
<p>What sets UESP apart, at least from Humphrey’s perspective, is the creativity and decision-making capacity derived from its independence. This allows the team to run the ads they choose and implement new utilities like the ESO Build Editor.</p>
<p>“We've been asked to join larger wiki farms before, and while it might make sense from a technical standpoint, we would lose a lot of what makes UESP unique and long-lasting,” said Humphrey.</p>
<p>In fact, UESP has been slowly expanding over the years and is starting to host wiki sites beyond The Elder Scrolls. In August 2023, the site launched the <a href="https://starfieldwiki.net/wiki/Home">Starfield Wiki</a>, which already maintains over 10,000 articles and has unofficially taken over all the construction set wikis for the Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises. Currently, Humphrey said, UESP is looking at hosting a few more existing game wikis later this year.</p>
<p>As for the Elder Scrolls series itself, <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em> is still well into the future. But at the time of my interview, the <em>Oblivion</em> remaster was just social media speculation. Still, Humphrey predicted how the game might change the wiki.</p>
<p>“It comes down to the organization of the site. We sort of have to deal with that a bit with DLCs. There’s the base game, and then there’s the DLCs; for the most part, DLCs are their own contained area, but they do modify the base game as well,” said Humphrey.</p>

<p>“We’d probably take a similar approach with it, creating their own namespace underneath <em>Oblivion </em>and putting all the remake information there,” he added.</p>
<p>It’s always a challenge to determine how to organize things like DLCs and remakes into the wiki, Humphrey said. He noted that he would ultimately leave it up to the editors themselves.</p>
<p><span>Since the release of&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered</em>, the game has, in fact, received its own namespace, and editors are already documenting some of the changes.</span></p>

<p>When it was still the Daggerfall FAQ, Humphrey wasn’t thinking about what it would look like in 2025 or how a community could be built around a website; he was simply someone with a passion for the game who liked building things.</p>
<p>But as time went on and Humphrey began attending conventions and Elder Scrolls-related meetups, he started to realize the kind of community that had naturally formed around the site.</p>
<p>“It's not something I planned on doing, but it's really neat, and it's something I'm more aware of now in terms of doing community-related stuff,” Humphrey said.</p>
<p>That community, which has over 23,000 users with at least one edit in its history, measures the success of the wiki not by the quantity of content but the quality of the pages themselves. Humphrey leaves most of the content decisions up to those editors.</p>

<h2>Scraping and editing</h2>
<p>Robert “RobinHood70” Morley—a 54-year-old native of Ottawa, Canada—has been editing the pages since May 2006, just a short time after UESP turned into a wiki, while playing through <i>Oblivion</i>.</p>
<p>He explained that he found the wiki at a critical time, shortly after he fell ill with a sickness that doctors struggled to diagnose.</p>
<p>“Getting involved in the wiki provided a bit of a refuge from that,” Morely wrote through Discord. “I could forget how I felt (to some degree) and focus instead on what was going on the wiki. Because I couldn't really leave the house much anymore, I made friends on the wiki instead and let that replace the real-life social life that I couldn't have anymore… That continues to be the case even now.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>He didn’t necessarily set out to find that kind of community, which was much smaller at the time, but he recognized that it was helping him cope with things. Not only did editing give him a sense of accomplishment, but he enjoyed seeing what others were able to do.</p>
<p>Over the years, Morely’s involvement in the wiki has grown. He’s gone from a regular user to an admin to a bureaucrat. He’s the only editor with access to the servers other than Humphrey. He now does the critical job of running bots through the game pages that add bulk information to the wiki.</p>
<p>“In some sense, a bot is like any other editor. It adds/changes/removes information on the wiki. The difference is that it does so several thousand times faster,” Morley said. “Bots are often used to bulk-upload information from the game files to the wiki. For example, they might provide the initial documentation of every NPC in a game… They would provide the hard stats, but afterward, people would expand the page to provide a narrative for each character.”</p>
<p>When an<span><em> Elder Scrolls Online </em>update goes live, for example, Morley quickly deploys the bot, which detects any changes in the new versions of the game, such as</span> skill and stat adjustments. All that added information is dumped into the wiki to provide human editors with a base to start from.</p>
<p>That’s similar to the process of creating pages for a brand-new Elder Scrolls game. The game would be scraped shortly after it was released, and editors would get busy trying to figure out how those pieces fit together.</p>
<p>Once created, the pages would be edited and continuously retouched over time by other editors.</p>
<p>Those editors include people like 26-year-old Dillon “Dillonn241” D., who has been a part of the wiki for over half of his life. He first discovered and began editing pages of the UESP at 11 or 12 years old.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>While his activity on the wiki has ebbed and flowed over the years based on interest and the demands of daily life, he says the community is a big part of what keeps him coming back—the near-endless nature of collaboratively working on a project. He enjoys the casual conversations on the wiki's Discord server, as well as the more focused and pragmatic discussions about editing through internal channels.</p>
<p>He has since become a prolific editor and was awarded a “gold star” on his talk page last year for editing more pages than anyone in 2024, with a total of 18,864 edits.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to call it an addiction because that makes it sound bad, but it’s kind of like—you know, I guess I have an hour here. I'll just hop on UESP and edit a few pages or see how things I’ve edited have been doing.”</p>
<p>Most of those edits, he explained, were likely minor, things like fixing grammar, sentence structure, and formatting to better conform to the wiki’s internal style guide. In this way, he considers himself a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiGnome">WikiGnome</a>”—someone who makes small, incremental edits to pages and makes changes behind the scenes.</p>
<p>When he’s in the mood to do some editing, he’ll jump around the wiki using the random button for a couple of hours and make changes.</p>
<p>All those hours have given him not only refined copy editing skills but also a serious familiarity with the pages. Dillion says he can jump on just about any page and find at least one of his edits on it.</p>

<p>He has done a lot of work on the namespaces for the <em>Tamriel Rebuilt</em> mod and essentially rewrote the entire namespace for <i>The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard</i>, a game he doesn't particularly enjoy playing but started on a whim.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>“At some point, I stumbled across the wiki section for it and was like, well this is nothing, this is awful,” he explained.</p>
<p>He recalled getting stuck on a section of the game, and the wiki wasn't able to help him. He was able to stumble through the game but decided he would completely fix its entries so they would be more helpful to future players.</p>
<p>Now, the <i>Redguard</i> namespace includes detailed descriptions of the quests, characters, and items, along with photos, most of which Dillion took himself. He says that if the game and all its files were somehow wiped from the earth, developers would be able to remaster the entire game in Unity based just on what’s in the wiki.</p>

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>“I guess that’s kind of the end goal,” he said, “and some of the namespaces are kind of close, like <i>Oblivion</i> I would say is kind of close to where the things that you can still add to the page are getting minimal.”</p>
<h2>Efforts all over</h2>
<p>While Dillion is a more prolific editor than most and Morley plays a more specific role in the wiki than others—and Humphrey represents the original jumping off point for the former two—it’s the combined effort of thousands of editors like them that make the UESP what it is.</p>
<p>And across the Internet, there are equally involved editors working on an endless number of wikis toward similar goals. In a way, they are remaking the games they love in a text-based format.</p>
<p>At their core, these community efforts help players get through games in a time when physical guides often no longer exist. But in the aggregate, deeper, centralized insights into these games can ultimately contribute to something new. A record over time of how a game changes and how it works can lead to discovery and debate. In turn, that could spark inspiration for a mod—or a new game entirely.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Apple has formally updated its App Store guidelines to reflect the dramatic decision laid down by a US judge around alternative app store payments. 
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">fiery injunction passed this week</a>, Apple was told it could no longer dissuade app makers from offering other payment methods by applying a 27 percent commission on their proceeds. The move allows apps and games to offer direct - and potentially cheaper - options for in-app purchases, at least in the US.
</p>
<p>
Apple said it disagreed with the judgment and would appeal the decision, though would comply as instructed in the meantime. The company has now updated its App Store rules, and developers are rushing to take advantage.
</p>
<p>
"On the United States storefront, there is no prohibition on an app including buttons, external links, or other calls to action, and no entitlement is required to do so," Apple's rules now state (thanks, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/05/01/apple-app-store-guidelines-external-links/">9to5Mac</a>). 
</p>
<p>
"The prohibition on encouraging users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase does not apply on the United States storefront," Apple continues. "The External Link Account entitlement is not required for apps on the United States storefront to include buttons, external links, or other calls to action."
</p>
<p>
Last night, music streaming service Spotify said it had already submitted an app update to Apple which directs users to its website, bypassing payment via the App Store where Apple takes its 30 percent cut. 
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-05-01/following-landmark-court-ruling-spotify-submits-new-app-update-to-apple-to-benefit-u-s-consumers/">blog post announcing its move, Spotify said</a> users would finally be able to "see how much something costs in our app", such as subscriptions and information on promotions - and in the future, potentially easier-to-buy audio books.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney has stated that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> will return to the iPhone App Store in the US next week, after an absence of five years. 
</p>
<p>
The company has also offered a "peace proposal" to Apple, and suggested it would "drop current and future litigation on the topic" if Apple rolled out these changes worldwide. Seems unlikely, but you never know.
</p>
<p>
Sweeney previously said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">Fortnite had lost around $1bn in missed revenue from taking on Apple</a> and getting kicked off its app store for deliberately breaking the rules - but that it had been worth it.

			<p>A new The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered unofficial patch is now available for download, addressing a huge number of bugs.</p>
<p>The patch, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/477" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a> and requires game version 0.411.140.0, addresses a massive number of issues, including script, quest, NPC, object, item, dialogue bugs, and more. The main goal of the unofficial patch is to eventually fix every bug in Oblivion Remastered that won't be fixed by the developers within the capabilities of the Creation Kit and other community-developed tools. The complete changelog for the latest version of the unofficial patch can be found <a href="https://www.afkmods.com/Unofficial%20Oblivion%20Remastered%20Patch%20Version%20History.html">here.</a></p>
<p>As the game still uses the original's Gamebryo engine, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered features the usual selection of bugs and issues that have become tradition for Bethesda games. Even with these bugs and performance issues on PC, the remaster of the fourth entry in the beloved series is a more than worthy purchase for any role-playing game fan, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Enhancing the original where it mattered most while preserving what made it truly unique, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered stands as the definitive way to experience Bethesda’s classic. Although the shift in atmosphere and noticeable performance issues will put some players off, as will the dated gameplay, the game couldn't have debuted on current gaming platforms in a better way.</em></p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-another-trailer/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> has been delayed from its Fall 2025 release window, and will now launch next year on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>Today, Rockstar Games confirmed on <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1918265468076605706?t=Px5bjAPYlpMHJab6nnPEdQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> the highly anticipated new entry in the series will not launch this year as expected, and will now release on May 26, 2026 worldwide on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. While apologizing to fans for launching the game later than expected, the developer highlighted how their goal has always been to try and exceed their exceptions and with Grand Theft Auto VI, they want to do no different. As such, extra development time is required to reach the quality that players expect and deserve. More information on the game will be shared soon, so hopefully another look at the game won't take too long.</p>
<p>While it is disappointing to learn that Grand Theft Auto VI will not be released later this year on consoles, it is most definitely not that surprising. Considering their long history of delays, it would have been more surprising for Rockstar Games not to delay what is going to be, regardless, the biggest entertainment launch of all time to date, according to <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">analysts</a>.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on May 26, 2026. We will update you as soon as Rockstar Games shares more information, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

That’s all now thrown for a loop, with the game now set to be released on May 26, 2026.</p><p>“We are very sorry that this is later than you expected,” Rockstar <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1918265468076605706&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1918265468076605706" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted to X</a></span>. “The interest and excitement surrounding a new <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.”</p><p>Delays at this stage are not unusual, as teams take stock and realize that another half a year isn’t going to be enough to get the game ready for launch. But given <em>GTA 6</em> has been in development for many years already, it does take on rather more significance. Not least for Rockstar owners Take-Two, whose shares took a sharp pre-market dip in the minutes following the announcement, losing over nine percent.</p><p>“With every game we have released,” Rockstar’s statement continues, “the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.”</p><p>Take-Two Interactive, via 2K, already have quite a busy fall, with <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> and <em>Borderlands 4</em> due, alongside the likes of <em>NBA 2K26.</em>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-date-moved-up-gta-6-2k-randy-pitchford-1851778271&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-date-moved-up-gta-6-2k-randy-pitchford-1851778271"><em>Borderlands 4 </em>has only just moved it own release date ahead 11 days</a></span>, fueling much speculation that it might be moving out of the way of <em>GTA 6</em>. We now of course know this is definitely not the case, but could have been an early sign of the publisher rearranging things ahead of the announcement.</p><p>This delay will have enormous implications across the entire industry, given the wide expectation that the game will sell record-breaking numbers of copies. Not releasing ahead of the holidays will likely hit console sales extremely hard, given <em>GTA 6</em> will be a game many are waiting for before upgrading to the current generation. It will also be a real blow for physical gaming stores.</p><p>Still, for the regular player, these delays might suck, but are invariably good news in the end. A finished game later on is always better than a broken one earlier. But gosh, this remains a seismic announcement that’ll ripple across the whole gaming industry.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Rockstar has delayed the launch of GTA 6 to 2026.
</p>
<p>
The highly-anticipated sequel will now arrive for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th May 2026, Rockstar announced today in a short statement. 
</p>
<p>"Hi everyone, Grand Theft Auto 6 is now set to release on 26th May, 2026," the company wrote in a statement shared via social media.</p>
<p>"We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.</p>
<p>"With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto 6 is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.</p>
<p>"We look forward to sharing more information with you soon. Sincerely, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>."</p>

<p>Today's news comes ahead of parent company Take-Two's next financial results briefing, set for 15th May, and days after Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-not-the-reason-for-borderlands-4-release-date-change-randy-pitchford-insists">Borderlands 4's recent launch date change was nothing to do with any other game</a>.
</p>
<p>No other information was announced by Rockstar today - and there's certainly no sign of a new GTA 6 trailer. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-first-trailer-released-early">Rockstar released GTA 6's first - and so far only - look at the game back in December 2023</a>, at which point it was set for launch this year.</p>
<p>Rockstar's confirmation of a delay follows months of speculation over whether the game would still make its 2025 launch window, despite assurances from Take-Two that the game was still on track. 
</p>
<p>In November 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-doubles-down-on-gta-6-release-date-after-delay-rumours">GTA 6's publisher insisted the game would arrive in autumn 2025</a> despite whispers of a delay, something it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">doubled down upon again just a few months back</a> in February.</p>
<p>"This calendar year is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever for [Take-Two], as we plan to launch <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 on 11th February, Mafia: The Old Country in the summer, Grand Theft Auto 6 in the fall, and Borderlands 4," the publisher noted in a now-outdated earnings report. </p>
<p>And just a month ago, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-release-date-is-still-secret-because-take-two-boss-wants-to-maintain-the-anticipation-and-excitement">the publisher was still keeping the GTA 6 date close to its chest to "maintain the anticipation and the excitement"</a>. Still, reading back through his comments now, there is a suggestion of caution around announcing a firm date too early. Here's what he said:</p>
<p>"We do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance, and we found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand, and balance the excitement with unmet anticipation," Zelnick noted.</p>
<p>The delay is at least good news for other games hesitant to lock down a launch date towards the tail end of 2025. Indeed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">EA boss Andrew Wilson previously said the company would be willing to delay its next Battlefield</a> - currently expected to release before April 2026 - if "some things happening in the year" meant that "wasn't a great window for us".</p>
<p>Sony, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-announced">waited until last week to confirm an October launch date for Ghost of Yōtei</a>, likely its biggest PlayStation launch for the year. Its hard to imagine the company did that without knowing the game would not clash with Rockstar's behemoth.</p>
<p>Rockstar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta6-active-development-now-well-underway-rockstar-says">first confirmed GTA 6 development was "well underway" back in 2022</a>, following reporting that stated the game's initial scope had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-grand-theft-auto-6-plans-reportedly-featured-four-protagonists-and-three-cities">pared back to allow for a smoother development and the ability to grow the game's world post-launch</a>.</p>
<p>
As it is, GTA 6 will be set in a modern day version of Vice City - the Grand Theft Auto version of real-world Miami - and star a Bonnie and Clyde-style pair of protagonists. Here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">everything we know about GTA 6</a> for more.

            <p>Survival hellscape <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rust">Rust</a> has added a tropical jungle biome to its procedurally generated maps, the biggest change to the landscape of the game in nine years. It'll appear close to where new players spawn and hides a number of threats and fun. Poisonous snakes will skitter through the undergrowth and riverside crocs will chew your face given the chance. There are ruins and temples hidden among the trees, housing some basic loot. And you can swing from vines, perhaps inspiring a whole new life in the canopy. Probably for the best, considering there are now tigers and panthers stalking the ground below.</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0BHMuwU4Nk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>Developers Facepunch detailed all the changes in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/252490/view/498319683381887523">update post on Steam</a>. Maps are still procedurally generated (they've been this way since the nudist murder sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-new-version-review">moved to Unity 5 in 2016</a>) but until now maps have been basically a mix of arctic, temperate, and desert biomes. So this does seem a significant new addition to the deadly dog-eat-dog dangerzone. </p>
<p>To help out with that, there are two new weapons: a boomerang that returns to the player, and a blowpipe "for those who enjoy causing problems quietly." It can be loaded up with different types of dart ammo, including an "incapacitate" dart that slows its victims and obscures their vision for a time. Or a "radiation" dart that simply stacks radioactive ill-health onto your foe. Hideous behaviour, and not one bit surprising for Rust. The new wildlife sounds equally brutal. </p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>"The tiger may be the deadliest animal you'll ever encounter [in] Rust," say the devs. "It closes in extremely slowly from behind, and only strikes when it's sure to kill. A moment of inattention in the jungle is all it takes."</p>
<p>To make sure that enemy's AI doesn't feel "unfair and bullshit," the animal will have a set of cues that you have to watch and listen for while roaming the fern-ridden floor. "It'll be on you to experiment and discover those hidden signals."</p>
<p>The overgrown temples (an ancient ziggurat, for example) will hide some mysteries, we're told. And slightly less weathered ruins will contain "low-tier supplies and maybe even a few surprises tucked away". The place is also a botanist's delight, from the sounds of things.</p>
<p>"The jungle biome features a large variety of completely new foliage," they say. "This includes new types of bushes, such as bromeliads and monstera. New undergrowth plants like arrowroot and calathea. As well as [a] variety of new trees like trumpet trees, jungle palms and sandbox trees. The biggest of them all are enormous kapok trees that you will be able to climb and swing from." </p>

</figure>
<p>There's a bunch of other stuff accompanying the update (here's the <a href="https://rust.facepunch.com/news/jungle-update">full patch notes</a>), including beefing up of servers, and a DLC pack with an Aztec-flavoured AK-47. If only Moctezuma had had one of these... </p>
<p>I'm not going back to Rust, even with all this lush-looking leaf rendering. I haven't visited its randogen den of misdeeds in over a decade, when I chronicled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-diary">a nine-life misadventure</a> with its chaotic players. But even I can see the game has changed a huge amount since then, adding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-adds-boasts">boats</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rusts-next-dlc-pack-adds-pools-tubes-and-water-guns">water pistols</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-has-submarines-spearguns-and-sharks-now">submarines</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rusts-new-instruments-dlc-lets-you-shred-the-shovel-bass">musical instruments</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-now-has-npcs-who-can-give-you-missions">NPC quest-givers</a>, and even - oh my god - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-is-finally-adding-backpacks-to-kick-off-its-second-decade">backpacks</a>. No wonder it remains one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">best survival games</a>. If you're made of sturdier stuff than I, this could be a good time to go camping. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But, according to the publisher of Clair Obscur, not only did Oblivion <em>not</em> harm Clair Obscur, Clair Obscur actually benefitted from Oblivion’s release because it boosted excitement for the RPG genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So says Kepler Interactive’s senior portfolio manager Matt Handrahan, who told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/expedition-33-publisher-elder-scrolls" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a> all about Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s launch success against the odds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, some background. RPG fans were faced with the difficult choice between spending hundreds of hours in Oblivion’s Cyrodiil, or embarking on an expedition to take down the Paintress in Clair Obscur. The launch of the two games in the same week provoked both joyful and frustrated reactions from RPG fans, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-publisher-acknowledges-the-barbenheimer-energy-of-releasing-the-same-week-as-oblivion-remastered">a cheeky comment from Kepler Interactive itself</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an X/Twitter post, Kepler shared an edited image of the characters from Clair Obscur walking into an Oblivion Gate, with the text "omg its like barbenheimer" in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/internet-embraces-barbenheimer-memes-mashups-more"><u>humorous nod to the simultaneous release of the films Barbie and Oppenheimer in theatres on the same day in 2023</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">omg its like barbenheimer <a href="https://t.co/TN1AFzdggc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/TN1AFzdggc</a></p>— Kepler Interactive (@Kepler_Interact) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kepler_Interact/status/1914703225652945047?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft, which owns Oblivion developer Bethesda and which had heavily backed Clair Obscur since its reveal at an Xbox Showcase last year, also came under fire for shadow-dropping Oblivion on top of Clair Obscur, with both games being Game Pass day-one titles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, according to Handrahan, there was nothing to worry about. “We always knew that Expedition 33 had a very specific identity,” Handrahan said. “When I was in the press, I saw the Western-style RPG and the Japanese-style RPG as having quite different appeals and audiences. I knew plenty of people that would play an Elder Scrolls game that wouldn't necessarily play Final Fantasy and vice versa.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Also, by the time that we rolled around, we had momentum of our own and we felt pretty confident that we could stand beside it. I think there were other aspects, like the price point we were at and the inclusion in Game Pass… so we knew we would have a lot of interest around the game. We were confident in that. And it went as well as it possibly could have done in our eyes. And, actually, proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all. In many ways, I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week and everybody was thinking and talking about the genre.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur has become a big hit for Keplar and its French developer, Sandfall Interactive, selling over 1 million copies in just three days and posting impressive concurrent player numbers on Steam. It’s done so well that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/french-president-macron-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-for-creating-one-of-the-best-rated-games-in-history">French President Macron has praised the development team</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda has announced Oblivion Remastered has seen over 4 million players since launch, but hasn’t announced a sales figure. It too has seen big Steam concurrent player numbers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Business quoted data from Ampere that shows 35% of Clair Obscur players also played Oblivion remastered, which means there was significant overlap. A lot of that has to do with both games launching in Game Pass, with the overlap percentage dropping for Steam and PlayStation 5 players.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Oblivion Remastered, including a report on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-player-escapes-the-confines-of-cyrodiil-to-explore-valenwood-skyrim-and-even-hammerfell-the-rumored-setting-of-the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>a player who managed to escape the confines of Cyrodiil to explore Valenwood, Skyrim, and even Hammerfell, the rumored setting of The Elder Scrolls VI</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've also got a comprehensive guide to everything you'll find in Oblivion Remastered, including an expansive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/maps/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/cyrodiil"><u>Interactive Map</u></a>, complete Walkthroughs for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Main_Quest_Walkthrough"><u>Main Questline</u></a> and every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Guilds"><u>Guild Quest</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Character_Building_Guide"><u>How to Build the Perfect Character</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Things_to_Do_First_in_Oblivion"><u>Things to Do First</u></a>, every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/PC_Cheats_and_Console_Commands"><u>PC Cheat Code</u></a>, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Clair Obscur, be sure to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/clair-obscur-expedition-33/Tips_-_Things_Clair_Obscur_Doesn't_Tell_You"><u>check out our tips for the important things to know before </u></a>heading into the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

        <p>Oblivion remaster art lead is "excited to see their interpretation"</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> is theoretically terrible news for the creators of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a>, a long-in-development mod that recreates Bethesda's 2006 RPG in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> engine. On the one hand, you could argue that the official comeback care of Virtuos Studios renders Skyblivion unnecessary. On the other, there's the usual worry that Bethesda's intellectual property lawyers are going to erupt from the toilets like radioactive rats and eat the modders alive.</p>
<p>The Skyblivion crew professed themselves undaunted by the news, however. "This always was a passion project and still is until the end," modder KRebel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-get-twice-the-amount-of-oblivion-this-year-says-skyblivion-modder-undeterred-by-official-remaster">insisted last week</a>. "For the community its a win-win as you get twice the amount of Oblivion this year." And Bethesda have now met them with open arms by not only declining to sue the pants off Skyblivion for intellectual property infringement, but handing the modders keys for the official remaster and even going on camera to say that they're looking forward to Skyblivion's release.</p><!--more-->
<p>"Even though I worked on Oblivion Remastered, I'm still excited for Skyblivion," art and development lead Dan Lee comments in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_vxm8svHko">video</a>, as noticed by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesda-gives-full-throated-shout-out-to-skyblivion-fan-remake-after-giving-the-whole-dev-team-free-oblivion-remastered-keys-i-think-what-theyre-doing-is-very-special/">Passable Crumpet Gamer</a>. "I think what they're doing is very special, and I'm excited to see their interpretation of what we've done in the past. I think it's a great year for Oblivion fans." In case there was any lingering ambiguity about Bethesda's goodwill, the video closes with some footage of the mod.</p>
<p>The Skyblivion team are naturally very happy about this. "Dan, we're just as excited to get Skyblivion into your hands this year as you are to play it!" they <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skyblivion.com/post/3lo4pnqtszs2h">write on Bluesky</a>. "Thanks for the shout-out and kind words."</p>
<p>All this is being greeted online as a rare dollop of wholesome vibes from publishers that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/28/17511658/bethesda-lawsuits-fallout-elder-scrolls-prey">have launched their fair share of legal action over copyright infringement</a>. At the risk of being a Cyrodiil Cynic and/or Daedra Downer, I think it could be a mixture of genuine benevolence and Bethesda calculating that Skyblivion poses no real commercial threat to the Oblivion remaster at this juncture, and that being nice to the modders is great publicity. See also: this news post. If only Take Two Interactive thought the same of people <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playable-gta-6-map-mod-project-vice-is-no-more-following-take-two-copyright-strike">trying to recreate GTA 6 in the GTA 5 engine</a>. </p>
<p>Regardless, I am interested to compare the visuals of Skyblivion and the official remaster, particularly given James's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-settings-pc-performance">conclusions about the latter's performance</a>, and Nic's comments in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review">Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered review</a> about how the extra graphicsability only emphasises Oblivion's capacity for silliness. As he puts it: "by whacking up the verisimilitude dial, by making you believe that much more in every flickering flame or dancing shadow or rapturous sunrise, everything that actually occurs in Cyrodiil becomes that much stupider."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has congratulated Sandfall Interactive for its new RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, calling it a "shining example of French audacity and creativity".</p>
<p>Sandfall's game released last week to widespread acclaim. It sold 500k copies in its first day, which then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-500k-sales-in-one-day">grew to 1m copies within three days</a>.</p>
<p>"1m copies and to date, one of the best-rated games in history: and yes, it's French!" Macron wrote in a reply to the studio on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJHKCJyNVZ_/?igsh=a2ZyZWJsYncxejBr&amp;img_index=1">Instagram</a> (Google translated). "Congratulations to Sandfall Interactive and all the creators of Expedition 33. You are a shining example of French audacity and creativity."</p>

<p>The game's account replied in turn with the only acceptable response: a baguette emoji.</p>
<p>"We hope you've enjoyed spotting the nods to our home country throughout," the original post reads.</p>
<p>Despite being set in a surreal and painterly fantasy world, Clair Obscur is filled with silly French references: from battling mimes, to stripy outfits, a twisted version of the Eiffel Tower, and a fair amount of swearing in French.</p>

<p>The game released in the same week as Bethesda surprise-dropped Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion. Yet <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-oblivion-surprise-release-didnt-seem-to-harm-clair-obscur-expedition-33-success-publisher-says">Clair Obscur publisher Kepler noted that hasn't harmed sales</a>.</p>
<p>"Proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all," said Kepler's senior portfolio director Matt Handrahan. "In many ways, I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week and everybody was thinking and talking about the genre."</p>
<p>"Outstanding artwork and glorious combat bring Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's bold, painterly world to life," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Eurogamer's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a>.</p>
<p>Macron's comment recognising the success of a video game is also a welcome u-turn after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-clarifies-view-on-video-games-after-blaming-them-for-riots">he previously blamed the culture around the medium for riots in the summer of 2023</a>. He later clarified on social media he "always considered that video games are an opportunity for France, for our youth and its future, for our jobs and our economy".</p>
<p>"I expressed my concerns at the end of June because video game codes had been used by offenders to trivialise violence on social networks," he added. "It is this violence that I condemn, not video games."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>A fresh update roadmap for historical 4X game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ara-history-untold">Ara: History Untold</a> has been shared, alongside fresh information for the game’s first premium DLC, Untold Scenarios.</p>
<p>Oxide Games won’t be going it alone in supporting the game going forward, though, as Stardock Entertainment (best known for Galactic Civilizations and publishing Sins of the Solar Empire) is assuming production management. Oxide is still lead developer on the title, and the game is still being published by Xbox Game Studios, but this is a rejig of the game’s ongoing support, with Stardock having already collaborated with Oxide in the run up to release in September 2024 and through post-launch updates since then.</p>


<p>“With our decades of experience in delivering high-quality strategy games, Stardock is uniquely equipped to lead development on future content for Ara: History Untold,” said Brad Wardell, CEO of Stardock Entertainment and Oxide Games. “By listening closely to players, we’ll elevate the game’s history-defining potential for players everywhere.”</p>
<p>On the roadmap, May and June will build up to Version 1.4 (with a preview build), which will bring warfare updates, AI improvements in several areas, performance optimisation and more.</p>
<p>June will also see the paid Untold Stories DLC release with with new scenarios, maps, events, amenities, and technologies.</p>

<p>Looking further ahead, this summer will bring Version 2.0 with more significant overhauls.</p>

<p>Ara: History Untold is one of a number of historical 4X titles that have sprung up to challenge Civilization – especially looking to launch ahead of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/14/civilization-7-review/">Civ 7</a> – each introducing their own twist on how to deal with the passage of time. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/ara-history-untold-review/">our review</a>, I said, “Ara: History Untold is another distinctive take on the historical 4X strategy genre, putting a real emphasis on furthering your nation, managing supply chains and resources, and shifting the focus away from warring mentality it’s so easy to sink into. There’s room to grow, but this is a strong contender.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blades-of-fire-free-copies-to-be-given-away-at-london-comic-con-%E2%80%93-if-you%E2%80%99re-celebrating-your-steel-wedding.1179417/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-free-copies-to-be-given-away-at-london-comic-con-if-youre-celebrating-your-steel-wedding/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Blades of Fire publisher 505 Games announced a rather unusual offer. They'll be giving away free digital copies of the game (presumably handing out redeemable codes) at London Comic-Con in three weeks, on Friday, May 23. There's a pretty big caveat, though: you have to be celebrating your Steel Wedding (11-year) anniversary on May 22. That means you only get a free copy if you were married on May 22, 2014, and can bring a wedding certificate (or copy/photo) attesting to this.</p>
<p>The seemingly arbitrary date is obviously a reference to <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-new-action-adventure-from-mercurysteam-out-on-may-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game's launch date</a>, set for May 22, 2025 on PC (only <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/blades-of-fire-f8178f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Epic Games Store</a>, at least for now), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The game will be priced at $59.99, although there's a 10% pre-order discount available now on PC and Xbox. PlayStation users can also get the same discount, but only if they have an active PlayStation Plus subscription. As a side note, if you want to play on PC but don't have a good enough hardware (the system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-detailed-requirements-upscaled-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are fairly demanding</a>), the game will be playable via cloud <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-to-get-doom-the-dark-ages-blades-of-fire-and-more-in-may/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through NVIDIA GeForce NOW</a>.</p>
<p>Blades of Fire had a relatively short marketing period, having been revealed only in late February. However, MercurySteam has shared many details on the action/adventure game since. The title is set in a fantasy world where the evil queen Nerea has magically turned everyone's steel into stone, making it impossible to challenge her rule. However, protagonist Aran de Lira receives a unique hammer that isn't affected by the curse and sets out on a journey to take her down.</p>
<p>Forging weapons is, therefore, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-will-focus-strictly-on-weapons-and-your-skills-instead-of-magic-and-rpg-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a big part of the game</a>. Not only are there seven weapon families and 30 Forge Scrolls, but even the choice of materials will greatly influence the crafted weapon, leading to many different combinations. It will be up to the player to choose the right tool for the job, too, as weapons can have wildly different efficiencies depending on the enemy's armor. With over 50 enemy types, players will have to keep track of each one's strengths and weaknesses. The combat system also lets players attack specific body parts.</p>
<p>MercurySteam also <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-narrative-driven-game-where-you-decide-how-much-you-want-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that Blades of Fire is narrative-driven. At the same time, players will decide how much they want to know about the story. One way to do that is by engaging in dialogue with Aran's companion, the young scholar Adso de Zelk, who is something of a human encyclopedia.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview-a-pleasant-surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">going hands-on with the game at GDC 2025</a>, Kai Tatsumoto was quite interested in the final game:</p>
<p><em>MercurySteam’s strange AA blacksmithing adventure wasn’t on my radar before going to GDC after missing the initial preview event, but after going hands-on for an hour or so, I was pleasantly surprised with their latest unique IP. It’s just unique enough with the strong emphasis on forging and reforging that gives this action adventure a hook that I haven’t seen done before to this extent. The actual story itself could be a standard fantasy slop, and I’d still be on board for crafting a massive warhammer and just playing out my barbarian fantasies.</em></p>
<p>By the way, a new Blades of Fire trailer will go live later today during Future Game Show's Gamescom LATAM edition. We'll update this story once it is available.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
The Photo Of God is not an especially brilliant game, but it is a game I keep thinking about. It's a spooky, throwaway interactive epistle from the evidently self-deprecating Serious Daniel, in which you play a photographer standing on a rooftop in a flooded city, under a low, funereal sun. The photographer decides he is going to snap a picture of God. To do this, he must first take pictures of birds that form a breadcrumb trail around the rooftop and through an abandoned building, lit by blazing oil drums. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It's not clear whether the abandoned building is the same one you start on. There appear to be several floors but, perhaps due to the fade-outs when you enter the stairs, it feels more like you're repeatedly traversing one hallway, with objects shuffling around behind your back. It makes sense that a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a> about the joy and hubris of photographing a deity would complicate the notion of ascending or descending, that it would feel innately purgatorial. For every photograph you take, the photographer rambles to himself a little about beauty and divinity.
</p>
<p>
The birds, meanwhile, spawn one after the other, each cycling the same animation of cocking its head and pecking at the lurid, featureless environment. They appear indifferent to your presence until you snap a photo, using right-click to aim through the lens. Then, there's another fade-to-black and the sound of flapping wings and when the blackness lifts, the bird has vanished. You could call the inability to watch it fly away evidence of limited technical expertise or resources, but again, these crude ruptures feel appropriate. Cameras cut the world to pieces, whereas godhood is (going by the Judeo-Christian concepts I grew up with) continuous, all-pervading. Even when not seeking deliberately to visualise the deity, snapping a photograph is chopping God's body apart.
</p>
<p>
The game lasts a handful of minutes. You will probably guess at the rough nature of conclusion. If you can't, there's a picture of it right there on <a href="https://danieloschepkov.itch.io/the-photo-of-god">the Itch.io page</a>. The Photo Of God is no extended philosophical treatise, but a whimsical modelling of feelings of cosmic dread and presumption that are already perfectly encapsulated by the title alone. There may be a lot more to it or not much at all - I leave that for you to determine. It's free to download.</p>
<p>I keep thinking about the game because you could take the concept and apply it to any vaguely agnostic game with camera mechanics, and it'd be transformative. Imagine if, say, Ubisoft updated callous Clancy fest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands">Ghost Recon: Wildlands</a> with a bonus Steam achievement labelled "take a photo of God", with no guidance about what is meant here by God, no actual unlock parameters, and no other changes to the game. Just throw that one out there for the completionists to anguish over, while they're synching headshots. 
</p>
<p>
I'm not religious, as you may guess, but I would spend many enchanted hours in such a game attempting to conceive and envisage godhood through drone feeds, sniper scopes, and the game's own Photo Mode. I would also enjoy reading threads of other people striving to do likewise, according to their own modellings of divinity. We don't need to wait for that Steam achievement. We can start the ball rolling here.

The initial hype has peaked, and bloated prices are falling fast. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn’t just the usual post-release cooldown, it's a mix of wider stock availability and Pokébro investors moving on, making it far more affordable to pick up cards individually rather than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-may-1-2025">gambling on overpriced sealed boxes</a> (no matter how appealing that is!). Here's why buying singles could be the smart move for collectors in the US right now.</p><p id="tldr-japanese-single-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="TL;DR: Japanese Single Cards">TL;DR: Single Card Prices Are Crashing</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just look at the current value of Japanese booster boxes for The Glory of Team Rocket set, more than double the shelf price right now. We haven't seen overpricing like this since 151, but I think we're looking at the light at the end of the tunnel for stock <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-surging-sparks-booster-bundle-shining-fates-amazon-restock-latest">shortages of Pokémon TCG</a> worldwide. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take Team Rocket's <a href="https://zdcs.link/aD3m5W?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mewtwo ex SIR for example</a>; sold listing were at the $500 mark starting 20th April, which has nose dived down to around $370.77 over the past couple of days. A strong start when it comes to market correction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there's <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGlk8?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket's Moltres ex SIR</a>, going from a few sales at around $250 to $163. Granted, it's not a dramatic drop, but that's a $87 drop in the space of a week or so. Not bad. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-april-30-2025">These price drops</a> happening sooner shows us that more scalpers are leaving our hobby, which means <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-april-25-2025">artificial bloating on release is down.</a></p><p id="most-affordable"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Most Affordable">Most Affordable Team Rocket Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not all about the ridiculously expensive chase cards however, with Glory of Team Rocket's Super Rare ex and Hyper Rare ex variants looking stunning. These cards are usually over looked in each set, which is great for trainers like me and you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, we can see that it's not just us thinking this with certain cards like <a href="https://zdcs.link/98LwDL?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket's Mewtwo Super Rare ex</a>, which has climbed in value by $6 and change since release to $38.75. Following Journey Together's artstyle of the full color Pokémon with an outline of their trainer in the background, these cards are worth snapping up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe it's just a Mewtwo thing? <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEjZ0y?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket's Nidoking Super Rare ex</a> is performing as expected, dropping from $26 with some stability at $12.94. it's an iconic card for generation one fans and watchers of the first season of the Pokémon anime, not to mention it looks more menacing than Brock with a frying pan. This is one of those cards to buy now and watch it climb down the road, the same goes for Moltres and Crowbat.</p><p id="best-trainer-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Trainer Cards">Best Team Rocket Trainer Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-game-sale-switch-2-woot">peak nostalgia here from generation one</a> and two here, specifically Giovanni and Ariana. The former being the don of Team Rocket who players take down in Kanto, and Ariana serving as the second interim boss of Team Rocket in Johto. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's not much data on <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoXZqA?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Giovanni 129/098 right now</a>, but it features Team Rocket's leadership alongside the boss himself. It's likely to hold it's value at around the $17 mark, so if it comes up cheaper, grab it. A rule of thumb with this set; if it's Giovanni or Mewtwo, expect to pay out of your nose for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aN4vWV?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket's Ariana 128/098</a> is a stunning artwork variant of the standard trainer art, sporting prices between $17 and $18 and rightly so. Again, the set hasn't been out long enough to judge the value of this card properly, but any listing for under $18 is a good deal right now.</p><p id="best-art-rares"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Art Rares">Best Team Rocket Art Rares</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the best artwork in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/youll-save-more-buying-single-paldean-fates-pokmon-cards">Scarlet and Violet era</a> belongs to illustration rares and art rares. They're cheap and look amazing, easily some of the most slept on cards in the TCG. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">If you're looking for your collection to span binders</a>, grow in value and look good whilst doing it? This is the way forward for you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming in higher than most right now is Team Rocket's Meowth 109/098, sitting at around $19.25 at the time of writing. That's a fall of nearly $20 from the launch of The Glory of Team Rocket, which is to be expected so close to launch. But the link to this Pokémon and Team Rocket is iconic to say the least (Where the hell is Jesse and James in this set?). It looks like this card is still crashing, so anything below the $20 mark is an awesome deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some reason, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmXrE3?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blaziken 101/098</a> is crashing card right now. This artwork is incredible, showing off exactly why this generation three starter Pokémon is a fan favorite. These are usually all traits that go into a Pokémon card having a nice climb, which tells me this is a card to snap up rigt now. It's even playable thanks to it's Infernal Legs attacks, dealing 120 damage to your opponents active Pokémon and another 120 damage to a benched Pokémon. This card could literally snag a trainer two prize cards in one move, which is another reason why it should be worth more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you really want to open boosters of The Glory of Team Rocket despite the price tags and five card count of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-japanese-pokmon-tcg">Japanese packs</a>, go for it. But there's some serious bargains to be had on single cards. Just to note, pricing mentioned in this article are correct at the time of writing. Also, stock may go in and out due to TCG Player being a live secondary marketplace. But that's what makes it fun, right? If you missed the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/score-60-off-a-sams-club-membership-today-only-and-secure-sold-out-pokemon-tcg-sets-at-a-discount">Charizard Sam's club deal</a>, this it might be worth checking back in to see if it's still available.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Pokémon TCG Deals</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wheel-of-time-aaa-open-world-rpg-is-legit-its-developers-insist-but-dont-hold-your-breath-for-a-release-date-it-could-be-a-ps6-and-next-xbox-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say the recent announcement of a The Wheel of Time video game being in the works caught fans by surprise — and sparked a healthy dose of skepticism online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The announcement, reported first by Hollywood trade publication <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/wheel-of-time-video-game-iwot-1236374066/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, described an upcoming “AAA open-world role-playing game” for PC and consoles based on Robert Jordan’s much-loved 14-book series The Wheel of Time. A three-year development period was also mentioned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s in development at iwot Studios’ new Montreal-based game developer, which is led by former Warner Bros. Games executive Craig Alexander. Alexander oversaw development for all Turbine (now WB Games Boston) franchises, including The Lord of the Rings Online, Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online, and Asheron's Call. This, on the face of it, would normally spark significant excitement from fans. But it’s the name iwot Studios, which acquired the rights to The Wheel of Time (as Red Eagle Entertainment) in 2004, and this talk of an unlikely three-year development process that has raised more than a few eyebrows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A cursory online search of iwot Studios reveals the company has a fractured relationship with the hardcore The Wheel of Time fanbase. I found multiple posts from skeptical fans about the business, with some accusing iwot of being an "IP camper." Others believe iwot has "squandered" The Wheel of Time IP over the years, with multiple projects that failed to go anywhere. Fans often point to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/2vbnua/whats_the_deal_with_red_eagle_entertainment/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10-year-old reddit post</a> that goes even further with the complaints.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, coupled with a collective scoffing at the idea that a brand new video game development studio can essentially come from nowhere and turn around a triple-A RPG that matches The Wheel of Time fans’ expectations, has led to a "we'll believe it when we see it" attitude online.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, The Wheel of Time has found significant recent success with its Amazon Prime Video TV series, which just wrapped up Season 3 (Season 4 is yet to be announced). The show has exposed The Wheel of Time to a new army of fans, and, after upsetting the core fanbase with significant story changes in Seasons 1 and 2 compared to the books, did well to turn the narrative around with a much-improved Season 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s with all this in mind that I set out to learn more from iwot Studios itself. Over a video call, I spoke with Rick Selvage, boss of iwot Studios, and Craig Alexander, studio head for the company’s video game efforts, to get a better understanding of where the project is at, its scope, what fans can expect, and to put all that online criticism to them for a response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How did the video game project come to be?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rick Selvage:</strong> We have a very big, deep story to tell, and we also happen to control the rights through to The Wheel of Time, including all interactive rights. And video games are a major platform, fan platform, for any IP like The Wheel of Time. So of course we were going to do video games. The question is when and what type and how we're going to enter the marketplace? So we felt the time is right to now do that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Can you give me some detail on the setup you have to realize that vision? You’re talking about doing a triple-A open-world role-playing game here. A lot is required to make something like that happen to a certain quality level. Exactly what sort of scope do you have for this? What setup do you have now? Where do you hope to get to in the future?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Craig Alexander:</strong> First step is team formation to get started. The plan is to work with the franchise for many years and develop a series of games, sequels, expansion packs, DLC, et cetera, and build out as much of the world we can. And given that we have an expansive set of rights with one of the greatest fantasy IPs in the world, it's a labor of love and we're looking forward to getting started.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But how we're going to break that up over time is something that needs to be sorted out in pre-production. But we're confident that given the richness of the material, we're going to be able to build out much of the world. And you had mentioned complexity. We fully realize these are big games to build. This is a big IP. I've had experience doing quite a bit of fantasy games, building MMOs, which are the biggest and hardest games to do of all. I helped pioneer the genre, and believe this is the right time for a great Wheel of Time immersive experience, and the fans have been asking for it for many, many years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: It sounds to me like you are just getting started on this really, that it’s not like you've got hundreds of developers working away on the game at the moment. Is it the case that you need to start hiring aggressively to get this going?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Craig Alexander:</strong> Yes. We're actively recruiting a leadership team now. We're going to be having some announcements shortly as we fill out the leadership team. Then we're going to build a prototype team that's going to be fairly small, less than 20 to 30 people over time, build out our prototype, build up the vertical slice, and then eventually go into production where we're going to have upwards of 200-300 staff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those numbers are fairly typical for building this scope of a world. As you had mentioned, these are large games, but then as I had mentioned before, because we plan on having a sequel strategy from the outset, building out the entire experience is something that we're going to need to plan for, because I am certain that the fans will want more and we'd like to tell the whole story. And this is true of other big fantasy and science fiction IPs where there's a lot of content to work with.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/02/rick-selvage-headshot-color-1746174860753.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Rick Selvage, CEO of The Wheel of Time rights owner iwot Studios.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is it the case that you plan to self-fund and self-publish the project? Or will you take that vertical slice to market and try and get a publisher on board?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rick Selvage:</strong> No. First of all, it won't be self-funded. We will have substantial funding to build out the company, so that's not an issue. And in regards to publishing, I think it's way too early to commit to publishing either ourselves or another publisher. As you know, over the next years technology and business models will change dramatically, and we're in a position that we don't have to make those commitments now. We just have to focus on making and developing the best game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Craig Alexander:</strong> I would add the focus that I had mentioned on hiring is for a development studio. The publishing functions, as Rick said, come much later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I'm asking this because you've probably seen all the questions under the sun on the internet as a result of the announcement, and one of them is around the backing that you might have to realize this vision. When you go out and say a triple-A open-world role-playing game, that creates a level of expectation among fans because they know what a triple-A open-world role-playing game looks like these days, and that's not cheap. We've seen modern triple-A game budgets balloon in recent years to hundreds of millions of dollars. So I think there are questions around how you can realize that without having huge investment to make it happen. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rick Selvage:</strong> We understand the financial requirements to build a game like this. Craig has been around that business and certainly ran all development for the Lord of the Rings Online MMO, with a few hundred developers. And we understand the costs, we understand the challenges, and that's why we're putting the leadership team now that are capable of doing that. And the funding aspect of it is that we have no concerns about having the investment in order to reach the goals that we're establishing today with our Montreal studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: The announcement mentioned a three-year development process for the game.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rick Selvage:</strong> Yeah, well the three years, I don't know where that came from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I was going to say, that sounds very ambitious.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rick Selvage:</strong> The issue we've always had with the Wheel of Time is that there's excited fans out there, which is great, and there's a lot of misinformation that is started that is nowhere near accurate. We've just decided we're going to do our thing and make television and games and movies, and rather than attempt to put out any information that pops up… but at this point is that three years is… dunno where that came from. We know it's going to take multiple years to do this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Craig Alexander:</strong> It's going to take time. The first game will be the most difficult and we need to scope it properly and frame it, but we want to have a compelling, high-quality release in a reasonable amount of time, but then set up for a success in the future so that we have the workflow tools, processes, et cetera, so that we can build out follow-up releases like I had mentioned, sequels and expansions and the like over time, and run this in many respects as a live service and continue to support the franchise for the long term, because we have a big story to tell. I don't underestimate the amount of work to build out the whole world, but our intent is to do that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But to debate, ‘When is release number one going to come out?’ And, ‘What books and what regions of the world is it going to cover?’ Those details are still being sorted out. We're in pre-production </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rick Selvage:</strong> That's an impossible thing to state. It would be inappropriate to try to state it as well, as much as the fans would like a specific answer to it. There's a lot of work to do.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/02/craig-alexander-headshot542155-1746174899979.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Craig Alexander is leading development of The Wheel of Time video game.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: The announcement also mentioned you expect to launch on PC and consoles. Is that accurate?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Craig Alexander:</strong> Yes, the intent is to be multi-platform. I can't speak to exactly which consoles because there will likely be a console transition coming up. For example, the Switch 2 unclear, but Xbox and PlayStation most likely, and then obviously the PC and maybe even the Macintosh as well, as is typical of most open-world RPGs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Based on what you're saying, this is probably a PS6 game and whatever the next Xbox is. PC is PC of course, but this doesn't sound like something that's going to be out by the end of this console generation.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Craig Alexander:</strong> Yeah. Now it's possible we may want to support the previous generation as well, and support the Series X, support the PS5 just like you're saying. But obviously if we can launch a title that coincides with the launch of the new platforms, that would be great. But none of us have those details yet on exactly when that's going to occur. But the good news is we're going to develop the technology so that it's scalable, that it can support multiple platforms and execute on a triple-A plan that's been done before. Yes, this is difficult, but we know how to do it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don't want the experience too small and release too quick and potentially have quality compromises. On the other hand, we're not going to be developing this game over 10 years for the first release. That's not going to happen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So yes, the first one's the most difficult, but we will balance all those things and we'll get that Goldilocks right in the middle, not too long, not too short. But it's important we do the first one right, because that's going to set expectations. And there's lots of great material, even the order in which you tell the material. As you know as a Wheel of Time fan, the whole experience has a nonlinear nature to it. That's the core of the IP, so we're going to lean into that heavily.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: It makes sense for me to follow the story of the books and the story that the TV show has followed, at least from the outset because that's what's front and center in most people's minds. People who haven't read the books but have watched the show will recognize it in that case, right?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rick Selvage:</strong> We really have two things. One is, certainly a vast amount of people worldwide have read the books, and certainly the show has been distributed over 200 countries. So they're familiar with that and certainly we will follow that story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other piece I want to add though is that we are doing the origin movie, The Age of Legends now, and we're about ready to cast on that. The good news is that I believe the Age of Legends is one that fans and even non-fans can understand very easily. You start to understand the origins of The Forsaken and the trollocs and how the world broke, and that story really hasn't been told. And we're going to have an opportunity to do that in an epic feature film. And of course we would be crazy in development that we don't use assets from that in the game as well. That’s probably a logical path, is the Age of Legends as well as following the books. But where do we start is, we'll figure that out.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Wheel of Time Season 3, Episode 7 Galley</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Craig, your background is in MMOs, right? So is that what the plan is here? You mentioned live service earlier, which suggests it's not necessarily a traditional single-player open-world game like a Bethesda game or a Baldur’s Gate 3 type game, I suppose.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rick Selvage:</strong> Or Assassins Creed or Avowed?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Yeah.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Craig Alexander:</strong> The short answer is I've done all kinds of games. Yeah, we did bring up the MMO experience primarily because you were asking about scope and size. We specifically did not put MMO in the announcement because I think that is a level of undertaking that… I'm not sure it's right for the IP, in part because the Wheel of Time is so character centric. I mean there's almost 3,000 characters in the world. I want to be able to give the player the opportunity to play those folks. And typically in an MMO environment, you have to play an unknown character. You might be able to interact with these iconic characters from the fantasy or sci-fi franchises, but you don't get to actively play them. Which is why treating it more like a single-player experience with multiplayer elements is a much better way to go. But even the games that you had mentioned like Balders Gate 3 and the like, there are opportunities to do online integrations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as the live service, I was just trying to point out that releases are going to occur over time. There's going to be lots of them. And I know there's this attention on, when's the very first discreet release for the first and most difficult title? That's just one of many decisions on how you're going to deploy this content out over the decades.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's so much material we could spend our careers working on this. But the beauty is that there's enough content to draw upon. And this was true for me, for Lord of the Rings, where the game's still going. It's been live for 18 years now, and they're building out all of Middle-earth. And likewise, we can do the same here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take your big Assassin’s Creed releases, oftentimes there's around 300 hours of content in each release. Could you imagine the thousands of hours we're going to be able to put in, if we were able to build out a number of sequels to the experience and cover all the books and the prequels and all the things that Rick talked about. We have the luxury of doing all of this because the medium supports it and the players want it. As opposed to, when you're trying to support other mediums, you have to be much more narrow in your focus. And that's something we don't have to do when you're building these big open-world experiences. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: One of the things I wanted to talk to you about is the reception from the community online to the announcement. I think it's fair to say there probably was a degree of skepticism about the announcement and the project and indeed the studio company that you have. Doing my research online, people are pointing to previous things that have happened, previous announcements, Reddit posts from 10 years ago are coming up. Why should fans be confident that this game or this series of games as you're talking about, is going to meet their expectations?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rick Selvage:</strong> As you know, it's a big world with a lot of people and there's a lot of fans. We're not concerned about those that have been uninformed in the past and made comments. I think I mentioned to you earlier in the interview, we just can't address every single piece of misinformation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's been comments about Hollywood, comments about games. People said that when we did the deal with Sony and Amazon and we brought in the showrunner, ‘We'll see if it happens.’ Well, that's an example of things that fans or that minority in the marketplace have mentioned that has come to life in a very significant way. And we're having a lot of success on Season 3. In regards to the new feature film with Kari Skogland, who is an A-list director, we'll start seeing major cast members. All these things will come to fruition when the timing is right and when they're done and they're done in a correct way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've had opportunities for a very long time to put the Wheel of Time on television. We had an opportunity - I'll bring it up now - we did an announcement 20 years ago with Obsidian. That was the time when there were movie based games. Craig knows this from The Lord of the Rings. And we had a big publishing deal with EA. We had a development deal with Obsidian. The problem is, we set the project up at Universal Pictures to do a movie and it was all based on green-lighting the movie. Well, the movie never happened out of Universal, therefore there was no game development. And that was our first and only effort directly in the game business. We've had a lot of opportunities since then to enter the market in a significant way and decided it wasn't right for the market. It wasn't the right game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We wanted to see the television series come out and have some success before we made a decision. We could have put the Wheel of Time on the Sci-Fi channel at a $2 million episode budget way before that. And we didn't announce that, but we were very careful as custodians of the brand to make sure that we do the right thing at the right time and we have success doing it. And so a lot of these things like the first game effort certainly wasn't attributed to us, were the ones that we did the deal and lined up all the partners to do that. It just didn't deliver a movie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now the good news out of that is great for the fans because I don't think that you could really set up a world in a two-hour movie back in those days. And we had the opportunity to see Game of Thrones come out and do well, and that demonstrated that fantasy with big budgets can be done on cable. And as you know, the Wheel of Time is so big with a breadth and depth that television is the best way to tell that story and the best way to launch it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So there's a lot of reasons why there's information out there. The only thing we can do is just deliver good quality fan experiences, which we've done with the Sony Amazon relationship, which my partner and I, Larry Mondragon, our executive producers there, we're going to do the same thing on the video game side. We're going to do the same thing with the Age of Legends. And the only thing we can do is deliver on our commitments on those projects in a way that the fans are thrilled about. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And we're finally glad that fans came around on the Wheel of Time television series. As you well know, there were a lot of people saying the same things about the television series until Season 3 came out, and then it was a different story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I assume all of this comes from good intent, concern, excitement, interest. Nobody wants to be disappointed. We don't want to be disappointed as well. And we're committed to deliver the best fan experiences on different platforms as we possibly can. So that's where we are. We're keeping our heads down. We're doing what we're saying we're going to do. There have been a couple missteps. One was - I wouldn't call it a misstep - but the whole console game that we were going to do with Obsidian as an example.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I imagine I’m typical in that I came around with Season 3. Is that typical feedback from the community?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rick Selvage:</strong> It is. And Game of Thrones took three seasons, too, to come around, and ours is a much more difficult adaptation because it's a much deeper story and complicated. And the fact we got it right on Season 3 is great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I mean, you had fans throwing rocks at Rafe [Judkins], the showrunner. I think all the actors and Rafe and his team did a fantastic job and stuck to it, just like we'll continue to do and we'll win over the fans at the end of the day. But these things take time. They're not easy. There's a lot of challenges in the market from time to time depending on the industry. But we're custodians of the brand and it's to our benefit that we deliver to the fans premium experiences and done right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Craig Alexander:</strong> Team formation is going extremely well right now and we're getting very high quality talent. I know we were talking a bit about the narrative and the writing side. We have some of the best game writers in the industry that are approaching us that want to do this. In many cases they'll tell us, ‘Wheel of Time is why I got into the industry.’ This is big stuff. And they want to do this as a showcase project for them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rick Selvage:</strong> And you'll see that starting as early as next week and going on for the next month, there'll be a lot of announcements around the leadership team that we're bringing aboard. And I think that demonstrates commitment. People with the experience like Craig have in their area of expertise, some of them Craig has worked with before on teams, are all going to come together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We are going to make a deliberate effort to start communicating to the fans in a much more direct way in the future rather than letting our work speak for us. We're going to communicate in the community in a way of being proactive. And at one point in time we'll have our day and we'll be able to fix all the misinformation that's been spread over the last 10 or 20 years by the few people, but we're not concerned about it now. The effort and our dedication and our commitment is in our work. We think the TV show is one of those examples, and you'll see other ones as we move forward, both in a 3D animated feature and live action feature and the video games we’re doing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I can't let you go without asking you if Season 4 is happening. What's the deal?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rick Selvage:</strong> That's a question for Sony and Amazon. I’ll just leave you with that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Well, are you happy with how Season 3 has turned out? Not just from a critical reception and fan reception point of view, but commercially are you happy with it?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rick Selvage:</strong> Yeah, we're thrilled. I'll use the word that’s not typically used in the business, but the price performance ratio, meaning the cost of production versus the value that's created both commercially and from a fan perspective, I think comparable to other fantasy sci-fi shows. I think we're doing remarkably well. I'll leave it at that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're very happy with the performance of the TV show and the team and Rafe and the entire cast. And of course we're going to weigh in with the fans and we believe that the show deserves more seasons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
