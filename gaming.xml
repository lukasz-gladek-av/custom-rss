			<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio is the latest game developed by ATLUS. At the Metaphor Launch Event in Tokyo, Studio Zero Game Director Katsura Hashino announced that the Prologue demo for the game is now available. At the time, it was only available on Xbox, but the demo is now available on PlayStation and PC.</p>
<p>By playing the Prologue demo, players will get a taste for some of the early-game narrative, as well as get to explore the city that players will eventually learn about in the full game. The demo also allows players to explore some of the social elements in the game and engage with some of the characters that will make appearances in the rest of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metaphor: ReFantazio ‚Äî Demo Trailer | Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zItvCKVaUrI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the Prologue demo, the journey begins, showing the player how to begin the journey of lifting the prince's curse. In addition, it gives players access to the first four dungeons and the ability to unlock seven of the 40+ classes that are known as Archetypes in the game.</p>
<p>In terms of social aspects, in the prologue, players will meet six followers, some of whom are party members who will support them on their journey in the game.</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio is a new fantasy RPG in a new universe, created by the same iconic game developers who created Persona 3, 4, and 5. In this game, players are in charge of writing their destiny and have to work to rise above their fear to take the throne.</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio <a href="https://wccftech.com/metaphor-refantazio-gamescom-hands-on-a-jrpg-hit-in-the-making/">will launch on October 11, 2024</a>, on Xbox Series X|S, Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Steam. Players can obtain multiple pre-order versions, including a Collector's Edition that features an artbook and plenty of BGM DLCs as they are released.</p>
<p>To celebrate the demo being released for Metaphor: ReFantazio, a Prologue demo trailer was released so players can see what they are getting into if they decide to jump into the demo. Additionally, all progress made in the demo will progress to the full game if <a href="https://metaphor.atlus.com/index.html?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you purchase</a> the game. This will allow you to get a head start in Metaphor: ReFantazio, and aid you on your journey through the United Kingdom of Euchronia. The demo is just under two minutes long and showcases some of the features players can explore in the game.</p>
<p>Although the demo is only the prologue, it's still a whopping 58 GB download, with the full game being roughly 93 GB to install.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/popular-esports-legend-topson-retires-from-dota-2-competitive/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It is a sad day when one of the best esports players to ever live retires from the competition. Topson, the popular Dota 2 competitor, is officially making his exit from the competitive Dota 2 scene. This comes just after he and his team got third place at The International 2024. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-topson-announces-retirement-from-dota-2-competitive-scene">Topson Announces Retirement from Dota 2 Competitive Scene</h2>



<p>The gaming legend announced his official retirement from the Dota 2 competitive scene recently via Twitter on the official Tundra Esports page. The competitor, who has been competing for Tundra Esports for quite some time now, gave some insights into why he will be leaving the Dota 2 competitive world.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>From standing in at TI12, to getting third place at TI13</p><p>Pogson, Godson, Dadson ‚Äì Topson ü•π<br>After many patches, countless tournaments and some crazy picks we will have to say farewell to Topson as he retires from competitive Dota</p><p>Thank you for everything and all the best. üíô <a href="https://t.co/dE6Va6zj5T">pic.twitter.com/dE6Va6zj5T</a></p></div>‚Äî TUNDRA (@TundraEsports) <a href="https://twitter.com/TundraEsports/status/1838609775266820446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>‚ÄúI have always loved competition,‚Äù said Topson in the video posted on Twitter announcing his retirement. ‚ÄúAll my life, though, has been about Dota. I think this year has given me a lot of clarity about my future.‚Äù</p>



<p>The rest of the video was filled with heartfelt moments, showcasing Topson‚Äôs victorious career. The competitor has seen his fair hair of Dota 2 action over the years, with various iconic moments competing in The International events and more.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-from-3rd-in-the-international-to-retirement-topson-makes-his-official-exit">From 3rd in The International to Retirement: Topson Makes His Official Exit</h2>



<p>Earlier this year, Topson and his team, Tundra Esports, walked out of The International (TI) 2024 tournament with third place. While this may not seem as impressive as a feat compared to the teams that got first and second, the competitor has one of the most decorated careers within all of esports.</p>



<p>Not only has he competed in various TI events, but he also got first place back in The International 2019. </p>



<p>With millions in earnings under his name, Topson has built one of the greatest esports careers from the ground up, showing heavily what perseverance and hard work can do for a career. </p>



<p>Topson, you will be missed.</p>

<!-- cache hit 1:single/related:7886b1c7e92720ef3b1965682fd699d0 --><!-- empty -->
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, the long-anticipated next major release in the popular historical, open-world game franchise, has been moved back from its previously announced November 15, 2024 release date.</p>
<p>The new date is February 14, 2025, according to an open letter <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1838971189722562906">posted to X</a> by franchise executive producer Marc-Alexis C√¥t√©. "We realize we need more time to polish and refine the experience, pushing further some of our key features," C√¥t√© wrote. "As such, we've made the decision to postpone the release date."</p>
<p>He went on to promise a same-day launch on Steam as well as the console platforms for that date.
</p><p>C√¥t√© wrote the note to players, but a letter from publisher Ubisoft to investors <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5U6140Jg0IaqobyAIIEawC/af3b587a1c81f379d57bc64eefdd0285/PR_Trading_update_25092024_final.pdf">went into more detail</a>. "While the game is feature complete, the learnings from the <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> release led us to provide additional time to further polish the title," it says. "This will enable the biggest entry in the franchise to fully deliver on its ambition, notably by fulfilling the promise of our dual protagonist adventure, with Naoe and Yasuke bringing two very different gameplay styles." (It was previously announced that the game allows players to play as two characters: a samurai warrior and a stealthy assassin.)</p>
<p>The investor note also says that "the game will mark the return of our new releases on Steam Day 1," so that's a silver lining for PC players.</p>
<h2>A precarious position</h2>
<p>The massive-budget <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> was positioned as an "Assassin's Creed, but in the Star Wars universe" game and was released on August 30. However, it was met with a mixed reception. Players, reviewers, and streamers praised its meticulous, high-fidelity presentation of Star Wars locales and characters, but they criticized its stealth gameplay as repetitive and frustrating.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Among other things, the game involved lengthy stealth sequences that forced players to start over if they were discovered, but it didn't do a very good job of giving players the information and tools they needed to complete these sequences without resorting to trial and error. Shortly after the launch, one of the game's creative leads promised a patch (which arrived) that would fix one of the earlier missions, but his suggestion in an interview that the problem was simply with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/star-wars-outlaws-patches-dlc-interview">a single mission early in the game</a> rather than something more fundamental rang hollow for many players.</p>
<p>Ubisoft acknowledged publicly that <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> did not meet expectations in terms of either sales or critical reception.
</p><p>It's unclear exactly which lessons Ubisoft intends to take from the misfire of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>. But Assassin's Creed is its most vital franchise, so after a setback like that, the company can't afford anything other than an enthusiastic reception for <em>Shadows</em> from players. It's the first tentpole release in the storied franchise in four years.</p>
<p>Of course, this delay now means that Ubisoft's open-world samurai game will launch in the same year as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/ghost-of-yotei-the-acclaimed-ghost-of-tsushima-is-getting-a-sequel/"><em>Ghost of Y≈çtei</em></a>, a sequel to the Sony exclusive big-budget open-world samurai game called <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> that many players felt did the Assassin's Creed formula more justice than most Ubisoft titles. <em>Shadows</em> will also launch just a few months before the planned release of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>, which is likely to suck all the oxygen out of the room in gaming spaces for some time. There remains some possibility that<em> GTA6</em> will be delayed, though.</p>
<p>This is the first time an Assassin's Creed game from the main franchise has been delayed in a decade; the last delay was <em>Assassin's Creed Unity</em>, which saw its release date bump from October 28, 2014, to November 11. Despite the delay, that game launched with significant technical problems, which were mostly fixed in later updates.</p>

But perhaps the best part of this museum is actually its gift shop, which is filled with some of the coolest Nintendo merch I‚Äôve seen in a long time. </p><p>On October 2, after being announced in 2022, the official Nintendo Museum opens.

Following new of "softer than expected" sales for Star Wars Outlaws, Ubisoft has announced the open-world sci-fi adventure will get its first bit of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-roadmap-reveals-lando-and-hondo-for-paid-season-pass">previously announced</a> post-launch story DLC - starring Lando Calrissian - on 21st November.
</p>
<p>
Titled Wild Card, it sees Star Wars Outlaws protagonist Kay Vess being hired to infiltrate a high-stakes Sabacc tournament. "But as she crosses paths with the notorious gambler Lando Calrissian," Ubisoft teases, "she soon learns that another game is being played."
</p>
<p>
Wild Card arrives alongside two more Star Wars Outlaws cosmetics bundles - Hunter's Legacy and Cartel Ronin - which will also be part of the Season Pass, and a free update introducing new Contracts for all players arrives on the same day.

<p>
Notably, 8th November is also the day Star Wars Outlaws will debut on Steam. News of its impending arrival on Valve's platform follows Ubisoft's announcement all its new releases will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-new-ubisoft-games-to-release-day-one-on-steam-starting-next-february">launch day one on Steam</a> (for the first time since 2019) starting with the delayed Assassins Creed Shadows on 14th February next year.
</p>
<p>
Today's announcement also follows Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">admission</a> Star Wars Outlaws saw "softer than expected" sales, leading to second quarter financial results that "fell short of [the company's] expectations". Despite Outlaws underperformance, Ubisoft told investors its development teams are currently "fully mobilised to swiftly implement a series of updates to polish and improve the player experience" in the hope it'll "engage a large audience during the holiday season".
</p>
<p>
The company expanded on those plans in a <a href="https://x.com/StarWarsOutlaws/status/1838971704820801966">statement shared on social media</a>, promising fans it was "hard at work creating multiple titles updates which will bring optimisation, gameplay polishing, and tweaks, as well as quality of life changes includes adjustments to combat and stealth gameplay". That's on top of the previously announced Hondo Ohnaka Story Pack - titled A Pirate's Fortune - that's due to arrive in spring 2025.
</p>
<p>
Whether all this will be enough to change Star Wars Outlaws' fortunes remains to be seen; Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell felt the game itself was fundamentally flawed when it launched back in August. "It lacks the branching, open stealth of an Arkham game, the systemic options of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> or the incisive, relentlessly satisfying speed of picking enemies off in Assassin's Creed," he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">wrote in his two star review</a>. "It lacks the linear polish and charisma of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted">Uncharted</a>. Lacks the animation flow to its yellow-ledge platforming next to a Horizon, or the sheer joy of taking platforming and making it into an actual game in itself, as in Star Wars Jedi."

<p>It‚Äôs apparently a widespread issue causing Starfield to keep Crashing on Xbox Series X|S. Bethesda is aware of the problem, though they don‚Äôt have any information on an upcoming hotfix to resolve the issue. For now, we have a few potential fixes that could help you resolve the problem and get back to exploring the Settled Systems!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-potentially-fix-starfield-crashing-on-xbox-series-x-s">How to (Potentially) Fix Starfield Crashing on Xbox Series X|S</h2>



<p>I know firsthand that dealing with crashes can ruin the experience, especially in a game like Starfield. You want to immerse yourself, losing yourself in its exploration and side quests, not constantly restarting your system or the game. Hopefully, the following fixes will help you enjoy the game on your Xbox Series X|S:</p>



<ul>
<li>Restart your game or console should the issue persist.</li>



<li>Remove any Creations, especially third-party Creations that do not fall under the Bethesda-featured sections of the mod menu.</li>



<li>Ensure your console has adequate airflow and, if necessary, move it to a different position to prevent overheating.</li>



<li>Uninstall and reinstall the game as a last resort.</li>

<p>While it‚Äôs never fun to uninstall your mods, doing so could ease the problem and prevent you from reinstalling the entire game, which, depending on your internet, may take a long time.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-causes-starfield-crashes-on-xbox-consoles">What Causes Starfield Crashes on Xbox Consoles?</h2>



<p>There are numerous reasons why Starfield may continuously crash on Xbox Series X|S, but the primary causes include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Mod conflicts</li>



<li>Save file corruption</li>



<li>Overheating</li>



<li>Corrupted install/update files</li>
</ul>



<p>It‚Äôs unclear precisely which of these potential causes is the problem, and it could be all of them at one point or another, but hopefully, our above fixes helped you get back to your game without any further issues!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-devs-had-to-push-konami-very-hard-to-release-on-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Konami and Bloober Team will soon release their Silent Hill 2 remake for PlayStation 5 and Steam, but a PC almost didn‚Äôt happen at all.</p><p>News that Konami nearly left PC players behind comes from Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno, who spoke about the sequel remake ahead of its October launch (via <a href="https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Bloober-Team-spodziewa-sie-kolejnych-rozliczen-z-Konami-za-kamienie-milowe-8818376.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bankier.pl</u></a>). Although the Silent Hill 2 reimagining is a project that fans have begged for years for, its release was nearly limited to only one platform. The only thing that saved it from sticking exclusively with PlayStation at launch was Bloober itself.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/30/silenthill2-1717063971235.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Bloober had to push Konami to release its Silent Hill 2 remake on PC.</figcaption></figure></output><p>‚ÄúDefinitely Silent Hill 2 is a game that has been associated with the PlayStation brand from the very beginning,‚Äù the CEO said (as translated by DeepL). ‚ÄúAt the very beginning, we had to push Konami very hard to lean on the PC topic. For them the main market is PlayStation, while looking at the interest on Steam, it seems that it should also be a successful launch.‚Äù</p><p>After much anticipation, Bloober‚Äôs Silent Hill 2 remake was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-announces-silent-hill-2-remake"><u>announced in October 2022</u></a>. It‚Äôs a title fans have waited ages to see revealed, but the road to its launch hasn‚Äôt been without issues. When fans took issue with a combat trailer that arrived in January, Babieno quickly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-dev-responds-to-controversial-combat-trailer-insists-it-was-handled-by-konami"><u>clarified that the footage was handled by Konami, not Bloober</u></a>. At the time, he went as far as to say that the trailer in question was ‚Äúnot the spirit of what used to be, or what we're creating now.‚Äù The CEO also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-producer-wants-fans-to-give-bloober-team-a-chance"><u>asked fans to give the team ‚Äúa chance‚Äù</u></a> last month.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The October launch will be Bloober‚Äôs opportunity to prove itself. For now, it appears Bloober is confident that its push to release the Silent Hill 2 remake on PC via Steam will pay off.</p><p>The Silent Hill 2 remake has a release date of October 8 for PC and PS5. It will be <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-biggest-game-releases-of-october-2024"><u>one of the biggest game releases of the fall season</u></a> when it arrives, but players on other console platforms won‚Äôt be able to enjoy it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-console-exclusive-to-ps5-for-1-year"><u>for at least one year due to an exclusivity deal with Sony</u></a>. We went hands-on with Bloober‚Äôs remake and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-hands-on-preview"><u>shared our findings in August</u></a>. At the time, we said that the survival-horror remake is shaping up to be ‚Äúan extremely faithful reimagining that mostly resists the urge to alter the successful formula of a stone-cold classic.‚Äù</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

At the end of the game, those with enough favor tokens win, taking the Princess' hand to rule the kingdom together. Love Letter's gameplay is done through various cards, each with their own unique abilities and values that inform the way you play. As this is a deduction and reasoning game, it‚Äôs important to memorize where certain cards are at a given time, since you‚Äôll often have the ability to look at your opponents‚Äô hands throughout the numerous rounds played. </p><p>The original Love Letter game came to the States in 2012 and was distributed by AEG before being acquired by Asmodee in 2018. Numerous editions of the base game and themed expansions have been released in its decade-plus lifespan since. The Second Edition (which is now the definitive way to play) was released in 2019, and added five new cards to the mix, including the Spy and Chancellor, new artwork for every card, and the ability to play with up to six players. </p><p>Love Letter is good enough that it has landed on a number of our best board games lists, including our list of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pocket-sized-board-games">best pocket-sized board games</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">best four-player board games</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games-in-2024">best quick-playing board games</a>. That's to say nothing of the spinoffs, which you can read about below.

Set up is a breeze, as you‚Äôll deal one card to each player from the main deck before starting the rounds, which use a clockwise turn order. Your turns consist of playing cards from your hand that will both benefit you and hinder your opponents, so strategize accordingly. At the end of each round, favor tokens are awarded to players still in the round with the highest value card in play. Once the requisite number of favor tokens are held by one or more players, the game ends, and those players win! Games go quick, offering plenty of opportunity to replay, learn different cards, and find the best way to win.</p><h2>Different Themes</h2></div><p id="munchkin-loot-letter"><h3 data-toc-title="Munchkin Loot Letter">Munchkin Loot Letter</h3></p><div catalogid="ae79738d-5fc9-4733-9292-b53af810e6b5" id="207668"><div id="207668" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Munchkin Loot Letter</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Price</strong>: $18.20</li><li><strong>Players</strong>: 2-4 players</li><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 10+</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 20 minutes</li></ul><p>One of the products from the aforementioned AEG era, this Love Letter <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/munchkin-board-game-buying-guide">Munchkin</a> tie-in is seemingly one of the only themes from the publisher still widely available for purchase from retailers. AEG also produced a handful of other themed Love Letter tie-ins, like Legend of the Five Rings, Letters to Santa, and even FX‚Äôs Archer that are out of print. In this version, you play the same way as you would the base game, just with art and lingo from the Steve Jackson board game.

M&amp;M‚Äôs, anybody?</p><h2><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2><p>If you research Love Letter online, you‚Äôll surely come across a much wider variety of themes than what‚Äôs listed here. I don‚Äôt have the out-of-print games on the list, as I only wanted to focus on games more readily available for purchase, however a lot of them are available on the secondary market. For newer gamers and those looking to buy themed gifts for your geeky friends and family, Love Letter is the perfect pick-up-and-play card game, offering a handful of different popular IP reskins and replay value. </p><p><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance commerce writer for IGN.

            <p>Resident Evil's awkward middle child, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-3-nemesis">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a>, is now available via GOG. It follows in the leaking, shambling footsteps of Residents Evil 1 and 2, which likewise oozed onto the platform <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-from-1996-comes-back-to-pc-after-decades-of-gathering-flies">in June</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-2-from-1998-comes-shambling-and-groaning-back-to-pc">in August</a> respectively.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The release of Resi 3 has the same treatment as the previous two games: full compatibility with Windows 10 and 11, new graphics controls, a slightly better UI, and support for modern controllers.
</p>
<p>Resident Evil 3 was famously conceived as a spin-off from the main series, with a different protagonist, and was developed concurrently with Resident Evil - Code: Veronica. Capcom changed their minds during development and jammed existing resident Jill Valentine into the game and released it as the third mainline entry in the series. For those reasons, it's shorter than its seriesmates and a little less loved than Resis 1 and 2 or Mikami's glorious return as lead designer on Resident Evil 4.
</p>
<p>However! However: it's got a good scary tall lad in Nemesis, who hunts the player through segments of the game; it's got much the same appeal as Resi 2 (city, pre-rendered backdrops, good shotgun); and, I can never find it in myself to think "short" is a bad thing. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-3-review">strong 2020 remake</a> did a good job of bolstering its reputation, too, so here's a chance to play the original a little over 24 years after it was first released on Windows.
</p>
<p>Also there are so many Residents Evil now that arguably Resident Evil 5 is its awkard middle child, but let's not split hairs. A family can have more than one troublemaker round the dining table and you can <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_3">buy this one for ¬£9 over on GOG now</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<!-- cache hit 1:single/related:0f9924db959da96dd03f53d1109ce2e8 --><!-- empty -->
<p>Thus far, Meta's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/meta-continues-to-shovel-money-into-the-growing-vr-gaming-segment/">heavily money-losing Reality Labs division</a> has been primarily focused on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-version-0-5/">bulky virtual reality headsets</a> (and some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/even-people-who-bought-metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-dont-want-to-use-them/">odd, display-free Ray-Ban branded sunglasses</a>). So when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg pulled out a 100 g pair of see-through, augmented-reality glasses <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MetaforDevelopers/videos/449444780818091">at this year's Meta Connect keynote</a>, it represented a bit of a new direction for the company.
</p><p>The prototype Orion AR glasses Zuckerberg showed off today don't mean Meta will be ready to release a pair of consumer AR glasses anytime soon. But the demo represents a new vision for lightweight, wide-ranging, see-through smartglasses that Zuckerberg calls "a glimpse of the future" and "the dream of Reality Labs."</p>
<h2>Not your average screen</h2>
<p>The core challenge of building a pair of comfortable augmented-reality glasses, Zuckerberg said, is that "they have to be glasses." That means no bulky headset (a la Quest), no wires (a la Apple Vision Pro), and a weight of less than 100 grams (compared to a full 515 g for the Meta Quest 3). While there's a tiny battery and "custom silicon" in those lightweight glasses, Zuckerberg admitted that some processing is done in a "small puck" that connects wirelessly to the glasses themselves.</p>

<p>To achieve true augmented reality, Zuckerberg said Orion uses a screen that "is not actually a screen." Instead, the glasses use tiny projectors embedded in the arms, which shoot light into specially designed waveguides. From there, the light hits "nanoscale 3D structures etched into the lenses" to show holographic images that can be layered at various depths and sizes on top of a natural view of the real world as seen through transparent lenses.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Zuckerberg said it has been a challenge making sure those images are sharp enough to capture fine details and bright enough to be seen in all sorts of lighting conditions. "This isn't passthrough," Zuckerberg stressed during the keynote. "This is the physical world with holograms displayed on it."</p>
<p>Orion's microprojection technology allows for a field of view that Meta says is "the largest... in the smallest AR glasses form to date." <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/i-wore-metas-orion-ar-glasses-a-wireless-taste-of-a-neural-future/">In live demos</a> to press, Meta said that the field of view reaches 70 degrees, compared to just <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/hololens-2-field-of-view/">52 degrees for Microsoft's older Hololens 2</a> or <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/report-magic-leap-ones-field-view-detailed-developer-documentation/">50 degrees for the Magic Leap One</a>, to cite some more limited examples of consumer AR.</p>
<p>To control these holograms, Orion users can use voice commands or hand- and eye-tracking like that already seen on Quest VR headsets. But Zuckerberg also talked up a "neural interface" wristband‚Äîwhich the company has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/metas-hardware-plans-include-thinner-quest-this-year-ad-supported-ar-in-2027/">teased previously</a>‚Äîthat can read tiny wrist and finger movements even without line of sight to the glasses themselves. That will let you interact with what's on your glasses without having to awkwardly speak out loud or hold your hands in front of you like a zombie, Zuckerberg said.</p>

With just a day to go until the launch of Atari 50's paid The Wider World of Atari DLC, developer Digital Eclipse has revealed all 19 titles it'll be adding to its acclaimed interactive museum.
</p>
<p>
Digital Eclipse announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-50-getting-39-new-games-in-dlc-detailing-intellivision-console-war">more Atari 50 was coming</a> back in June, explaining an additional 39 games would be joining the original selection as part of a new Expanded Edition before 2024 was through. More specifically, the Expanded Edition includes two new timelines exploring different facets of Atari's history - The Wider World of Atari and The First Console War - and both are being released as separate bits of DLC for existing Atari 50 owners.
</p>
<p>
The Wider World of Atari is the first of Atari's two DLC releases and launches for all platforms tomorrow, 26th September. Topics covered include a "deep dive into Stern Electronics' robot-blasting Berzerk; unusual and underappreciated innovations and hidden gems from the late 1980s; a spotlight on the artist Evelyn Seto, who helped create the iconic 'Fuji' Atari logo; Pong creator Al Alcorn explaining the birth of Breakout", and more.

<p>
All this spans eight new video segments, alongside "interviews, vintage ads, historical artefacts, and more". That. of course, is in addition to those previously mentioned 19 playable games, which (via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e1YIEZXCZY">MetalJesusRocks</a>) we now know to be as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Atari Video Cube (2600)</li>
<li>Avalanche (800)</li>
<li>Avalanche (arcade)</li>
<li>Berzerk (2600 Voice Enhanced)</li>

</ul>
<p>
The Wider World of Atari DLC will cost $7.99 when it launches on 26th September. As for Atari 50's second bit of DLC, titled The First Console War, it arrives on 8th November. This details the long-running rivalry between the Atari 2600 and Mattel's Intellivision (a brand Atari <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-buys-intellivision-brand-ending-longest-running-console-war">purchased in May</a>) across six video segments and 20 playable games - including a selection of M Network games, a mix of Atari and M Network sports games, plus rare Atari 2600 and 5200 prototypes.
</p>
<p>
Both DLC releases are included in Atari 50's Expanded Edition (bringing the package's total number of playable games up to 154) which arrives as a standalone digital release for Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, Switch, and PC on 8th November. A $39.99 USD physical Expanded Edition launches for Switch and PS5 on the same day.

The <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240924896062/en/Blasting-Through-Time-SPACE-INVADERS%E2%84%A2-Joins-Forces-with-My-Play-Watch-and-Floor-84-Studio">Space Invaders: My Play Watch</a> is now available for $60 for the earliest backers of a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/f84/space-invaderstm-my-play-watch?ref=hodqsx">Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign</a>.</p></div><p>The My Play Watch was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24240947/this-apple-watch-clones-best-feature-is-a-playable-version-of-space-invaders">teased earlier this month</a>, but we now know more about what its creators say it can do. Its design looks inspired by, or directly lifted from, the Apple Watch, but with a 1.86-inch touchscreen display and a body that‚Äôs not as thin as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24236801/apple-watch-series-10-price-specs-features-release-date">Series 10</a> or as thick as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248380/apple-watch-ultra-2-black-smartwatch-wearables">Ultra 2</a>. It comes with two watch straps that match its retro gaming aesthetic, and it‚Äôs compatible with standard 22mm straps.</p><p>The watch has different faces with pixelated fonts and graphics all themed around <em>Space Invaders</em>, authentic sounds sourced from the original arcade machine, and even health tracking features like a heart rate monitor, a step counter, and an estimation of calories burned throughout the day. The real reason to strap the My Play Watch to your wrist is a custom version of <em>Space Invaders</em> that can be played using the watch‚Äôs touchscreen or its crown dial.</p><p>But the My Play Watch is unlikely to give the Apple Watch or Pixel Watch much competition. Its creators boast that it doesn‚Äôt connect to a smartphone at all. It won‚Äôt notify you of messages, emails, or phone calls, you can‚Äôt use it to ping a misplaced smartphone, and all of the health data it collects is only available on the wearable.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Space Invaders: My Play Watch includes several smartwatch features but no smartphone pairing.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Kickstarter</cite></p></div><p>There‚Äôs no shortage of <em>Space Invaders</em> games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/17/23798016/google-taito-space-invaders-world-defense-ios-android">available for various mobile devices</a>, including <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Finvaders-mini-watch-game%2Fid986212363">watchOS</a>. The My Play Watch is leaning hard on nostalgia as its main selling point as a way to convince retro gaming fans to take a risk on its Kickstarter, as the watch is still in the development phase and hasn‚Äôt yet moved to production.</p><div><p><strong>A note on crowdfunding:</strong></p><p>Crowdfunding is a chaotic field by nature. Companies looking for funding tend to make big promises. According to a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/fulfillment">study run by Kickstarter</a>, roughly 1 in 10 ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù products that reach their funding goals fail to actually deliver rewards. Of the ones that deliver, delays, missed deadlines, or overpromised ideas mean that there‚Äôs often disappointment in store for those products that do get done. </p><p>The best defense is to use your best judgment. Ask yourself: does the product look legitimate? Is the company making outlandish claims? Is there a working prototype? Does the company mention existing plans to manufacture and ship finished products? Has it completed a Kickstarter before? And remember, you‚Äôre not necessarily buying a product when you back it on a crowdfunding site.</p></div><p>For the first 48 hours of the crowdfunding campaign, a yellow or red version of the Space Invaders: My Play Watch is available for preorder with a $60 contribution. After that, they‚Äôll jump to the same price as the blue version at $75. The creators say that they expect to ship it as early as December, but that feels optimistic since they admit that development of the watch‚Äôs custom OS is still underway.</p><p>Many Kickstarters have been plagued by unexpected delays as products move from the development phase to production, particularly those involving electronics. Some have been delayed for months, while others fail to materialize at all, leaving backers without anything to show for their pledges. This might be one to keep an eye on until it actually ships.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A lot of people seem to think so. And when retro nostalgia collides with rabid console fandom, things tend to sell out quickly. Unfortunately, we still don‚Äôt know exactly when pre-orders for everything from the 30th Anniversary PS5 Pro to the PS1-style DualSense will go live.

The earliest that pre-orders are likely to go live is at midnight, 12:00 a.m. ET (9:00 p.m. PT), on September 26. After that, the window for pre-orders had tended to be in the late morning. Pre-orders <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Wario64/status/1306964642250465285&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1306964642250465285" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first went live</a></span> at the PlayStation Direct store for the original PS5 later in the day at 1:00 p.m. ET (10:00 a.m. PT). </p><p><em>The Shortcut</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theshortcut.com/p/ps5-pro-30th-anniversary-pre-order-time&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theshortcut.com/p/ps5-pro-30th-anniversary-pre-order-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a></span> that a major retailer in the U.S. claimed its inventory for regular PS5 Pro pre-orders, which also go live on PlayStation Direct tomorrow,&nbsp;would go up for sale starting at 10:00 a.m. ET on October 10, ‚Äúexactly two weeks after Sony.‚Äù One interpretation, then, is that Sony‚Äôs own PS5 Pro and 30th Anniversary inventory will go up for sale starting at 10:00 a.m. ET (7:00 a.m. PT) on September 26.

If that was local time, it would be 5:00 a.m ET (2:00 a.m. PT) in the U.S. Whatever the case, it‚Äôs a good bet that pre-orders go live on the hour mark though, so as long as you‚Äôre checking before each one, you‚Äôre not likely to be taken by surprise.</p><h2 id="h3583"><a id=""></a>3 things to do to increase your chances of nabbing the pre-order you want</h2><p>There are other measures you can take to increase your chances of snagging a PS1-style PS Portal or one of the super rare, 12,300 limited-edition PS5 Pro 30th Anniversary bundles that comes in an all-white box. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/support/pre-orders&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/support/pre-orders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here are some steps</a></span> you can take to be better prepared before pre-ordering:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>If you have a PSN account, make sure you‚Äôre already logged on in your web browser.</li><li>Have an active credit or debit card on file that can handle the full pre-charge for the sale and doesn‚Äôt expire in the next two months. </li><li>Hope your internet doesn‚Äôt crap out at the last second</li></ul><p>Once pre-orders actually go live, it‚Äôs just a matter of clicking on the store listing, selecting the pre-order option, hoping it gets added to your cart, and then checking out.

Fortunately, the first round of 30th Anniversary Collection pre-orders are exclusively through the PlayStation Direct store, so no one has to worry about the chaos of navigating half a dozen online retailers‚Äô decade-old websites. We‚Äôll update this story when and if Sony shares more information about what to expect from the 30th Anniversary Collection pre-order process. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/geeks-and-nerds-for-harris<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this month, <em>Wonder Woman</em> actress Lynda Carter <a href="https://x.com/RealLyndaCarter/status/1831726342628372659" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> an online fundraiser for the Kamala Harris and Tim Walz campaign called ‚ÄúGeeks and Nerds For Harris.‚Äù I stumbled across it earlier this week and felt a mix of intrigue and cringe. It‚Äôs part of a <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/4887181-white-dudes-swifties-cat-ladies-nerds-for-harris/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">movement of identity group-based campaigning</a> for the Democratic candidates, but I wondered how an identity not as clearly linked to the current political landscape as race or gender would make the connection.&nbsp;</p><p>Honestly, I figured it would be pretty embarrassing. Some of this is my own deep cynicism: I am not excited about electoral politics, and while I‚Äôm thrilled not to be asked to vote for Joe Biden, there‚Äôs a lot <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/pro-palestinian-uncommitted-movement-refuses-endorse-harris-rcna171756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not to love</a> about Harris. Am I going to vote? Absolutely. Will I celebrate in the streets if the Democrats win, the way I did when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2020/nov/07/hes-done-it-joe-biden-victory-celebrations-in-pictures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Biden won in 2020</a>? Totally‚Äìnot out of genuine excitement for the candidates, but to share in the relief and joy of four years that will hopefully be less bad, or at least an importantly different kind of bad, than they might otherwise have been. Am I going to wear a Harris/Walz pin, or hang a flag, or give money to their campaign? No.</p><p>The roughly three-hour <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is876dF_-Ds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‚ÄúGeeks and Nerds‚Äù livestream</a>, which initially involved registration but ultimately moved to YouTube, featured a range of famous <a href="https://geeksforharris.org/schedule" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guests</a> from sci-fi, fantasy, and superhero media, as well as journalists and politicians. The fundraising aspect was set up as a competition between ‚ÄúEarth Heroes,‚Äù for the cast and fans of shows like <em>Supernatural </em>and <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-boys-season-4-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Boys</em></a>, and ‚ÄúSpace Explorers,‚Äù for folks from and into things like <em>Star Trek</em>, as well as actual astronauts. The competition aspect of the fundraising was mostly contained to occasional donation updates on-stream, and some speakers, such as <em>The Boys</em> and <em>Supernatural</em> casts, matching viewer donations of their team. The idea of competition seemed to work to generate excitement, with the event raising $500,000 dollars for the campaign. Outside of the idea of teams, Wheatus performed ‚ÄúTeenage Dirtbag.‚Äù Andy Merrill from <em>The Brak Show</em> and <em>Space Ghost</em> sang a song on a neat-looking <a href="https://aftermath.site/learning-new-stuff-as-an-adult-rules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ukulele</a>. Bill Nye talked about science. Lynda Carter showed <em>The Boys </em>cast how her old-school Wonder Woman bracelets worked. There was <a href="https://www.vox.com/22893634/marvel-post-credits-scene-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even</a> a post-credits scene.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The cast of "The Boys"</figcaption></figure><p>I was earnestly moved by the excitement in the chat, where many viewers identified themselves as ‚Äúblue dots‚Äù in red states, eager to be in a space with other people who shared both their politics and interests. The viewership topped out at around 25,000 people, who filled the chat with blue hearts, <a href="https://abc7news.com/what-is-a-blue-wave-will-there-be-2018-election-kamala-harris/4550049/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waves</a>, and rainbows. Unlike Harris‚Äô first Twitch stream in <a href="https://aftermath.site/kamala-harris-twitch-stream-dnc-palestine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August</a>, I didn‚Äôt notice any Palestine flags, but the chat was moving intensely quickly. I only noticed one possible troll, with someone promoting Trump in chat toward the end.&nbsp;</p><p>In her opening speech, Carter cringingly called Harris a ‚Äúcelestial badass ready to navigate us through the space debris of division‚Äù and praised Walz for his ‚Äúdemeanor cooler than a Martian winter,‚Äù but after that I was honestly surprised at how serious the event turned out to be. In opening remarks by Representative <a href="https://robertgarcia.house.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Garcia</a>, Garcia claimed that ‚ÄúAs geeks and nerds, we naturally are progressive people‚Ä¶ We meet someone who likes the [<em>Star Wars</em>] Rebel Alliance but they‚Äôre voting for Trump. Maybe they don‚Äôt understand comics and why social justice and social justice movements have always been a part of our community.‚Äù This idea was taken further in a presentation by academics Tanya Cook and Kaela Joseph discussing their <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/710912/fandom-acts-of-kindness-by-tanya-cook-and-kaela-joseph/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book</a> on ‚Äúfan activism,‚Äù which they described as ‚Äúactivism that uses the superpowers of fandom and community to make the world a better place.‚Äù They discussed the idea of fandoms as being rooted in enthusiasm and kindness, and called out activism such as charity fundraisers already going on in the fan space. A later presentation including Jacqueline Emerson from <em>The Hunger Games</em> talked about campaigning as an introvert, which while maybe a bit of a stereotype was also pretty useful.&nbsp;</p><p>Other segments highlighted the political aspects of certain fandoms. Anthony Rapp from <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em> noted the series‚Äô progressive roots and highlighted queer representation, and <em>Voyager</em>‚Äôs Tim Russ highlighted the series‚Äô connection to current labor movements. George Takei called<a href="https://gamerant.com/star-trek-why-was-original-series-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> fans rallying</a> to keep the original <em>Star Trek </em>from being cancelled after its second season ‚Äúactivism‚Äù and said, ‚ÄúAmerica cannot afford another Trump presidency. So it‚Äôs time for our fans to step up again and vote blue up and down the ballot.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôd call these the same types of ‚Äúactivism,‚Äù or that I‚Äôd trumpet ‚Äúvoting blue,‚Äù but I get what he was going for.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Star Trek actors</figcaption></figure><p>I was prepared for the event to basically <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>-ify politics, but overall I was impressed at how largely elegant and, well, <em>normal</em> the connections were. Besides a few tortured analogies, it mostly focused on helping viewers see how their media of choice had political themes, or how they could leverage their passion and fan practices toward politics. It acknowledged fandoms and fans‚Äô enthusiasm without talking down to them. The word ‚Äújoy‚Äù came up frequently, and though the event lacked the natural relatability and chill of <a href="https://kotaku.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-streams-on-twitch-with-hasan-p-1845431479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AOC‚Äôs <em>Among Us</em> Twitch stream</a> in 2020, it did a mostly good job not pigeon-holing or stereotyping fans or giving fan identities outsized importance on the political stage.&nbsp;</p><p>It also stood in sharp comparison to Trump‚Äôs outreach via <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-adin-ross-donald-trump-kick-stream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">streamers on Kick</a>, with less ‚Äúnotice me, senpai‚Äù energy but still keeping the focus on the candidates, and obviously with very different political messages. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/09/25/harris-campaign-ign-ads-nerds-for-harris/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Washington Post</a>, writing about news today that the Harris campaign will be advertising on IGN, says ‚Äúthe Trump campaign said Wednesday that the Democratic candidate needs to pay to reach these [gaming] audiences, while enthusiasm for Trump within gaming communities is organic.‚Äù I‚Äôd argue both parties‚Äô outreach efforts feel forced; both feel like they‚Äôre seeking to capitalize on polarized aspects of these scenes. But the narratives of ‚Äúnerd‚Äù media truck in this polarization, and it also reflects the polarization around the political parties in society more broadly. You could argue they‚Äôre doing the same thing from opposite ends, though that in no way makes their positions comparable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It‚Äôs interesting to me that both parties see gamers, nerds, and geeks as a voting bloc worth courting. Carter told <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/lynda-carter-interview-geeks-and-nerds-for-harris-election-event-1236097608/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a> prior to the event, ‚ÄúThe way I feel about it is that we are bringing in people whose voices have not been heard in this [campaign] at least it feels like anyway, they haven‚Äôt been heard in this way.‚Äù But beyond the ‚ÄúGeeks and Nerds‚Äù viewers who identified themselves as political minorities in their home states, what makes them a political identity that hasn‚Äôt been heard in the campaign? Do geeks and nerds have specific political needs? I‚Äôm inherently suspicious of the idea of ‚Äúgeek,‚Äù or for that matter ‚Äúgamer,‚Äù as an identity marker; in my experience, I‚Äôve mostly seen it wielded in the negative, used to justify <a href="https://aftermath.site/sweet-baby-detected-conspiracy-theory-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">harassment</a> or patrol the borders of an interest. There‚Äôs value in taking that back, and highlighting the liberal or progressive themes in media as a contrast to those who would <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-star-wars-controversy-ratings-this-is-all-terrible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claim the opposite</a>, as well as helping people see how the things they appreciate in their media have corollaries in the real world. But <em>politicizing</em> an identity doesn‚Äôt make it a <em>political</em> one.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The cast of Supernatural, and also Cory Booker</figcaption></figure><p>I‚Äôm also leery of claiming a fandom as an identity because I worry it pegs people‚Äôs power and energy to something outside themselves, to work that may be <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-cancelled-star-wars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made by artists who share similarities with their fans</a> but is ultimately owned and controlled by corporations and their money. It‚Äôs the same suspicion I bring to conversations about queer and trans representation in <a href="https://www.out.com/film/2022/3/22/disneys-first-out-lgbtq-gay-characters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney</a> or <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2020-03-25/steven-universe-rebecca-sugar-lgbtq-legacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">children‚Äôs TV</a> or <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-have-mixed-feelings-about-the-last-of-us-part-2s-tran-1844245756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video games</a>: that it can lead to a certain waiting for recognition from a system that my own politics‚Äìrooted in the radical queer and trans movements of a <a href="https://aftermath.site/lego-fortnite-cat-enters-his-queer-elder-era" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more confrontational</a>, less accepting time‚Äìsay can never fully be trusted. I won‚Äôt deny the value of seeing yourself in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-67635601" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Doctor Who</em></a><em> </em>or <a href="https://trekcentral.net/transgender-representation-in-star-trek/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Star Trek</em></a> (I say this as someone with a <em>Doctor Who </em>tattoo), but these will never take the place, to me, of work made without the intermediary of the predominantly cis and straight people who ultimately pull the strings. By identifying people as ‚Äúfans,‚Äù and then leveraging that fandom into being a ‚Äúfan‚Äù for Harris/Walz, this framing runs the risk of just funnelling power upward. We‚Äôve seen Trump <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/ubnow/stories/2018/03/gabriel-trump-reality-tv.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leverage this</a> for his own ends; surely the Harris campaign wants to do the same.</p><p>But this is also how electoral politics work. The presenters in ‚ÄúGeeks and Nerds for Harris‚Äù whipping up the world-changing power and importance of their candidates are, at its core, giving away their power to someone else, someone who will never actually, fully have their best interests at heart. Perhaps the event‚Äôs audience is already inherently primed for such a transfer through the nature of fandom, in ways that aren‚Äôt necessarily positive. At the same time, this focus doesn‚Äôt stop people from getting more directly involved in politics, and could also be a good way to inspire people into more hands-on local action. My own political beliefs have shifted enough over the years to recognize that, however much electoral politics go against the ways I think the world should be structured, they are a space where a hugely consequential battle is currently being fought. The money and energies of our politics, however they overlap with the energies of our other interests, are <em>not</em> best used in service of people running for president, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I should pretend all that doesn‚Äôt exist.</p><p>Maybe the event‚Äôs main value, beyond raising money for the campaign that it will hopefully use in battleground states, lay in making space for people in the chat to be together, especially those who feel isolated. That‚Äôs something fandom has always been good at, though that‚Äôs been used for both positive and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/11/05/660642531/right-wing-hate-groups-are-recruiting-video-gamers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">negative</a> ends. Creating a campaign event that felt fun and positive has value, as does any kind of pushback to the hateful and conservative narratives running rampant in ‚Äúnerd‚Äù spaces, even if the nature of the event means it was preaching to the choir. If ‚ÄúGeeks and Nerds for Harris‚Äù served as a place for people to feel energetic and empowered about getting involved, and as a stepping stone for other ways they can effect change in addition to voting, that‚Äôs ultimately a good thing.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sucker-punch-planning-other-spin-offs-beyond-ghost-of-yotei/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/arts/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sequel-playstation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with New York Times</a>, Creative Directors Nate Fox and Jason Connell said that they are planning on other spin-off projects past Ghost of Yotei, which was only announced just yesterday during <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sequel-ghost-of-yotei-showcased-at-state-of-play/">Sony's State of Play</a>. Both Fox and Connell were the Creative Directors for Ghost of Tsushima, and will be reprising their roles for Ghost of Yotei, saying that the announcement of this new title changes Tsushima from a standalone game to the start of a franchise.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Y≈çtei - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7z7kqwuf0a8?start=2&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A Ghost of Tsushima movie is currently in the works, with the movie set to be directed by Chad Stahleski, who was the director for the John Wick movies, as well as being a stunt man in movies such as The Matrix and Van-Helsing, for example.</p>
<p>Speaking to New York Times, Nate Fox explained the process for how they began developing a sequel. "When we started working on a sequel, the first question we asked ourselves was, 'What is the DNA of a Ghost game? It's about transporting the player to the romance and beauty of feudal Japan."</p>
<p>As seen in the trailer, the game's inspiration came from the stunning area of Mount Yotei, which is in current day Hokkaido. To make sure they were doing the region justice, some of the team visited the mountain and the surrounding area so that they could get more inspiration.</p>
<p>For some of the audio, they visited Shiretoko National Park in the northeastern part of Hokkaido and recorded some sounds for the audio team. "Being in this incredibly beautiful park with jagged cliffs and water, yet all the time being aware there were dangerous bears, was electrifying. We strive to bring that into the video game- that feeling of danger."</p>
<p>There are plenty of areas in Japanese history that could provide inspiration for a sequel to Ghost of Yotei, but for now, the audience will have to wait and see what comes of Ghost of Yotei. At the moment, the game doesn't have a specified release date and is shaping up to be a PlayStation 5 exclusive, the same way Ghost of Tsushima was originally when it was first released. However, it's possible that they may put Ghost of Yotei on PC as well from the get-go or do a similar process where they release it a couple of years later in the remastered version of the game.</p>
<p>As it is, Ghost of Yotei takes place 300 years after Ghost of Tsushima, taking players into the Sengoku era of Japan.</p>

This one isn't <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ttrpgs-for-trans-rights-bundle-now-on-sale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">promoting trans rights</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/rpgs-for-reproductive-justice-bundle-now-on-sale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">women's reproductive rights</a>, but to help the blind or visually challenged player have a seat at the table. It is the TTRPGs for Accessibility in Gaming bundle.</p>

<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.rascal.news/ttrpgs-for-accessible-gaming-charity-bundle-launches/">Rascal News</a>, the TTRPGs for Accessibility in Gaming bundle is being launched to support the <a href="https://www.dotsrpg.org/">DOTS RPG Project</a>. They are a non-profit organization known for their Signature Braille Dice, metal and acryllic polyhedral dice designed for blind or visually impaired players.</p>
<p>The proceeds from the TTRPGs for Accessibility in Gaming Bundle will help fund mass production of these braille dice. Instead of having to order a set from a small website, you can just grab a set at your local game store. The manufacturing will be done in partnership with Die Hard Dice, a company known for bespoke dice and dice accessories.</p>

By paying $10, you'll buy a bundle worth $965.</p>
<p>The material in the TTRPGs for Accessibility in Gaming Bundle is a diverse mix of independent talent.</p>
<p>Notable inclusions are <em>Inspirisles</em>, the magic TTRPG that teaches sign language, several cyberpunk RPGs like <em>Chrome//Knuckles</em>, <em>Neon Lights</em>, solo games like <em>Rage in Hell</em>, <em>Solo Orbits</em>, <em>The Narrator Paradox</em>, and <em>Fresh Blood</em>, and thoughtful experiences like <em>Ghost-fi</em>, <em>Afterparty</em>, and <em>This Game Is A Message</em>.</p>
<p>In addition, the bundle contains supplements and adventures for other RPGs. There are <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/cyborg-is-possibly-best-cyberpunk-ttprg-ever" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CY_BORG</a> supplements like <em>Too Fast To Live, Too Young To Die, </em>a Doctor Who hack for the game Lasers and Feelings titled Love and Monsters, and a <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank">D&amp;D</a> </em>Monk subclass called <em>Way of the Hidden Realm</em>.</p>
<p>At time of writing, the TTRPGs for Accessibility in Gaming Bundle has raised $20,672, which is short of its funding goal of $35,000. The bundle will be available until October 21.</p>

<p>Ed enjoyed the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/drive-rally-blends-wrc-seriousness-with-arcade-cheer">demo earlier this year</a>, and having briefly played this Early Access release I second his comments about the handling. It's forgiving, with every car I tried having a considerable amount of grip and a short brake distance. It's nice to press the accelerator and not immediately wrap every car around a tree.
</p>
<p>This first release already contains plenty of environments to drive around - forest, swamp, slippy slidey ice world, desert - and each one is a large expanse that can then be carved into multiple tracks. Nature tourism is one of the biggest draws of rally racing to me, and I hope at least one of these tracks has a mountain I can fall off.
</p>
<p>The developers say they hope to keep Drive Rally in Early Access for a year, with new content and balance adjustments made based on feedback. "This includes the addition of new cars to expand our garage, new maps and tracks to race on, new Co-Pilots to drive with, and additional car customization parts and items," according to the Steam page. Based on my short time with it, co-pilots definitely need some work. They're a throwback to the '90s in multiple ways in that the advice they give you is borderline unhelpful and they occassionally chime in with some mean comment about your driving delivered in a stereotypical accent of some sort. 
</p>
<p>If you fancy checking out its blocky, cel-shaded cars for yourself, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2494780/DRIVE_Rally/">it's available from Steam now</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/batman-arkham-shadow-gameplay-and-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">knowing it was coming</a> in October for months, there‚Äôs finally an official release date for Batman: Arkham Shadow. Meta and developer Camouflaj have announced that the game will release on Tuesday, October 22.</p>



<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the Fourth of July, and Gotham City is under attack by a new threat: the mysterious Rat King and his cultish devotees,‚Äù the game‚Äôs description reads. ‚ÄúAs widespread rioting engulfs the city, Batman races to prevent this so-called ‚ÄúDay of Wrath‚Äù before it all goes wrong.‚Äù</p>



<p>The new game is part of the ‚ÄúArkhamverse‚Äù that was developed by Rocksteady‚Äôs previous Batman games. This game, however, is set before the events of Batman: Arkham Asylum. The game will feature classic villains like Scarecrow, Two-Face, and Harley Quinn.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/38974589_2867020580132409_5823899669027287741_n.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Batman: Arkham Shadow will be available exclusively on Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S VR headsets.  As far as a price goes, that has yet to be revealed. Right now you can only wish list the game on the <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/batman-arkham-shadow/3551691271620960/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Meta Quest Store</a>. </p>



<p>It‚Äôs also worth noting that while you‚Äôll need an internet connection to download the game, the game‚Äôs store page says no internet connection is required to play it.</p>



<p>Are you going to give Batman: Arkham Shadow a try now that we know its release date is October 22? Join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/420/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

			<p>Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQs3LRIVEyE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checked out</a> the upcoming PS5 Pro console at a recent preview event and came back with an hour-long video to discuss their first impressions (with some excerpts of game developer interviews sprinkled in) and show off some new footage from various games.</p>
<p><em><strong>F1 24: </strong>Besides <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-24-unveils-track-and-driver-updates-talks-raytraced-ddgi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DDGI</a> (Dynamic Diffuse Global Illumination), Codemasters has added three ray-traced effects for ambient occlusion, transparency, and opaque reflections. Moreover, anisotropic filtering has improved. According to DF's Oliver Mackenzie, these additions translate almost into a generational leap in visuals in some instances. However, image stability in this RT mode isn't as stable as in the base PS5 Quality mode, probably due to a combination of PSSR and the noise caused by the ray-traced effects. PSSR will be added to other modes in the future.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Gran Turismo 7:</strong> Polyphony Digital's latest game offers two PS5 Pro modes. One, as mentioned in the other report <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-launch-games-get-detailed-specs-and-enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted earlier today</a>, adds real-time ray-traced reflections during races. However, GT7 has a more limited ray tracing implementation than F1 24, with off-track elements and even some on-track elements not being factored in the reflections. Image quality and stability also suffer a bit in this RT mode compared to the base PS5. For those players who aren't interested in the ray-traced reflections, there is an image quality priority mode that uses PSSR and looks very clean in comparison.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Horizon Forbidden West:</strong> This one is interesting. Guerrilla Games confirmed that it uses a new anti-aliasing reconstruction technique originally developed for future games but was then ported back to the second installment in the Horizon series. It's not PSSR or checkerboard, but Digital Foundry was very impressed as it looked way more detailed and stable than the previous solution included with the game. There will be a Quality mode that renders more often at 4K or near-4K resolution, but the developers really believe PS5 Pro players should rather use the new Performance mode since it looks extremely good already.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Hogwarts Legacy:</strong> The Fidelity RT mode will offer vastly improved ray-traced shadows and reflections on PS5 Pro compared to the base PS5, with reflections using doubled resolution. The developers credited this to the console's BVH management, which is much faster than the PlayStation 5's and allows them to 'collect' objects from much further out. Avalanche Software also confirmed to have switched to PSSR for all modes (they were previously using Unreal Engine 4's TAA).</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart:</strong> According to Digital Foundry, in Marvel's Spider-Man 2, PSSR in the Performance Pro mode looks 'different' compared to the Quality mode from the PS5 version, resolving some details better and others not as well. Of course, that's while running at twice the frame rate. Insomniac said they plan to further improve the Quality Pro mode, hinting at potentially adding some ray tracing techniques that would take advantage of the PS5 Pro's much-improved ray tracing capabilities. They also confirmed to have removed a sharpening filter that was previously applied to their anti-aliasing reconstruction technique, since it is not needed with PSSR anymore. As for Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, image quality and PSSR hold better than Marvel's Spider-Man 2, possibly due to the less intensive load.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>The Last of Us Part II Remastered:</strong> PSSR once again appears to resolve a lot more details than the blurry TAA used in the base PS5. However, it also has worse image stability, and the depth of field isn't working correctly in some cases.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth:</strong> In many ways, this is the poster child for the PS5 Pro since the PlayStation 5 console delivered profoundly disappointing image quality in the Performance mode. The details are much higher on the PlayStation 5 Pro. However, DF again noted some stability issues, and the Level of Detail (LOD) drawbacks haven't been improved.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em><strong>The Crew Motorfest:</strong> This is another game where the Performance mode sees a big detail improvement thanks to PSSR. The developers are also porting some of the higher settings from the PS5's Quality mode.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Demon's Souls:</strong> While still an incredible-looking game despite being a PS5 launch title, the PS5 Pro makes it even better by allowing a higher resolution and introducing contact shadows.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Dragon's Dogma 2:</strong> PSSR looks a lot better than the old checkerboard solution, but it does seem to have some issues in this game with RTGI. Overall, though, the game ran much faster on PS5 Pro, reaching around 50 frames per second in the notoriously troublesome city scenarios.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="PlayStation 5 Pro Hands-On: 11 Games Tested, PSSR and RT Upgrades Revealed, Developers Interviewed!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JQs3LRIVEyE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To round up the preview, Digital Foundry said that multiple developers hinted at PSSR having improved over time, and they expect the same will occur in the future. It makes sense, being a machine learning technique. As for the elephant in the room (whether the PS5 Pro is worth the $699 price Sony is asking), they said its improvements will matter more to users interested in playing games at 60 or higher frames per second.</p>

That means there are now 10 levels in the strategy game, with the campaign taking most players 8-12 hours, per Grizzly Games. This update also offers new equipment and quality-of-life improvements.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the campaign, there is a roguelike mode in Thronefall, too. The game sees players building their bases and armies during the day and then taking on hordes of enemies at nightfall. Grizzly notes that players can also charge into the conflicts themselves, if they so wish. Successfully surviving the darkness and baddies leads to the ability to pick out new weapons and perks.</p><p dir="ltr">Before Thronefall, Grizzly previously worked on Superflight and Islanders. The latter surprise-launched on Switch back in 2021 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/axiom-verge-2-surprise-releases-on-switch-today-alongside-six-other-games/1100-6495049/" data-ref-id="1100-6495049">alongside Axiom Verge 2 after a Nintendo Indie World stream</a>.</p>
