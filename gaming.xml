		<p>Valve has released details and content for Deadlock with the major new update called Old Gods, New Blood bringing with is a new 4v4 Street Brawl mode, new bosses and patrons that fall into the camps of the Hidden King and Archmother, and lots of updates. There are also six new heroes coming to Deadlock with two released per week, with the release order determined by community votes.&nbsp;The six new heroes have just three phrases to describe each of them, and they are as follows:</p>

		
		

<ul>
<li>Silver – Feral, Hot Mess, Transformation</li>
<li>Rem – Tiny, Helpful, Zzz</li>
<li>Graves – Morbid, Aerial Denial, Necromancer</li>
<li>Celeste – Performer, Disruptive, Dazzling</li>
<li>Venator – Devout, Arms Expert, Tactical</li>
<li>Apollo – Finesse, Mobility, A Cut Above</li>
</ul>
<p>The new Street Brawl mode is a fast paced 4v4 mode where players duke it out in a best of five format with rounds just taking a couple of minutes. At the start of the match, players can pick three random items to add to their inventory, and everyone starts each round on the same level with no farming. The post game screen and MVP system have also been updated so it is easier to get the information you want. Valve has also looked at additional UI and settings improvements which include:</p>


<ul>
<li>Reactive Portraits – Your hero portrait changes based on how you are doing in game.</li>
<li>Kill Streaks – Show off your hot streak</li>
<li>Chat – Various chat visual improvements and updated ally vs. enemy chat styles.</li>

<li>Mid Boss Timer – Keep track of when Mid Boss will spawn next directly on the minimap.</li>
<li>Random Hero Button</li>
<li>Rejuv Duration Time – More easily track the rejuv timer before it expires.</li>
<li>Visibility Outlines – Improved readability for players and structures during gameplay.</li>
<li>Hole Punch View – A new Camera Hole Punch system reduces the amount of unexpected camera movement when running in front of obstructions. The camera will peer through the objects instead of pushing toward the player character.</li>
<li>Neutrals Near Walls – Jungle camps now glow through walls when you are in close proximity, to help aid in navigation.</li>
<li>Settings Search – Quickly find and update the setting you are looking for on the fly.</li>
<li>Custom Reticle Control – New custom reticle editor with live-preview to help you find the perfect crosshair.</li>
<li>FOV Slider – Instead of a single legacy FOV option, you can now adjust the camera more gradually.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you have even more changes outside of the UI and settings including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two new items to use
<ul>
<li>Ballistic Enchantment – Imbue an ability with increased range. Dealing damage with that ability grants you increased weapon damage per target hit.</li>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/my-lara-croft-is-not-a-sex-bombshell-says-sophie-turner/</link>
            <guid>1414036</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Just over a week ago, <strong>Amazon</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-sophie-turner-lara-croft-tomb-raider-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared with <strong>Tomb Raider</strong> fans a first look at <strong>Sophie Turner</strong></a> as <strong>Lara Croft</strong> in the upcoming TV series adaptation, which recently started principal photography.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2026-01-21/sophie-turner-steal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during an interview with the LA Times</a> for another Prime Video show (<strong>Steal</strong>, a six-episode limited series available now for streaming), Turner spoke a little about her version of the beloved English adventurer and archeologist. She clarified that she and the showrunners are focusing on her extraordinary skill set rather than her sexy appearance, unlike previous games and even the movies starring Angelina Jolie, which didn't shy away from it. </p>



<p><em>My Lara is not a sex bombshell. It's about her and her story and what drives her, rather than what so many people also love about her, which is how hot she is in the games and the movies. But I really want to show the other side. She’s so unashamedly capable. She is not a woman who hides her strengths at all.</em></p>



<p>Interestingly, the actress, who got her breakthrough role as <strong>Sansa Stark</strong> in <strong>Game of Thrones</strong> and was also a main character (<strong>Jean Grey</strong>) in <strong>X-Men's Dark Phoenix</strong>, says she never trained as hard for any role as she did for Lara Croft's upcoming Tomb Raider TV series. </p>



<p><em>I now really feel like I could protect them [<strong>Editor’s Note: she's referring to her kids</strong>]. As a mum, I come up with scenarios in my head, and I’m like, ‘OK, if a man jumped out of here, what would I do?’ And it’s always like, ‘I just pick the kids up and run. But now it’s changed. My instinct would be to deck him in the face.</em></p>



<p><em>I’ve never had to train for anything like this before. In ‘X-Men’, we had to be in good shape, but my character was telekinetic, so I didn’t need to do much. I didn’t realize I could push my body that far. I feel like I’ve achieved something even before we’ve started shooting.</em></p>



<p>Truthfully, even the most recent Tomb Raider reboot trilogy started moving away from Lara Croft's previously inherent sexiness. We'll see if that continues with the next game iteration, <strong>Tomb Raider: Catalyst</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-2026-tomb-raider-catalyst-new-entry-in-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in development at <strong>Crystal Dynamics</strong> and scheduled to launch in <strong>2027</strong></a>.</p>

            <p>The CWA-backed United Video Games union has written to the US Federal Trade Commission in opposition to the proposed acquisition of EA by private investors, including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and various investment firms.</p>
<p>The letter, published on Action Network, lays out the case against the acquisition, stating that EA is not "a struggling company", and any jobs lost as a result of the sale would be: " a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors pockets -- not to strengthen the company."</p>
<p>They conclude the letter with a call for members of the US public to sign an accompanying petition, and to a request to members of the Federal Trade Commission who could potentially halt the deal, writing: "We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinize this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, and preserves creative freedom."</p>

<p>Last December,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-shareholders-approve-saudi-arabian-buyout-leaving-only-the-us-government-able-to-block-the-deal"> EA shareholders approved the proposed deal for private investors to buy the company</a>. This left only US institutions like the Federal Trade Commission able to slow the deal down or block it. If approved, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-almost-entirely-owned-by-saudi-arabia-sale">EA will be almost entirely owned by the government wealth fund of Saudi Arabia</a>, a country that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-takeover-the-saudi-arabian-public-investment-fund-and-vanity-mega-projects-human-rights-watch-assesses-the-impact-of-gamings-latest-controversy">has been criticised due to its history of human rights violations</a>.</p><p>How likely is it that the US would block such a deal? Well, while some members of the government have criticised the deal, the Financial Times reported it will likely face little pushback <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-private-acquisition-deal-expected-to-go-smoothly-says-report-as-what-regulator-is-going-to-say-no-to-the-presidents-son-in-law">due to the involvement of the current president's Son-in-Law Jared Kushner</a>.</p>

<p>The upcoming Fable reboot is in ‘consideration’ for the Nintendo Switch 2, according to an Xbox insider. </p>



<p>Playground Games’ Fable finally received some gameplay <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fable-release-window-announced-at-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yesterday at Xbox’s Developer Direct</a>, along with a concrete release window. The title is releasing for Xbox Series X/S and PC, as well as the PlayStation 5, on release day. It seems developers may have another platform in mind, but it isn’t 100% confirmed yet. </p>







<h2 id="h-fable-on-switch-2-isn-t-100-but-there-s-a-chance">Fable on Switch 2 isn’t 100%, But There’s a Chance</h2>



<p>The claim about Fable being discussed for the Switch 2 comes from reliable insider Jez Corden. According to his recent post on <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2014463781250777444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the release “isn’t 100% definite for now, but under consideration for the future.” In one of the replies, Corden also added that currently, the decision is in “logistics” today, and the port is not in development right now. However, he speculates that the port will come through. </p>



<p>Playground Games has also spoken about how it is retaining Fable’s true spirit while adding much more player freedom. The three core pillars of the upcoming title are “Freedom,” “Fairytale,” and “Britishness,” and they establish Fable’s DNA. The developers also spoke about transferable skills from working on the Horizon series, with their expertise in open-world games among the biggest. Check out all the details from the developer interview <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playground-games-founder-on-preserving-fables-true-spirit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>







<p>In other news, the upcoming Fable reboot will unfortunately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/theres-no-dog-companion-in-new-fable-and-even-devs-are-upset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not have a dog companion</a>. Additionally, the game’s new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playground-games-explains-fables-new-reputation-based-morality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reputation-based morality system</a> will reflect our own world.

            <p>A new major update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a> suddenly dropped, bringing six new characters that will join the roster gradually, a new game mode, and various quality-of-life tweaks to the popular MOBA.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most notable addition in this update, dubbed Old Gods New Blood, is a faster-paced game mode called Street Brawl. A quick 4v4 alternative, the shopping system is streamlined down to a random selection each round. In addition resources are equalised across all players, with farming disabled.</p>
<p>The patrons have been given a proper redesign too, as do their minions, finally giving each team's endboss the makeover they've been sorely lacking. They are the Hidden King and the Archmother, two polar opposites with their own thematic arena.</p>

</figure>
<p>Then there's the six new characters. These are Silver, Rem, Graves, Apollo, Celeste, and Venator. Two of them will release per-week, with the first two hitting the game starting the 26th January. Players can vote to determine the release order, with votes earned by playing the game.</p><p>Once the heroes are out, a priority token system will be rolled out to help Deadlock players get an opportunity to try these newcomers out. There are also going to be in-game sprays for each newcomer available, so you can promote your vote in live matches. Pretty cool!</p>
<p>As for those quality-of-life changes, there are some absolute scorchers coming. A revamped post-game screen is on the way, alongside an adjustment to how the MVP is determined. More detailed post-game stats screens will help break down your performance, and UI overhauls are aiming to improve visibility and ease of play.</p>
<p>There's also a massive rework to the in-game settings, and ongoing map updates. You can read <a href="https://www.playdeadlock.com/oldgods">a full breakdown of all the changes and additions on the Deadlock website</a>.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, the Deadlock community anticipated some big news would be dropping overnight, <a href="https://x.com/IntelDeadlock/status/2014435973485002770">thanks to a surge in activity at local pizza spots by the Valve office</a>. Much like the pentagon, it seems when the pizzas are rolling fresh and fast near Valve, something's afoot.</p>

<p>On the hardware side of things, Nintendo systems take up the full podium this time, with the Switch Lite and OLED joining the Switch 2 at the top of the standings. As you might expect from the software numbers, console sales haven't been massive this time, but hey, that's the post-holiday blues.</p>
<p>Combining the three Switch 1 SKUs for the week gives us 27,234 sales, while the trio of PS5 models comes in at 9,983.</p>

            <guid>1414006</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has revealed a new physical product, making the Talking Flower from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/super-mario-bros-wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> into something you can plonk on your sidetable and have quip away at you all day, every day (unless you tell it to stop).</p>
<p>Launching on 12th March, the Talking Flower is now available to pre-order from Nintendo and retail partners, priced at £24.99 / $34.99.</p>
<p><iframe title="Talking Flower – Coming March 12th" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NlPHrDkoukM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Talking Flower will spout out somewhat random quips throughout the day, set by default to say something ever 30 minutes, and able to be manually triggered with a press of the Talk Button. It’s just about smart enough to be able to announce the hour (but will sometimes get it wrong and then correct itself, which is actually marginally more intelligent than the self-assured ChatGPT). It can also comment on the time of day and temperature, and will sometimes play background music from the game (you can then mash the Talk Button and it’ll shout and yelp to match the music).</p>
<p>Thankfully, you can get it to shut up. Hold the Talk Button for two seconds and it will halt its chit chat, and you can set a sleep schedule so that it doesn’t disturb you. It also has support for English, German, French, Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Dutch, Portuguese (Brazil), Japanese, Chinese and Korean localisation.</p>

<p>It’s another thoroughly odd little bit of Nintendo merch, to go alongside their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/09/nintendo-alarmo-is-an-alarm-clock-and-not-switch-2/">Alarmo alarm clock</a> from a couple years ago.</p>
<p>Chances are most people will stick with just playing the game. Super Mario Bros. Wonder was a real highlight for the Nintendo Switch, bringing a renewed sense of fun and imagination to the 2D side-scrolling platformer, and Nintendo are now expanding it for Nintendo Switch 2 with a Switch 2 Edition and Bellabel Park add-on. They just delved into the various multiplayer modes and added challenges that will be making their way into the game on Switch 2 when it launches in March, and you can <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/22/super-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2-edition-arrives-in-march-with-playable-rosalina-more/">read all about that here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“We Nicked It From The Office”: Fable Lead Confirms In-Game Mockumentary Style]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/fable-lead-confirms-mockumentary-style-is-in-the-game/</link>
            <guid>1414003</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>There's no doubt that most of the curiosity surrounding the <strong>Xbox Developer Direct 2026</strong> was directed at <strong>Fable</strong>. Sure, <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong> is massively anticipated on the heels of the excellent previous game, but it's mostly a known quantity. Fable, on the other hand, has been missing for over fifteen years, and it's now being rebooted by a new developer, <strong>Playground Games</strong>. </p>



<p>The presentation <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-launches-autumn-2026-amazingly-faithful/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was very promising</a></strong>. As I noted in my article, it appears that the developers have successfully retained most of the spirit and gameplay features that made the original trilogy unique. However, there's still a lot we have to discover about the game. A fresh interview with Game Director <strong>Ralph Fulton</strong>, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/fable-interview-overview-details-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on the Xbox Wire blog</a>, helps with that. In the interview, Fulton mentions that Fable will feature a 'sensational cast of characters', although it's too early to unveil who will be playing them, except for <strong>Richard Ayoade</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-first-gameplay-xbox-games-showcase-richard-ayoade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who was revealed nearly three years ago as Dave</a>. </p>



<p>Then, Fulton went through the studio's inspirations to get that British humour right. <strong>Ricky Gervais's The Office</strong> was apparently the main inspiration, but not only for the tone: the show's trademark <strong>mockumentary style</strong> wasn't just reserved for the trailers; it will actually be found in the game.</p>



<p><em>We were inspired by the incredibly rich variety of British comedies that have been around over the last 20 years like ‘Peep Show,’ ‘The IT Crowd’ and so many others. We started with ‘The Office’, which again started out as quintessentially British, but also travels really, really well. Not just that IP, but a lot of the techniques and the devices that it’s popularized, you know. It’s that really grounded, awkward style of humour which really appeals to us. And the actors who have been in a lot of these shows – and indeed some of whom are in our game – they’re known all over the world.</em></p>



<p><em>The other cool thing about The Office is something we’ve kind of nicked. You’ve maybe seen in our trailers that we have a sort of mockumentary interview style. I think a lot of people assume we just did that for those trailers, but it’s actually a device we use throughout the game. I’ve never seen it in games before, but it allows you a way to really neatly tell a joke or drop a little bit of character detail in a way that would feel really clunky in a dialogue, but suddenly feels entirely natural when you do it to ‘camera’.</em></p>



<p>To be honest, I'm not too thrilled about this. While the mockumentary style made perfect sense for The Office, I'm not sure it will work just as well in a game like Fable. Sure, the British humour was always part of the series, but that and the mockumentary style are quite two different things. <strong>I'm not sure delivering lines to 'camera' makes sense when you're supposed to be feeling immersed in the fantasy world of Albion</strong>.</p>



<p>That said, as I wrote earlier, <strong>everything else about Playground's game looks spot on</strong>, so perhaps this will only be a minor annoyance - and perhaps it might even be fun from time to time. It won't be too long until we find out: now we know that Fable will be released in Autumn for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X. If I were Microsoft and Playground, though, <strong>I'd make sure to release well before Grand Theft Auto VI</strong>, which is currently set for November 19, 2026.</p>



<p>As a side note, the game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just won Wccftech's most anticipated roleplaying game of 2026 category award</a></strong> from both staff and community.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, <strong>Koei Tecmo</strong> unveiled new <strong>Nioh 3</strong> footage in a 17.5-minute gameplay showcase. As you know if you've read <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nioh-3-everything-we-know-about-team-ninjas-supernatural-action-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our roundup article on the game</a></strong>, Nioh 3 actually takes place across multiple time periods, including the early <strong>Edo</strong> period, the <strong>Sengoku</strong> period, the <strong>Heian</strong> period, and the <strong>Bakumatsu</strong> period. </p>



<p>Today's gameplay showcase begins in the second one, also known as the <strong>Warring States</strong> period. In the game's version of the era, the <strong>Yōkai</strong> (demons) freely roam the land, and a horrifying realm known as the <strong>Crucible</strong> has manifested. The player explores a large, open field while seeking a way to the Crucible. </p>



<p>The protagonist, the historical figure <strong>Tokugawa Takechiyo </strong>(Iemitsu), <strong>can switch between the classic samurai style and the new ninja style at any time during combat</strong>. Switching is particularly useful whenever there's a need to adapt to certain enemies and situations, or simply to shift to the player's preferred play style.</p>



<p>Samurai mode lets Tokugawa confront enemies head-on, utilizing martial arts and deflecting attacks while switching between stances to unleash a variety of strikes. On the other hand, Ninja style aims to outmaneuver enemies with <strong>Ninjutsu</strong>, evading with mid-air and behind-the-back attacks.</p>



<div><p><strong>Not everyone or everything is hostile in Nioh 3, though</strong>. The developers from Team Ninja highlighted that Tokugawa will encounter friendly characters and even friendly Yōkai on his journey. Interacting with them may bring useful rewards.</p><p>Ultimately, Tokugawa's journey heads to the aforementioned Crucible, a treacherous area ruled by dangerous, hostile Yōkai. <strong>Players should expect even more challenging fights in this area</strong>. According to the developers, those who summoned the Crucible are heroes who have lost their way, succumbing to their own ambitions and misguided causes.</p></div>



<p>The gameplay video then switches to the Heian period, where the land is entirely frozen. Here, as in the other time periods, the protagonist must cleanse the Crucible to restore the land, purging it of Yōkai corruption.</p>

<p>Nioh 3 <strong>is set to launch on February 6, 2026</strong> for PC and PlayStation 5. Eager fans can jump in early to sample the free demo, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-new-demo-ps5-pc-january-29-2026-carries-full-game-crossplay-missing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which will be released on January 29</a></strong>. Its save data also carries over to the full game, so in essence it's a bit like having early access to the initial portion.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/activision-unveils-warzone-resurgence-series/</link>
            <guid>1413973</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Activision has lifted the lid on a massive Call of Duty: Warzone tournament circuit dubbed ‘Resurgence Series’. The new ecosystem boasts a massive prize pool worth $1.2 million and will unfold through 2026, culminating in a Championship event at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>This is set to replace the World Series of Warzone, throwing players into the small-form, fast-paced maps, as opposed to the larger, traditional battle royale experiences.</p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-has-a-new-esports-circuit">Warzone Has a New Esports Circuit</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://callofduty.worldseriesofwarzone.com/resurgence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent release</a>, Activision detailed the all-new Resurgence Series, a grand event set to turn around some gamers’ fortunes in 2026. It starts with online qualifiers that begin on February 9th, which will feed players into the first LAN event at DreamHack Birmingham in late March in the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>Following that event, a second qualifying stage starts, this time with players competing at DreamHack Atlanta in May. From these two LAN events, a selection of teams will qualify for the Esports World Cup <strong>directly</strong>. Another 22 spots will remain open for the Esports World Cup Qualifiers, set to be hosted in June ahead of the ultimate tournament in July in Riyadh.</p>



<p>The prize pool will be split accordingly:</p>



<ul>
<li>DreamHack Birmingham: $100,000</li>



<li>DreamHack Atlanta: $100,000</li>



<li>Esports World Cup: $1,000,000</li>
</ul>



<p>This is a trios-based tournament that uses the traditional kill race format, with players earning points for kills and getting boosted multipliers for higher finishes during each round.</p>



<p>For a while, fans have been sceptical about the future of Warzone’s esports ecosystem. It has been rocky for a couple of years now, but this new diverse approach that has spawned more LAN events at some of the biggest showcases in the business has pro players enthused.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#957)—Clues and Answers for Friday, January 23]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-23-957/</link>
            <guid>1413970</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Welcome to the end of another long week, and the introduction of a fresh round of NYT Connections hints and solutions. Today’s puzzle is a tough one, but that’s why I’m here to help you out. Before we roll into the weekend, let’s see if we can keep your streak running for a little while longer.</p>



<p>Read on to get today’s NYT Connections hints and solutions in just a few seconds.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-23">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 23)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #957:</p>



<ul>
<li>STONE</li>



<li>TEMPLE</li>



<li>PILOT</li>



<li>LIP</li>



<li>STREET</li>



<li>CHEEK</li>



<li>FOOT</li>



<li>TRAFFIC</li>



<li>EYE</li>



<li>ACRE</li>



<li>FLOOD</li>



<li>METER</li>



<li>GARAGE</li>



<li>LIME</li>



<li>BUSHEL</li>



<li>VALET</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think about parts of the face you’d point to during a game of “Simon Says.”</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Different ways you might leave your car depending on the situation</em>.</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> Old‑school measurements still used in certain countries.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each one forms a common compound phrase when placed before the word <em>light</em>.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 23:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-january-23-957">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, January 23 (#957)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CHEEK, EYE, LIP, TEMPLE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – GARAGE, METER, STREET, VALET</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – ACRE, BUSHEL, FOOT, STONE</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – FLOOD, LIME, PILOT, TRAFFIC</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>The "Big Apple brawler" enters the ring</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>'s roster has continued to grow, and as we enter 2026, Capcom is now looking towards the return of Alex.</p>
<p>We saw him in action in a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/alex-turns-heel-as-the-man-with-no-allies-in-street-fighter-6-trailer">teaser trailer earlier this month</a>, and this week Capcom has now rolled out first-look gameplay of the "Big Apple brawler".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No use holding back when faced with the Dark Devil himself, as he'll show you no mercy with his array of devastatingly powerful throws!</p>
<p>Alex can be purchased individually with Fighter Coins and the owners of the Year 3 Character Pass / Ultimate Pass will automatically get access to Alex when he releases.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted above, Alex is available as part of the Season 3 Character Pass DLC, or you can purchase him separately with Fighter Coins. Capcom also offers in-game rentals, where you can try out a character for one hour before purchasing them.</p>
<p>This character steps into the ring on <strong>17th March 2026</strong> and is joined by the already available characters Sagat and C.Viper, with Ingrid up next.</p>
<p>Capcom has also managed to secure one of the "biggest names in the anime song universe" JAM Project - which has contributed to this original BGM track "Go! Alex! Hope is Born! - Alex's Theme". You can listen and sing along to the full song in the YouTube upload below:</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Playground Games Explains Fable’s New Reputation-Based Morality]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playground-games-explains-fables-new-reputation-based-morality/</link>
            <guid>1413880</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The morality system in the Fable reboot sets out to reflect our own world.</p>



<p>Playground Games’ reboot of the Fable franchise was the centerpiece of the Xbox Developer_Direct on January 22, 2026. In the wake of that presentation, Playground’s founder, Ralph Fulton, spoke with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/fable-interview-overview-details-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a> about the game’s direction.</p>







<h2 id="h-morality-is-a-sliding-scale-in-fable">Morality Is a Sliding Scale in Fable</h2>



<p>When discussing upgrading the classic morality system for the modern era, Fulton explains that the team wanted the way people view morality in everyday life to be reflected in the game’s system.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>How we think about morality in the world today has really informed how we wanted to represent it as a game system in this game. That’s to say: there is no objective good, there is no objective evil. Really it’s just about people’s subjective opinions and what they choose to value in someone else when they make that judgment.</p>



<p>So, as you saw in Developer_Direct, our version of morality isn’t a sliding scale – we’ve chosen to anchor this around the actions you do, and specifically the things you do in Albion that are witnessed by at least one other person. So, if the things you do are seen by one or more people, you’ll start to earn a reputation for that thing. Obviously, we always use the chicken kicking example, because kicking chickens is classic Fable.</p>



<p>So if a person sees you kicking a chicken, you will start to get a reputation as a ‘Chicken Chaser’ – and if enough people see you do it, or you do it a lot, that reputation will become one of the things you’re known for in that settlement. And people will react to you based on what they think about that particular reputation.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Fable is slated to launch in the autumn of 2026. For the first time ever, it is headed to PlayStation 5 in addition to its release on Xbox platforms.</p>



<p>One thing that will be missing from this reboot is dog companions. Learn why Ralph Fulton made the decision to cut that feature in the upcoming game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/theres-no-dog-companion-in-new-fable-and-even-devs-are-upset/">here</a>. </p>



<p>However, don’t worry, the team worked very hard to preserve the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playground-games-founder-on-preserving-fables-true-spirit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">true spirit and Britishness.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Was the Best-Selling Console of 2025 in the U.S. and Is Still Outpacing the Nintendo Switch]]></title>

            <guid>1413856</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2 was the best-selling console of 2025 in the U.S., both in unit sales and dollar sales, selling a total of 4.4 million units in the U.S, and continuing its streak of selling faster than the original Nintendo Switch over the same period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from Circana's full-year reporting on the U.S. games market courtesy of analyst Mat Piscatella, and shouldn't come as a shock to anyone. The Switch 2 has been at the top consistently since it launched earlier in the year, amid a period of decline for the steadily aging PS5 and Xbox Series consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 was the best-selling game of last year, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> was the best-selling accessory.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, the U.S. games market reached $60.7 billion in sales for all of 2025, and $7.8 billion in December alone. That's up 1% and 3% year-over-year, respectively.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In hardware, spending was up 9% year-over-year to $5.4 billion for the year, and up 6% year-over-year to $1.2 billion in December. The Nintendo Switch 2, as the best-selling console of the year, managed to sell 4.4 million units, 94% higher than the original Switch at the same amount of time after its own launch, and 35% ahead of the PlayStation 4. It also continues its reign as the fastest-selling video game console hardware platform, with Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mczfshqpik2v" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointing out on Bluesky</a> that the Game boy Advance remains the fastest-selling hardware platform overall after seven months on sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over in software, December spending was up 3% to $5.9 billion, with subscription services seeing the biggest increase of 24% year-over-year. Overall full-year spending was only up 1% year-over-year, with subscription spending increasing 20% offsetting declines in everything else except mobile spending.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Battlefield 6 was the best-selling game of the whole year, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 took the crown in December, despite its precense on Game Pass making its impact on Xbox much harder to tally. Fortnite saw the highest total active users across PlayStation and Xbox in 2025 of any game, with over half of all active users on the two platforms playing Fortnite at least once.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for other games, the top five sellers for the full year should shock no one who's been watching the numbers all month: after Battlefield 6 was NBA 2K26, Borderlands 4, Monster Hunter: Wilds, and Call of Duty Black Ops 7, again noting that Call of Duty was a Game Pass Day 1 title. The rest of the list was populated by a series of expected sellers, with some standouts such as The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered coming in at No.9, Elden Ring: Nightreign at No.14, Pokemon Legends: Z-A at No.17 (though Nintendo doesn't report digital sales, so it's possible this would have been higher), and Split Fiction at No.19. Grand Theft Auto V clocked in at No.20 as players await the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, probably this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, just looking at December, standout games including Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, which launched into No.7 overall for the month, and Flight Simulator 2024, which released on PlayStation in December and shot from No.114 in November to No.16 last month. Over on PC for December, both Elden Ring and Elden Ring: Nightreign saw jumps likely due to the new Nightreign DLC.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">December 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li><li>NBA 2K26</li><li>Battlefield 6</li><li>Madden NFL 26</li><li>EA Sports FC 26</li><li>Pokemon Legends: Z-A*</li><li>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (NEW)*</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza*</li><li>Ghost of Yotei</li><li>EA Sports College Football 26</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li><li>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</li><li>Forza Horizon 5</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li><li>Flight Simulator 2024</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li><li>Kirby Air Riders*</li><li>Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2*</li><li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li></ol><h2 data-cy="title2">Full Year 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Battlefield 6</li><li>NBA 2K26</li><li>Borderlands 4</li><li>Monster Hunter: Wilds</li><li>Call of Duty Black Ops 7</li><li>Madden NFL 26</li><li>EA Sports College Football 26</li><li>EA Sports FC 26</li><li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>Ghost of Yotei</li><li>MLB: The Show 25*</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Elden Ring: Nightreign</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li><li>Forza Horizon 5</li><li>Pokemon Legends: Z-A*</li><li>WWE 2K25</li><li>Split Fiction</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.

<p>“Despite the increase in player numbers and overall positive reception, it wasn’t enough to sustain the size of our development team. So we made the difficult decision to reduce team roles to ensure we can continue delivering updates to the game while working in a way that supports the studio in the long term. We remain focused on Wildgate’s next content update, which introduces more quality of life improvements, including the highly-requested progression system, which we anticipate coming later this quarter.” </p>
</blockquote>







<p>Dreamhaven also had to make cutbacks in September 2025; at that time, they largely affected the publishing team. A month earlier, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dreamhavens-wildgate-has-struggled-with-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it was reported</a> that the game had only sold $130,000 unit; now, it is free to play on the Epic Games Store. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, layoffs in the gaming industry are common right now. Ubisoft recently announced a massive restructuring. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-human-cost-ubisofts-next-cost-cutting-measure-could-see-another-2000-jobs-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>No, there is no dog companion in the upcoming Fable reboot. Yes, there are those in the development team who are upset about it as well.</p>



<p>In Fable 2 and Fable 3, one of the player-favorite features of the game was the dog companion. However, the series is now being rebooted by Playground Games, and unfortunately there’s no dog companion. There will be horses, though.</p>







<h2 id="h-playground-founder-explains-why-he-nixed-dog-companions-in-fable">Playground founder explains why he nixed dog companions in Fable</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking with IGN, </a>Ralph Fulton of Playground Games noted that he was the one who made the decision to cut the dog companions, he cited “development reasons” as the cause, and noted that there were members of his team that have yet to forgive him for making the decision.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I did know I was going to get this question. And do you know what? There are some folks on the team that were relishing me getting this question because I cut it a while back. You know what? For development reasons, right? I don’t need to go into any more detail than that, except to say there are a substantial number of people on the team who have yet to forgive me for that decision.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Despite the lack of a canine by your side, Fable will retain the freedom and Britishness of the original series. Learn more about the origins of the reboot at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playground-games-founder-on-preserving-fables-true-spirit/">this link.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Text-based games, management RPGs, and visual novels – of whatever kind – rarely make the most exciting previews. It's just not easy to build a rich interest in the world and characters of a story you can only get the slightest taste of. I'm very pleased to say that a few hours with Sovereign Tower broke that trend entirely. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whosoever turns the key in the giant magic lock on the tower becomes king. So, as the mystically-appointed lord of the tower, your poor faceless wanderer becomes a very important person overnight in what developer Wild Wits calls a "story-rich, Round Table management RPG." It's an entertaining concept that draws its characters and dialogue equally from fantastical tradition and modern life. Couple that with a deliciously detailed art style and a sense of what's most entertaining to do in both management games and visual novels. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's enough to sell it, I think, but it also has some nice surprises and a weird little twist on the genre as a whole. I had a pretty darn good time with it, and I'm looking forward to more.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">King of the Castle</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In each turn of Sovereign Tower, you have to do two things: accept audiences, then assign knights from your round table to various quests. Taking audiences is a simple concept: Sit on the throne and deal with problems people bring you. The decisions you make there can alter the path of the story, bring up new quests for your knights, or avoid problems. They'll also affect the sovereign's standing with the realm's four factions: the Nobility, People, Merchants, and Scholars. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some problems go away if you just throw money at  them, and the taxes you get at the start of every cycle can pay for some of that—but those are the same taxes you use to pay for stuff like cool new swords and horses and magic potions, so do you really want to spend them on boring stuff like bridges or whatever? Probably not.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Sovereign Tower Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That sounds pretty normal, but it's the weirdos that show up to need things from you or to join your kingdom that make it memorable. I encountered a stinky jester, proud emissaries unable to admit they couldn't solve their own problems, clever peasants, annoying nobles, and even an assassin. Talking with them solidifies the personality of your blank-slate Sovereign, raising their stats in Audacity, Tyranny, Wisdom, and Kindness to unlock alternate decisions in future events.</p><p>It's the weirdos that show up to need things from you or to join your kingdom that make it memorable.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Knights are the flavor that'll really have to carry the game, and from what I saw they might do it. I met a huge guy that acted like a child, a very fancy boy, an extremely overdramatic guy, a nice lady who loved forest critters, the most goth knight ever, and even a straight-up actual wolf. Each of them had their own unique little events and dialogue that popped up from time to time, each of which affected your sovereign's relationship with them. They also had history to learn, as well as more straightforward stats, all of which affect their performance on missions.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/screenshot-08-1769118770111.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Figuring out which knight would be best for each quest was an actually interesting choice. Equipment like a specific horse to ride, a sword to use, or a magic potion can give them temporary stat boosts, but it's often the bonuses or penalties from their personality traits that make the difference between a failure and success or between mere success and an outstanding victory. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example if you're doing something that's a bit of public relations? Probably should send the more charismatic knight, but not the really arrogant one. Watching each knight's background and figuring out which of the little highlighted keywords apply to the current mission is a fun bit of understanding the characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there's a real penalty for failure. Your knights each have an armor score, which if it goes to zero means that knight's, well, dead and gone. Your blacksmith can only fix one knight's armor each cycle—so you need to be reasonably sure that the task you're sending a knight on is one they can at least survive if they fail.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Shining Armor</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">None of the characters, nor the entire game as I saw it, would have nearly as much personality without the visual art on display in Sovereign Tower, and I've got to take a moment to run through the influences and elements that make it up. Starting with the simple choices of colors to draw from: The warm pastels, earth tones, and jewel tones are lovely, then they're combined with copious golden shades and tints to express lighting. It's a palette of colors that's something between stained glass or rich watercolor on thick paper.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/screenshot-14-1769118784850.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The characters are drawn with a lot of emotion and movement, too, for what are otherwise relatively flat portraits. You can feel the shrug in how Urusla stands, for example. You can see the carefree attitude in the angle of Angelica's head. And, well, everything about Gideon tells you exactly who he is and how he behaves. It's not just great illustration work in that you can feel the motion, it's that you can immediately start to feel who the characters are just from how they look.</p><p>The characters are drawn with a lot of emotion and movement, too, for what are otherwise relatively flat portraits.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's clear that these are artists who understand how to work their chosen medium, and if you'll put up with me for a nerd moment, it is deeply reminiscent of the Art Nouveau period in design from France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Particularly the advertisements, posters, and calendars of justly-famous artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonse_Mucha" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Alphonse Mucha</u></a>. It's a fitting choice, too: Mucha's work often used the kind of medieval romantic and even fairytale themes that Sovereign Tower seems to use in its stories—I imagine he'd approve of being the inspiration here.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/screenshot-03-1769118800769.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I think that's where I'd place this whole game's artistic style, too: It's a blend of medieval fantasy and Arthurian romance setting, the art of Mucha, and the writing of a wryly clever modern comic book. There's basically nothing to dislike in that.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Clever Twist</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not a surprise to people who like this kind of game that there are going to be secret events and pathways through the story to uncover, as well as desperate outcomes and painful prices to pay when choosing poorly at certain decision points. I found that Sovereign Tower must have more than a few, since I managed to stumble into at least two hidden story outcomes while playing just by assigning an unexpected or suboptimal knight to a specific quest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The frustration with these kinds of events, however, is that they can give you unwanted outcomes or change the story when you weren't expecting them to or were aiming for another outcome. The only choice you've got at that point is often to play the entire visual novel over again just to see a new path or the immediate consequence of a tough choice.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/screenshot-02-1769118819660.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The real good choice that Sovereign Tower makes is to have a built-in do-over mechanic. See, there's a demon that lives in a cage in the tower basement, which I'm sure isn't scary or plot-relevant at all because the demon helps you do something very useful: Step back in time. Don't worry—the demon assures me this is because it has absolutely no bad intentions and is bound to help you—much like all the other magical things that live in the tower.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the demon's help you can turn back time, especially when some choice you've made would lead to a disastrous end. I expect you'll also be able to use the power to avoid the worst ends in the game, and I'm betting most players will want to use it at least once or twice to avoid making whatever NPC they've chosen to romance not mad at them about something. There's also the hint, given in the trailer and screenshots for Sovereign Tower, that you'll be able to use the demon's power to unlock alternate dialogue in situations you've seen before—tagged with an "Omniscience" stat that surely won't upset or alarm people who don't realize you're time travelling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, from the art and the writing, I'm pretty intrigued by Sovereign Tower and it's going on my list of games to watch out for. Sure, the game mechanics are pretty simple, but when the story and characters are interesting in this way I'm glad the game rules are getting out of the way to let me entertain myself—failing and succeeding on my own terms.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/sovereign-tower-preview-hands-on-with-this-unique-arthurian-round-table-management-rpg]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-is-finally-stealing-the-show-for-micros-1848034238">It’s almost time to leave behind <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>‘s Mexico</a> and journey to a brand new country. <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-location-microsoft-tokyo-game-show-2000628658"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> moves the series to Japan</a>, and it looks amazing! The new entry in Xbox’s popular car sim series arrives later this year, and we have all the useful info you might want to know about the upcoming open-world racer. Just put your seatbelt on first before speed-scrolling through this list.</p> <h2>What is <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>?</h2> <p><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is the next installment in the <em>Forza</em> <em>Horizon </em>franchise. <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-motorsport-8-horizon-xbox-game-pass-review-120fps-1850900323">Unlike the more serious, sim-heavy <em>Motorsport</em> games,</a> the <em>Horizon</em> titles are open-world racing games focused more on over-the-top moments, music, gorgeous locations, and arcade-y fun. This time around, <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> brings the franchise to Japan, a location fans have been wanting for years. You’ll be able to explore the urban streets of Tokyo, the suburbs outside of the town, and plenty of open land and rural spaces far away from the city. And like in past games, you can choose to focus on big races to level up and unlock more challenges, or you can just chill, cruise, and jam out to music.</p>

 <h2>What’s different about this latest entry?</h2> <p>Beyond the new location, <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is shaking things up and swapping out the main character. In <em>Horizon 6</em>, you won’t be playing as the “superstar” racer featured in the last few games. Instead, you’re a tourist visiting Japan who gets involved in the Horizon Festival and all the racing and car culture. That means you have to earn entry to the festival and its activities and slowly work your way up from driving rust buckets to supercars.</p>  <h2>How big is the map in <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>?</h2> <p>Very big! In fact, this is the biggest map that Playground Games has created for a <em>Forza Horizon</em> game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-biggest-map-japan-open-world-size-comparison-2026-ps5-xbox-2000628855"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> art director Don Arceta claimed in an interview</a> that <em>Horizon 6</em>‘s digital Japan is the biggest map in the history of the series, and Tokyo is the largest city the team has ever built. And as you explore this massive location, you’ll fill up a journal, a new feature in <em>Horizon 6</em> that helps you track everything you do and all the places you visit while playing the game.</p>

 <h2>How many cars are available at launch?</h2> <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/forza-horizon-6-developer-direct-breakdown-interview/">According to<em> Xbox Wire,</em> there will be around 550 cars</a> to collect and drive in <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> at launch. That number will go up over time as the devs add more cars to the game. As for the car on the cover of the game, that’s the Toyota 2025 GR GT Prototype.</p>

 <h2>Can I play <em>Horizon 6</em> online with my friends?</h2> <p>Yup! Like earlier games in the series, <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> supports multiplayer with friends as well as random players. And new to this entry, players will be able to build new tracks together with their friends. There will also be car meets you can hang out at with friends, and a location that lets players build their own personal home and race track. These are both new features for <em>Horizon 6</em>.</p> <h2>What is <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>‘s release date?</h2> <p><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is launching on May 19 for Xbox Series X/S and PC, and&nbsp;will be available day one on Game Pass Ultimate. Xbox is also holding the game hostage, like so many publishers. If you spend extra on the Premium Edition, you’ll be able to play <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> four days early, on May 15.</p>

 <h2>Will <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> be available on PS5?</h2> <p>Yes, but not at launch. Playground has confirmed that it is working on a PS5 port of <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, but it won’t be available until sometime later in 2026.</p> <h2>Wait, where are the goblins and magic and swords?</h2> <p>Ohhh, you’re looking for Playground’s other open-world game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-reboot-features-open-world-release-date-fall-xbox-ps5-2000662295"><em>Fable</em>, which is also launching this year. Sorry to have wasted your time</a>.</p>

<p>Playground Games’ Ralph Fulton spoke about the origins of Fable’s return and ensuring the game kept the core spirit of the original series, which debuted a quarter of a century ago.</p>



<p>Fable has returned for the first time since 2018 and is set to release its first mainline game in the franchise in over a decade since Fable 3 in 2010. With Playground Games currently at the helm of the franchise, Fulton can now reflect on how the success of Forza Horizon 3 and the desire to grow as Developers sowed the seeds for Fable’s return. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking with IGN, </a>Fulton expanded on what he thinks led to this opportunity for the team of developers.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think that as a developer, you should always be trying to challenge yourself and expand your skill set. So, that’s where the idea came from. And obviously because we’d been working with Xbox for really since our inception as Playground Games, we had great relationships with them. We knew a lot of people there. The obvious first conversation for us was with them where we said, “Hey, look, we’re looking to build a second team. We want to work in a new genre.” We felt like the transferable skills that we had from the Horizon games were an open world. We had learned a lot about building open worlds technically in terms of streaming, in terms of game design and game flow and all that good stuff. And in lots of ways that are maybe surprisingly car-agnostic. There’s a ton of things about Horizon games that are about the cars, but there’s a ton of principles that we’d learned there, which we felt were transferable. And I don’t remember who said the word Fable first, but as soon as I heard it, I was like, “That has to be it. That fits so perfectly.” It’s a series that we adored here and still do.</p>

<h2 id="h-playground-wanted-to-make-sure-fable-maintained-its-core-elements-including-its-britishness">Playground Wanted to Make Sure Fable Maintained Its Core Elements, Including Its Britishness</h2>



<p>When rebooting such a beloved franchise from the ground up, the team at Playground wanted to ensure certain core elements remained intact. Ralph Fulton says the three pillars of Fable games they landed on were “Freedom,” “Fairytale,” and “Britishness.” For developers, these three pillars formed the core of Fable’s DNA.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We actually wrap that up into the word “freedom” because it’s about the freedom to choose, the freedom to make the choices and then have to live with the consequences of your choices. It’s the freedom to go where you want, do what you want, be the hero you want to be. And that right there is at the heart of our game. We want you to be the hero you want to be. So, freedom is absolutely central to it.</p>



<p>We landed on two other tonal pillars, I think. And the first is fairytale. And we actually inherited this from Lionhead. We had this treasure trove of documents which had been in storage, that came originally from Lionhead. And one of them had this incredibly neat little bit of direction, which was Fable is a fairytale, not fantasy, which I just think is brilliant, incredibly incisive and speaks to really tonally what Fable is…</p>



<p>Finally, it’s about Britishness. And again, why was it important to Xbox that a British studio continued with Fable? Because Fable is this quintessentially British game, and not just because Albion is medieval Britain through a filter, if you like. And not just because the characters are British and have British accents. There’s a sensibility to the games, there’s a tone of voice, a way of thinking about things, a way of reacting to things. It’s very British. And those things combined are for us the DNA of Fable. If you don’t hit those things, if you’re not true to those things, you’re not making a Fable game. So, that was something that we decided right at the start.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>For the first time ever, Fable has the freedom to release on PlayStation, and the game will be coming to PlayStation 5 on the same day it’s released on Xbox platforms.

      <p>The Congressional Labor Caucus, with support from the Communications Workers of America, on Thursday released a <a href="https://laborcaucus.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/laborcaucus.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/letter-to-ftc-on-proposed-acquisition-of-electronic-arts-ea.pdf?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">letter</a> to the Federal Trade Commission requesting a review of the $55 billion <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-ea-sale-is-bad-news-for-everyone/" rel="noreferrer">sale</a> of Electronic Arts to a group of investors made up of Silver Lake, Affinity, and (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-29/saudi-plans-for-video-game-hub-grow-with-55-billion-ea-deal?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">primarily</a>) Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The Caucus expressed concern over the proposed deal's potential effect on workers and on competition within the games industry.</p><p>The letter, signed by <a href="https://laborcaucus.house.gov/media/press-releases/labor-caucus-calls-for-review-of-electronic-arts-acquisition?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">46 House Democrats</a>, "urge[s] the Commission to conduct a thorough investigation into the labor market consequences of this proposed acquisition, including EA’s existing wage-setting power, the likelihood of post-transaction layoffs, the degree of labor-market concentration in relevant geographic and occupational markets, and the role of cross-ownership in shaping labor outcomes."</p><p>The Caucus takes issue with several parts of the deal. One is that, given that "EA is one of the largest employers of video game workers in the United States," the company has outsized power over game workers' jobs and pay. Noting that "EA has eliminated more than 1,700 U.S. jobs since 2023, contributing to an industry-wide total of over 35,000 layoffs since 2022," the letter highlights the $20 billion in debt that's set to finance the deal, which could lead to further layoffs as EA seeks to cut costs. It also raises the possibility of "offshoring, restructuring, or studio closures," all of which "not only jeopardize thousands of high-skilled American jobs, but also further concentrate already fragile labor markets" in the games industry.</p><p>The Caucus also notes that the deal would bring EA under the same ownership as "sports leagues, sports-betting platforms, talent management, and game-development tools," writing that</p><blockquote>For example, Silver Lake’s ties to WME and TKO, along with PIF’s ownership of LIV Golf, would put EA under the same umbrella as major sports and entertainment brands that its games rely on for key licenses. This level of cross-ownership presents risks of self-preferencing and anticompetitive coordination across these sports, sports-related talent, and sports-related video game business lines. This could, consequently, restrict worker mobility and reduce bargaining power for employees throughout the industry.</blockquote><p>Back in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/cwa-calls-on-ftc-and-cfius-to-scrutinize-ea-buyout-and-protect-workers-consumers-and-the-future-of-the-game-industry?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">October</a>, the president of the CWA sent a similar letter to the FTC and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, urging the organizations to review the deal. The <a href="https://cwa-union.org/sites/default/files/2025-10/20251028_cwa_letter_to_secretary_bessent.pdf?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">letter to CFIUS</a> also raised concerns about "critical national security risks due to EA’s (1) access to and collection of sensitive personal data from millions of American consumers and (2) current and planned development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology."</p><p>The deal was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shareholders-back-55bn-acquisition?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">approved by EA shareholders</a> in late December and now goes to regulatory review. Given the current political climate in the US, and given that Affinity was founded by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, the odds any of these letters amount to anything feel pretty slim to me. But I'm heartened to see a number of US politicians recognize the magnitude of this deal and its potential consequences on games workers. As the letter concludes, "workers deserve a fair, competitive marketplace where their skills are valued," and this sale is certainly not a way to get it. </p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-saudi-arabia-creative-control-jared-kushner-donald-trump/"><div><p>EA Says It Will Retain Creative Control Following Saudi Sale, But, Like, Come On - Aftermath</p><p>EA says that its sale to Saudi Arabia will not come at the price of creative control.
