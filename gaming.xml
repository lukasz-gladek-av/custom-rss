            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/08/jackbox-survey-scramble-release-confirmed-for-24th-october/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If someone approaching you on the high street with a clipboard in hand sparks nothing but fear, then Jackbox Survey Scramble will be the perfect horror game for a Halloween party when it launches on 24th October.</p>
<p>The game will arrive for all major platforms including PC, Mac, Linux, Playstation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Amazon Fire TV and Apple TV, and will be priced at the rather appealing point of $9.99.</p>


<p>Just ahead of that 24th October release date, PC and Mac owners will be able to get an early look with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2948640/The_Jackbox_Survey_Scramble/">a Jackbox Survey Scramble demo</a> available during the Steam Next Fest from 14th to 21st October. That will give you access to two of the game’s four modes – Hilo and Squares.</p>
<p>This is Guesspionage souped up into a full standalone product. Hilo is a game where you guess the most and least popular answers, while Squares has you organise choices in popularity order. The other two games are Speed mode, where you’re guessing against the clock, and a mode where you can intercept your opponents answers in Bounce.</p>
<p>In each case, the survey data that the game is drawing from is dynamically shifting based on the answers that you and all of the game’s players are feeding into it. Come back to the game a week, a month, a year later and the same prompts will potentially give rather different answers.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Off the back of the recently released Jackbox Naughty Pack, Jackbox is making this a game with broader settings. One of the question examples is “what’s the cutest word for a butt?” but that won’t be in there if you apply content filters for a lower age range. There’s also streamer settings and accessibility options aplenty.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaking Naughty Pack, this is the first year in a decade without a 5-game Party Pack release, and Naughty Pack didn’t manage to fill that void for us in anywhere near the same way. An experimental fumble in the dark which sought to put more adult-rated prompts and games together, it did not land. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/18/the-jackbox-naughty-pack-review/">Naughty Pack review</a>, Jason said, “Ultimately, Jackbox Naughty Pack is the worst Party Pack to date, […] Maybe making our own fun and our own filth is the way forwards to a truly naughty experience.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here’s hoping that Survey Scramble can right the good ship Jackbox.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/roblox-accused-of-lying-to-investors-about-user-numbers/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In new accusations from the investment firm<a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Hindenburg Research</a>, Roblox has landed themselves in hot water, as they are accused of lying to investors about their user numbers. Hindenburg Research has claimed that it is "consistently overstating the amount of people on its platform by 25 percent to 42 percent or more." This isn't the first time Roblox had some trouble, as Roblox has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/turkiye-bans-roblox-due-to-potential-child-exploitation/">banned from Turkiye</a> for possible child exploitation. While they are said to be working with the government to try and fix this issue, it seems that Roblox is still blocked. Roblox went public in 2021 and reported that they had 79.5 million daily players. However, Hindenburg claims that this number is statistically incorrect.</p>
<p>Hindenburg is claiming that Roblox "intentionally conflates" actual people with daily users, where that number has the potential to include alt accounts and bots, which is a huge problem on the platform. The research released by Hindenburg alleges that Roblox is capable of separating alt accounts from single users, although Roblox has disclosed that daily active users "are not a measure of unique individuals accessing Roblox." In their report, they also say that their research indicates that "engagement hours, another key metric, is inflated by an estimated 100%."</p>
<p>The report also mentions that before Roblox went public, it would report the number of "people" on its platform, saying "there are over 54.1 million people coming to Roblox every day" in a 2022 report. However, Hindenburg says that the number of 'people' matches Roblox's reported Daily Active Users. As stated above, they disclose that their DAU is not a measure of unique individuals. As a result, Hindenburg believes that they are intentionally conflating "people" with DAUs.</p>
<p>In 2023, Roblox told the SEC that it is "unable to identify if a user has multiple accounts," a response that Hindenburg believes is a lie. This is after multiple former employees spoke to Hindenburg Research, saying that "Roblox does internally track single users with multiple accounts, referring to the process as de-alting."</p>
<p>The report made by Hindenburg is incredibly lengthy and says that in interviews, "Roblox effectively has two sets of books for counting users: one for internal business decisions, in which multiple accounts are de'alted', and one used by the finance team that reports higher metrics to investors."</p>
<p>Roblox as a platform continues to grow, and whether this highly detailed report will have any effect on the company or whether they will now have to answer to these allegations remains to be seen, but it's possible that the investors will not be happy if Roblox has been making out that they are more successful than they actually are.</p>

It didn't mention the release date specifically but Apple App Stores were updated with a December 31 date alongside the new information.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/02/15/residentevil-1644966155522.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>"A limited part of the base game can be played for free," reads the game's App Store page.

Your favorite chaotic sandbox is back and more beautiful than ever, with updated graphics, every downloadable content, and more bugs that you can shake a goat at. WASD to rewrite history.</p><p>Your goal? Chaos! Your muse? Pilgor the goat! If you’ve had your horns in the sand for the last 10 years, Goat Simulator is a game about causing as much destruction as you possibly can, as a goat. Headbutt, backflip and ragdoll your way around each level to earn points, and come up with creative ways to ruin an NPC’s day.</p><p><em>Goat Simulator Remastered</em> is the remaster no one asked for. It comes with everything you loved about the original game and more, with new and improved visuals, updated textures, shiny new lighting, and some brand-new foliage showing off the finest in advanced goat simulation technology. We’ve also completely reworked Mutators, allowing you to pick and choose whichever “goat” you desire from a handy in-game menu. You just have to catch them all first!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The remaster also includes every downloadable content from the PC version, and one of our favorites from the mobile version, including:</p><ul><li>“GoatVille” – The Big Apple of Goat Simulator, as some would say…</li><li>“Goat City Bay” – The coastal jewel of northern GoatAsia.</li><li>“Goat MMO” – A fantasy <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,802 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> across lands unknown.</li><li>“Goat Z” – Can you survive the apocalypse?</li><li>“PAYDAY” – Gather your crew and prepare for a heist!</li><li>“Waste Of Space” – Explore the outer reaches of space and see what popular sci-fi references lie within…</li><li>“Buck to School” – From <em>Goat Simulator Mobile</em>, GoatVille high has a new jock in town.</li></ul><p>There are also less exciting new things, like general optimization and bug fixing—but we promise we mainly fixed the boring ones.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>You can be a goat… again.</li><li>No really, that’s still the main selling point.</li><li>A brand spanking new mutator menu that lets you mix and match goats to your heart’s content—if your contentment means abominations.</li><li>As buggy as you remember—just because it’s a remaster doesn’t mean we haven’t left in an unhealthy dose of physics-based bugs because why not?</li><li>All downloadable content included—we could have sold them separately to you again, but if we’re honest this is already a cash-grab.</li><li>New and improved graphics, lighting, VFX and animations – as well as revamped foliage for the prettiest leaves you’ll see in a <em>Goat Simulator</em> game excluding <em><a title="Games > Goat Simulator 3 [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/goat-simulator-3">Goat Simulator 3</a></em>.</li></ul><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p><p><em>Goat Simulator Remastered</em> is a completely stupid game and has been a completely stupid game since we first invented goat simulation over 10 years ago. We’ve said it before, but you should absolutely be spending your money on something else, like a neat hat, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Gameplay Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Goat Simulator Remastered – Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4bDc8gzsYs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Media Molecule has announced that LittleBigPlanet 3 will be delisted from the PlayStation Network Store on October 31, along with seemingly every single piece of DLC in the series.</p><p>"After 10 years of playing, creating, and sharing content in LittleBigPlanet 3, the game and our entire range of LittleBigPlanet DLC will be removed from the PlayStation Store on October 31, 2024," Media Molecule said in a <a href="https://x.com/LittleBigPlanet/status/1843652568389480651" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> on Twitter.</p><p>The studio also said that anyone who purchases the game or any LittleBigPlanet DLC will still be able to access it even after the content is removed from sale. It's important to note that DLC from LittleBigPlanet and LittleBigPlanet 2 are compatible with LittleBitPlanet 3. While it seems like the entirety of LittleBigPlanet's DLC will be gone, GameSpot has reached out for clarification.</p><p>Servers for the PS3 version of LittleBigPlanet 3 closed permanently in 2021 because of DDOS attacks. Earlier in January, Media Molecule temporarily <a href="https://x.com/LittleBigPlanet/status/1744329352567742639" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">took the PS4 servers</a> offline while it investigated reported issues.

            <p>Ah, this makes for sore reading. Spanish developers Tequila Works have cancelled a game and made a "small" number of layoffs in the face of financial difficulties.</p>
<p>“With deep regret, we must inform of the decision to cancel an unannounced game,” reads a post from Tequila on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tequilaworks_with-deep-regret-we-must-inform-activity-7249379290159452160-vRKo/">LinkedIn</a>. “This tough decision means we will be restructuring the studio to concentrate on the development of only one game. These changes will have an impact to a small number of roles at the studio.</p>
<p>“This is an incredibly difficult time, and our focus is to provide the support and guidance to those affected," it goes on.</p>
<p>Tequila remain best known for Rime, a first-class graduate of the Ico-meets-Zelda school of small children exploring emotive fantasy worlds that are probably metaphors for something, but they’re also co-developers and publishers of The Sexy Brutale, one of my personal favourite time-rewindy puzzlers. Their last game was a League Of Legends spin-off, Song Of Nunu. Katharine (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/song-of-nunu-a-league-of-legends-story-review-simple-3d-platforming-with-lots-of-heart%E2%80%9D">called it</a> “a heartfelt, winsome platformer that doesn't require any knowledge of League Of Legends to enjoy”. Before that they made Gylt, which Alice B (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gylt-is-an-alan-wake-for-kids-adventure-that-trains-you-in-the-ways-of-survival-horror%E2%80%9D">was charmed by</a>, calling it Alan Wake for kids and a nice intro to the nuances of commercial game design at large. Here’s a longer chunk:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you want your child to learn that you can move or climb yellow things in games, that enemies often have glowing vulnerable spots, that you can go back to previously locked off areas to find things, that you should grid search games to find the three MacGuffins you need, that it's often economical to run past enemies to get to the next area, and that being a bystander to bullying if you're not participating yourself is still really bad, then gosh, Gylt will do all of that in one.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Suffice it to say that Tequila Works are good folk with many strings to their bow. I hope things pick up from here. Best of luck to the people who’ve lost their jobs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But sadly, huge amounts of the game’s dialogue aren’t read aloud by its stellar voice cast. That’s in stark contrast to <em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, which included voice acting for every chapter of its relationship-building social links.</p><p>Part of this is likely because production on <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>began long before <em>Reload</em>, which went into development in 2019. <em>Reload</em> is a remake of an existing 2006 RPG, though, so it’s not surprising that the team managed to get it out the door more quickly than <em>Metaphor</em>, a brand-new game and franchise for the studio. <em>Metaphor</em>, meanwhile, was first announced way back in 2016, shortly after <em>Persona 5 </em>was released in Japan, so it’s not surprising that it follows the format of previous Atlus games where voice acting is concerned. <em>Metaphor</em>, like <em>Persona 5</em>, only voices the first and last of its social link-style follower stories, so all the build-up is only portrayed through text and pantomiming.</p><p>With games like <em>Metaphor</em> that have dialogue presented visual novel-style with text boxes and voice acting, I tend to switch on the setting to have lines auto-progress and watch them like an anime. With a voice cast as strong as <em>Metaphor</em>’s, it’s always a treat to get to a fully voice-acted scene and hear the crew work their magic. Those were plentiful in the main story, but when you spend hours getting to know characters and the world in these side relationships, it’s a bummer that they don’t get to give voice to some pretty meaningful moments in between the intro and conclusion.</p><p>My hope is that this is just a matter of <em>Metaphor</em> being in development for so long, and that <em>Persona 3 Reload </em>is a more accurate declaration of what Atlus plans to do on this front in the future. With any luck, sometime down the line <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> may get a <em>Persona 5 Royal</em>-style re-release and Atlus might fully voice these scenes in a few years. Until then, I’ll enjoy the times the voice cast does get to pop off, though they’re fewer and farther between than I would like. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A new report has alleged that Roblox misleads investors by falsely reporting player numbers, and has highlighted yet more examples of inappropriate - and allegedly, illegal - content being shared via the platform. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/">report</a>, published by short-selling firm Hindenberg Research (via <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/short-seller-hindenburg-says-roblox-inflates-user-metrics-compromises-child-safety-92c77b5e?st=NV9qAB">Wall St Journal</a>), claims that daily player counts and engagement statistics have been inflated by Roblox since 2021, based on interviews with multiple former employees at the company.
</p>
<p>
A Roblox spokesperson has responded to the report to say it was "simply misleading".
</p>
<p>
More damning still are a fresh set of examples that appear to show Roblox's content moderation system failing to keep children safe - and to stop adult content circulating.
</p>
<p>"We firmly believe that Roblox is a safe and secure platform," a Roblox spokesperson said in response.</p>
<p>
The report includes examples seen by Hindenberg Research of Roblox experiences named after sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and sex trafficker P Diddy, as well as chatrooms where Hindenberg staff say they witnessed child sexual abuse images being openly traded.
</p>
<p>
Roblox's share price tumbled 4.6 percent in the wake of Hindenberg Research's report being published - and it's worth acknowledging that the business model of short-selling firms such as this is to benefit as a result. Still, this on its own does not bring any of its research into doubt, and any share price recovery from the report being proven incorrect would expose it to a huge amount of risk.
</p><p>
In its report, Hindenberg Research claims Roblox insiders have cashed out $1.7bn in stock while reporting losses each quarter. Publicly, Roblox boasts off of huge engagement statistics, but the report says user numbers have been inflated by "25 to 42 percent", while user engagement hours have been "inflated by an estimated 100+ percent". 
</p>
<p>
The report claims that Roblox user numbers are being artificially inflated by multiple accounts owned by the same user, as well as large numbers of bot accounts used to farm in-game items or artificially boost player follower accounts. It's these secondary accounts which former employees say the company detects but does not flag publicly.
</p>
<p>
Thus, Roblox is claimed to have an actual player count it uses for internal business decisions, with "alt" and bot accounts removed (a correction process it refers to as its numbers being "de-alted"), as well as the publicly-communicated player number it reports to investors. 
</p>
<p>
"If that number [Daily Active Users] is not 'de-alted', I think the actual one would be like anywhere between 30 to 20 percent lower," a former data scientist at the company told Hindenberg Research. 
</p>
<p>
The report details how it has determined that large numbers of bot accounts are active on the platform, and highlights the existence of widely-available tools for users to run more than 20 Roblox bot accounts at the same time. 
</p>
<p>
On the issue of child safety, the report dubs Roblox an "X-rated paedophile hellscape" that exposes children to "grooming, pornography, violent content and extremely abusive speech". 
</p>
<p>
A former senior product designer told Hindenberg Research that compromises to protect child accounts meant "limiting users' engagement" which meant "hurting your metrics... in a lot of cases, the leadership doesn't want that".
</p>
<p>
The report's authors say they, using an account set with an age "under 13", personally witnessed child sex abuse images being openly traded within user groups, and members "soliciting sexual acts from minors". 
</p>
<p>
The report details numerous Roblox games titled "Escape to Epstein Island" and "Run From Diddy Simulator" and variations thereof, images of male genitalia being shared in a "school simulator" game with no age restrictions, and other games designed around killing pregnant women, going on a shooting spree in a hospital, or simulating sex acts in public toilets.
</p><p>
Finally, returning to player numbers, the report claims Roblox is now reaching a saturation point in the US and Europe, with profitability per user falling as it seeks to continue growing its audience numbers, as it adds "loss-generating users in markets like Asia, per a former employee". 
</p>
<p>
Roblox, a game played by millions of young people, has continually been criticised for its child safety breaches. This summer, a Bloomberg report revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">Roblox itself had reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation in 2023</a>, and that more than two dozen people had been arrested for abusing minors, following contact in-game.

            <p>Swedish video game publishers Thunderful are selling some steam, which is terrific news for those of us who don't live near saunas and are thus cruelly deprived of their widely-accepted health and wellness benefits, which date all the way back to the ancient Mayans. Oh wait, I read the press release wrong. Thunderful are actually having <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/ThunderfulSale2024">a Steam <em>sale</em></a>, with up to 90% off such well-regarded games as Laika: Aged Through Blood, Swordship, Viewfinder and, just to confuse me further, several SteamWorld games.</p>
<p>Of the games on discount, I would focus on Viewfinder, now 45% off, in which you get a camera that can turn photographs into bits of walkable terrain. In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/viewfinder-review">Bestest Best review</a>, Rachel (RPS in peace) enthused that "its reality-shifting, mind-bending hook is constantly fascinating, and the directions it takes will leave your head spinning in the best way possible". To that, I'm going to add Swordship - 70% off - which Matt Cox (also RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/swordships-11-update-is-a-great-excuse-to-get-this-snazzy-dodge-em-up-on-your-radar">hailed</a> for its "purity of purpose".</p>
<p>There's also The Gunk, which Katharine (RPS in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Eurogamer</a>) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-gunk-review">called</a> "a safe but stunning adventure from the SteamWorld devs" - it's 75% off.  Kaan Serin (RPS in Gamesradar, at the minute) was similarly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pull-off-sick-motorcycle-backflips-to-reload-in-this-gorgeous-motorvania">keen</a> on the demo for Laika: Aged Through Blood, though we never commissioned him to review it: he remarked that it "seems to be mashing My Friend Pedro's bullet violence and Trials' motorcycle-spinning physics into a Metroidvania formula". The Steam user consensus is that it sticks the landing. </p>
<p>Kaan did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/white-shadows-review-a-twisted-musical-joyride-that-loses-a-little-steam">review</a> White Shadows, currently 85% off, summarising it as "two hours of creative, chilling designs, joyous musical set pieces and enough screen-shottable sights to fill your hard drive". You can get that one for about the price of a family-sized bag of chips. Alternatively, reserve your pennies for Somerville, now 65% off, which Malindy Hetfield <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/somerville-review">summarised as follows</a>: "Mechanically simple but visually engrossing, Somerville offers an interesting, if not particularly deep, sci-fi adventure." </p><p>Thunderful have published some good stuff, though they are also one of those publishers who wildly over-invested during the pandemic lockdown years. In January this year, they announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steamworld-publishers-thunderful-fire-20-off-staff-due-to-over-investments-made-in-the-last-few-years">they would lay off around 20 per cent of their staff</a> in order "to reduce costs and focus the business on areas with the best future growth and profitability prospects".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Or, as it’s often summed up, if a gun shows up at some point in your story, by the end, it had better go off. So, when a gun shows up early in my playthrough of narrative game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/apartment-story&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/apartment-story"><em>Apartment Story</em></a></span><em>,</em> you can imagine where my mind immediately went.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194012" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="April's Air Combos Make Her TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge’s Raddest Playable Character" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="194012,193534,194617" data-current="194012"><div><p>April's Air Combos Make Her TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge’s Raddest Playable Character</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194012/194012_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194012/194012_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194012/194012_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194012/194012_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19479.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The game, from developer Blue Rider Interactive, is clearly working within that basic narrative concept but its connections to theater and the medium’s style of storytelling go even deeper. What that results in is a brisk esoteric narrative blending Chekhov with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-sims-4-the-kotaku-review-1633166683&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-sims-4-the-kotaku-review-1633166683"><em>The Sims</em></a></span> in fascinating ways that don’t always work, but are utterly unique in execution.</p><p>Before the gun shows up in <em>Apartment Story</em>, you might find the gameplay loop pretty mundane, even boring. It’s a life simulator in which you control Arthur, an out-of-a-job writer cooped up in his apartment doing nothing of importance. You’ll take a shower, eat some food, have a cigarette, type away at your computer, jerk off, drink beer, watch a movie, or any number of basic things. What makes these activities all the more interesting, however, is how much effort each of them take. </p><figure id="" data-id="a7343d10b86f929e7f3c57d95efaaa67" data-recommend-id="image://a7343d10b86f929e7f3c57d95efaaa67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An overhead shot of a man cooking food on a stove" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An overhead shot of a man cooking food on a stove" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Rider Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a7343d10b86f929e7f3c57d95efaaa67" data-recommend-id="image://a7343d10b86f929e7f3c57d95efaaa67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An overhead shot of a man cooking food on a stove" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you want to make a basic meal you need to manually open the fridge, individually pick up each ingredient and drop it on a cooking board, activate the stovetop to actually cook, wait 15 in-game minutes, grab a plate to serve the food on, then sit down at a table to eat. It’s a lengthy process and on paper it’s pretty uninteresting, but the mundane loop still manages to scratch that itch in your brain that makes you want to do it again and again. To encourage you to actually engage with the loop, Arthur has a list of needs that must be managed, like hunger. If any of these stats gets too low you’ll start moving slower.<br></p><p>Arthur’s normal life begins to get strange when his old roommate Dianne shows up asking to grab something from one of his rooms. That mysterious thing is, shocker, the gun. It’s been hidden in the bedroom of your absent current roommate Godot (more theater references for you). Dianne tells you a story about how she is running from her abusive lover and is ready to protect herself in any way. Over the next couple of in-game days, during which you still have to manage all your stats, Dianne’s entrance back into your life turns it into a thriller in which your safety is not guaranteed. That is first illustrated when you awake one morning to discover everything in your apartment has been thrown across the floor and a man named Blondie—who identifies himself as Dianne’s lover—is sitting at your dining table. He tells you to stay away from Dianne and then beats the shit out of you. </p><p>While Blondie’s appearance should have made me worry for Dianne and Arthur’s lives, the first thing I felt was rage at the state of the apartment. This asshole threw all of my shit across the apartment and now I have to clean it. I had to pick up each book, DVD, plant, and fork one-by-one and organize them in some way that made the apartment feel clean again. It’s an excellent way to make me more invested in the outcome of the story, because after that, I kind of wanted to kill that guy too!</p><figure id="" data-id="07bf2bc9f7732ce069be59e23a669238" data-recommend-id="image://07bf2bc9f7732ce069be59e23a669238" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man in a black sweat suit stands in an apartment with items scattered across the floor" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man in a black sweat suit stands in an apartment with items scattered across the floor" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Rider Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="07bf2bc9f7732ce069be59e23a669238" data-recommend-id="image://07bf2bc9f7732ce069be59e23a669238" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man in a black sweat suit stands in an apartment with items scattered across the floor" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The use of Chekhov’s gun in <em>Apartment Story</em> keeps you on your toes, which is what the device has always been intended to accomplish. Once the gun is in the picture you’re more on edge, more attentive to everything Arthur, Dianne, and Blondie do and say. But what’s even more interesting is how <em>Apartment Story</em> adds a twist to the narrative device that only games can—while tradition says that the gun must go off, <em>Apartment Story</em> leaves that decision up to you. No gun actually has to be fired, though there will be consequences to pulling the trigger or not. There is also plenty of narrative downtime, during which you’ll have to occupy several in-game hours of Arthur’s life with mundane tasks while you wait for something to happen, which breaks up the dramatic highs in an absurdly hilarious way thanks to the ridiculous life-sim elements.<br></p><p>From start to finish, <em>Apartment Story</em> will take you about two hours to complete. The writing is strongest in the early sections of the game, as it feels more grounded in the mundanity of Arthur’s depressing life. As the game goes on, and the stakes get higher, the story devolves into melodrama with some predictable beats. But the blending of life sim elements with a high stakes narrative that takes place in a relatively short period of time—both in-game and in reality—makes for a compelling game that has you steadily more invested as it goes on. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Iron Gate has unveiled what’s next for Valheim, uncovering the Bog Witch update, which is preparing to enter public testing. Valheim, which entered early access in 2021, has proven to be a hit with gamers worldwide, offering a tougher-than-average title with base-building, combat, and RPG mechanics.</p>



<p>In the game’s next major update, Iron Gate is adding a mysterious denizen, new multiplayer mechanics, farming, and a range of fresh decorations.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-go-down-to-the-bog">Go Down to the Bog</h2>



<p>The swamps of Valheim aren’t to be trifled with, but per the latest update that Iron Gate is working on, you’ll soon have a new reason to venture down to the bog. In this upcoming patch, players will be able to find The Bog Witch, a mysterious vendor selling all manner of potions, materials, and crafting recipes.</p>



<p>If you’re an adept chef, you’ll be able to utilise new features added in this update to prepare monumental feasts for your friends, thanks to the ingredients and recipes you get from The Bog Witch. To stay on theme, Iron Gate is adding a string of recipes themed on the swamps, such as the Swamp Dweller’s Delight.</p>



<p>In addition, players will be able to grind new and updated skills: Cooking and Farming. If you want, you can equip a scythe to make it easier to harvest your crops – that’s new in this update as well. If that wasn’t enough, Iron Gate is introducing new kitchen stations, a line of decorations, and some mysterious cooking ingredients, keeping everything aligned.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed when The Bog Witch update will arrive, but keep your eyes peeled – it won’t be long.</p>



<p>Do you enjoy playing Valheim? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Lavapotion has revealed the first major DLC for its turn-based strategy game Songs of Conquest. The Vanir DLC update will add a new player faction, units, biome, and more to Songs of Conquest this winter.</p>



<p>According to Lavapotion, the Vanir faction is inspired by Scandinavian and Viking folklore.</p>



<p>“In the world of Aerbor, the Vanir are direct descendants of indebted Baryans and Arleon settlers who have become a raiding nation scouring the Bleak East region for riches,” the studio said. “However, the Bleak East is a hostile place, and the Vanir were forced to embrace the temperamental creatures of the land known as Vildra, allowing them to change into fearsome beasts full of rage and power.”</p>



<h2 id="h-songs-of-conquest-vanir-dlc-details">Songs Of Conquest Vanir DLC Details</h2>



<p>With the addition of the new faction comes new unites for players. There are eight new units in total to build your armies with as Vanir.  Those units are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Huskarl </strong>– a sturdy warrior equipped with a spear and shield that can transform into a Korphan</li>



<li><strong>Berserker </strong>– a juggernaut full of rage that can change into a mighty bear to challenge any who seek to hurt their brethren</li>



<li><strong>Chieftain </strong>– a commander of the Vanir force that can grow to enormous proportions and become the gigantic and mighty Jormr</li>



<li><strong>Swine </strong>– embodying the mythological beast eaten by gods each night only to be resurrected the next day</li>



<li><strong>Troll</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lyke</strong></li>



<li><strong>Bacahorse</strong></li>



<li><strong>Nornor</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Also coming with the DLC are nine new Wielder hero units, five new Conquest maps, and even two new Challenge maps. The maps are built to offer players a challenge while learning the new faction and terrain.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-change-in-plans">A Change In Plans</h2>



<p>The announcement of the Vanir DLC is a change from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/songs-of-conquest-sells-500000-copies-announces-new-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously announced roadmap</a>. Vanir was originally scheduled for the spring 2025, but plans changed after feedback from players.</p>



<p>“While our original plan was to release a large expansion next year that would feature two new factions and a sweeping new campaign, we chose to listen to our players and change our plans to release more content sooner, starting with the release of the Vanir DLC this winter,” Lavapotion founder and CEO Magnus Alm said.  </p>



<p>By changing the focus of development, the Rise Eternal campaign has been pushed back from the fall 2024 release.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Songs of Conquest Vanir DLC launches this winter. An exact release date as well as price will be available at a later date. The game is available on Steam, but is also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/strategy-game-songs-of-conquest-coming-to-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to mobile</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-latest-ruling-in-epic%E2%80%99s-case-against-google-is-sigh-kind-of-a-big-deal.1003899/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/epic-google-app-store-ruling<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in December, Epic Games <a href="https://aftermath.site/epic-wins-google-case-which-i-did-not-see-coming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won its case</a> against Google, which began all the way back in 2020 when Epic<a href="https://kotaku.com/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store-1844717397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> launched its own store</a> on Apple and Google phones and was subsequently banned from their app stores. Epic mostly lost against Apple, but things on the Google front went way better for the company. Yesterday, the judge handed down his final ruling, ordering Google to change its policies in some major ways. Also Tim Sweeney made a groan-worthy joke about it.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a> summarizes, Judge James Donato ordered Google to open up its app store for three years, letting alternate stores like Epic’s mobile Games Store app onto Google Play proper. These stores also aren’t obligated to use Google Play Billing, and can point users to other download and payment options (a big sticking point during both trials). Additionally, Google can’t <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23954107/here-is-the-full-list-of-developers-google-targeted-with-project-hug-deals-in-2019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incentivize developers</a> to launch their apps on the Play store or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23954111/google-boasted-it-got-riot-games-not-to-launch-its-own-app-store-by-offering-10m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>not</em> to launch</a> on other stores or on their own, practices we learned it engaged in during the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23959932/epic-v-google-trial-antitrust-play-store-fortnite-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trial</a> to the tune of eye-watering sums.&nbsp;</p><p>Google has, of course, <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/epic-games-verdict-appeal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appealed</a> the ruling. In its statement, it cites the Apple ruling, writing that “Apple and Google compete directly” for customers and developers, and that “The initial decision and today’s Epic-requested changes… undercut Android’s ability to compete with Apple’s iOS.”&nbsp;</p><p>On Twitter, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney cheered the ruling, <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1843394694975500310" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writing</a> that “all app developers, store makers, carriers, and manufacturers have 3 years to build a vibrant and competitive Android ecosystem with such critical mass that Google can't stop it.” Then, when Google appealed, he <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1843423301169013162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>, “Google has announced it will a peel” and tweeted a&nbsp; picture of <em>Fortnite</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190328130449/https://kotaku.com/fortnites-new-banana-skin-is-not-right-1833066805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nightmare fuel</a> character, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/even-apple-knows-fortnites-peely-is-a-monster-1846860238" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple trial hot topic</a>, Peely.</p><figure></figure><p>Whatever, it’s a tweet, but I will always be fascinated by watching Epic try to figure out who it’s playing to with this fight. Its Apple approach, aimed at <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-about-this-sucks-1844720017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weaponizing players,</a> could be called a failure, though it gave us <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/epics-trial-apple-fortnite-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some laughs</a>. Its Google approach, aimed at being adults in front of the adults on the jury, was far more successful, at the cost of, well, being a bit less fun for regular folks following along at home, though it remains fuel for the "sir" school of reply guys under Sweeney's tweets.&nbsp;</p><p>Sweeney and Epic can never resist the urge to inflate the whole thing a bit too much, but at the same time, it kind of <em>is</em> a big deal. The Google trial jury ruled that Google has a monopoly in app stores and billing on its phones, and through the judge’s ruling yesterday the remedy for that is that it… doesn’t get to have a monopoly anymore, at least temporarily. It’s a big win against big tech, part of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/business/antitrust-case-tracker.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing pushback</a> to these practices. When I talk about these cases with my non-gaming friends, I feel a little bad for myself as I bang the table excitedly and they say, “Wait, you mean the game with the dances?..” Explaining the ways this could actually be good for game developers and players feels a little like carrying water for Epic’s ultimate crusade to make more money.</p><p>As a journalist, I at least have a professional excuse to care about this stuff a bit too much; I will never forget how, early on in the saga, I fell asleep waiting for a filing and had a nightmare that I missed it, only to wake up in a panic and realize I <em>had</em> missed it. My entire relationship to <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-battle-royale-the-kotaku-review-1833890299" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fortnite</em></a> has been a bit like this, an obligation leading to actual interest and a lot of <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnites-black-hole-is-over-1839050526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early mornings</a> and a grudging, growing respect for the things Epic is using its tentpole game to do, even if <a href="https://aftermath.site/bandcamp-just-trying-to-keep-the-lights-on-following-epic-sale-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not all of it is good</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Epic recently launched <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-launches-major-new-lawsuit-in-app-store-fight-this-time-against-samsung-and-google" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>another</em> lawsuit</a> against Google and Samsung, aimed at how <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-phones-eu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hard it is to download its store on their phones</a>. It feels ridiculous–<em>another one</em>, <em>really?</em>--but also it <em>is</em> in fact notably difficult to get the store working on your phone! We’ll see how those cases play out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Dragon Age: The Veilguard Accessibility Options Outlined Ahead of Late October Launch]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-accessibility-options-outlined-ahead-of-late-october-launch.1003887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-accessibility-options<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and BioWare have revealed some of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>'s accessibility options ahead of the game's launch at the end of this month, and the list seems pretty exhaustive.</p>
<p>The accessibility list is part of a series of deep dives detailing everything about&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>, from combat to companions and more, before it arrives. EA says the goal with accessibility in&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is to ensure that everyone can enjoy the game "regardless of skill level or ability".</p>
<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>will offer five preset difficulty levels, running the gamut from the relaxed Storyteller mode through to the intense-sounding Nightmare. An Unbound option will also allow you to customize individual difficulty elements like parry timing, enemy aggression, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-accessibility-combat.jpg?itok=N0SIiGEI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-accessibility-combat.jpg?itok=vFYoxNoC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>will let you customize combat to your heart's content.</figcaption></figure><p>UI elements like your health bar, objective tracker, and minimap can be turned off, and you can also change the game's text size if you're struggling to read it.</p>
<p>If you suffer from motion sickness, you'll probably want to take advantage of the game's Persistent Dot option, which can help your brain to keep track of the action if it's moving too fast. You can also turn off motion blur entirely.</p>
<p>Additionally, you'll find interface elements accompanied by accessibility aids; you can, for instance, add audio cues for incoming attack indicators, as well as adding full-screen filters to help with vision deficiencies.</p>
<p>All in all,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>'s list of accessibility options seems rather comprehensive. You can see the full list of accessibility features the game will have <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/accessibility-spotlight" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>series of dark fantasy RPGs, which began with 2009's&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>.</p>
<p>This latest installment is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer">a pretty far cry</a> from the CRPG-style gameplay of that first entry, though; it's closer in spirit to&nbsp;BioWare's&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>series, focusing as it does on set pieces, companion relationships, and fast-paced action combat rather than real-time-with-pause RPG-style engagements.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dragon-age-the-veilguard/bsdx4fnnc0dk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on October 31st.</p>

In a report published on Tuesday, the <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/">investment firm Hindenburg Research</a> claims Roblox is “consistently overstating the amount of people on its platform by 25 percent to 42 percent or more.”</p><p>Roblox, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578491/roblox-ipo-announced-dau-increase-pandemic">which went public in 2021</a>, reported <a href="https://ir.roblox.com/news/news-details/2024/Roblox-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=non%2DGAAP%20guidance.-,Based%20on%20the%20carrying%20amount%20of%20deferred%20revenue%20and%20deferred,2024%20and%20an%20increase%20in">having 79.5 million</a> daily active users in its most recent earnings report. However, Hindenburg claims Roblox “intentionally conflates” actual people with daily users, as that number could also include alt accounts and bots. The research alleges that Roblox can separate alt accounts from single users, even though the company’s disclosure says daily active users “are not a measure of unique individuals accessing Roblox.”</p><div><p>Hindenburg is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/19/hindenburg-research-is-making-a-name-for-itself-by-taking-on-carl-ichan-gautam-adani-and-others.html">an activist short-selling firm</a> that infamously publishes research when it says it’s identified something shady about a business, allowing it to make a profit as its share value declines. One example is from 2020, when Hindenburg <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436126/nikola-fraud-allegation-hindenburg-short-seller-electric-truck">accused the EV startup Nikola</a> of fraud. Subsequently, an investigation by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848108/nikola-settlement-sec-fraud-trevor-milton-investors">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> resulted in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/18/24006571/nikola-trevor-milton-sentence-prison-fraud-electric-truck">four-year prison sentence</a> for its founder, Trevor Milton.</p></div><p>“We totally reject the claims made in the report,” Desiree Fish, Roblox’s chief communications officer, said in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “The financial claims made by Hindenburg Research are simply misleading. The authors are, admittedly short sellers and have an agenda irrespective of the substance of Roblox’s business model and results.” You can read the statement in full at the bottom of this article.</p><p>The firm also claims Roblox isn’t doing enough to protect children on the platform, alleging its “in-game research revealed an X-rated pedophile hellscape, exposing children to grooming, pornography, violent content and extremely abusive speech.” Roblox <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/short-seller-hindenburg-says-roblox-inflates-user-metrics-compromises-child-safety-92c77b5e?st=ktia3b&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">shares dipped</a> following the release of the report.</p><p>Last week, a financial newsletter also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262033/roblox-the-bear-cave-child-abuse">accused Roblox of enabling child abuse</a>. At the time, Roblox spokesperson Eric Porterfield denied claims that child endangerment is a widespread issue on the platform, saying it frequently updates its safety practices to “catch and prevent malicious activity.”</p><p>Here’s Roblox’s full statement:</p><div><blockquote><p>We totally reject the claims made in the report. The financial claims made by Hindenburg Research are simply misleading. The authors are, admittedly short sellers and have an agenda irrespective of the substance of Roblox’s business model and results. Over the past four quarters our bookings, the amount of cash receipts, have grown over 22% from $780.7 million in Q2 2023 to $955.2 million in Q2 2024. Over the same time, cash provided by operating activities have totaled $646.3 million, free cash flow was $440.3 million, and we have guided to even higher numbers for fiscal 2024. An examination of our GAAP balance sheet and our GAAP cash flow statement makes that clear. The focus on cash bookings and cash flow are themes that we have focused on consistently with investors dating back to our days as a private company. The author made no attempt to highlight any of that because the positive facts simply don’t support their agenda.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div><p><em><strong>Update, October 8th: </strong>Added a statement from Roblox.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Coffee Stain and developer Box Dragon have unveiled a new roguelike deck builder called As We Descend. The reveal took place during Coffee Stain’s “The Spill” showcase event on Tuesday.</p>



<p>“As We Descend takes a strategic twist to the beloved deckbuilding roguelike genre,” the studio said. “Recruit units for your expeditions, navigate political treachery, enlist allies across the city, and take on incomprehensible foes.”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="As We Descent - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4yLbne3m3aA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The first game from Box Dragon, As We Descend features turn-based combat as well as card crafting. There is also relationship building for players which will impact the characters met in a “desperate city which evolves and crumbles in unique ways based on the player’s decisions”.</p>



<p>The game’s director, Kevin Chang, said during The Spill described it as a strategy sandbox based on the decisions players are allowed to make while they play. He also hinted the game has a Dark Souls-like difficulty where it will provide a fair challenge for players.</p>



<p>The game doesn’t have a release date just yet. However, there is a demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769830/As_We_Descend/">available on Steam</a> to give players a first look at what they can expect on a full release.</p>

Paradox's overarching message? It's sticking to what it's good at, and what it's good at is strategy games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"It is not in our strategic direction to make this kind of game," Lilja told PC Gamer. "So if Bloodlines 2, God willing, is successful, Bloodlines 3 [will be] done by someone else, on the license from us. I would say it's the sort of strategic way this would work. So it's still an outlier from what we're supposed to do, we don't know that stuff, so we should probably let other people do it."</p><p>In short, Lilja considers Bloodlines a "dead end" for the company regardless of how well it does, which is made more awkward by the fact that Paradox Interactive owns Vampire: The Masquerade creator White Wolf Publishing. Lilja didn't talk about Paradox's plans for White Wolf, but it seems as if any future Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines RPGs will be licensed out to other developers.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>So if Bloodlines 2, God willing, is successful, Bloodlines 3 [will be] done by someone else, on the license from us</p></div><p>"I think some studios do strategic investments, long term things, because they feel that the cost of not doing it is too high. But, I mean, I think it's fairly clear, at least to me, and I think to you, even in the best of cases, Bloodlines does not have a super long shelf life. That's not the way these games behave. You have an influx of players, there's a bit of word of mouth, and they have a high peak, and then they trail off. And it's not the type of gameplay that develops over time that much. So I think that's part of why these types of games are not really that attractive to us."</p><p>Lilja's comments come amid the still-ongoing development of Bloodlines 2, which was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/22/bloodlines-2-announced">announced back in 2019 as a faithful successor to the original game</a> by Troika Games — considered one of the greatest RPGs ever made. The original development was handled by Hardsuit Labs, but numerous delays and other problems led to its near cancellation before <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-with-a-new-developer-and-release-window">Paradox handed development to The Chinese Room </a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"If we hadn't found The Chinese Room," deputy CEO Mattias Lilja said, "and seen what they'd done with the early work, [cancellation] would have been the next logical step, because we could not continue as we did."</p><p>The Chinese Room is taking what looks like a very different direction from Hardsuit Labs, boiling it down into more of a straightforward action RPG. Fans have posted various comparisons between the two online, noting the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-gameplay-reveals-bloodthirsty-combat">differences between the melee combat</a> among other things.</p><p>"Generally, it's a continuation of the same vision but they had to make it theirs," Lilja told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/paradox-on-bloodlines-2-we-had-a-game-we-could-do-but-maybe-not-with-the-team-we-had" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GI.biz</a> in a separate interview. "When a game has been going this long with a sizable team in Seattle for a number of years before we moved it... It might have commercial  challenges, but we liked the direction."</p><p>Lilja says that Paradox is targeting a first half of 2025 release for Bloodlines 2, and that development is currently on track after its suffered yet another delay in August. </p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.
