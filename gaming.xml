			<p>Despite being released in 2016, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered has skyrocketed in sales. As a result, it has become the second best-selling game on Steam, behind Counter-Strike 2.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered has shot back up the rankings due to the H2M mod, which is set to be released this week. This Modern Warfare 2 revival mod utilizes Modern Warfare Remastered as a foundation.</p>
<p>This highly ambitious mod essentially ports the entirety of Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer to Modern Warfare Remastered. It includes all of the maps, modes, weapons, and some of the newer content released for the game, utilizing single-player environments.</p>
<p>While the mod is free, you must own Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered to play it. This game is currently on sale with a hefty 50% discount, which explains the hefty resurgence in people purchasing the game.</p>
<p>When Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered was first released, it did not perform as well as Activision may have been expecting. Instead, it only had an all-time high of 1,409 players. This was quite a shock, especially since Modern Warfare was one of the older-generation consoles' most favored Call of Duty games. However, with the release of the H2M mod, it's shaping up to surpass the number of 1,409 players.</p>
<p>The H2M mod for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered is set to release on August 16. While Activision did release <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-remastered-both-aged-and-timeless/">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Remastered</a>, it wasn't received well by fans of the game. This is because they stripped it back completely, removing the multiplayer modes, which is a huge reason people played Call of Duty in the first place. Between that and the hefty price tag, it disappointed many players worldwide.</p>
<p>Luckily, on August 16, those who own Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered can play this free H2M mod, allowing players to relive the nostalgia of the Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer game modes.</p>
<p>For those wanting to explore the H2M mod, there is an official website where you can download it, which also includes the <a href="https://h2m-mod.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H2M mod installer</a>. However, it isn't available for download at the moment, as the mod isn't released until August 16. Additionally, this mod can only be used on the Steam version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halloween-is-getting-two-new-games-and-one-uses-unreal-engine-5.951003/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halloween-games-unreal-engine-5<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Two new games based on the horror movie franchise&nbsp;<em>Halloween&nbsp;</em>are currently in development, a new report reveals, and one of them is being built on Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>According to a new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halloween-unreal-engine-5-john-carpenter-boss-team-games" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IGN</a> report,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/evil-dead-game">Evil Dead: The Game</a>&nbsp;</em>publisher Boss Team Games is currently working on two projects based on&nbsp;<em>Halloween</em>.&nbsp;While details are scarce right now, the report does say that one game will be built in Unreal Engine 5 and will feature input from original&nbsp;<em>Halloween&nbsp;</em>director and legendary auteur John Carpenter.</p>
<p>Per IGN, Carpenter, who says he's a "huge gamer", is "thrilled" to be bringing Michael Myers and the&nbsp;<em>Halloween&nbsp;</em>franchise to the world of video games. Carpenter goes on to say that he hopes the games will "scare you silly", which doesn't sound like a difficult mission for a game based on a legendary franchise like this one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/evil-dead-the-game-halloween-games-boss-team.jpg?itok=sqJcqiwU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/evil-dead-the-game-halloween-games-boss-team.jpg?itok=uyHflk63 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Boss Team Games is responsible for&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Right now, Boss Team and Carpenter are remaining relatively tight-lipped regarding what the&nbsp;<em>Halloween&nbsp;</em>games in question will actually be.</p>
<p>However, a press release does state that they'll allow you to "relive moments from the film" and "play as classic characters" from&nbsp;<em>Halloween</em>. Given Boss Team's involvement, it's fair to speculate that we could be getting a&nbsp;<em>Halloween</em>&nbsp;spin on the&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game&nbsp;</em>formula.</p>
<p>Apparently, the Unreal Engine 5 project is still fairly early in development, which presumably means the other game is moving ahead at full steam. If that's the case, we'll probably hear about it sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>These two games would, remarkably enough, be the first titles to be based on&nbsp;<em>Halloween&nbsp;</em>since 1983's Atari 2600 game, which was, as you can probably imagine, pretty basic by today's standards. Myers has also appeared in&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>as a killer, alongside the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-castlevania-crossover-release-date"><em>Castlevania</em>'s Dracula</a>,&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-crossovers-spinoffs">Vecna</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-chucky"><em>Child's Play</em>'s Chucky</a>.</p>

Stay tuned for more on this one as and when we get it.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/SurviveTheT800/status/1823011706836029701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, Nacon announced that it will now delay the Terminator: Survivors launch until 2025, previously expected to release in October 2024.</p>



<p>Nacon broadly cited the need for “some additional time” in order to realize its vision for the game. The studio also wants to “deliver the game that fits your expectations.” </p>



<p>Nacon did not break down the exact cause for delay, nor offer a more concrete release window. </p>



<p>However, the devs say they are impressed by fan enthusiasm, and thanked the community for their understanding and support. Although fans are dismayed by Terminator: Survivors’ delay, they did support the decision to await a smooth launch.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nacon first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terminator-survivors-open-world-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed Terminator: Survivors</a> in February 2024, during the Nacon Connect showcase.  A couple of months later, Nacon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terminator-survivors-offline-story-first-person/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed more details</a> about the game during a Q&amp;A session.</p>



<p>Terminator: Survivors is an open-world survival game and first-person shooter, built in Unreal Engine 5. It will support co-op, as well as offline single-player gameplay.</p>



<p>According to the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2617340/Terminator_Survivors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a>, players will “meet iconic characters of the franchise as well as original ones.” It will also feature “an unexplored storyline” about Judgment Day.</p>



<p>Terminator: Survivors previously planned to launch on PC on October 24, 2024, with console versions releasing later on. Most recently, Nacon shared a development video late last June, explaining the game’s inspiration from James Cameron’s original two films.</p>

		<p>EA has today announced the 13 players that have been given Heroes status for FC 25, with these 13 players made to make players’ teams stronger in Ultimate Team. Those players are&nbsp;Blaise Matuidi, Celia Šašić, Eden Hazard, Fara Williams, Guti, Jaap Stam, Jamie Carragher, Laura Georges, Maicon, Marek Hamšík, Mohammed Noor, Tim Howard, and Zé Roberto. EA SPORTS FC Mobile players will get access to the male Heroes later this year.</p>

<p><em>“There’s a lot of heroes in this beautiful game that we love across the globe, and the fact that I’m one of the FC Heroes this year is special to me,”</em> said Tim Howard. <em>“I’m excited to play in goal in FC 25.”</em></p>
<p><em>“It can be a well-timed challenge, a gut-busting run, a last minute winner or anything in-between, hero status amongst the fans is a badge of honor for any footballer,”</em> said Charlie Villiers, Sr. Director, Franchise Marketing EA SPORTS FC. <em>“With this year’s incredible set of Heroes launching in Ultimate Team this September, we wanted to capture the moments that signaled their commitment to the club and celebrate these players’ journeys to cement hero status.”</em></p>
<p>If a pre-order for EA Sports FC 25 Ultimate Edition is put in by August 20th, buyers will get a day-one ‘Origin Hero’ item, which will automatically upgrade to a Prime Hero item on November 28th.</p>

<p>In our FC 25 Preview, I wrote, <em>“While this press preview only gave a small look at what to expect with FC 25, my general impression is a little mixed. The main game feels more of the same from FC 24, with the on the pitch action not being too different. It is Rush mode that really gives some fresh breath of life (more so than the name change) to the series, and I think it will be incredibly popular for all players due to how entertaining and quick it is.”</em></p>
<p>EA Sports FC 25 will be available on September 27th, 2024 for most players, though those who get the Ultimate Edition will be able to play the game from September 20th.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/just-crow-things-review-%E2%80%93-rising-to-the-caw-of-doody.950970/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/just-crow-things-review-rising-to-caw-of-doody<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From the wild imaginations at Unbound Creations comes <em>Just Crow Things</em>, an unabashed meme game where you poop on everyone and caw at everything. If caw-sing chaos and winging solutions on the fly are your jam, then this game might already be on your wishlist.</p>
<p><em>Just Crow Things</em> isn’t meant to be taken seriously; there’s no profound message or rich setting here. It knows what it’s about and commits to the bit, rolling from punchline to punchline with no time to roost. However, sometimes it sacrifices some fun factors along the way.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, this is a lighthearted sandbox of bird-flavored whimsy. It’s perfect for an afternoon of silly, breezy fun.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/just-crow-things-leaf-blower.jpg?itok=HbvwzlPW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/just-crow-things-leaf-blower.jpg?itok=NGBVkykU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>She's teaching him how to fly!</figcaption></figure><h2>This Is What Beak Performance Looks Like</h2>
<p>Your goal in <em>Just Crow Things</em>, almost always, is to cause chaos. You can fly up and swoop down on humans to make them panic and drop shiny objects. Tools like baseball bats and hand torches can be picked up and used. How can a crow do that? Dunno, and don’t care.</p>
<p>There are 12 levels in total, a few of them being optional and one being the tutorial. In each level, you find NPCs who give you tasks, all of which usually involve defacing something or disrupting someone.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/just-crow-things-cat-dog.jpg?itok=h2Ug1aRb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/just-crow-things-cat-dog.jpg?itok=d2zh1xHu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>When you get a lot of quests, the UI can be a little messy. But also it's all in Comic Sans, so it's fine.</figcaption></figure><p>For example, a character might ask you to poop on some humans to show them a thing or two about encroaching on someone else’s territory. The trick is, you need to eat some food to generate poop. That’s just science.</p>
<p>However, they do say you are what you eat, and that kind of rings true here. Eating an average fruit will give you average poops, but a pepper will give you fiery poops that set people ablaze. Fire poop bombing a car will make it explode. Again, that’s just science.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/just-crow-things-big-cat.jpg?itok=Opm2t1bu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/just-crow-things-big-cat.jpg?itok=xbwwtqxc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>No, I will not elaborate.</figcaption></figure><p>As I got further into&nbsp;<em>Just Crow Things</em> though, I felt like some of the quests were a bit tedious and meandering. Some made me feel like I was finding needles in a haystack or just running circles around the maps looking for small details.</p>
<p>It sort of hampers the fun when you get a quest to use an item on specific spots in the map, because you have to carry that one item around while scanning the map. It takes away your agency to just explore, poke, and prod at the world at your leisure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/just-crow-things-leaf-blower-tasks.jpg?itok=s5x_wvnI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/just-crow-things-leaf-blower-tasks.jpg?itok=SlWYXCcM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Blowing away three humans is easy, but imagine having to use the leaf blower in five specific places all around the map.</figcaption></figure><p>If you drop a quest item to explore, the map will tell you where it is at least, so you don’t have to worry about losing something important if you go on a personal side quest.</p>
<p>There are also races you can do in every level, where you compete against the clock while going through some checkpoints. As a whole, these feel like the weakest link in <em>Just Crow Things</em>. There isn't much humor or storytelling to them, and the controls can get a little finicky when it asks for precision.</p>

I’ve found that doing the story quests usually gets you to 100+ easily, with the races offering an extra 20 points total.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this approach to the gameplay; I didn’t have to be a completionist to feel like a completionist, which makes this appealing as a casual game. It's not a deep commitment, and you don't have to collect all the feathers here. Even the races can be made easier if they’re giving you trouble.</p>
<p>It just falls in line with the philosophy of <em>Just Crow Things</em>: we’re here to have fun, take it easy, and have a laugh.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/just-crow-things-sandstorm.jpg?itok=fVwQm8bU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/just-crow-things-sandstorm.jpg?itok=BHoL5QaO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Darude??</figcaption></figure><h2>Going on a Meta Quest</h2>
<p>A lot of the humor in <em>Just Crow Things</em> is referential, meta, and absurd, and it doesn’t waste time being in your face about it. Sometimes, it's nice and complements the gameplay well.</p>
<p>For example, there's a&nbsp;stage set on the moon. The first NPC makes a Commander Shepard reference and then asks you to find resources using a metal detector. The entire stage is basically that planet-probing mini-game from <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, which is kind of clever and doesn't overstay its welcome.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/just-crow-things-gas-station.jpg?itok=JjobgbJQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/just-crow-things-gas-station.jpg?itok=maKxta-6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Zombies? At a gas station??</figcaption></figure><p>There’s also a fantasy level that depicts a generations-long war between cats and dogs. It's up to you to help one side or the other (or find a third secret ending). In this case, the meta-humor blends well with the gameplay, creating an opportunity for novel gameplay.</p>
<p>However, the referential humor can get a little old or obvious. In this totally-not-Skyrim level, the first thing the first NPC says is, “You’re finally awake.” Then a cat says they have wares. I wouldn’t be surprised if I missed an arrow-to-the-knee joke, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/just-crow-things-half-life.jpg?itok=I352IsGC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/just-crow-things-half-life.jpg?itok=LvivxkW_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I hear she's spent half her life at the crow bar.</figcaption></figure><p>I won’t spoil all the references, but that’s the sort of vibe <em>Just Crow Things</em> brings to the table. At its core, it’s a silly game about a silly lil' birb, and the extra references feel like winks and nods to the player. You just might see a lot of them coming and shake your head.</p>
<p>At an overarching level, the game doesn’t quite stick the landing by the end of the story, either. It resolves a pretty fluffy, easygoing narrative, which is fine, but it’s paired with a nothingburger of a final level. If it was a reference to something, I’ve missed it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/just-crow-things-customization.jpg?itok=6fmJ26EV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/just-crow-things-customization.jpg?itok=la5UqBGg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's a lot of customization options to make the crow feel uniquely yours.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Just Crow Things</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, <em>Just Crow Things</em> is a game about the journey, not the destination. It truly is a sandbox of silly tools and sillier jokes, and the New Game+ just unlocks a literal sandbox mode where you can spawn objects in each stage.</p>
<p>In some ways, it rides the line between being a love letter and a playful mockery of the games it’s referencing, and that’s what makes it a decent comedy game. Even if the jokes get a little tiresome or obvious, it’s all in good fun. It just unfortunately loses some of that fun toward the end.</p>
<hr><p><em><strong>Just Crow Things</strong>&nbsp;was reviewed on a Steam Deck with a copy provided by the developer. All screenshots were taken during the process of review over 7 hours.</em></p>

<div>
<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Just Crow Things thrives off its own absurdity, referential meta humor, and chaotic silliness. Most jokes land, though some you can see coming a mile away. Though it does sacrifice some fun for the sake of its comedy, making the latter stages feel tiresome. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

            <p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadows-of-doubt">Shadows Of Doubt</a> you can fall from the roof of a corporate office building during a routine investigation, shatter all the bones in your frail detective body, wake up in a clinic fully healed, and then sprint out the door without paying your sky-high hospital bills while the clinic's auto-turret shoots at you for doing a medical dine and dash. The early access game is on our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-immersive-sims-on-pc">best immersive sims</a> list for a reason, you know, and now it has an autumn release date for the final version, along with a new trailer.</p>

<p>It's creeping out of the early access vents on September 26th. Ed once described the gumshoe detective game as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadows-of-doubt-update-adds-gated-communities-and-snipers-making-it-even-more-of-a-reverse-hitman-game">"reverse Hitman"</a>, referring to the fully simulated little city that you've got to navigate and understand in order to solve the murder cases that fill up your corkboard. The procedurally generated folks leave behind evidence of their movements in the form of emails, fingerprints, address books, CCTV footage, and more. It's your job to follow these trails and solve some murders. </p>
<p>"Shadows Of Doubt is like no other detective game I've played," said Rachel when she <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadows-of-doubt-early-access-preview">reviewed it in early access</a> last year. She did have some complaints about how often her cases seemed to hit a dead end, but still found it "gripping" and "refreshing". I've only played it for the teeniest, tiniest moment. But I did get a taste for how detailed the world felt by nosying about in apartment buildings and convenience store backrooms. That was before I broke all my bones, of course.</p>
<p>Since its first appearance the game has added <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadows-of-doubts-first-major-content-update-adds-cheats-liars-and-a-fancy-hotel">fancy hotels</a>, player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadows-of-doubt-modding-tools-will-let-you-build-cities-and-write-your-own-murder-mysteries">modding tools</a>, and a new type of murderer: the sharpshooter. A fun bug then led to said snipers filling rooms with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadows-of-doubts-sharpshooter-assassins-keep-missing-and-leaving-huge-piles-of-wasted-ammo-everywhere">hundreds of shell casings</a> as they continually missed their would-be victims. Game development is rad.</p>
<p>We're not told what fun and murderous japes will be added for the upcoming 1.0 release, but new features "will be revealed in the coming weeks," say developers ColePowered Games. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to a recent <a href="https://ir.motorsportgames.com/node/9786/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financial report</a>, Motorsport Games saw a notable improvement with revenue and net income increases for Q2 2024. </p>



<p>In the new report, Motorsport Games revenue was “$1.9 million compared to $1.7 million for the same period in the prior year.” It adds that net income for the latest quarter was “$2.4 million in Q2 2024 compared to a net loss of $8.2 million in Q2 2023.”</p>



<p>It is a far more optimistic report, following “substantial doubt” surrounding the company in its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/motorsport-games-earnings-company-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concerning April 2024 SEC filing</a>. </p>



<p>Now, Motorsport Games says its “detachment from historical challenges” could appeal to new “investors and potential acquirers.” </p>



<figure><figcaption>(image via Motorsport Games)</figcaption></figure>







<p>Motorsport Games also commented on plans for Le Mans Ultimate, following “strong customer reception.” </p>



<p>The publisher stated that “we have decided to accelerate efforts to bring this to title to games consoles and reach a larger audience.” While it did not confirm an exact release window or date, the console versions should now arrive sooner than expected.</p>



<p>Le Mans Ultimate, developed by Studio 397, first launched into Early Access in February 2024. At launch, it earned “Mostly Positive” reviews on Steam. Last July, it also released a 2024 Season Pass as DLC.</p>



<p>Fans may also recognize Motorsport Games for a variety of NASCAR games, including the NASCAR Heat series.</p>

While some can be played in as little as 5-10 minutes, others can span multiple days of play, or more. While <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-game-table">board game tables</a> are great for the tabletop experience, they don't always solve the storage problem. Eventually you'll need to find a place to keep your board games when you aren't playing.</p><p>Whether you want to display your board game collection proudly, or keep your obsession hidden until the opportune moment, we assembled a list of some of our favorite places to store our board games. Now you have an excuse to keep building that collection. You're welcome.</p><p id="ikea-kallax"><h2 data-toc-title="Ikea Kallax">Ikea Kallax</h2></p><div catalogid="012b9671-d411-46ba-9d82-2243384df9bb" id="205877"><div id="205877" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Ikea Ikea Kallax</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Model Number</strong>: N/A</li><li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 15.38"D x 57.88"W x 57.88"H</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> $274</li><li><strong>Age Rating</strong>: Adult</li></ul><p>Board gamers around the world are united in their love of Ikea’s Kallax range as the go-to option for board game storage. The cubic compartments are the perfect size to store the modern square boxes favoured by most publishers, stacked either horizontally or vertically as you prefer. And the subdivisions, alongside options for compartment doors and storage boxes, mean you can also tuck away more oddly-sized games with ease. And of course, like everything else from Ikea, it’s reasonably priced and comes with that Scandinavian sense of effortless cool.</p></div><p id="better-homes-gardens-12-cube-stora"><h2 data-toc-title="Better Homes &amp; Gardens 12-Cube Stora">Better Homes &amp; Gardens 12-Cube Storage Organizer</h2></p><div catalogid="7d69bba9-3bbc-4d31-b54b-d50d05e589d8" id="205878"><div id="205878" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Better Homes &amp; Gardens 12-Cube Storage Organizer</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Model Number</strong>: N/A</li><li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 57.4" W x 15.35" D x 43.35" H</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> $108</li><li><strong>Age Rating</strong>: Adult</li></ul><p>What’s better than a Kallax for board game storage? A set of shelves that does everything a Kallax does, but cheaper! Trust Walmart to provide this excellent alternative as part of its Better Homes &amp; Gardens range. Like its inspiration, it also comes in a range of sizes - the linked suggestion is the biggest - and it even one-ups the original by offering a wider range of colors and finishes.

<p>The new&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/moguri-mod/install?authuser=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9.0 version</a>, which can be installed via the latest version of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FAlbeoris%2FMemoria%2Freleases%2Fdownload%2Fv2024.08.05%2FMemoria.Patcher.exe&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw2zeEMg28ddZxLiY7sTdlXp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memoria patcher</a>, introduces significant visual improvements to field backgrounds, a full rework of battle backgrounds, a redrawing of many layer edges, improvements for most lights, animated textures upscale on monster and NPCs, some reworked FMVs and many visual bug fixes.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/norland-roadmap-through-november-promises-barons-usurpers-and-walls-oh-my.950943/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/norland-roadmap-august-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Long Jaunt and publisher Hooded Horse have revealed the&nbsp;<em>Norland&nbsp;</em>roadmap for the first part of the game's Early Access release, and there's plenty on the way to keep you occupied.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1857090/view/4363510595761745133" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the game's Steam page</a>,&nbsp;<em>Norland&nbsp;</em>developer Long Jaunt says it's planning to release roadmaps for&nbsp;<em>Norland</em> "every three months", and each roadmap will highlight significant features making their way to the game in the months following the roadmap's release.</p>
<p>For now, the developer says it's working on&nbsp;<em>Norland</em>'s family tree interface and Steam achievements, although the former is "a very complex task", so it could be a while before it appears in the game. In the meantime, several other major features are planned for the next few months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/norland-roadmap-november-2024.jpg?itok=R7_dZjK5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/norland-roadmap-november-2024.jpg?itok=nOOpbcCX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Norland&nbsp;</em>has plenty of new features coming your way in the next few months.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, this month, Long Jaunt is adding lords' graves and the ability to command your troops to attack archers to the game, as well as general optimizations to make your time with&nbsp;<em>Norland&nbsp;</em>just that little bit smoother.</p>
<p>Optimizations continue throughout September, which is also when ranged towers will be added to the game, along with unique guests for your settlement. Finally, in October, you're getting some bigger features in the form of barons and usurpers, as well as city walls and gates to keep your settlement safe.</p>
<p>All of this will happen alongside "bug fixing and quick support throughout the entire period", as well as more stuff that Long Jaunt and Hooded Horse will "reveal soon".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Norland</em>, it's a medieval colony sim with shades of games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/rimworld">RimWorld</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings&nbsp;</em>(both of which are, incidentally, mentioned on&nbsp;<em>Norland</em>'s Steam page).</p>
<p>It's your job to steer your colony through political intrigue, war, and other dilemmas, all while tending to the basic needs of your citizens. After <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/norland-delayed-kingdom-sim-manor-lords-publisher">being delayed</a>, the game was released in Early Access back in July, and the devs say the current plan is to keep the game there for "around a year", although this may change depending on "how the design develops with player feedback".</p>
<p><em>Norland&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1857090/Norland/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.</p>

Soh’s upgrade screen is presented as a circle, split up into five segments, and aside from two of them requiring a prerequisite skill to access, you can pick and choose as you wish. This allows you to easily form a preferential playstyle, although some upgrades stand out better than others. Here’s what you need to know.</p><h2 id="h48"><a id=""></a><strong>When are Upgrades for Soh Unlocked?</strong></h2><p><strong>You’ll be able to start upgrading Soh after defeating Batsu</strong>, the fifth boss (arguably sixth if we consider Enri Village) and eleventh stage. You’re likely to recognize this monster as the one who hit you with a cheap shot during a prologue cutscene and took some of your powers. On top of unlocking the Spearman villager and enacting some sweet revenge, Soh’s mask will also appear on the upgrade screen after you’ve slain Batsu. You can distribute any Musubi to unlock Soh’s upgrades from this point on.</p><h2 id="h49"><a id=""></a><strong>The Best Archery Skills to Upgrade</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="16000ae9cf10e1da9d252924b668e339" data-recommend-id="image://16000ae9cf10e1da9d252924b668e339" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some swirly fighty action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Some swirly fighty action." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="16000ae9cf10e1da9d252924b668e339" data-recommend-id="image://16000ae9cf10e1da9d252924b668e339" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some swirly fighty action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Whether they’re flying or simply very dangerous, some enemies are a pain to fight with only melee attacks. Leaving them to Archers and eventually other ranged units isn’t always the most dependable solution either. This is what makes Soh’s archery abilities a must-have for anyone playing <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>.<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Archery - Allows Soh to use a bow. This is a prerequisite skill to unlock the others, and gaining access to the bow alone results in a monumental advantage.</li><li>Butterfly Shot - Charging the bow before firing will teleport Soh to an enemy that’s hit. Aside from being a great way to follow up on flying enemies, the latter stages feature targets in normally inaccessible areas. Equipping this ability will let you access elusive chests or even some defilement in need of purifying.</li><li>Pinnacle Shot - <strong>Charging the bow before firing will fire an arrow that deals heavy damage to an enemy’s health and resist gauge.</strong> Between the strong knockback on smaller enemies and the heavy damage it inflicts, this is one of my favorite abilities. I highly recommend giving this a chance if you’re having trouble stunning flying or more tanky enemies.</li></ul><h2 id="h50"><a id=""></a><strong>The Best Command Screen Skills to Upgrade</strong></h2><p>I wouldn’t blame you for thinking the Command Screen is a bit rudimentary. Individually managing the villagers can be a chore and a menu just for moving them feels quite bare-bones. Thankfully, most of the abilities in the Command Screen section add some lovely features worth investing in. Two of them strangely don’t have anything to do with the Command Screen, although they’re still both crucial additions to any play style.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Assemble - Every villager can be summoned to the same location. This is purely a quality-of-life upgrade, but it’s very worth it when you’re directing more and more villagers.</li><li>Yoshiro’s Guide - Yoshiro can be ordered to stop or continue moving from the command screen. By default, you can only give this order when you’re physically next to Yoshiro. With how much you can be scrambling during the day, this is a wonderful upgrade for efficiency’s sake.</li><li>Tsuba Guard Slot Increase - <strong>Unlocks an extra Tsuba Guard Slot.

Only one style can be used at a time.<br></p><p>It ultimately comes down to preference when comparing Oka Dance vs Shiden Dance. I enjoyed using the free-flowing nature of the default style throughout my first run in <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>, but Shiden is pretty impressive against bosses. The upgrades for both styles simply add a resist gauge-depleting combo ender whenever you hold down the Dance Attack button. This comes down to preference again, although the following felt the most useful:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Oka Form 2 - Soh only has one upward-swinging slash that can hit flying enemies, and this tacks on resist gauge damage too. Shell out the meager five Musubi for this if you hate dealing with Seethe in the air as much as I do.</li><li>Oka Form 4 - While it takes the longest string of attacks to activate and it’s the most chaotic to control, this is another favorite ability of mine. Its long reach makes it ideal for hitting multiple enemies and avoiding attacks.</li><li>Shiden Form 1 - Unlike the Oka Forms, every Shiden Form ability ends in the same attack. I suggest the very first form ability so that you can bring out this powerful move as soon as possible.</li></ul><h2 id="h52"><a id=""></a><strong>The Best of Soh’s Other Abilities to Upgrade</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="24622834e9b10ab65136e939665da28a" data-recommend-id="image://24622834e9b10ab65136e939665da28a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dancy dancy action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dancy dancy action." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="24622834e9b10ab65136e939665da28a" data-recommend-id="image://24622834e9b10ab65136e939665da28a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dancy dancy action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Last, but certainly not least, is what’s considered Soh’s “Other Abilities.” A much better way to describe these is Combat Abilities, since that’s what they all revolve around.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/five-things-we-noticed-in-echoes-of-wisdom-traversing-hyrule-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This past week,&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>fans around the world were treated to a closer look at the world of Hyrule with&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-hyrule"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> traversing&nbsp;Hyrule trailer</a>. Not only does this appear to be the largest Hyrule we've ever seen in a top-down&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game, but it's filled with small details and characters that bring the game to life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's pretty clear that <i>Echoes of Wisdom</i>&nbsp;is taking inspiration from&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild">Breath of the Wild</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, from its vast, open world to its Echoes, Bind, and Reverse Bond abilities. Reviewing the trailer ahead of the&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>&nbsp;release date on September 26, here are five things we noticed that we're excited for.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>1. Bridging the Worlds of 2D and 3D <em>Zelda</em> Games</h2>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>is a series that has been brilliantly translated both to 2D and 3D platforms, from top-down perspectives exploring caves to massive three-dimensional Gleeok battles. Many of the elements of a traditional&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>&nbsp;(combat, exploration, etc.) translate well whether you're approaching them in 2D or 3D, but there are some features that seem solely attributed to one or the other, and this is where&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>can bridge the gap.</p>
<p>Creatures like the Zora are typically only seen in 3D <i>Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</i>games, with some exceptions like <em>Oracle of Ages</em>. The Gerudo also predominantly exist in the 3D&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>universe, with the exception of&nbsp;<em>Four Swords Adventure.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Horse transportation, meanwhile, is a predominantly 3D&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>feature. Horses definitely appear and are even ridable in games like&nbsp;<em>Oracle of Ages</em>, but&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>traversing Hyrule trailer showed us, for the first time, what free-roaming horse riding will be like in a top-down perspective.</p>
<p>This reinforces the possibility that the&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>&nbsp;Hyrule is going to be among the largest we've seen in a 2D&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

<h2>2. Locations Abound: The Expanse of Hyrule&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Not only does the&nbsp;<em>Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>traversing Hyrule trailer show us Princess Zelda riding a horse across the vast world, it also shows a variety of unlockable warp points. We don't have the full map as a reference yet, but the small section of the map revealed in the trailer with multiple warp points visible is a hint at just how gigantic these regions are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just from what we've seen so far, we know the following locations include:</p>
<ul><li>Hyrule Castle</li>
<li>Castle Town&nbsp;</li>
<li>Kakariko Village&nbsp;</li>
<li>Gerudo Desert / Oasis</li>
<li>Jabul Waters and its two Zora villages&nbsp;</li>
<li>Eldin Volcano</li>
<li>Goron City&nbsp;</li>
<li>Faron Wetlands</li>
</ul><p>Plus, in one of the side quests that the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>trailer reveals, "Finding the Flying Plant,"&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>mentions other never-before-seen locations like Suthron Village and Suthron Forest. It's possible there will be many Hylian villages sprawled across the world for players to visit during their journey.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>3. Weather &amp; Smoothies: The RPG Elements of <em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em></h2>
<p>Recent&nbsp;<em>Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>games have leaned more heavily into RPG elements, and&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>looks to be&nbsp;no exception. Both&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild&nbsp;</em>and <i>Tears of the Kingdom</i>&nbsp;required proper clothing or elixirs in order to tolerate the different weather systems across Hyrule, and that appears to carry over to this title. Though not explicitly revealed, we do see Zelda herself sweating in the desert, looking to be on the brink of heat exhaustion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also know that a traditional Gerudo outfit is available for her to wear, as well as many other clothing items shown in the&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>traversing Hyrule trailer. This Hyrule will have rivers, oceans, deserts, snowy mountaintops, and so much more, so it would make sense to have appropriate clothing for each biome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also know that Business Scrubs will sell smoothies with different effects, like resistance to electricity, fire, and other elements. It wouldn't be wild speculation to think that smoothies could offer some protection from the natural elements while adventuring.</p>

<h2>4. Echoes of Wisdom: Accessorize, Accessorize, Accessorize&nbsp;</h2>
<p>In addition to clothing and weapons, Zelda has access to an assortment of accessories that grant different abilities. We've only been shown a few so far, but the ones we know about include:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Zora's Flippers</strong>: Helps you swim faster</li>
<li><strong>Zora Scale</strong>: Helps you dive deeper&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Frog Ring</strong>: Helps you jump higher&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Heart Pin</strong>: Makes hearts appear more often</li>
</ul><p>It appears like you can only equip one accessory at a time, so prioritizing which accessory to have for each challenge will be critical for success.</p>

<h2>5. Reverse Bond &amp; Its Game-Breaking Possibilities&nbsp;</h2>
<p>In addition to creating Echoes, Bind &amp; Reverse Bond are new abilities that can help Zelda traverse the landscape, defeat enemies, and solve puzzles.&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li><strong>Echoes:&nbsp;</strong>Cast a recreation of an enemy or object&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Bind:&nbsp;</strong>Bind Zelda to an&nbsp;object and it will follow her movements. This can be used to unearth buried treasure chests or reposition enemies. You can use Bind on Echoes.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Reverse Bond:&nbsp;</strong>Zelda will go where the object goes. Players can cast an Echo, use Bind, and use Reverse Bond, allowing them to climb walls with a spider or fly with a seagull.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>These abilities feel very similar to Ultrahand in&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>&nbsp;in the way that players can use them in infinitely creative and game-breaking ways. Bind and Reverse Bond allow you to tackle challenges in myriad ways, ensuring no two playthroughs will be exactly alike.</p>
<p>As for whoever the final boss may be, I look forward to seeing the different strategies in defeating them as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>&nbsp;will arrive on September 26 with plenty of other mysteries to explore and solve, like what exactly is on the other side of those&nbsp;rifts. <em>Legend of Zelda</em> fans just have a little bit longer to wait before they can uncover for themselves just how vast this latest iteration of Hyrule is.</p>

And he didn’t even break a leg this time. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,196923,196922" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It shouldn’t necessarily come as a surprise that the movie obsessive would be the one to do the hand-off between the 2024 games and the 2028 event in Los Angeles. No one still living embodies Hollywood quite like Cruise, and if anyone was going to jump down from the stadium rafters for a hokey publicity stunt it was going to be the guy who regularly mugs the camera outside theaters to keep the dream of the double-feature matinee alive.  </p><p>After tumbling down from the Stade de France catwalk and taking the stage to officiate the passing of the Olympic torch between Paris and L.A., Cruise put the Olympic flag on a motorcycle and took off into the night. A pre-filmed segment then followed showing Cruise arriving by plane into the U.S. before eventually being spotted by a transformed Hollywood hills sign. The closing ceremony wrapped up with a concert on Venice Beach featuring the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre. “Can’t Stop” and “Drop It Like It’s Hot” were played, both of which are now 20 years old. </p><p>Prior to the hand-off ceremony, Cruise was spotted at other matches throughout the Summer Olympics, most noticeably the women’s soccer final where, sporting big, dark aviators, he enthusiastically joined the thunderous applause when Mallory Swanson cemented the U.S. national team’s victory with a beautiful goal in the 57th minute. It was Cruise who got the applause last night, however, with an outpouring of appreciation for his rollercoaster ride to becoming the last major movie star in the world. </p><p>The 2024 Summer Olympics themselves felt at points like an unusual return to the days of everyone tuning into and reacting to the same blockbuster movie, TV show, or sporting event, the type of thing Cruise now seems to have made it his life’s mission to preserve. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I don’t consider myself an achievement hunter. I see the appeal, and I’m excited to watch one of those videos on YouTube of someone achieving one of the rarest trophies in a game, but I don’t want to put in the work myself.

<h2 id="h-when-can-you-play-black-myth-wukong">When Can You Play Black Myth: Wukong?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Game Science</figcaption></figure>



<p>Seriously, I’m right there with you. I want to get my hands on Black Myth: Wukong! But if you’re looking to track down and unlock all achievements in Black Myth: Wukong, you must wait until August 20 to play the game.</p>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong launches simultaneously on PC and PlayStation 5, but sadly, there’s still no word about the Xbox Series X|S release date. It’s coming; the studio just doesn’t know when.</p>



<hr>



<p>To help you unlock achievements, it’s nice knowing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-open-world-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game is mostly linear</a> so that you won’t have to run far and wide. What do you think? Would Black Myth: Wukong be better as an open-world game or a linear one?</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The 20 Best Games Of 2024 (So Far)</p>
      </div>
<p>Classic horror film franchises have been the source material behind several asymmetrical horror games as of late, with notable examples being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/friday-the-13th-the-game-review/1900-6416692/" data-ref-id="1900-6416692">Friday the 13th</a>, Evil Dead, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review-thrill-of-the-hunt/1900-6418102/" data-ref-id="1900-6418102">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</a>. Halloween's first video game was released in 1983 for Atari systems, and since then, the film franchise's iconic slasher Michael Myers has appeared as a DLC character in games like Dead by Daylight and Call of Duty: Ghosts.</p><p>The two Halloween games don't have a release date yet, and development is said to still be in the early stages. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-carpenter-still-wants-to-direct-a-dead-space-movie-cant-stop-playing-fallout-76/1100-6508208/" data-ref-id="1100-6508208">noted gamer John Carpenter</a> is also involved in another video game project, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/toxic-commando-is-a-new-horror-shooter-from-the-mind-of-john-carpenter/1100-6514976/" data-ref-id="1100-6514976">Toxic Commando</a>, a team-based shooter set in an original world created by the famous writer and director.</p>

<p>According to a new report <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halloween-unreal-engine-5-john-carpenter-boss-team-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by IGN</a>, Boss Team Games is working on two new titles based on the classic Halloween 1978 film.</p>



<p>One of the games will feature Unreal Engine 5 development and direct input from the original film’s iconic director, John Carpenter. </p>



<p>In IGN’s report, Carpenter says that “as a huge gamer myself, I’m thrilled to help bring Michael Myers to life again in this game, and my hope is to scare you silly.”</p>



<p>Fans my recognize Boss Team Games as the publisher behind Evil Dead: The Game. Saber Interactive announced the game would <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/evil-dead-content-stopped/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">end its content cycle</a> in September 2023.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Boss Team Games’ title in the works with Unreal Engine 5 is still “in early development.” Today’s new report also reveals that players will “relive moments from the film and play as classic characters.” IGN’s report did not offer details on the second game.</p>



<p>Boss Team Games will develop both titles based on the beloved IP alongside Compass International Pictures and Further Front. </p>



<p>Halloween 1978 remains a legendary horror film, and among horror games, Michael Myers did show up in Dead by Daylight. However, that chapter first appeared nearly a decade ago in 2016 as the very first paid DLC.</p>



<p>Most recently, Blumhouse Productions delivered a new trilogy of Halloween films that ignored canon after the original movie.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/exploring-12-sided-studios-jasper-william-cartwright-on-empowering-creators<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://12sidedstudios.com/">12 Sided Studios</a> is a new UK-based production studio founded by Jasper William Cartwright, who fans of Actual Plays and TTRPG adjacent content like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b6ff64e2-0570-485e-860b-402771d3faf6" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/we-chat-dimension-20-burrows-end-generational-trauma-and-environmental">Dimension 20</a>, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a9a9913f-42e9-4189-bbde-08061c01a7e8" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/matthew-mercer-interview">Critical Role</a>, and 3 Black Halflings would be more than familiar with. This new studio plans to be "the go-to team for production support of promotional, creative shoots, films, and events while also making Actual Play, YouTube, and Twitch content."</p>
<p>Last week we had the chance to sit down with Cartwright to talk more about how 12 Sided Studios came to be, what this could mean for those making nerdy content in the UK, and what this means for current and future productions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Our entire ethos and idea is that we want to make high-end nerdy, sci-fi, fantasy content across multiple different platforms"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea behind the creation of 12 Sided Studios came from Cartwright and Chad Pytel, Co-Founder and Executive Producer, around a year ago, but for Cartwright, the desire to become a director has been something he's been thinking about for around 15 years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I wouldn't say I'm a control freak, but I like to bring people in who are better at me in a specific thing to do it"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's this desire to have a creative vision, and then work with a talented network of creators to take his vision and "go away and make [his] ideas even better."</p>
<p>As Cartwright and Pytel had been discussing the possibility of creating 12 Sided Studio Cartwright had to admit that it wasn't just a matter of who and where, but also when.</p>

<p>"It came at a time when my own 'brand'," Cartwright explained with raised quotation fingers "which for an English person I find it so horrible trying to promote myself, but where I've started to get a bit of a following and found that especially within the TTRPG industry the doors are starting to open. It felt like a perfect time to bring in a little more structure."</p>
<h2>Creating High-Quality Content Where There's An Audience</h2>
<p>In discussing the important aspects of 12 Sided Studios Cartwright explained "we're trying to bridge the gap between more traditional media, because a lot of us at the studio have experience with the traditional media setup, and bridging the gap into the online creator space."</p>
<p>Not only are they looking to create that gap but another aim is to be flexible in a day and age where IP can transcend a variety of media types. An easy example Cartwright was able to give was of Critical Role's <em>Legends of Vox Machina</em>, that is about to launch it's third season with an adaptation of Critical Role Campaign 2 already on the way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/legends-of-vox-machina-s3-opening-screenshot.jpg?itok=QP-LOvRQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/legends-of-vox-machina-s3-opening-screenshot.jpg?itok=Yx2moJKG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Legends of Vox Machina is an animated retelling of Critical Role's first campaign, available on Amazon Prime</figcaption></figure><p>Cartwright lamented the way that high-quality content not understood by traditional media doesn't get the attention it deserves. "There's no reason that traditional media shouldn't be looking at this space for things like TV and Film."</p>
<p>"When traditional media is looking at a book a lot of the shows and people that we're talking to right now have a bigger following and more of an audience, a more dedicated audience, than maybe that book which has already got a five-movie deal"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The reaction to our announcement and our behind the scenes conversations has been so overwhelmingly positive where we think maybe the sky's the limit here?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"That's where I see 12 Sided Studio being a player in the space," he continued "We see a creator producing the highest quality stories. We want to make sure that they are seen by the big players and make sure that when we make content that the big players can see it and go 'Oh, I can already see how we can turn that into a TV series or a Video Game.'"</p>
<p>In the early days of 12 Sided Studios they don't want to overspecify in any one area but Cartwright acknowledges "as the years roll on we'll get more focused naturally because time and resources are finite."</p>
<h2>Continued Projects And Collaborating With Creators</h2>
<p>Two shows that Cartwright was already producing, 3 Black Halflings and the Rotating Heroes Podcast, will be folded underneath the 12 Sided Studios banner but that's not all that 12 Sided Studios is working on.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/banner-image-for-three-black-halflings.jpg?itok=WdQSbHiN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/banner-image-for-three-black-halflings.jpg?itok=l45dUpaw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"Consistency is key with any kind of content that you put out, but the main reason and benefit of this is that we can improve the content itself." Cartwright explained that with the backing of 12 Sided Studios he was hoping to offer up more for viewers such as creating better value for money via their Patreon in the form of guest appearances, such as a visit to Worldcon later this year, and behind the scenes and other on-screen content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We have some pretty big collaborations upcoming with some well known brands in the TTRPG space"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Cartwright and I spoke he did tease that there were projects that they were working on with a variety of talent that fans of the Actual Play space would be familiar with, as well as a "show that uses all of the dice."</p>
<p>For the different creators that 12 Sided Studios are working with they're also looking to add more shows to the "12 Sided Studios Family." Cartwright explained that with the expertise that he and the other members of 12 Sided Studios have they're able to add more structure and help those who might be at a growth limit on their own.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/12-sided-studios-team.jpg?itok=WJPJOGlN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/12-sided-studios-team.jpg?itok=VDn50jgQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The 12 Sided Studios Team; Jasper William Cartwright, Chad Pytel, and Jess Jewell</figcaption></figure><p>An extremely wholesome part of our conversation came from discussing how Cartwright wants to "democratize the creative space and give the keys to the creator" and how sharing knowledge and working together on projects all just ends up creating something bigger and better than they could have created individually.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I haven't had a conversation yet where I've thought, oh actually we can't do that"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cartwright wanted to make sure everyone knew that "if there is anyone out there who is looking for any kind of work, whether it be solely creative, design, production, start to finish branding and marketing we can do it all. I've been talking to some really really amazing people but I'm sure there are so many people I've neglected to reach out to and talk to and unfortunately there's only so many hours in the day."</p>
<h2>Dode, The Mascot Of 12 Sided Studio</h2>
<p>The announcement of 12 Sided Studios came with a <a href="https://x.com/12SidedStudio/status/1816837154091278441">short video on Twitter of a D12 bouncing across a table</a> before triumphantly leaping into the air, sword and shield in hand. Introduced as Dode their mascot I asked about his creation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We're trying to rep all of the other dice, we have a show we're pitching out that uses all the dice. Even the d4 are going to get repped"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cartwright remaked the creation of Dode was a very funny story. Talking with their designer they had corporate designs and late on a Saturday night Cartwright received a text simple saying "Hey, what if we had a lil guy?"</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/12-sided-studios-dode-announcement-trailer.jpg?itok=sq3waqV6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/12-sided-studios-dode-announcement-trailer.jpg?itok=A309_6b0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>While small I've been informed that Dode is in fact a CR 2 Barbarian</figcaption></figure><p>Not sure of the idea Cartwright rejected the idea believing that "[12 Sided Studio] needs to be taken somewhat seriously". Shortly after a he was shown an early sketch and he immediately thought "Oh my god, it's perfect! There was no doubt in my mind that this is it."</p>
<p>"Dode represents so well who we are as a company. He's a little bit silly, he's adorable but also I just think it showcases what we do and who we are."</p>
<p>We continued to joke about the number of d20 based logos out in the Actual Play space and that with Dode it sets 12 Sided Studios across. Famously being the damage dice for Barbarians in Dungeons &amp; Dragons Cartwright even explained "That's the big damage die, we like that one. That's also part of the reason why we canonically decided that he is a Barbarian."</p>
<p>Cartwright joked that "if anyone wants to make a Dode stat sheet that they can, he's a barbarian. Probably CR 2, maybe, he's pretty small but he's scrappy and has got a lot of hit points."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/24216389/psvr2-pc-adapter-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The biggest problem with Sony’s PSVR 2 virtual reality headset <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183482/psvr-2-regret">is the dearth of games</a>. I’d hoped Sony’s PC adapter would change that. The chance to play <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22167726/half-life-alyx-valve-vr-game-of-the-year-2020"><em>Half-Life: Alyx</em></a>, the best VR game made yet, seemed like reason enough for existing owners to justify <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D92XQL22?tag=theverge02-20">the $60 adapter purchase</a>. </p><p>But I can’t currently recommend Sony’s PC adapter. If I had purchased it with my own money, rather than borrowing one from Sony, I’d have asked for a refund long before now.</p><p>It’s a shame, because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23601368/sony-playstation-ps-vr2-review-virtual-reality">the $550 PSVR 2</a> is still a good headset, with image quality that arguably beats <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23906313/meta-quest-3-review-vr-mixed-reality-headset">the newer $500 Meta Quest 3</a>. Playing <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> inside Sony’s headset isn’t just more vibrant thanks to the richer colors of its OLED screen; it’s more thrilling, too, with the panel’s true blacks making me feel the terror of its darker corridors. The Quest 3 experience looks incredibly washed out by comparison. </p><div><figcaption><em>This room feels downright chilling inside the PSVR 2.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>But what really scared me in <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> was the damned <em>glitch</em>. How — when I lift my pistol to deal with an unspeakable horror — I’d often find my hand had become detached from my body, stuck in place, two feet above the ground.</p><p>I’ve spent eight hours troubleshooting this issue and ones like it over the past week, and I’m no closer to a solution. My Quest 3 streams this game almost perfectly from the same PC in the same room, and yet my PSVR 2 struggles even with a hardwired headset cable to help. I see plenty of others reporting the same issues online, yet others report no issues at all.</p><div><figcaption><em>You didn’t... need that hand for anything, right?</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Is it luck? Perhaps, but I suspect it might also have something to do with how Sony cheaped out.</p><p>You probably know that Sony’s headset connects to the PS5 with a single USB-C cable that routes its display signal, power, and data simultaneously. Once upon a time, graphics card manufacturers were planning to standardize on a USB-C port with that same combo — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/17/17583362/virtuallink-vr-headsets-oculus-valve-microsoft-connect-usb-c-cable">they called it VirtualLink</a>, and while the brand didn’t take off, some GPUs did make it out into the wild with a do-it-all USB-C port.</p><p>The PSVR 2 PC Adapter appears to be the same thing. The three-by-three-inch square puck takes USB-A and DisplayPort from your gaming PC and power from a DC barrel jack, combining them into a single USB-C port for your headset on the other end. Find a DisplayPort cable (it doesn’t come with one and doesn’t support HDMI-to-DisplayPort), fire up <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2580190%2FPlayStationVR2_App%2F">the free PlayStation VR2 App on Steam</a>, and suddenly, you have a SteamVR headset capable of displaying any Steam game.</p><p>But the headset is the <em>only</em> thing the PSVR 2 adapter adapts. Sony provides no way to connect the PlayStation VR2’s all-important controllers<em>. </em>They need to connect to your PC over Bluetooth, but Sony does not provide any form of Bluetooth radio for that — and figuring out controller connectivity on my own has been an utter mess.</p><div><p><strong>Other PSVR 2 PC limitations</strong></p><p>I don’t majorly mind that they’re missing, but you should know the PSVR 2 also doesn’t support some of its flagship features on PC:</p><div><ul><li>HDR</li><li>Eye tracking</li><li>Adaptive triggers</li><li>DualSense haptic feedback </li></ul></div><p>Also, the PSVR 2’s tiny sweet spot for perfect lens clarity <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23601368/sony-playstation-ps-vr2-review-virtual-reality#:~:text=Instead%2C%20Tom%2C%20Adi%2C%20and%20I%20have%20a%20different%20annoyance">bugged me as much as ever</a>, and I’m still not pleased with the controllers’ battery life. However, it does still support passthrough video: you can get a look at your real-world surroundings anytime with a tap of a headset button.</p></div><p>First, I tried my desktop’s own built-in Bluetooth. My motherboard shipped with the extremely common Intel AX200 Wi-Fi 6 / Bluetooth 5.2 combo chip, so I figured I had a chance. I made sure its antennas were screwed in tight and turned off Wi-Fi just in case it might interfere. </p><p>The controllers paired quickly! But one of them refused to update unless I physically plugged it into my PC with a USB-C cable first. My blasters in <em>Space Pirate Trainer</em>, a game where I can easily test aiming, were unusually floaty, and soon, one of them started disappearing entirely. The controllers would not stay connected. </p><p>So, I ordered the first Bluetooth adapter on Sony’s <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-ps-vr2-bluetooth/">incredibly small compatibility list</a> — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Bluetooth-Receiver-Controller-UB500/dp/B09DMP6T22?tag=theverge02-20">the $15 TP-Link UB500</a>. Sony weirdly writes there that “operation is not guaranteed” with any of its recommended adapters, but at the time, I didn’t take it as a red flag. </p><p>The first thing I learned is that you must <em>disable</em> your motherboard’s onboard Bluetooth if you want to use a dongle. (I learned that from poking around myself because neither Windows nor Sony’s app gave me a clue.) The second thing I learned is you must unpair controllers <em>before</em> you disable your motherboard’s onboard Bluetooth, or else Windows won’t let you pair them again.</p><div><figcaption><em>Don’t forget to disable any Bluetooth adapters you don’t want to use.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>After many, many additional troubleshooting steps, my controllers began to feel responsive. </p><p>But even then — with Sony’s recommended Bluetooth dongle, the latest drivers, plugged into a USB extension cable, with a direct line of sight to my controllers less than five feet away — one of my virtual hands would regularly, repeatedly, and consistently get stuck in midair. It lost positional tracking, meaning I could still rotate my hand, even squeeze the triggers, but not move it anywhere. </p><div><figcaption><em>Video passthrough is nice to have (but I couldn’t get the automated room scan working after many, many attempts).</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Now, I admit that doesn’t entirely sound like a Bluetooth issue, and I could be wrong about that, but here’s why I suspect it might be:</p><div><ul><li>I have no issues with the Quest 3’s controllers in the same space, so I don’t think my room or lighting is interfering with tracking.</li><li>I had no issues with the PSVR 2’s controllers with a Framework 16 laptop and its internal Bluetooth chip (though I did have other issues with that setup). </li><li>When I added the TP-Link adapter to that laptop, my controller started getting stuck.</li><li>The virtual controller gets stuck even if it stays within the field of view of the headset’s cameras, which should help with positional tracking.</li><li>It was always the same controller getting stuck — until I unpaired them and re-paired them. Now it’s the <em>other</em> one. It feels like it’s having trouble fully supporting two at once, which had long been a complaint with standardized Bluetooth wireless tech.</li></ul></div><p>I’m afraid that controller tracking isn’t the only issue I’ve had with PSVR 2 on PC, either. I’ve repeatedly seen the entire experience grind to a halt, on multiple PCs, just by trying to access the SteamVR overlay to change volume or load a different game. I had to remove the headset and force-close things each time. It happened once when I was trying to play <em>Armored Core 6 </em>in SteamVR’s theater environment that gives you a big virtual screen for your flat games, too. </p><p>If it weren’t for that, and how both Sony and Valve require you to use motion controllers to access and navigate SteamVR, maybe I could at least recommend the adapter for non-VR gaming. </p><p>Sony did not answer my questions about why it didn’t choose to offer its own Bluetooth solution or whether there’s another Bluetooth adapter or a validated laptop I should try instead. I offered to let Sony help me troubleshoot over the phone, but the company didn’t take me up on that, either.</p><p>After trying <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-ps-vr2-troubleshoot/">every troubleshooting step</a> on Sony’s website and more via PR email, and putting eight hours into this thing without a single good gameplay session, I’ve decided Sony’s PC product simply isn’t ready for my PC. </p><div><p><h3>Agree to continue: PSVR 2 PC Adapter</h3></p><p><em>Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads. It’s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don’t read and definitely can’t negotiate.</em></p><p>Unlike most dongles, the PlayStation VR2 PC Adapter requires its own app, and here that means one mandatory agreement: <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2F%2Feula%2F2580190_eula_1">the PlayStation VR2 App EULA</a>. </p><p>Additionally, Sony makes you agree to automatically let it collect “limited data” about the PSVR 2 hardware, game errors, “information necessary to detect and investigate malicious, unauthorized or fraudulent activity,” and “information required by applicable law and to demonstrate compliance.” You can optionally let Sony collect “full data” including but not limited to “detailed information about what games you play” and “information about your play area.”</p><p>That’s two mandatory agreements and one optional permission.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
