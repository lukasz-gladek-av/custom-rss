			<p>Console exclusivity will eventually become a thing of the past for PlayStation as it has with Xbox, due to how consoles and the market as a whole have changed, the Moon Studios CEO believes.</p>
<p>In a lengthy post on <a href="https://x.com/thomasmahler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, Moon Studios CEO Thomas Mahler talked about Xbox's current approach, saying that it is the right one for several reasons. A few years back, the studio decided not to make&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No Rest for the Wicked</a> under Microsoft because it would have prevented the game from being released on PlayStation consoles and Nintendo Switch and would have impacted the game considerably as the studio felt that multiplayer and cross-play are an important part of the experience.</p>
<p>Elaborating further on the limitations of console exclusivity, the Moon Studios CEO gives a very interesting example. Over the years of communicating with Phil Spencer, Thomas Mahler always brought up how crazy it would be if certain DVDs would only play on players made by certain manufacturers. If this is crazy for movies, Mahler asks, then why is it different with games, considering how both PlayStation and Xbox consoles are powered by essentially the same hardware and have the same controller? At the same time, the console audience hasn't been growing, and for the entire industry to grow, access to content must be easier. This is achieved by reducing the cost of entry, which is what Microsoft is doing with its current strategy. For these reasons, Thomas Mahler concludes, he would be surprised if Sony didn't follow Microsoft's strategy, and bring an end to the days of PlayStation exclusive releases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I know some people always want me to join the console warring, but I strongly believe that <a href="https://twitter.com/XboxP3?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@XboxP3</a> has the right approach.</p>
<p>We decided a few years back not to make <a href="https://twitter.com/wickedgame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@wickedgame</a> under Microsoft because back then we couldn’t have shipped it for PlayStation and Switch and since we… <a href="https://t.co/A0913IXMkx">https://t.co/A0913IXMkx</a></p>
<p>— thomasmahler (@thomasmahler) <a href="https://twitter.com/thomasmahler/status/1883273827284599091?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Microsoft started doing away with Xbox exclusives last year and has since released multiple games on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch, including Hi-Fi Rush, Grounded, and Sea of Thieves. With <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/">Microsoft Flight Simulator, Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-hall-effect-diablo-iv/">others</a> also rumored to launch on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2, it will be very interesting to learn if Microsoft's strategy will pay off in such a big way that Sony will consider following suit.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-mod-support-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hogwarts-legacy-mod-support-update-coming-this-week.1092768/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-mod-support-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizarding RPG&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>is getting official mod support via an update this week, developer Avalanche Studios and publisher Warner Bros. Games have revealed.</p>

<p>Launching on January 30th, the update will not only add modding support to the game, but it'll also bring official modding tools that will allow&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>'s players to create mods even if they don't have much modding experience.</p>

<p>In a new video explaining modding for <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, community manager Chandler Wood explains how modding will work in the game. It turns out you'll be using a tool called the&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>Creator Kit, which will be available via the Epic Games Store.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-mod-support-update-toolkit.jpg?itok=nj3jSR0a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-mod-support-update-toolkit.jpg?itok=mO0uYwGH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>is getting official modding support soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Wood doesn't specify whether you'll be able to find the Creator Kit on Steam, nor does he say whether you'll be able to use the Epic version of the kit to play mods via the Steam version of <i>Hogwarts Legacy</i>. I can only imagine the game's community will have something to say about it if not.</p>

<p>Mods can range from character cosmetics and "small touches" through to entire dungeons and quests. Wood also confirms that Avalanche has been working with&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>modders to ensure you'll have something to play as soon as the update launches.</p>

<p>You'll only be able to access&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>modding if you're playing on PC, unfortunately. It doesn't seem like mod support or the modding toolkit will be coming to the console versions of the game.</p>

<p><em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>launched back in 2023, and it's proven to be a massive success for Warner Bros. Games, selling over <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">30 million copies</a> at last count. Given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow">how bad the publisher's 2024 was</a>, that continued success will likely come as a balm.</p>




<p>A sequel for&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>is in the works, and it's also been reported that WB Games is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report" rel="nofollow">working on a Director's Cut version</a> of the game, with staffers from&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>developer Rocksteady reportedly helping out on the project.</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/990080/Hogwarts_Legacy/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/hogwarts-legacy/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/hogwarts-legacy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/hogwarts-legacy-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and the modding update launches on January 30th.</p>

<p>Rise of the Ronin releases for PC via Steam on March 11, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rise of the Ronin, Team Ninja’s popular open-world RPG, was released for PS5 in March of last year, and precisely a year later, we are receiving a PC port for the game. The new title will feature several new features that aim to enhance the PC user experience. Additionally, there is a pre-order bonus that features armour sets, weapons, and combat styles.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-rise-of-the-ronin-pc-features">Rise of the Ronin PC Features</h2>



<p>Rise of the Ronin PC will be released with 8K resolution support and DirectX 12 support. Players will be able to play the game on ultra-wide and super-wide monitors. The game will feature support for 120 FPS, ray tracing, 3D audio, customisable keyboard and mouse controls, and a UI menu with mouse clickability. Graphically, players will see support for AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution, Nvidia DLSS and Reflex, and Intel XeSS graphics technology.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-rise-of-the-ronin-pc-pre-order-bonus">Rise of the Ronin PC Pre-Order Bonus</h2>



<p>As mentioned earlier, players can pre-order Rise of the Ronin PC for $49.99 and receive some bonus rewards. The rewards include an Iga Ninja Armor Set (a four-piece set), Iga Ninja’s Katana and four combat styles: Hayabusa-ryu for Katana, Hayabusa-ryu for Naginata, Nioh-ryu for Katana and Aisu Kage-ryu for Katana.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, it is worth noting that the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340990/Rise_of_the_Ronin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">listing</a> for Rise of the Ronin PC did not mention a PSN account requirement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Sniper Elite Resistance mission list takes us through every scenario. Main character Harry Hawker is the star of this show and you take the expert infantry marksman through a few intense missions as he looks to thwart Nazi oppression.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> is one of 2025’s first big hitters. While it’s a little rough around the edges, this is unmistakably a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-sniper-elite-games-in-release-order-release-dates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite</a> game. It has the hallmarks we’re accustomed to: Gory killcams, long-range precision, dangerous AI, and expansive levels.</p>



<p>The final of these items is what we’re most curious about. Knowing how many missions it has can influence someone into buying Resistance. Or, if you’re already playing it, sometimes it’s good to know how many missions you’ve got left.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-missions-in-sniper-elite-resistance">How Many Missions in Sniper Elite Resistance?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Behind Enemy Lines, fitting. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Sniper Elite Resistance has nine main missions to complete.</strong></p>



<p>This total is <strong>slightly misleading though</strong>. Although nine missions are advertised, the first mission is relatively short and can be completed in 20-30 minutes—depending on your familiarity with <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite</a>. Whereas the ninth and final mission is a traditional Epilogue—akin to Sniper Elite 5—which is over in no time at all.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-is-sniper-elite-resistance-game-length/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resistance’s game length and time to complete</a> isn’t as extensive as its predecessor. However, there’s still plenty to keep you busy.</p>



<h2 id="h-complete-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-list">Complete Sniper Elite Resistance Mission List</h2>



<p>Here’s every Sniper Elite Resistance Mission, along with a quick look at how many Collectibles each one has.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Mission Number</th><th data-align="center">Mission Name</th><th data-align="center">Number of Collectibles</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">#1</td><td data-align="center">Behind Enemy Lines</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">#2</td><td data-align="center">Dead Drop</td><td data-align="center">20</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">#3</td><td data-align="center">Sonderzüge Sabotage</td><td data-align="center">19</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">#4</td><td data-align="center">Collision Course</td><td data-align="center">19</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">#5</td><td data-align="center">Devil’s Cauldron</td><td data-align="center">19</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">#6</td><td data-align="center">Assault On Fort Rouge</td><td data-align="center">19</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">#7</td><td data-align="center">Lock, Stock And Barrels</td><td data-align="center">19</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">#8</td><td data-align="center">End Of The Line</td><td data-align="center">19</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">#9</td><td data-align="center">All Or Nothing</td><td data-align="center">0</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Again, you can see from the Collectibles list Mission 1 and 9 are nowhere as deep as the others. The first mission is still a decent-sized, linear affair designed to welcome you into the fray.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-propaganda-challenges-in-sniper-elite-resistance">How Many Propaganda Challenges in Sniper Elite Resistance?</h2>



<p><strong>There are seven Propaganda Challenges to unlock and complete in Sniper Elite Resistance.</strong></p>



<p>You unlock Propaganda Challenges by finding a unique poster in certain levels. This grants you access to special exercises including Stealth Challenges, Sniping Challenges, and a Combat Challenge.</p>



<h2 id="h-complete-sniper-elite-resistance-propaganda-challenges-list">Complete Sniper Elite Resistance Propaganda Challenges List</h2>



<p>Take a peek at every Propaganda Challenge in Sniper Elite Resistance, as well as what they entail, and their score requirements.</p>

                <p>This month's brief ban of TikTok in the US <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-gets-caught-up-in-tiktok-ban-currently-unavailable-in-the-us/1100-6528894/" data-ref-id="1100-6528894">saw Marvel Snap get caught in the crossfire</a>, as it was inaccessible to US-based players for several days. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-is-back-online-developer-is-looking-for-a-new-publisher/1100-6528902/" data-ref-id="1100-6528902">After that issue was resolved</a>, developer Second Dinner pledged to reward players for their patience, and it looks like there'll be a lot of free stuff to grab this week.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/article/1882941452336189902" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Second Dinner explained how this will work</a> on its social media channels. First off, there'll be separate rewards packages for US-based players and the international playerbase. Each package will be subdivided based on collection level, with the higher collection levels getting the lion's share of the goodies. These are substantial drops, as Second Dinner will be handing out currencies, variant cards, and more. This stuff typically equates to hundreds of dollars if you were to buy them in the game's expensive microtransactions store.</p><p>It's worth pointing out that the existing US-based players are defined as accounts created before January 20 inside the US and have shown any activity in the last 30 days before the outage, Second Dinner wrote. The developer explained that if US players made use of a VPN service to get around the downtime, it will not affect their eligibility for the compensation package. "This includes players from outside the US VPN-ing into the US to try and receive the US Downtime Package," Second Dinner added.</p><p>Some of these rewards also require a fair bit of grinding to unlock, so even if you aren't playing Marvel Rivals regularly, you'll want to log in and claim these prizes for when you do decide to jump in again. Here's what you can expect to receive this week if you're in the US:</p><h3>US Players Downtime Package (Over Collection Level 500)</h3><ul><li>2 x Spotlight Keys</li><li>5,000 Season Pass XP</li><li>4,150 credits</li><li>6,200 Collector’s Tokens</li><li>1,000 Gold</li><li>5 x Gold Conquest Ticket</li><li>3 x Infinite Conquest Ticket</li><li>4,000 Conquest Medals</li><li>Mystery Variant card</li><li>6 x Premium Mystery Variants</li><li>1 x Cosmic Red Border (Super Rare)</li><li>3 x Cosmic Gold Border (Super Rare)</li><li>5 x 155 Random Booster packs</li></ul><h3>US Players Downtime Package (Under Collection Level 500)</h3><ul><li>6 x mystery Series 3 cards</li><li>5,000 Season Pass XP</li><li>7,150 credits</li><li>1,000 Gold</li><li>1 x Mystery variant</li><li>6 x Premium Mystery variants</li><li>Cosmic Red Border (Super Rare)</li><li>Cosmic Gold Border (Super Rare)</li><li>5 x 155 Random Booster packs</li></ul><p>And for players outside of the US, the downtime package might not be as generous, but it's still pretty great considering that it's a freebie:</p><h3>Global Gratitude Package (Over Collection Level 500)</h3><ul><li>2 x Spotlight Keys</li><li>3,000 Collector’s Tokens</li><li>1,500 Credits</li><li>Mystery Variant card</li><li>Premium Mystery Variant card</li><li>Cosmic Gold Border (Super Rare)</li><li>Cosmic Red Border (Super Rare)</li><li>5 x 155 Random Booster packs</li></ul><h3>Global Gratitude Package (Under Collection Level 500)</h3><ul><li>6 x Mystery Series 3 cards</li><li>3,000 Credits</li><li>Mystery Variant card</li><li>Premium Mystery Variant card</li><li>Cosmic Gold Border (Super Rare)</li><li>Cosmic Red Border (Super Rare)</li><li>5 x 155 Random Booster packs</li></ul><p>This should help players to unlock a few more cards as part of Marvel Snap's Dark Avengers-themed month. While Iron Patriot can only be obtained by purchasing the $10 season pass, other unlockable cards this month include Moonstone, Bullseye, Victoria Hand, and Ares.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-says-no-comment-on-reported-saudi-funded-assassins-creed-mirage-dlc.1092732/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-report-ubisoft<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the weekend, a report emerged suggesting that Ubisoft had secured funding from the Saudi Public Investment Fund in order to create more&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>DLC. Now, Ubisoft has responded to that report...sort of.</p>

<p>In a statement provided to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-claiming-its-signed-a-saudi-deal-for-fresh-assassins-creed-mirage-content" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, Ubisoft declined to comment on the matter, pointing fans to the imminent release of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>instead. It's worth noting that declining to comment doesn't constitute a denial.</p>

<p>The statement in full, as Eurogamer relays it, simply reads: "We'll decline to comment. We are focused on finishing&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>and excited for players to get to play it on March 20th."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-funded-dlc-report-fight.jpg?itok=jVENmpim 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-funded-dlc-report-fight.jpg?itok=J2JcAe2H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>DLC might be on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>The original report came on Friday courtesy of French news platform <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/letonnant-deal-dubisoft-avec-larabie-saoudite-2144626" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Les Echos</a>, with YouTuber and strreamer j0nathan subsequently <a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/1882849239434232101" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sharing</a> the story on social media platform X.</p>

<p>In his post (which is in French; we're using machine translation), j0nathan says that Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot reportedly signed a deal with Saudi Arabia's Savvy Games Group to develop extra content for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>during a meeting last month.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not aware, the Saudi PIF is a national wealth fund backed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It's been used to buy shares in companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-pif-becomes-nintendos-largest-outside-shareholder" rel="nofollow">Nintendo</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-pif-buys-1-billion-stake-in-embracer-group" rel="nofollow">Embracer Group</a>, as well as to outright buy up a controlling stake in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-arabian-crown-prince-to-buy-controlling-stake-in-snk" rel="nofollow"><em>King of Fighters</em>&nbsp;developer SNK</a>.</p>

<p>The PIF doesn't currently hold any shares in Ubisoft, but this deal could signify an interest on bin Salman and Saudi Arabia's part to invest in the company, especially at a time when Ubisoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter" rel="nofollow">current shareholders seem unhappy</a> with the direction it's taking.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-mirage-dlc.jpg?itok=vZmjlNCq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-mirage-dlc.jpg?itok=hu7AHUUr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft says it's currently focused on&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>' impending release.</figcaption></figure><p>As for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, the game is currently scheduled for a March 20th release, having been delayed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">not once</a>, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march" rel="nofollow">twice</a> since its original announcement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ubisoft no doubt has a lot riding on&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>' success; its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results" rel="nofollow">latest financials</a> were very gloomy indeed, with high-profile games like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">first-person shooter&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">XDefiant</a>&nbsp;</em>proving to be expensive flops for the studio.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether more&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>DLC is indeed planned for the future. In the meantime, you can grab the game now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035570/Assassins_Creed_Mirage/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/assassins-creed-mirage/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/assassins-creed-mirage/9N4096HX1WWQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage-review-it-feels-so-good-to-be-back" rel="nofollow">read our review of it here</a>.</p>

            <p>I reckon you're likely to be in one of two camps with precision <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bauhaus-bonk">Bauhaus Bonk</a> - which I instantly appreciate for giving me an excuse to use the word "bopping" -  either finding it so easy you wonder what the point is, or getting genuinely sucked in by its deceptive trickiness. It's a single-button affair, having you navigate levels by alternating a pivot-point on a shape I don't know the name of so I'm just going to call a spinny stick.</p>
<p>There are moving background elements in some stages - in others, you make your own pace. Except I can't really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk? Because the swing soundtrack makes me feel like a plodding buffoon if I'm not responding with appropriate gusto. This is entrapment, game. I am devilishly compelled by swing, like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reefer_Madness">Reefer Madness</a> extra.</p>

Alternate which pivot-point you’re rotating around to move through 54 levels. Switch the background color to make obstacles disappear.

How minimalist of you, Bauhaus Bonk. How…unification of individual artistic visions with principles of mass production and an emphasis on function of you, Bauhaus Bonk. No, <em>you </em>just read the Wikipedia page on the Bauhaus movement. Leave me alone. I describe headshots for a living.</p>
<p>Speaking of headshots: Bauhaus Bonk nails some aspects I feel are absolutely crucial - and often overlooked - in games aiming for a similar sense of arcadey snackability. Firstly, when you fail, it absolutely hits like a failure - your spinny stick shattering into myriad pieces. Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, you're thrown right back into the restart before you've even really had a chance to process it all. You are thus doomed to play once again, perhaps forever. Bauhaus Bonk is out February 6th, 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What I mean is, a tile-based, first-person RPG, with runic writing on the walls, trapdoors in the floor, and cubes of sparkly lights that’ll teleport you somewhere. That’s what we’ve got here, and while the written words (few and far between) are close to gibberish, everything else is completely splendid and I love it.

This means that if you’re holding a lengthy staff (none of that, thank you), you can poke enemies from two tiles away, <em>and </em>it also means you can catch baddies on the diagonal. This makes the tile-dodging combat of the genre so much more lively, really embracing the way most people game the genre’s battles by sidestepping from attacks, then sidestepping again to deliver blows.</p><p>Each enemy type has a different ghastly mask that determines their abilities, and each requires a unique approach to fight safely. There are those who can use ranged fire attacks, those that swish little swords at a rapid pace, and–oh god–those who can ghoulishly vanish, then jump-scare appear right in front of you as they scream and hit. Eek! Those last ones are brilliant, and fortunately, quite easy to kill. Others take a proper beating, and given your weapons degrade with use, this all requires lots of careful balancing.</p><p>It’s also all made easier by the amazing movement. You have a completely free mouse-look, letting you look around as if in an FPS—it’s only movement where you are tile-bound. But this is all so smooth that you can whizz around and barely feel like you’re laboriously turning 90 degrees on the spot in that stilted fashion, even though you are. Trust me, it just works, and it’s how every blobber should be from now on. And talking of new rules for the genre, the way you can throw items must be immediately adopted too! When you hold to throw something, an arched dotted line appears showing you where it will land, adjusting as you aim. So yes, at last, a <em>Dungeon Master</em>-like where you can accurately throw a stone onto a distant pressure plate! Game changing.</p><figure id="" data-id="6f7c5f3060ffbc3a2e3baeaaf7ebe2f6" data-recommend-id="image://6f7c5f3060ffbc3a2e3baeaaf7ebe2f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="One of the masked teleporting buggers.

Beyond that, at the start of the game your inventory is <em>teeny</em>, your spaces for carrying spares of torches, weapons, health potions and the like very limited. But this expands with every new bag you find on your travels. Often these are rewards for finding secret passages, or exploring out of the way, and each one feels like <em>such</em> a win, suddenly giving you two more inventory spaces for lugging about everything you could need.</p><p>To balance this limitation (and of course it’s even less space than usual, given you’ve only one character), the save fountains found in levels are accompanied by magic chests that have loads of storage, and work like a <em>Diablo </em>stash or a <em>Resident Evil </em>item box, where your spare equipment appears in all of them.</p><figure id="" data-id="2d88841bb76ad270f312e32d17f47869" data-recommend-id="image://2d88841bb76ad270f312e32d17f47869" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A deer-headed enemy, who has a lot of stamina." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A deer-headed enemy, who has a lot of stamina." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Papertip Studio / Buried Treasure</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2d88841bb76ad270f312e32d17f47869" data-recommend-id="image://2d88841bb76ad270f312e32d17f47869" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A deer-headed enemy, who has a lot of stamina." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The puzzles are great, there are hidden switches all over the walls, and it all feels so comfortable to play.

Health potions are perfectly distributed, infrequent enough to force you to worry and squeak around on low health, then find one just in the nick of time—but I do miss being able to mix my own.

But could Bethesda’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> be among them?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN’s former Director of Video Content Strategy, Destin Legarie, for his new <a href="https://www.patreon.com/savestateplus" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patreon-funded show Save State Plus</a>, Microsoft’s gaming boss Phil Spencer was asked directly whether he could confirm that Starfield was staying Xbox exclusive for the time being.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Destin (@DestinLegarie) <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinLegarie/status/1883243143342231655?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 25, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"No,” was Spencer’s response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There’s no specific game… this kind of goes back to my red line answer. There’s no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place where it would find players, where it would have business success for us. What we find is we’re able to drive a better business that allows us to invest in great game lineup, like you saw. And that’s our strategy. Our strategy is to allow our games to be available, Game Pass is an important component of playing the games on our platform. But to keep games off of other platforms, that’s not a path for us. It doesn’t work for us. What we’re doing now, we think really enables us to build the best platform for the world’s best games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The world’s biggest games are available in multiple places. And more and more creators are asking us, ‘how do we stay connected when our game might be playable in all these different places?’ And we want Xbox to be absolutely the platform that enables that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We think that makes us unique. Most of the other platforms out there are single platform on single device. Whether that’s PC, whether that’s mobile, whether it’s a console. And we want Xbox to be a platform that enables creators across any screen that people want to play on.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-and-possibly-starfield-are-reportedly-being-considered-for-ps5">Starfield and MachineGames’ Indiana Jones and the Great Circle were both reported as being considered for PS5 as far back as March 2024</a>. Indy ended up confirmed for PS5 with a spring 2025 release window, a few months after its release on PC and Xbox Series X and S. But Starfield is yet to be confirmed for PS5, although Spencer's comments here certainly suggest it's on the cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A number of Xbox games are currently available on PS5, including Rare’s Sea of Thieves, Tango Gameworks’ Hi-fi Rush, and Obsidian’s Grounded and Pentiment. Microsoft already publishes Minecraft games on PlayStation consoles, among many other platforms, and is set to publish Doom: The Dark Ages and Ninja Gaiden 4 on PS5 later this year.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-review.1092714/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It occurs to me that the Orcs Must Die! series – and the tower-defense genre as a whole – are something like a cousin to factory games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/satisfactory-review">Satisfactory</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/factorio-review">Factorio</a>. Those games focus on feeding raw resources like iron and coal into complex machines to efficiently produce spaceship parts, while Orcs Must Die! is about feeding hordes of cartoon monsters into machines that produce… mulched cartoon monsters. Maybe one day we'll learn to build spaceships out of that goop, but for now just creating it is plenty of fun on its own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deathtrap, the fifth OMD game (if you count the now-defunct Unchained), shifts its reliable action-tower defense gameplay into a new structure: rather than a linear series of levels to figure out one at a time, we're put through a roguelite-style gauntlet of randomly selected stages, each with a mix of modifiers that can make both you and the orcs more powerful in sometimes interesting ways, capped off by a boss fight. Burning through those can be a blast, especially with up to three friends in the new co-op cap of four, but like a lot of run-based games it does eventually get a little too grindy (and not the kind where you're grinding up orcs) and repetitious for its own good.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I say that in part because after more than 60 hours playing Deathtrap in both co-op and single-player, I've only seen three of its four bosses and defeated two. While it's generally IGN's policy to complete a game's content before writing a review (and if we don't, we'll tell you and explain why), this is one of the rare cases where it's become clear that it's meant to take a very long time to check all the boxes, and also that I've already seen the great majority of what's here. Over the course of dozens of runs I've unlocked every trap, played all six characters, and seen all but probably the final boss and his map. I've also not yet seen a potential ending story cutscene, but considering Deathtrap is even lighter on storytelling than Orcs Must Die! has traditionally been, I think I can safely tie a bow on this review without grinding out the rest of the skill tree and unlocking the character skin set that's on display for 99,999 skulls (AKA in-game money).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Sophie is a cat with curved swords and throwing stars who summons a skeleton warrior buddy. Of <em>course</em> that's your first choice.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Setting out on your first run is as easy as picking a character and diving in, which is a no-brainer because one of the options is Sophie, an anthropomorphic cat with curved swords and throwing stars who summons a skeleton warrior buddy and lays bear traps. Of <em>course</em> that's your first choice for a third-person action game like this, unless you're playing co-op and someone else gets to her first. In that case it's understandable that you'd fall back on an old-school OMD archetype like Vaan, who wields a crossbow (that's actually a machine gun for all intents and purposes) and can temporarily prevent the rift you're protecting from taking any damage from orcs. After cycling through them all, including tanky bear-man Kalos, Riftkin sniper Mac, and Harlow, the blunderbuss lady with a pet dragon, I settled on Wren the mage as my favorite: her rifle-like wand includes an active reload minigame for bonuses, she summons floating proximity mines, recharges traps for quicker kills, and conjures two clones of herself to attack in triplicate. It’s a strong cast as a whole, though, and while there's not much by way of a plot beyond "kill the orcs" for them to act out, they all have distinct personalities that come through in their various jokey combat shouts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Immediately thereafter you're presented with a choice of three levels to tackle, but this comes with a catch that complicates it and – for me – almost always overrides my preference for one map over another: each is randomly assigned a modifier that ranges from increasing orc damage by 25% to a specific special enemy type being guaranteed to show up every time, or maybe you'll always see an unstable rift appear that must be quickly destroyed before it spews out even more enemies. These modifiers carry extra weight because they don't just affect that one map, but all of the rest going forward on this run, and the tough ones can put a fear in me. If I'm playing as a sniper, I definitely do not want the one that reduces headshot damage by 50% (because zoomed-in headshots are my whole thing!) – and when you're playing in co-op you have to make a group call that screws you all over the least.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The tough modifiers can put a fear in me.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not to say the choice of map isn't important. They're mostly fairly large – bigger than what's been standard for the series, but smaller than Orcs Must Die! 3's War Scenarios – and after playing each one what feels like a dozen times or more, I've definitely developed favorites for those where I know how to control the orcs' paths and eye-rolling dislikes for those that are more wide open and almost impossible to fully wrangle unless you've lucked into certain upgrades. As long as the randomized modifier price isn't too high I'll go for one where I know I can force incoming waves into a narrow path of movement-slowing tar traps lined by threshing machines on the walls and lasers, acid, or poison raining down from above, all while auto-targeting turrets knock down annoying flying enemies before they can slip by my barricades. Those feel like guaranteed wins. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting that while Deathtrap's orcs and maps look very much like the previous OMD games because of its cartoony art style, the lighting is notably improved, and that's something that's on full display when the nighttime and rain modifiers are in effect. Those aren't just for looks and come with randomly spawning skeleton orcs and water elementals, respectively, that can spring into existence behind your barricade lines. That's a good way to keep us on our toes when we're feeling like we've got things locked down – you've always got to keep an eye on the minimap when you hear the telltale sound effects and warning calls.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Lighting is notably improved, and that's something that's on full display when the nighttime and rain modifiers are in effect.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If I must, though, I'll choose a stage like the Dry Docks map: a shipyard where the rift can be in one of several locations and there are more paths to each of them than the default number of barricades can block off. The opening phase of any Orcs Must Die! map, and the unlimited-length pauses between waves, are spent figuring out the puzzle of how to control the coming flow of enemies. They will usually approach from four different doors that gradually open up, and the idea is to send them on the longest routes that overlap as much as possible, creating killzones where your traps will provide the most bang for your buck. Efficiently obstructing paths is tricky, but the ghostly previews showing where orcs are able to run based on the options available to them help to spot and plug holes. There are almost never enough barricades to go around, so you'll often have to make the best of a bad situation and decide what holes you're going to have to fill with your own magical bullets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Why not simply buy more barricades?" OMD veterans may ask. Well, Deathtrap revamps the way barricades are handled in a fairly radical way: rather than being a trap item you can buy for increasing amounts of cash, your team gets a set number that can be placed for free (and are replaced between waves if they're destroyed). Overall I like this change because it's an acknowledgement of how crucial it is to block off portions of the map, but it also serves as the number one way I know if a run is going to go well or not. If I don't luck into at least a few more via the random upgrades you pick from at the end of each round (or better yet, the upgrade that makes the barricades I have twice as large) I'm probably gonna have a rough time when the going gets tough.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dan's Favorite Tower Defense Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Boosting the number or shape of your barricades is far from a sure thing, though, because even though each player gets to pick a new upgrade card from a set of three randomized options at the end of every wave – six per level and a bonus at the end – there are so many of these "thread" cards in the mix, especially as you unlock more and more with in-game achievements, that it's easy to wind up with everything but. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My other issue with how barricades are handled is that, when you're playing in co-op, the team's supply is evenly divided between you and your teammates. It sounds fair, but it's often annoying when you're the person with the plan but have to stop halfway through executing it to call over whoever has barricades left and instruct them on where to place them. Also, if a barricade breaks during combat, the most barricade-minded person is going to be the one who's completely out and has to call someone else to rush over and plug the hole. So while it makes sense to have traps and cash divided between teammates because it encourages you to use each of your inventory slots wisely and synergize which death dealers work well together, I feel like barricades would've been much better off as a shared pool.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Barricades would've been much better off as a shared pool.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, some of those other thread cards can be quite powerful, so not all is lost if you don't draw barricades. They could lend your default attacks major bonuses to ammo capacity, give them burn, freeze, or shock damage, or provide extra uses of special abilities, among many other things. Wren, for example, can have four proximity mines out at a time by default, but I've raised that as high as seven. One card makes you shoot extra-large projectiles for some reason (they don't do more damage, they're just big). But none I've seen matches the impact of having more barricades, which makes even the Cursed card that grants 10 additional blocks but makes all your traps cost 10 times more potentially worthwhile if you're on a team of three or four (their traps aren't affected).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which traps you put where is the other big part of the puzzle, and since you can only carry a handful of them with you (especially in co-op) for each level, you have to carefully examine the map layout to see where you can place the best combos of floor, wall, and ceiling traps to both deal damage and rack up scoring combos with multiple types of damage on single targets (which charge up your most powerful abilities). There are a few dozen of these, the vast majority of which are old stalwarts like the Brimstone floor tiles that set enemies ablaze, flippers that launch them into the sea, arrow walls right out of Indiana Jones, saw traps, freeze traps, acid traps, poison traps, you name it. A few new ones round out the arsenal, such as the harpoon that snags enemies to pull them in and a heavy ice turret – I'll be interested to see how the creative types out there combine all of these.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>All in all it's a more than healthy mix of enemies that keeps things interesting for a long while.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Enemy variety is also largely recycled from Orcs Must Die! 3's dozens of trolls, ogres, elementals, flying guys, and hunters who ignore traps and barricades to chase down Warmages, but it does build at least a bit on what came before with around a dozen or so new types. The Stonebat, for example, petrifies you with a projectile that takes you out of the action for several seconds and can be extremely annoying if you don't take them out, and there's an orc suspended by a balloon that seems functionally similar to the various bats but takes a few more hits. There's also a big floating cyclops who sails over traps and then blasts you with a damage-hose laser beam from his eye if you stand between him and the rift, a drummer who doesn't attack but buffs other orcs, shielded ogres, troll archers, and a lizardman thief who hunts you down and steals your coins, among others. All in all it's a more than healthy mix that keeps things interesting for a long while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of each map you're given the option to cash out with the money you've made thus far or wager half of it on whether or not you'll be able to beat the next map before enough orcs make it to your rift, which has a persistent "health." It's a smart mechanic because sometimes you'll just barely eke out a win with one or two rift points remaining and have to make a call about whether to go on or go home and level up, and I much prefer this to feeling like I had to beat every level of previous OMD games without a single orc making it through my defenses to really feel like I'd beaten it. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Co-Op Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you make it to the boss fights, Deathtrap at least makes an effort to change up its style: there's only one large wave to deal with and you get a big chunk of change to spend, but there's an extra powerful enemy walking or teleporting around the map while you do it. So you can go all-in on inflicting as much damage on them as possible or try to hold out until you exhaust the wave of enemies before turning your attention to the main target. But in my experience, the boss fights don't turn any major ideas on their heads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Win or lose, you’ll return to your fortress and use your cash to buy permanent upgrades that are sometimes meaningful, like the ones to each individual Warmage that unlock or amplify abilities or let you do +50% damage to bosses, and others that give you an almost imperceptibly incremental improvement to trap damage, speed, or other stats. Given that upgrades often get dramatically more expensive as you go, it can be a bit frustrating to spend so much for so little to improve your chances on the next run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What eventually slowed my progress to a crawl was the fact that as you progress from one map to the next in your run, the orcs steadily get stronger and more durable rather than more numerous. In the first mission you'll tear through waves solo, one-shotting most enemies before they can even reach your kill zone. But by the fourth, I was emptying entire 45-bolt crossbow magazines into a single heavy orc's face and having to stop to reload before polishing him off. It gets tiring, frankly, especially when dealing with enemies with magical armor that diminish the impact of your weapons and traps even further. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering that each run consists of several missions, starting with three and going up by one every time you beat a boss, runs become excessively long. I've beaten two, so I currently have to do five missions of six waves apiece before the boss fight, and each one can take around half an hour. You can save between missions in single-player but not in co-op, so that becomes a serious time commitment if you're playing as a team. Also, I wish there were a way to skip the first one or two missions, which are effectively a foregone conclusion for me now, and go straight to the challenging ones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I'm on my feature wishlist, this four-player co-op game (which has full cross-play support between PC and Xbox/Game Pass, though not cross-progression) is notably without split-screen functionality of any kind. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has once again commented on the company's strategy as it relates to launching its own first-party games on other platforms. As Spencer has been saying for a long time already, he believes Xbox is strongest and best-positioned when it launches its own games on other platforms. A game remaining exclusive to Xbox in perpetuity "doesn't work for us" going forward, he said.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/phil-spencer-120725254" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Destin Legarie</a>, Spencer was asked directly if he could confirm if Bethesda's RPG Starfield would remain exclusive to Xbox on console for the time being. Spencer said, "No."</p><p>He added: "There is no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say, 'This game will not go to a place where it will find players, where it would have business success for us.'"</p><p>Spencer said what his team has found is that launching Xbox games on other platforms amounts to "better business" results for the company, which in turn allows Microsoft to invest in the kinds of games that it recently showed off at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-directs-are-about-more-than-games-theyre-about-the-human-side-of-game-development/1100-6529023/" data-ref-id="1100-6529023">January Xbox Developer Direct.</a></p><p>"That's our strategy. Our strategy is to allow our games to be available [across consoles]. Game Pass is an important component of playing the games on our platform. But to keep games off of other platforms, we don't think--that's not a path for us. It doesn't work for us," he said.</p><p>"What we're doing now we think really enables us to build the best platform for the world's best games. Because the world's biggest games are available in multiple places. More and more, creators are asking us, 'How do we stay connected when our game might be playable in all these different places.' We want Xbox to be absolutely the platform that enables that," Spencer added. "We think that makes us unique. Most of the other platforms out there are 'single platform on single device.' Whether that's PC, whether that's mobile, whether it's a console. We want Xbox to be a platform that enables creators across any screen that people want to play on."</p><p>Some Xbox fans have expressed concerns about this new strategy, and particularly how it may lead to a feeling of Microsoft losing its identity. Spencer said he's heard these concerns and takes them seriously. He said Xbox's "identity will continue to evolve," which he said has always been the case since the Xbox brand was launched in 2001.</p><p>The next big Xbox title to come to PS5 is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which hits Sony's console this spring following its debut on Xbox back in December. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526483/" data-ref-id="1100-6526483">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> will then launch in May across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC at the same time. Starfield, meanwhile, launched in September 2023 and remains exclusive on console to Xbox (it's also available on PC). </p>

                <p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will be censored in Japan due to its depiction of gore and has received a mature rating from the country's video game rating system.</p><p>According to Ubisoft Japan (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/assassins-creed-shadows-will-be-censored-in-japan-to-comply-with-cero/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), depictions of dismemberment have been completely removed from the Japanese version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. Other versions of the game will still have the ability to to toggle the dismemberment feature on or off.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows has also been rated CERO Z by Japan's video game rating system, which is the equivalent of North America's ESRB rating of M. The Japanese version will have some modified voice lines as well, but Ubisoft Japan didn't provide any additional explanation or details.</p><p>This isn't the first time CERO stepped in regarding dismemberment in a video game. 2023's Dead Space remake was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-space-remakes-japanese-ban-confuses-ea-exec-after-stellar-blade-rating-released/1100-6522831/" data-ref-id="1100-6522831">banned in Japan</a> because of the game's depiction of severed body parts. However, its ban was later criticized after Stellar Blade's Japanese rating was revealed. The game depicted dismemberment, but it was still allowed to be sold in Japan.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows takes place in feudal Japan, which could explain why Ubisoft and the Japan video game ratings board are being extra careful with this release. Director Chris Benoit said that the reason behind the game's second delay was to polish the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-director-reveals-why-game-was-delayed-a-second-time/1100-6528995/" data-ref-id="1100-6528995">parkour mechanics on feudal Japan's architecture</a>.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will launch on March 20 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-feels-like-the-series-trying-to-come-to-terms-with-its-warring-halves/1100-6528968/" data-ref-id="1100-6528968">Assassin's Creed Shadows preview</a>, we said, "Ubisoft Quebec seems poised to be the first to pull together Assassin's Creed's disparate eras, but we've been here before and it's routinely not worked out."</p>

It's a third-person action-adventure game that stands out thanks to a striking physics system where players chain together magical abilities to battle creatures and navigate complex terrain—sometimes both when the "terrain" is a giant creature.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A decade ago, this kind of game would have seemed only possible from a team of hundreds of developers, but Yellow Brick Games is shipping </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eternal Strands </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">with less than a hundred workers (and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yellow-brick-games-splits-from-private-division-to-self-publish-debut-game">a pivot</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from being published by Private Division to self-publishing). Technological advancements obviously made this task easier, but Unreal Engine hasn't gotten </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>that</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> much more efficient over the years. So what made this game possible?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The answers offered by game director Frédéric St-Laurent, creative director Mike Laidlaw, and executive producer Jeff Skalski will seem familiar to most of our readers (Laidlaw and Skalski pull double duty as Yellow Brick's chief creative officer and chief operating officer). They can be summed up simply as "constraint, cutting, and collaboration."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But diving into the details, you start to see a process that led to such efficient development over four years of work. Like a well-guided snowball rolling down hill, the studio took a temperature system that would be at the heart of its magical gameplay and built a process for cooking up properly-scoped content that brought this game to life.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Eternal Strands'"><span>Eternal Strands'</span> magic system is built on temperature measurement</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When the Yellow Brick Team came together in 2020, the pitch for what would become </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eternal Strands</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was exceptionally close to what would make it in the final game. The core game mechanics of crafting weapons, slaying giant monsters, and wielding physics-based magic were all there on day one, all to be set in a fantasy world spearheaded by Laidlaw, a veteran of BioWare's Mass Effect and Dragon Age franchises.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eternal Strands</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, players take on the role of Brynn, a member of a magical band of "Weavers" who stumble into a lost land called The Enclave, who's tasked with digging up its secrets in order to save the world, and more importantly, her friends. She does this with magical powers that dynamically interact with the environment, weather, and enemies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">St-Laurent explained that the beating heart of the magic system is actually a temperature tracking tool. After producing a physics-based controller for the player that would fuel procedural animations for climbing on titanic creatures, the team got to work on a method for tracking the temperature within every two-meter by two-meter cell of air in a gameplay environment. Then objects like plants, rocks, and collectible ingredients needed "sensors" to track that temperature and determine what behavior to display. Hot objects start burning, cold objects become brittle, creatures slow down in the cold or freeze in place by ice, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The goal was to ensure magic and creature attacks could organically impact the environment. One example would be a dragon starting a massive wildfire with its fire breath thanks not just to the flames, but the convection put out by the heat. Another would be if a towering "Arc" automaton swung its mace into a wooden structure and send it crumbling to the ground.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a smaller-scale version of what Nintendo pulled off with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tears of the Kingdom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. And because it's smaller-scale (and made by a smaller team), those two-by-two measurement cells began sprouting constraints really fast.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It drove interesting decisions," Laidlaw said. "Our game cannot be open world because we cannot simulate all of those temperatures in a 25 kilometer-square [area]." Players instead explore a number of different "zones," each populated with different enemies and resources, which, along with quests, drive players to regularly double back to explored areas.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The design of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eternal Strands</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' "epic" encounters with large monsters followed a similar pattern. Though some creatures, like different types of dragons and towering magic automatons, were there at the start, the Yellow Brick team approached their design in a top-down fashion, rather than just creating a list of enemies that had to be in the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To make these creatures, St-Laurent and his colleagues first created the classic locomotion and health systems that would be universal to each creature. Then they created a "language of elements" that would be common to everything in the game (fire, ice, telekinesis, acid, etc.). Then they did what he called "subtractive design" to decide the traits of each creature, allowing them to use in-construction systems to define the traits of each enemy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So if "flight" is one system, then a creature that "flies" and "breathes fire" is the foundation for a dragon (or "breathes ice" for an ice dragon). The creatures are further differentiated by AI and the environments they're placed in. Most wander in a pattern, but some will engage the player directly while others attack from a distance, creating a challenge where they have to close the gap.</span></p><p>Image via Yellow Brick Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But again, the constraints appear. Building creatures in this manner ruled out monsters that would require other forms of locomotion like rolling or sliding. So no boulder-themed or snake creatures could be part of the mix. "I remember joking about adding a perfect sphere that had a tessellating amount of polygons, and it would cause you to lag," said Laidlaw. "The ultimate challenge was optimizing your system in real time."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Skolski said this process—and building the magic system in a similar way—allowed emergent play possibilities to pop out mid-cycle that the developers hadn't even considered. He recalled testing the Ice Wall power against a giant automaton enemy called the Arc of the Stricken Earth, and blasting a stream of ice at it as it wound up to smash him with a giant mace. By accident, he aimed the ice from the creature's chest up to its upper arm, holding it in place the way ice can freeze enemies to the ground.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I just put my shield down because I went 'it can't hit me. It's trying, but it can't until it breaks the ice or [the ice] melts.'" Laidlaw explained that moments like this emerged all over the development process—but then it became a challenge to make sure the player understood what chain of events caused these surprises to happen.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Cutting features before anyone wastes time on them">Cutting features before anyone wastes time on them</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eternal Strands</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was being scoped out, the plan was originally to create 12 epic creatures. The game shipped with 9. Cutting interesting ideas is part-and-parcel for game development, but Skalski said the goal with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eternal Strands</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was to allow as minimal work as possible on a feature before it was cut. Or in other words, to cut features </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>before</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> they slowed down production, not after.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We were constantly cutting every time we had an offsite with directors," Skalski said. "It was a normal practice, because we wanted to try and be as healthy as we could be." Laidlaw added that it was vital for developers at Yellow Brick to see leadership making these cuts, so they would feel confident presenting planned features as being out of scope, knowing they'd take it seriously.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"At the beginning of every major phase of development, we'd sit down with every director and some of the leads and go 'okay, here's what we'd like the end of [this stage] to look like, does that fit, yes or no?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So if the end of say, a 6-month pre-production sprint, the team wanted all of Brynn's armor choices completed by the end of pre-production, they'd go to the team and ask if that was possible. If the team said "we can't make that much armor," they'd cut the number of assets or otherwise reshape the armor system as needed, rather than sacrifice the top production goal.</span></p><p>Image via Yellow Brick Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This process was done in service of ensuring developers wouldn't work on a feature for a year, only to have it completely cut from the game. So when Yellow Brick cut the number of epic creatures from 12 to 9, the 3 lost monsters didn't see "a single minute" of additional work. St-Laurent alluded to his experience at previous studios (going out of his way to not specify which ones) where developers would pour months of work into some portion of a game and then eventually realize it either it wasn't good enough or leadership just plain forgot it was being worked on.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What a process like this makes possible">What a process like this makes possible</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of Laidlaw's favorite memories in development came while toying with the interaction between temperature and loot—the crafting components that drop in the world that players use to craft and upgrade weapons and armor. He described how "rich boulders" in the game were a prime example of this system. After they were heated up, they were meant to drop rarer, better metals because they'd been magically "refined or smelted" by the heat in the world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I always joked with [St-Laurent]...I said 'my dream is that I can use telekinesis to hold a boulder in a dragon's breath so it produces excalibur-level materials.' And I remember one day he messaged me and he says 'hey, remember your jokes about combat smelting? I did it. It's in, and it works.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And so "combat smelting" was born, allowing players to manipulate loot drops using the laws of thermodynamics. It's an example of how this systems-focused approach created "efficiencies" later in development after spending extra time early in the process. Not only was the team creating new content as the game went on, each new element introduced to the game had additive properties that didn't need to be designed by hand.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eternal Strands</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> now out in the wild, Yellow Brick Games and the game development community have a case study for what smaller teams of experienced developers can produce. It's still yet to be seen if these </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/veteran-devs-claim-smaller-teams-could-mean-more-successful-games">smaller teams will ultimately produce more successful games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. But for now, the team can take pride in releasing one of the first exceptionally unique games of 2025.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/27/tails-of-iron-2-whiskers-of-winter-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>It’s a hard life, being a rat. No one thinks you are cute, you get all the blame for the bubonic plague, and you have a tendency to get embroiled in vicious blood-thirsty wars with rival armies of animals. For an example of the latter, look no further than the first <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/04/tails-of-iron-review/">Tails of Iron</a>, which pitted Redgi and his anthropomorphic pals against ferocious bands of fearsome frogs. Now, with the frog menace having taken their last ribbit, it’s the turn of some undead Bats to invade a Ratty Kingdom. Thankfully for Redgi, this is not the southern kingdom that he rules over, instead, it’s the Rats of the North who get brutally murdered by an invading army. And they do, in outstandingly gory but oh-so-cute fashion, in the cataclysmic opening to Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tails of Iron 2 | Gameplay Overview Trailer | Out 28th Jan - PC, PlayStation, Xbox &amp; Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mj-v3CHQK8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those who didn’t have the good fortune of playing through its fantastic forebear, Tails of Iron 2 is best summed up as a 2D Souls-like. The diminutive player character – a bearded, brutally-violent, yet surprisingly cuddly rat named Arlo – must hack and chop their way through a vast interconnected environment, taking on hordes of massive foes. The foes are glorious to behold, painted and animated in an arresting visual style.</p>


<p>This time out there’s an overarching wintry Game of Thrones aesthetic, which proves a suitably arresting theme. The species and enemies are far more varied and creative in this outing; cannibalistic were-owls, enormous killer snakes (from Arlo’s perspective at least), and undead wyvern-riding bat shamans are all a joy to dismember. Indeed, the vast array of baddies keep proceedings fresh as the hours of play tick by, demanding that the player is constantly identifying new attack patterns, finding the chinks in their foe’s armour and exploiting them to finally emerge bat-tered (pun absolutely intended) and victorious. The satisfaction these hard earned triumphs earn results in quite the squeak of exultation.</p>


<p>Make no mistakes, Tails of Iron 2 doesn’t pull any paws. This is a tough – and often deeply unfair – game. Arlo is pitted against ridiculous odds, again and again, running a gauntlet of overpowered opponents before the next save point is reached. Though, I’m pleased to report that Tails of Iron 2 benefits from a much-needed focus on accessibility.</p>
<p>There’s a very welcome easy mode that slows down enemy attacks, allowing a player to learn the attack patterns of enemies, improve their skills, and then reapply their newfound abilities on higher difficulties, if they so choose. Even better, easy mode can be toggled at any time, ensuring middle-aged gamers with fading reactions can still make it through to the credit. Something I’m deeply thankful for.</p>
<p>In combat, Arlo has to roll to dodge red coloured unstoppable attacks, just like Redgi before him. Yet something has gone awry with his ability to parry yellow-coloured attacks, the controller inputs feeling floatier and less precise than in the original game.&nbsp;Parrying now rarely works, all too often resulting in Arlo being mashed in the face with a mace. In fact, so naff is the mechanic that I entirely ignored parrying, opting to dodge every attack instead.</p>

<p>Avoiding parrying takes some of the complexity out of the original game’s rock, paper, scissor, approach to combat, leading to a less engaging experience. Still, at least the combat benefits from being more dynamic. Enemies are much more prone to dodge and weave around the combat zone, using flight to soar above Arol’s head or tunnelling to dig beneath Arlo’s paws, all of which serve to keep Arlo on his claws; mitigating some of the sedentary combat encounters that plagued the original.</p>
<p>Where Tails of Iron 2 really falls in comparison to the original game is due to a nasty bout of sequelitis bloat. It’s an affliction that plagues many an anticipated sequels, presenting as a cornucopia of unnecessary gameplay mechanics bolted, Frankenstein Monster-stye, onto the once lean framework of its predecessor. Take the new system of gathering resources to build new weapons and tools by way of an example; as it’s mostly pointless. Why bother making your own gear when the items found in chests, received for completing quests, and discovered discarded on oft-decapitated corpses, are so much better? Despite the game demanding I recruit blacksmiths and build forges through its main story quests, I rarely availed myself of their services. A shame, as an entire day-night cycle has been implemented for this outing, requiring you to hunt at the correct time to find certain enemies, yet – in my playthrough at least – I barely bothered with any of it.</p>

<p>Then there’s elemental damage. Every foe you meet will harness different elements to attempt to kill you. The idea being that you should gather resources to build specific armour that offers the appropriate elemental resistance. The problem is that no matter how awesome the armour looks, it’s still totally useless. Whatever armour you wear, pretty much every enemy will kill you in two hits. Why bother with armour when you are best off being nice and light to help dexterously dodge attacks? Again, an initially interesting mechanic is rendered moot through haphazard implementation.</p>
<p>Tracking was a much-highlighted addition in preview footage, with Arlo able discern foes traits before he meets them by observing the environment. Yet in practice this amounts to little more than finding one footprint and then being told everything about the enemy, including all their elemental weaknesses. Meanwhile, the grappling hook, which proved a tantalising tease in my preview, remains frustratingly limited in its usage, providing Arlo with a slightly faster means of navigating the environment, but little else. Those hopping to use the grappling hook to explore environment of greater height and scale will be left disappointed.</p>
<p>In short, this squeakquel is more of the same, which is a good thing, but it’s also lumbered with a bunch of underwhelming gumpf that doesn’t work as cohesively as it should, and that’s most definitely a bad thing.</p>

			<p>Just so we’re all clear on this: Nazis are the bad guys, alright? They might have been reduced to almost pantomime villains in TV, films and video games, but it says more about the world that those same video games are providing timely reminders on this fact. So anyway, here comes <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sniper-elite-resistance">Sniper Elite: Resistance</a>, in which you get to do to those aforementioned baddies pretty much everything that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrQVFZx7XX4">Samwise Gamgee would do to a potato</a>. And then some.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sniper Elite: Resistance | Official Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/34d5T8PW0W0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s early 1944, and as the Allies prepare for D-Day, they’ve sent some of their top operatives behind enemy lines to prepare the way, link up with the French Resistance and disentangle any unexpected problems they might find. Taking place alongside Karl Fairburne’s mission in Sniper Elite 5, Resistance gives his regular co-op buddy character Harry Hawker a promotion to be the star of his own mission.</p>


<p>In many ways, Sniper Elite: Resistance feels like a standalone expansion to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/25/sniper-elite-5-review/">Sniper Elite 5</a>. It features a spin-off character, it’s the same stealth action gameplay in sandbox missions, and there’s very few new embellishments around that. And I’m totally fine with that. It arrives with the same asking price as Sniper Elite 5, which some might be dismayed at, but this is a full campaign of the same scope as its predecessor, far larger than anything found in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/07/sniper-elite-5-season-pass-2-starts-with-rough-landing-mission-the-mosin-nagant/">a Sniper Elite season pass or DLC</a>.</p>


<p>The core Sniper Elite experience is still so moreish, though. Dropped off on the edge of a large map, you’re given a main mission to complete –&nbsp;find a resistance informant, investigate a trainyard, and the like –&nbsp;an additional Kill List target to kill, with a bonus if you do so in a specific way, and further optional objectives to find and take on along the way.</p>
<p>My default way to play is to sneak through stages with a trusty Welrod in hand, trying to quietly and effectively take out enemies with this pistol or melee kills, only taking out my sniper rifle when there’s effective noise cover from rolling thunder, church bells, or a diesel motor that I’ve just sabotaged. Until it goes a bit wrong, I have to run and gun with SMG, die, and then reload from a save.</p>
<p>Of course, you can get much more creative than this, use more noise distractions, decoys, or booby traps. Or you can go in all guns blazing, trusting your rifle abilities to deal with the throngs of enemies drawn toward your last known positions, especially if someone trips the alarms.</p>
<p>Either way, you’ll want to scavenge around for crowbar and bolt cutters to access electrical boxes or quickly bust through doors – though you can pick locks – and keys to more quietly open safes and objective points. There’s workbenches dotted through each level, each one unlocking new attachments and modifications and allowing you to switch up your loadout, but there’s also special limited ammo weapons which often come kitted out with silencers and other perks. Enemies will still hear a rifle crack from a silencer, though they reduce the audible range quite effectively.</p>

<p>It’s a solid campaign with a good blend of day and night missions, cities, mountains, remote facilities, and more. The main disappointment is when you encounter rougher edges that affect how you can play. In several places, I had clipping issues when trying to climb up stairs, or some invisible geometry in another location. Hopefully, these are ironed out quickly. More deeply rooted is the immersion-breaking way that characters auto-snap into position when doing a melee takedown, which makes the game feel older than it is.</p>
<p>The whole campaign can be played with a buddy character by your side, or with the optional Invasion mode where another player drops in as an adversary, sparking a tense game of cat and mouse, where both animals are armed with sniper rifles and can find clues on where the other one is. There’s also the more regular PvP multiplayer with a set of straightforward modes that include TDM, No Cross for the pure sniping gallery experience, and the multiplayer suite is rounded out with Survival for co-op horde mode play.</p>
<p>We weren’t able to try these modes out prior to release, but…. well, outside of any technical issues, they’re the same as Sniper Elite 5.</p>

<p>The one real addition to the formula are the Propaganda missions. Find a resistance poster while exploring the main missions and you unlock a small challenge mission to take on against the clock. They’re fine bitesized little experiences, but are only really small asides, instead of more significant ways to change up the action.</p>
<p>I keep coming back to that standalone expansion feeling. I do feel that, after Resistance, Rebellion needs to find the next evolution for this series. The fundamental form hasn’t really changed since the shift toward more sandbox levels in Sniper Elite 4, and it feels like the next game can take another leap. Whether that’s cribbing off Hitman’s homework for more replayable levels, going even more open world, or simply digging down to overhaul animations, polish and more, I don’t know.</p>

			<p>Today, Avalanche Software had a surprise for PC players of Hogwarts Legacy. In just three days, on January 30, the game will be updated to offer built-in support for mods, which will be downloadable directly from the in-game menu.</p>
<p>Moreover, the developers are also releasing the Hogwarts Legacy Creator Kit modding tool, which will be available on the same day via the Epic Games Store. The Hogwarts Legacy Creator Kit will support the creation of new quests, dungeons, and character enhancements such as cosmetics and skins. Mods can then be submitted through the CurseForge platform for in-game release; all these mods will be hosted and curated by CurseForge. A Steam or Epic Games Store account linked to a Warner Bros. Games account is required to access the official Hogwarts Legacy mods. Players can already link their accounts by going <a href="https://fortyseven-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2hLVo9CqysYYacm84HMeKJD_F6oW-tiX0aKN5cItB6OolwBKolAEQBS3p_5_w0QiZPTeTLLqrG7VcwbY6h3F9t7dx0OfJBHCbgwnxU7ca1gpG4dzOd1PJSJuwmWnn_hoIsfiPgOqxvajBJduku8kS2C7rWOV0vBIpB0VJRPHRGJMjHCM4r7d4hEw3LzVJTsu6obQEFSobYFiVfXSzjEGurtAeATDBfUnUBA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to this webpage</a>.</p>
<p>In a video overview, we also learned that Avalanche has already partnered with some mod creators to create content ahead of the upcoming launch. For example, players can look forward to a “Dungeon of Doom” mod, a dungeon packed with combat and hidden secrets, as well as all-new broom replacement mods, expanded character creation, outfit customization, and more. Of course, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-mods-and-tweaks-roundup-improve-graphics-performance-gameplay-and-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">existing PC mods</a> available through old-fashioned ways and downloadable <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hogwartslegacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Nexus Mods</a> will remain separate.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hogwarts Legacy - PC Modding Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/41xltDoIoEs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>By the way, the press release also reveals that the best-selling game of 2023 has now sold over 30 million units to date. This doesn't sound like the rumored <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Definitive Edition</a>, which should launch later this year with around 10-15 hours of new content; it's probably just a stepping stone as Avalanche Software and Warner Bros. Games (which just <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost its long-time chief</a>) attempt to prolong the game's life while Hogwarts Legacy 2, rumored to feature live service elements, is in development with Unreal Engine 5.</p>

						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Over the years, the Sniper Elite series emerged as one of the top stealth game series, and for good reason. With each new entry, developer Rebellion further refined the series' formula, providing players with more tools to sneak past enemies, who, in turn, have become smarter and more resourceful themselves, culminating with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sniper-elite-5-jager-beware/">Sniper Elite 5</a>, which introduced, besides more gameplay improvements, a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/sniper-elite-5-how-axis-invasion-works-and-how-to-kill-your-enemy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Invasion mode</a> in the vein of the Souls series that allows players to "invade" another player's world. This mode considerably spiced up the experience, adding an element of unpredictability for those who enabled the optional invasion.</p>
<p>With the latest entry in the series having been released almost three years ago, the time was definitely ripe to see SOE sniper Karl Fairburne back in action, infiltrate enemy's strongholds, and enjoy some gory kills with the series' trademark X-Ray Kill Cam. Rebellion, however, had something else in mind with Sniper Elite: Resistance. Instead of featuring a brand new story taking place after the fifth main entry in the series, the new game focuses on the hidden war fought during World War II, detailing British soldier Harry Hawker's mission to dispose of a new insidious Wunderwaffe that would allow the Nazis to easily turn the tides of the war. Operating in France, Harry Hawker ends up collaborating with the local Resistance to learn more about this new threat and get rid of it for good on the eve of one of the most important events of World War II: the Allies landing in Normandy.</p>

<p>A game like Sniper Elite: Resistance is most definitely not story-driven, nor does it attempt to be, as its story and characters are nothing to write home about. While Harry's snarky remarks can be fun to hear from time to time, they don't add much to what is a typical war story with all the usual elements, such as brave Resistance members, ruthless scientists and Gestapo operatives and so on, although the fanaticism of Special Committee C, the group behind the chemical Kleine Blume weapon, is refreshing in some way, as it breaks the Nazi absolute obedience to the Fuhrer seen in this type of story.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Sniper Elite: Resistance delivers fully when it comes to gameplay, although with a few caveats. For starters, anyone who has played Sniper Elite 5 will inevitably feel disappointed at the lack of new features in the latest entry in the series. In pretty much every gameplay aspect, Resistance feels more like an expansion of the previous entry in the series, featuring more of the same. That isn't a bad thing at all, as the stealth gameplay is extremely tight thanks to the varied design of the new maps, which include a Nazi-occupied dam in the Alps, occupied cities with plenty of facilities, including a hotel, a coastal chemical weapons plant, a hilltop fortress and so on.</p>
<p>Following the series' tradition, these maps feature main objectives that must be completed to proceed to the next map and plenty of side objectives, which include killing a specific target, collecting documents and other collectibles, and so on, which expand the game's playtime considerably. All the maps, like in the past installments, are designed as sandbox locations where the player is free to reach the main objectives and deal with the enemies any way they see fit, taking advantage of the environment and the tools that can be scavenged on site as well, such as crowbars, explosives and any sort of weapon. These tools augment Henry's loadout, which includes a sidearm, an automatic weapon, and a long-range rifle that can be selected before a mission begins. All weapons can also be fully customized using workbenches found during missions with new parts that can greatly alter their performance, giving players the chance to tailor them to their preferred playstyle.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250121182518_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Speaking about playstyles, as already mentioned, Sniper Elite: Resistance allows players to tackle each mission's main objective any way they want. While sneaking around remains the way to go, those who are keen on a more aggressive approach can definitely just go all out and kill all the Nazis on sight, although this approach becomes less and less viable the higher the difficulty is set. Besides featuring some general difficulty presets, Sniper Elite: Resistance also allows players to fine-tune the difficulty to their liking by including options that change specific aspects of the challenge level, such as enemy aggression, accuracy, skill, sniper skills, perceptiveness, turning Focus on or off, the ability which lets Henry perceive enemies in the vicinities, and more, granting players a surprising amount of control over the entire experience.</p>
<p>Even just using the regular difficulty presets, the game can be quite challenging, especially for newcomers who are not used to its mechanics. Thankfully, it does not take long for players to get to grips with them, so, on the whole, the experience is rather welcoming despite the complexity of some of its mechanics, such as sniping, which requires players to keep quite a few things in mind before pulling the trigger. The aforementioned trademark X-Ray Kill Cam naturally makes a comeback, giving players the chance to see exactly how they have killed their enemy with their well-placed shots. Depending on how an enemy is killed, Henry will also obtain experience points to level up and earn Skill Points that can be used to unlock the skills included in the three available skill trees. The vast majority of these skills are rather basic, but some of them can be a big help, depending on the playstyle, such as those that enhance the aforementioned Focus mode, which makes sneaking easier and possibly more fun.</p>
<p>Besides featuring eight main missions set in some rather varied locations, Sniper Elite: Resistance also features an additional set of missions called Propaganda Challenges, which are unlocked by finding Resistance posters hidden inside the main maps. These special missions are slightly different from the main ones, as they put the player's stealth, combat, and sniping skills to the test. By completing them within certain time limits, it is possible to unlock medals and new weapons, so completionists have plenty of reasons to clear them. Those who wish to put their skills even more to the test also have the chance to play with or against other players in a variety of multiplayer modes and Survival Mode, the same modes seen in Sniper Elite 5. Rounding up the multiplayer modes offered by the game is the ability to play each main story mission in co-op mode, which opens up some extremely interesting possibilities, making repeated playthroughs even more fun.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250122193226_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Launching on previous generation consoles as well as on PC and current generation systems, it is not surprising to find that Sniper Elite: Resistance is far from the best-looking stealth game available. While locations look decent enough and finely detailed in a previous-gen sort of way, character models leave something to be desired, especially when it comes to facial details, which look rough, and animations, which are a tad stiff at times. Still, the game's visuals are acceptable, for the most part, and fans of the series will not find anything truly wrong with them, as Sniper Elite has never been known for its amazing graphics. The relatively simple visuals also mean that the game runs reasonably well on different PC system configurations.</p>
<p>On the system used for the review (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB), the game ran at native 4K resolution (the game does not support any upscaler), and the settings in the screenshots below, at an average of 181 FPS, 65 FPS 1% lows, in a benchmark session held in the Assault on Fort Rouge mission. Unfortunately, I have experienced some second-long stuttering at times, which were annoying, immersion-breaking, and caused some slip-ups in combat and stealth sequences, but at the very least, they did not happen too often.</p>

<p>To no one's surprise, Sniper Elite: Resistance strength is also its main weakness, as the game is essentially Sniper Elite 5 with a new main character, a new set of missions, and very little else. While this can be good news for those who wanted more of the previous entry in the series and some of its best features, such as the Axis Invasion Mode, fans of the franchise who wanted to experience its next evolution will inevitably be disappointed by what is essentially more of the same. It's a solid offering, to be sure, but still Sniper Elite 5 by another name.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jdm-japanese-drift-master-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Gaming Factory has announced the&nbsp;<em>JDM: Japanese Drift Master&nbsp;</em>release date, and the Japan-set "simcade" racer is coming to PC across various storefronts in March.</p>

<p>The game - which is "the most wishlisted racing game on Steam", according to Gaming Factory - launches for Valve's storefront, as well as the Epic Games Store and GOG, on March 26th.</p>

<p>It promises "winding mountain roads, scenic rural streets, and city highways" for you to race along, all of which will be located within the fictional Japanese prefecture of Guntama, an open-world expanse that "spans over 250km in main roads".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/jdm-japanese-drift-master-release-date-racing.jpg?itok=FDw3BrjM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/jdm-japanese-drift-master-release-date-racing.jpg?itok=T2ip4Es4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>JDM: Japanese Drift Master&nbsp;</em>hits the streets in March.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather curiously, despite being a fictional prefecture, Guntama will boast "the most famous tourist landmarks". These will include a recreation of the world-famous Himeji Castle, which is in&nbsp;Hyōgo Prefecture in the real world, and the Daikoku Parking Area, which you can find in Yokohama.</p>

<p>Unlike many other racing games,&nbsp;<em>JDM: Japanese Drift Master&nbsp;</em>also has a story. You'll play as Polish driver Touma, who wants to prove himself on the local Guntama street racing circuit.</p>

<p>As he tries to do so, he'll make friends among the locals, but he'll also make enemies, leading to "drama, action, and even love". It's fairly unusual for a racing game to emphasize its narrative these days, but it's nice to see nonetheless.</p>

<p>Intriguingly, the story in&nbsp;<em>JDM: Japanese Drift Master&nbsp;</em>will be told "through in-game events and a manga" drawn by Gaming Factory's art team.</p>




<p>Of course, it wouldn't be much of a racer without cars, and&nbsp;<em>JDM: Japanese Drift Master&nbsp;</em>has plenty, packing in licensed brands like Nissan, Mazda, and Subaru.</p>

<p>The game will also offer the opportunity to tweak and upgrade your car to your heart's content, and Game Factory says it's "constantly adding presets for driving wheels and the plethora of simdriving hardware available on the market" as well.</p>

<p><em>JDM: Japanese Drift Racer&nbsp;</em>launches for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1153410/JDM_Japanese_Drift_Master/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/japanese-drift-master-b4fd48" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/japanese_drift_master" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> on March 27th.</p>

<p>Sniper Elite Resistance’s game length and how many hours are required to beat it keeps coming up. This is because previous games have a consistent model, so let’s see if Resistance deviates, or if you can expect the usual-length adventure.</p>



<p>Sniper Elite games are not known for having a ton of missions and chapters. Instead, it’s quality over quantity with a select palette of levels deep enough to fill in the Grand Canyon. Most entries feature an array of playgrounds giving you freedom and flexibility in how you approach them. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> is a lot more of the classic action fans have come to love.</p>



<p>If you want to know how much bang you’re getting for your buck, I can tell you using my hands-on experience.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-sniper-elite-resistance">How Many Hours to Beat Sniper Elite Resistance?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A beautiful beginning. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>My first playthrough of Sniper Elite Resistance took just over eight hours to complete.</strong></p>



<p>By this, I mean the main Campaign. No Propaganda missions, Invasion distractions to deal with, or replaying missions. It was a chronological playthrough of each level in the main story.</p>



<p>The first level is more of an introduction to the game’s mechanics, and the epilogue is over in a couple of minutes. The bulk of the content lies in the main missions. <strong>I had some levels last 45 minutes to an hour</strong>, whereas one had me in the palm of its hands as I easily racked up <strong>over 90 minutes of playtime</strong>.</p>



<p>Each person’s logged hours depend on your goals. I enjoy exploring the full map, completing every objective, and looking for collectibles. You might be more fixated on completing the main objective and that’s it. You’re looking at closer to six hours if you approach <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite</a> Resistance this way.</p>



<p>Furthermore, <strong>the difficulty you play on has a huge bearing on the hours logged too</strong>. I opted for the middle of the three, meaning I got a fair amount of assistance lining up shots, but enemies still proved to be stern opposition and used me for target practice quite regularly.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-sniper-elite-resistance-full-completionist-run">How Long is a Sniper Elite Resistance Full Completionist Run?</h2>



<p><strong>Sniper Elite Resistance is likely to take you 30-40 hours if you want to see and do everything.</strong></p>



<p>I’d consider the multiplayer aspects of the game optional. So, to complete every mission with full stars on Authentic Difficulty, along with the Propaganda side content, and find all Workbenches, Posters, and collectibles, my timeframe feels accurate.</p>



<p>Your experience with Sniper Elite games, your ability, and your time and patience all factor into the total time-to-beat estimation. If you’re a veteran, you could maybe attempt Authentic Difficulty right away. If this is your first Sniper Elite purchase, expect 40 hours—and maybe more—for full completion. </p>

<p>A loaded Sniper Elite Resistance Trophy and Achievements list awaits hungry hunters. But I hope you’ve got plenty of spare ammo because there are a lot of optional objectives to go around.</p>



<p>Rebellion’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> is the next shooter in the long-running, sniper-centric series. In it, we’re once again tasked with sneakily (but not always) chopping down Germans during wartime. Many missions await, along with fun challenges, and the Trophy and Achievement list goes one step further and challenges all facets of your sniping abilities.</p>



<p>This is an extensive list and one that demands respect. It features offline play, online play, and much more in between.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Can you give me a second, please? Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 62 PlayStation Trophies in Sniper Elite Resistance and 61 Xbox Achievements if you want to do everything.</strong></p>



<p>Xbox continues to use Gamerscore as its reward for Achievements, whereas PlayStation users always get a bonus courtesy of Platinum Trophies. This is the key difference between Trophies and Gamescore. <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> still has a ton of additional tasks for you to do, whichever console you choose to play. Just know that going for total completion will sap your time, energy, and patience.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-sniper-elite-resistance-achievement-amp-trophy">Every Sniper Elite Resistance Achievement &amp; Trophy</h2>



<p>Get ready to complete the campaign, master a bunch of skills and talents, and battle opponents online. Also, be prepared to land an unbelievably precise shot on one unfortunate enemy’s crotch!</p>



<p>Now I’ve piqued your interest, check out the non-hidden list.</p>

<p>Sniper Elite Resistance has quite a few hidden Trophies and Achievements. I wouldn’t say they’re the most spoiler-heavy tasks, but they’re initially hidden nonetheless.</p>

<h2 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-trophies-amp-achievements-difficulty-rating">Sniper Elite Resistance Trophies &amp; Achievements Difficulty Rating</h2>



<p><strong>Many Sniper Elite Resistance Trophies and Achievements need you to prevail on Authentic Difficulty and achieve Three-Star Ratings—which is why this gets an 8 out of 10 for toughness.</strong></p>



<p>This is a very skill-based list, and your mileage will depend on <em>you</em>. Completing missions and Propaganda quests without assistance is the bulk of the list’s difficulty. Take your time, understand the game’s mechanics, harness patience, and you might walk away with everything.</p>

                <p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has said doubled down on Microsoft's commitment to the hardware space via Xbox, saying the company aims to "win" by providing the best experience out there. At the same time, Spencer admitted that times have changed. These days, it's a "game-first" market as opposed to "platform-first," he said.</p><p>Appearing on the GamerTag Radio podcast, Spencer said, "I want people to pick hardware based on the capabilities of that hardware and how that fits into the choices they want to make about where they want to play. We want our hardware to win based on the hardware capabilities that we have."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAl5yVpNc3o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mAl5yVpNc3o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Spencer said the biggest, most-played, and most successful video games out there today are multiplatform games that are not locked to one device. Spencer said he's hopeful his teams can create a platform with Xbox that appeals to developers who make those kinds of games.</p><p>"I want to build a platform that services those creators: those creators that are trying to meet people on every screen," he said.</p><p>Spencer also pushed back against the ongoing claims and assertions that Microsoft should get out of the hardware business given its place as the No. 3 system out there today, behind PS5 and Switch.</p><p>"Our own hardware? I think it's fundamental to what Xbox is. It's not lost on me that, 'Box' is in the name of our brand. I'll say, in the position I'm in, I look at hardware as a critical part of what we do," he said.</p><p>Spencer said it's his mission, as the CEO of Microsoft Gaming, to "build innovative hardware" that he hopes will attract players. That could be a traditional console that plays on a TV, or a handheld device, or even in "other places" via Xbox, he said.</p><p>On the subject of the handheld market, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-console-generation-could-include-a-handheld-report/1100-6526635/" data-ref-id="1100-6526635">ongoing rumors of Microsoft creating its own dedicated Xbox portable device</a>. Spencer didn't confirm anything, but said he's learned a lot from Steam Deck and ROG Ally, specifically. "What does Xbox mean on those platforms? I don't think we've tuned it perfectly yet," he said.</p><p>The video game hardware market in the US had a difficult 2024, with all three major platforms--PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch--seeing their yearly sales sink year-over-year. A downturn was expected due to the age of the systems, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gaming-hardware-was-always-expected-to-struggle-in-2024-but-it-was-worse-than-one-analyst-expected/1100-6529003/" data-ref-id="1100-6529003">the falloff was greater than some experts envisioned</a>. The Xbox Series X|S platform is seeing particularly challenging results, as sales relative to the Xbox One are down as well, whereas <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gaming-hardware-was-always-expected-to-struggle-in-2024-but-it-was-worse-than-one-analyst-expected/1100-6529003/" data-ref-id="1100-6529003">PS5 sales are up over PS4 over a similar period of time.</a></p>

Additionally, players who purchase the game on PC by April 2 will receive the same bonuses that came with preordering the game on PS5--the Hayabusa-ryu, Nioh-ryu, and Aisu Kage-ryu styles for katana, as well as the Hayabusa-ryu style for naginata.

            <p>
The Japanese version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has been hit by censorship restrictions from the country's ratings board. 
</p>
<p>
In Japan, Ubisoft will now release a version of the game without the ability to behead your enemies or slice off their limbs.
</p>
<p>
These changes - and others listed below - will now mean the game will be granted a Z rating, which is the equivalent of an 18, by  Japan's Computer Entertainment Rating Organisation (CERO).

<p>
"Regarding differences in content between the overseas (North America, Europe) and Japanese versions of Assassin's Creed: Shadows, the version sold in Japan of Assassin's Creed: Shadows (CERO: Z) will have some differences in in-game content in order to comply with the regulations of the certification organisation," Ubisoft revealed in a statement posted to its Japanese <a href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1882611785775174070">social media account</a>.
</p>
<p>
"The option to switch amputation on/off from the game settings has been removed, and amputating the neck and limbs of enemies during gameplay is now always impossible."
</p>
<p>In other words, all versions of the game have the ability to turn off more graphic violence. But, in Japan, these options will be locked down, and limbs will always remain attached.</p>
<p>
There are other changes, too. Ubisoft has altered the "amputated surface of the body", presumably to make it less graphic. 
</p>
<p>
"The representation of some Japanese voices played in the overseas version (North America and Europe) has been changed," Ubisoft added, without further explanation.
</p>
<p>
Japan's rating board has long been squeamish around the issue of violence in video games, with limb removal an issue in other games previously such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cod-black-ops-censored-in-japan">which was censored</a>) and the recent Dead Space Remake (which was denied a release altogether).
</p>
<p>
The issue sparked a notable response last year from a Japanese EA executive, after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-will-be-uncensored-in-all-regions">Japanese version of Stellar Blade was allowed a rating despite showing severed limbs</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"What's going on CERO?" EA's Japanese boss Shaun Noguchi <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blades-uncensored-release-in-japan-prompts-criticism-of-rating-system/">wrote at the time</a>. "You denied our Dead Space a rating because it included cross-sections of severed body parts and internal organs, but here we have both cross-sections and insides on display passed off with a CERO D [17+] rating. I find this hard to accept..."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer recently went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">hands-on with Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which our Katharine described as the series' "biggest shake-up of the series in years".
