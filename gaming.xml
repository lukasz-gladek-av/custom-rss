<p>This month, NVIDIA also added a few extra games to the library compared to the original plans for February, including the Batman: Arkham games (the first step for <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-to-add-wb-games-titles-starting-with-batman-arkham-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warner Bros.

According to a representative, starting today, new members are once again going to be able to sign up for GeForce NOW, whether they are planning on a free, 1-month or 6-month membership. These memberships will be available in the US, Canada, and Europe. New members can sign up using a credit card, PayPal, Google Pay, or Apple Pay. However, there's no update yet on existing GeForce NOW members being able to make changes to their current membership. As a reminder, in the meantime, they can enjoy free gaming without billing.</p>

That’s part of the pitch behind Ludoscene, an app for game recommendations that uses humans rather than machines to tell you what to play. The other part of the pitch is turning personal gaming taste into a slick-looking deckbuilder rogulite. <br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196663" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="429" data-playlist="196663,196086,196918" data-current="196663"><div><p>The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22220.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Lots of games that people would love will get buried,” Andy Robertson, author of <em>Taming Gaming </em>and freelance journalist for the BBC, told <em>Kotaku</em>. “Popularity is a way for some of those to float up but you have to kind of get lucky, you have to get that social traction.” If games never start to pick up that traction, social media and storefront algorithms quickly leave them behind, the plight of many a fantastic PC game with over 90 percent positive ratings on Steam and less than 500 reviews, indicating that maybe only a few thousand people ever played it. </p><figure id="" data-id="45a9e9273f288710e4eac3b7959e4237" data-recommend-id="image://45a9e9273f288710e4eac3b7959e4237" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="173" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cards wiggle in an web browser.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Robertson is part of the team pitching Ludoscene, a web browser app that uses gaming experts to curate thousands of games users might want to play based on the ones they already like as well as on factors like platform, genre, and other preferences. “We wanted to have a system where it could be much more eclectic, and there’ll be a much greater chance that you’ll encounter games that you probably would never encounter if you just looked at what was popular on Steam or Xbox,” he said. </p><p> The project currently has a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ludocene/ludocene-game-discovery-from-people-you-trust&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ludocene/ludocene-game-discovery-from-people-you-trust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter</a></span> with the hope of launching the initial version later this year. There are three main components to building Ludoscene. The first is human curators like <em>My Perfect Console</em> podcast host Simon Parkin and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/videoverse-game-review-online-gaming-forums-vn-kinmoku-1850780173&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/videoverse-game-review-online-gaming-forums-vn-kinmoku-1850780173"><em>Videoverse</em></a></span> designer Lucy Bundell. The second is a database of great games with over 3,000 entries categorized based on the team’s input. And finally there’s the creative interface: a <em>Balatro</em>-like deck of cards you slowly build up by swiping based on what you like and don’t like. </p><p>It reminds me of a scene from <em>Halt and Catch Fire</em>, the cult AMC drama about the rise of computers, in which Lee Pace is filling up a whiteboard with colorful post-it notes in an attempt to fully map out the nascent world wide web in the early ‘90s. Before Google used algorithms to sort everything and eventually ended up breaking the internet in the process, life online was catalogued and curated by regular people just looking to connect over shared passions and hobbies. It’s inefficient and clumsy but also more intimate and meaningful. </p><p>I have no idea if Ludoscene could be that for game recommendations but it could certainly be the start of trying to move game discovery and recommendations back toward something more personal and authentic. And unlike mapping the entire internet, you only need a dozen really good game recommendations to keep you busy for a long time. The dating-app-like aspect of just getting presented with one choice at a time rather than being bombarded with 100 critically acclaimed games from the last five years is also very appealing. </p><p>The plans for Ludoscene also sound quite robust. It’s not just giving you names of games to go look up later. You can flip each game’s card over and see quick snippets of actual gameplay taken from trailers, what platforms the game is on, its price, and links to immediately go buy and download it on the platform of your choice. It’ll also tell you if the game is available on one of the subscription services like Game Pass or PS Plus so you know before spending the money.</p><p>“There’s quite a lot of nice,  ongoing curation so it really is about creating a relationship person to person, both in terms of game suggestions and the experts, which is quite a different approach to just purely algorithms, or  just using tags to try to float stuff up to the top, which works for some games, but not for others,” Robertson said. “It’s really about that human connection.” The team is looking at recruiting more than the few dozen experts it’s currently working with and hopes that personal touch will be a big part of Ludoscene’s draw.</p><p>Another thing the project has going for it is just how terrible the existing storefronts are at showing players games they might like. Despite years of information on what I own and play, the PlayStation Store, Microsoft Store, and Switch eShop are effectively useless when it comes to browsing for anything outside of broad genres and the games that are already popular in them. Steam is much better relatively speaking, but still not great in the broader scheme of things.  Ludoscene sounds like a good antidote to those shortcomings. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Pokémon has announced Pokémon Champions, a new title developed for mobile and Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>The announcement was made during the Pokémon Presents showcase, where it was said that the title will be focused on Pokémon battles that “you know and love from core Pokémon games.”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Pokemon Champions Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9t-KdSW5iHs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Pokémon Champions will be a multiplayer game where players can matchmake with others around the world.</p>



<p>GAME FREAK is said to be carrying out the planning for the project, while development will be handled by The Pokémon Works.</p>



<p>Players will also be able to connect with Pokémon HOME, meaning you’ll be able to use Pokémon from previous Pokémon games in Pokémon Champions.</p>



<p>No release date was announced for Pokémon Champions, but base on the announcement, it seems like it could be a ways away from release.</p>

The studio behind </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Job Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vacation Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—two games that helped introduce players to virtual reality—isn't resting easy on its laurels. With its latest omnidimensional diner/garage simulator </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://dimensionaldoubleshift.com/">Dimensional Double Shift</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the company is once again shifting strategy with new ways to make VR games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But this time, its experiments aren't just technical or design-led in nature. In 2024 Owlchemy Labs released </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dimensional Double Shift </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">as a free-to-play open beta, a first for the company that packaged its previous games as standalone products. It's also the company's first-ever multiplayer game, joining the ranks of popular titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gorilla Tag</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>VR Chat</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. So while it's a little late to the multiplayer party, Owlchemy Labs "chief executive owl" Andrew Eiche told Game Developer in a chat at DICE 2025 that the game is part of the studio's strategy to keep up with the ever-shifting VR market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's always worth checking in where great studios think the next opportunities are—and in our chat, Eiche was glad to unpack how the studio is keeping up with new trends like social multiplayer while not sacrificing quality along the way.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="VR players want to hang out with their friends">VR players want to hang out with their friends</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gorilla Tag</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has shown us, a growing number of VR users are surprisingly young, and not interested in the same kinds of games that dominated in the early days of the HTC Vive and Oculus Quest (now the Meta Quest). As has been harped on many times in conversations about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and other games popular with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/7oC45CC1s-0">the youths</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the next generation of players is way more interested in "social experiences" than their predecessors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But that's a clinical (and maybe creepy) way of saying it. Eiche says when Owlchemy's been speaking with players, they hear it put more plainly and simply. "They're not even going 'can you add multiplayer?' It's more like, 'why can't I play with my friends?'"</span></p><p>Image via Owlchemy Labs/Google.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via Owlchemy Labs/Google.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The subtle difference is that the first question is a request for a new feature, and the latter is an understanding that "playing with my friends" is a default expectation. So when Owlchemy started work on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dimensional Double Shift</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, getting players in groups with their friends was the number one goal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a goal that became more challenging when picturing the economics of VR. Owlchemy's previous premium games only cost $20, but if four players want to run their multidimensional diner/garage, the game would max out at around $80. "Consumers care about where their dollars go," he said. "So for us it was a product of necessity to be like, 'if we want to make a multiplayer game, we need people to not feel the friction of playing.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, Owlchemy had observed that the Meta Quest Store—currently the de facto leader in the VR landscape—was shifting to a more "App Store" style algorithmic system that surfaced more free-to-play games with in-app purchases. Owlchemy has no experience with free-to-play, so committing to a long dev cycle with no firm understanding of monetization was going to be difficult. Hence, the decision to launch in open beta.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our job is to make sure it doesn't shift to the dark part of [monetization]," he said, nodding to how some games rely on player compulsion to drive spending and keep them hooked (a topic </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/greenheart-necromancer-reinvents-the-idle-game-shows-how-to-rethink-predatory-mechanics">many developers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are examining lately).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The open beta launch has done more for Owlchemy than just help them crack monetization, it's helped them learn where they should be putting focus on their game development. As they suspected, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dimensional Double Shift</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> players do indeed prefer casual sci-fi diner/garage shenanigans over stiff competition (sometimes making their own ad hoc minigames). They also enjoy having game modes (referred to as "shifts") that do offer some competition, but it's not the center of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What did surprise them? When they launched, they didn't expect players would want to play with anyone other than people they already knew. But they quickly got feedback that players did in fact want matchmaking options. They wanted to meet people and experience omnidimensional life with new pals.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="VR multiplayer turns game development on its head">VR multiplayer turns game development on its head</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers aren't likely to be surprised that switching from single-player to multiplayer development introduces a whole host of challenges. Eiche said that Owlchemy had to make major changes to its usual formula and "rip out" all of their previous tech solutions and build it all for multiplayer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The biggest breakthrough, he said, was in the world of player proximity. The "secret" to VR multiplayer up to this point is that player "spheres"—the area around their avatars—are never supposed to touch. If they do, it can be violently disorienting or (or at worst, grounds for harassment. Eiche said that Owlchemy spent 3 years aggressively tackling that problem. In a game about working shoulder-to-shoulder in a diner/garage, it definitely helps to not have to give players wide spaces to avoid each other's bubbles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other pain points, he said, include fluid physics and hand-tracking data. Continued improvements to hand-tracking capabilities allow players to be more communicative when in VR—but they also add millions of data points that have to be networked across up to 4 machines.</span></p><p>Image via Owlchemy Labs/Google.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via Owlchemy Labs/Google.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fluid physics, he said, almost didn't make it into the game. The team came to grips early on with the fact they didn't think they could implement the feature, despite it being a popular part of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cosmonious High</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Job Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vacation Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. But he said in Owlchemy's history, "we can't do that" often turns into more of a dare than a barrier.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We confidently say we can't do something like 'we can't make sandwiches and pick them up. They have to be made on a sandwich maker,'" he said. "And then a dev gets a wild look in their eye, and they lose their mind, and they're like, 'I'm gonna do it. God damn it. We're gonna make fluids work.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So features like fluids (and sandwiches) often make it into Owlchemy Games out of "spite," said Eiche.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Where is VR headed?">Where is VR headed?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">2024 was a rough year for the virtual reality marketplace. Though Camouflaj's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Batman Arkham </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Shadow </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/batman-arkham-shadow-1-million-players-quest-3/">was a standout success of the holiday season</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, analysis indicates that Meta Quest sales slowed down during what should have been the busiest month for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/meta-quest-3s-failed-to-boost-holiday-demand-for-vr-in-2024">the headset.</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile Meta has signaled </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/meta-ponders-whether-reality-labs-could-be-more-efficient-after-it-loses-another-4-4-billion">it's scrutinizing</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the billions of dollars its Reality Labs division has burned away, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/meta-laying-off-workers-within-reality-labs-division">laid off Reality Labs workers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in June of last year. The Meta quest isn't the only headset on the market, but it is the most popular, and slowing sales could be frustrating news for VR developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eiche said he's not fazed. Despite being owned by Meta competitor Google (itself in the process of rolling out Android XR, its answer to Meta, Valve, and Sony Interactive Entertainment's VR platforms), Owlchemy's remained a multiplatform studio, focused on wide releases over pushing parent company hardware. He said he's excited for the potential of Android XR, though Owlchemy's PR representative stressed to us that he was speaking solely as the boss of the VR studio, not as an employee of Google.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He does think some VR firms have lost the plot a little when it comes to what VR is supposed to be "for." "People don't like technology," he argued, a surprisingly bold claim given how technology has invaded everyday life. "But that's fine. It's just a necessary thing they interact with—like a dishwasher—as part of being an adult."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The thing that we have to answer as an industry is 'why is this so valuable that it's worth putting something hot and heavy and a little bit isolating [on your head?'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's why he's not a fan of the idea of "general computing" (using VR for ordinary desktop tasks like spreadsheets and email) as a primary force for VR—at least not yet. "Fully immersive stuff is actually the answer to that," he said, referring to software experiences that are wholly unique to VR. He thinks VR users might be open to those kind of tasks—but they'd be better served as gentle interruptions of the fully-immersed VR experience, not lesser versions of what players do outside their headsets.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">VR studios have been particularly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/independent-vr-studio-archiact-is-making-layoffs">hard hit</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by the mass game industry </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/uk-studio-ndreams-confirms-layoffs-could-impact-17-5-percent-of-workforce">layoffs </a></span><span data-testid="content-text">of 2023-2025, with some devs saying it's an "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/vr-dev-fast-travel-games-cuts-30-employees-saying-vr-faces-a-more-uncertain-year-">uncertain year</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" for the field.

Obsidian role-playing game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> now has an official mushroom kit, which you can use to grow a crop of colourful fungus at home similar to the infestation that covers your hero's face.
</p>
<p>
Not convinced? How about if we told you this creeping mass of plague-like fungi was designed to be enjoyed as a snack? Just peel the mushrooms from the Avowed-branded box, and pop one in your mouth. Delicious.
</p>
<p>
This official kit comes from mushroom mail order service North Spore, which sadly does not seem to ship to the UK. Maybe that's for the best.

US residents keen to grown their own plague (actually, perfectly edible oyster mushrooms of various colours) can order an Avowed kit online for <a href="https://northspore.com/products/organic-spray-grow-avowed-grow-kit">$30 plus shipping</a>. Each kit comes with a random colour selection included, which only reveals itself when the spores bloom.

Optionally, you can also download 3D printing details for a bear ornament to grow your mushrooms on, similar to the infected hulking enemies found within the game. Yummy.

Avowed looks to have done well enough for Obsidian, which has now hinted at more to come from its plague-ridden role-playing game. The game's director, Carrie Patel, was recently asked whether her next project would be something new - but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-director-hints-at-a-future-for-the-franchise">said it was likely she'd be back for more Avowed</a> - be that more content for the first game, or sequels.
</p>
<p>
"What Avowed lacks in gloss it makes up for with charm, depth and a playful heart," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Eurogamer's Avowed review</a>. "It's one of this year's most pleasant surprises."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-program-march-3rd-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has announced that a special&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>broadcast is set to air next week, bringing more news about the cult JRPG franchise.</p>

<p>In a rather brief <a href="https://x.com/Konami/status/1894938037122957766" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Konami says that the broadcast, which will air on March 3rd at 3pm Pacific (that's 6pm Eastern), will bring you "all the latest news on&nbsp;<em>Suikoden</em>".</p>

<p>That's a particularly interesting way of wording it, because we already know the release date for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Suikoden II&nbsp;</em>remasters, so presumably, the broadcast will contain some new information about the future of the series.</p>

<p>I think more remasters are significantly more likely than a brand new game in the franchise, although Konami must be pretty confident in&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>if it's doing more than just the upcoming remasters of the first two games.</p>

<p>News of the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>broadcast comes as Konami revisits some of its biggest franchises in the form of remasters and remakes. Last year, for instance, the company worked with Bloober Team for the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake, which has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">amassed more than two million sales</a> around the world so far.</p>

<p>The studio is also gearing up for the release of&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, a remake of the 2004 stealth-action classic, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">in August</a>. The game will feature a visual overhaul thanks to the magic of Unreal Engine 5, as well as updated gameplay mechanics.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>itself, the snappily-titled&nbsp;<em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars&nbsp;</em>collection is due to launch next week.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, the collection remasters the first two games in the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>series, which are connected by a number of recurring characters and narrative elements. The remasters will feature updated visuals, new animations, and extra quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>remasters when they land on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1932640/Suikoden_III_HD_Remaster_Gate_Rune_and_Dunan_Unification_Wars/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10004292" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/suikoden-iii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars-pre-order-bonus/9P9FM62WZXR2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/suikoden-i-and-ii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on March 6th.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>broadcast, meanwhile, is set for March 3rd, and you can watch it via Konami's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KONAMI573ch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>. The link in Konami's post on X leads to the Japanese channel, but the post itself is in English, so it's not clear whether the show will air in English or just in Japanese.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-financials-2024-revenue-falls<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros. has released its financial summary for both the fourth quarter of 2024 and the year as a whole, and it probably won't surprise you to learn that it's been a pretty bad year for the media giant's gaming wing.</p>

<p>In its earnings <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_earnings/2024/q4/earnings-result/WBD-4Q24-Earnings-Release.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">release</a>, Warner Bros. says its gaming division's revenue dropped by 29% in Q4 when compared to the previous year's quarter, which the studio puts down to the "better performance" of big sellers&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">Hogwarts Legacy</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-sales" rel="nofollow">Mortal Kombat 1</a>&nbsp;</em>last year.</p>

<p>This is likely at least one of the figures that caused Warner Bros. to&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow">close three of its studios recently</a>, namely Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and WB San Diego. They're not mentioned in the financial report, but that could just be because the report covers the period ending December 31st last year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warner-bros-financials-2024-monolith.jpg?itok=b5odTwrZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warner-bros-financials-2024-monolith.jpg?itok=rIJTz3Ba 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Warner Bros. recently closed&nbsp;<em>Middle-earth: Shadow of War&nbsp;</em>developer Monolith, as well as two other studios.</figcaption></figure><p>The weak performance of two major Warner Bros. games last year, namely superhero live-service looter-shooter&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>&nbsp;</em>and crossover fighter&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow"><em>MultiVersus</em></a>, both contributed to WB Games' weak year.</p>

<p>Both games performed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024" rel="nofollow">so poorly</a> that they were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-updates-ending-season-5-offline" rel="nofollow">shut down</a> before being on general release for a year (although&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>technically spent some time in a sort of beta-Early Access limbo between mid-2022 and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-open-beta-will-close-in-june-full-release-coming-in-early-2024" rel="nofollow">spring 2023</a>).</p>

<p>Back in January, it was revealed that Warner Bros. gaming head David Haddad <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-david-haddad-stepping-down" rel="nofollow">would step down</a> after over a decade with the company. The reason for his departure wasn't officially announced, but I can't imagine&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>' failures had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>As for what the future holds for Warner Bros., the company says it's planning to refocus on "proven IP" like&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter</em>,&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones</em>,&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em>, and the wider DC universe, including "top tier characters like&nbsp;<em>Batman</em>".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warner-bros-financials-2024-batman.jpg?itok=64LAPPnr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warner-bros-financials-2024-batman.jpg?itok=wkA8H8fr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Warner Bros. says it wants to refocus its efforts on proven IP like&nbsp;<em>Batman</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>To that end, it was recently revealed that DC Studios boss James Gunn <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dc-boss-in-talks-with-rocksteady-and-netherrealm-to-develop-dc-universe-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">has been talking</a> to Warner Bros. studios Rocksteady and NetherRealm to develop DC games, although it's not clear which games those might be.</p>

<p>Given that the closure of Monolith also includes the cancellation of that studio's&nbsp;<em>Wonder Woman&nbsp;</em>game, though, I wouldn't hold your breath for anything but a new game starring Batman or one of his extended family. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>PlayStation has announced that the PlayStation VR2 will be getting a worldwide price reduction in March 2025.</p>



<p>Announced in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/27/a-great-new-price-for-playstation-vr2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation blog</a>, the PSVR2 will now start at a new retail price of $399.99 / €449.99 / £399.99 / ¥66,980.</p>



<p>For those whop want to purchase the Call of the Mountain Bundle, the recommend retail price will be $399.99 / €449.99 / £399.99 / ¥66,980. The bundle includes a PlayStation Store voucher code for Horizon Call of the Mountain, PS VR2 headset, PS VR2 Sense controller, and stereo headphones.</p>



<p>Announced in November 2022, the PlayStation VR2 started at $549.99 / €599.99 / £529.99 / ¥74,980, which was considered a hefty price at the time for a limited amount of games and the need to purchase a PlayStation 5 alongside it.</p>



<p>PlayStation points out that PSVR2’s catalogue of games is now better then ever, “With recently released hits like&nbsp;Alien: Rogue Incursion,&nbsp;Skydance’s Behemoth, and&nbsp;Metro Awakening VR, and exciting new game launches on the way including&nbsp;Aces of Thunder,&nbsp;Dreams of Another,&nbsp;Hitman World of Assassination, and&nbsp;The Midnight Walk, it’s never been a better time to jump into the action with PS VR2. Using the&nbsp;PS VR2 PC Adapter, players will also have access to browse, buy and play thousands of virtual reality games on Steam. Title release dates and regional availability may vary.”</p>



<p>The blog post continued, “In addition, with a recent update to PS VR2, it now supports low-latency hand tracking is now supported, which allows developers to create games that tracks a player’s hand position and movement through the cameras embedded on the PS VR2 headset. Through this new feature, players will be able to experience intuitive controls in supported games such as<em>&nbsp;</em>Waltz of the Wizard.”</p>

And when those fans aren't happy, they aren't afraid to be vocal about it. Some of Riot's most recent moves--including the removal of Hextech chests--angered players so much that the company is now walking back that decision as well as a few other unpopular changes.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAVa467pHl8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sAVa467pHl8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the video above--and in the accompanying <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-hextech-chests-getting-champs-more/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post on Riot's site</a>--Senior Vice President Andrei Van Roon and League of Legends executive producer Paul Bellezza explained why the company is reversing its recent decisions. Bellezza noted that their choices had eroded some of the trust that fans had for Riot, and they want to fix that.</p><p>The first step in rebuilding that trust is coming in next week's patch, which will restore Hextech chests to the game. Eight chests will be available through the free seasonal pass, while players can earn two additional chests through the game's Honor system. The dev post notes that the Honor system is still being worked out, but it's meant to reward players who are good teammates and respectful opponents.</p><p>League of Legends' Exalted skin for Sahn Uzal Mordekaiser is also being delayed to give the developers more time to "deliver on its core fantasy." Fans have been very critical about the Radiant Serpent Sett and Fractured Arcane Jinx Exalted skins, which is why Riot plans to put greater effort into future Exalted skins to meet players' expectations.</p><p>Riot is also reducing the cost of unlocking champions through League of Legends' in-game currency, Blue Essence. As of the next patch, the price for all champions will drop by 50% in the hope that players can more easily expand their roster with new and older characters.</p><p>Earlier this month, Riot announced that the League of Legends fighting game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/2xko/" data-ref-id="5000-503365">2XKO</a>, won't be getting the large playtest in March that was originally planned. Instead, a smaller playtest will be held while the company builds its infrastructure for a larger test later this year. League of Legends also recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcanes-mel-officially-joins-league-of-legends-with-a-new-noxian-look/1100-6528699/" data-ref-id="1100-6528699">added Mel Medarda to the roster</a>, following her larger role in the second and final season of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcane-season-2-trailer-charts-the-past-and-future-of-sisters-at-war/1100-6527212/" data-ref-id="1100-6527212">Arcane</a>.

            <p>
A new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eternal-strands">Eternal Strands</a> update has made various adjustments to the fantasy action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s movement and so, restarted the inexhaustible debate as to what manner of jank is 'good' jank.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Posting in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1491410/view/506195909797741132?l=english">their latest dev roadmap</a>, creators Yellow Brick acknowledge complaints about protagonist Brynn's motions feeling a bit slippy-slidey, particularly when accelerating or decelerating or being struck by an object. "Some of you described that her walking/running felt a little bit too much like 'skating' and that the lack of precision could be frustrating at times," they write.
</p>
<p>
That slipperiness is sort of the aim, however. Eternal Strands is broadly a Dragon Adjacent physics sandbox, with objects you can lob about with your legally distinct Jedi mind tricks, and elemental gimcrackery such as freezing and combustion. Brynn's character model doesn't stand aloof from all that - while she has more capacity to direct the proceedings, she's also basically another child in the ballpit.
</p>
<p>
 "Something to note about Brynn's movement is that much of how it feels is intended and attributable to how a 100% physics-based sandbox game like Eternal Strands is designed to work," the post goes on. "Being an object that reacts to the physics surrounding her, just like any other object in the world, means that her weight and inertia have an impact on her movement." 
</p>
<p>
They are, however, trying to find some common ground with the detractors. Difficult to find common ground when you're coasting about like a seal, I guess, but it definitely sounds like change for the better. As of today, Bryn's "minimum acceleration speed has been enhanced". Following the next update "reaching a target speed or slowing down to a full stop will happen quicker" to avoid the impression of sliding, though if you're lightly clad and equipped there will stil be a touch of "skating". Furthermore, "direction changes will be much 'snappier'."
</p>
<p>
Occasionally eccentric handling notwithstanding, Eternal Strands has found a following on Steam. While our own reviewer Sophie Glass <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eternal-strands-review">noted its "janky controls"</a>, she also pointed out that it's the work of a small team, and described it overall as "consistently surprising and enjoyable".
</p>
<p>
In particular, Sophie highlighted "the lovely improvised chaos of physics systems bumping into each other", adding that "every time I get flung directly into the sky, or a triceratops thing mistimes its own attack and slams a rock the size of a piano into its own face, I am filled with the wild joy of being alive."
</p>
<p>
Personally, I like games in which the physics often betray you. Many are the laughs I have had while accidentally judo-throwing myself in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gang-beasts">Gang Beasts</a>. I'm also fond of how Eternal Strands harkens back to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/psi-ops-the-mindgate-conspiracy-retrospective">a sillier age of video game telekinesis</a>, long before Control came along and made it all seem so stylish.

<p>The Little Nightmares 3 release window is locked in. A painful delay pushed a dagger into the heart of everyone excited for the innovative sequel. With Supermassive Games now at the helm, there’s a tangible sense of anticipation, and Little Nightmares 3 information is available already.</p>



<p>There’s a small pocket of repressed Little Nightmares trauma locked away in my brain. From my first run-in with Little Nightmares to the sequel, Tarsier Studios did a great job of making me feel trapped, defenseless, and helpless. Little Nightmares 3 looks like another mysterious and miserable meander through horror and hellacious hell, this time in the Nowhere.</p>



<p>Little Nightmares 3 was scheduled for 2024, but a delay impacted its debut. A new release window has been confirmed.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-little-nightmares-3-releases">Do we Know When Little Nightmares 3 Releases? </h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s going to be a scarily good time. Credit to Supermassive Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>An exact Little Nightmares 3 release date hasn’t been declared by Supermassive Games or Bandai Namco, but we know it’s scheduled to arrive sometime in 2025.</strong></p>



<p>May 31, 2024, was the day <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-delayed-to-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3 was delayed to 2025</a>. It was a dark day, and I shut myself in my room and sulked.</p>



<p>Both developer and publisher declared in a <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1796512039768097038" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on X</a> they have been “Working hard towards delivering the best experience possible for the next entry in the franchise.” Here’s hoping we don’t have to wait too long for a concrete date.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-little-nightmares-3-platforms">All Little Nightmares 3 Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Bandai Namco and Supermassive Games are giving Little Nightmares 3 a wider launch on PlayStation</strong> <strong>4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</strong></p>



<p>It always brings me joy to tell gamers a game is coming out on all platforms. No one misses out, everyone has a chance to get involved, and the title ultimately benefits. Little Nightmares 3 has a big chance to keep the series’ momentum moving in a healthy direction. </p>



<p>I’d also wager a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> port could happen if Nintendo feels the need to cast its net out even further.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-how-much-little-nightmares-3-is">Do we Know How Much Little Nightmares 3 is?</h2>



<p><strong><strong>The Little Nightmares 3 price hasn’t been revealed yet, and the ability to wishlist the game is currently the only option.</strong></strong></p>



<p>We’re still on for a 2025 release, but the price is a mystery. It may be a case of leaving it until the final few weeks once an official release date is announced. If I use Little Nightmares 2 as an example, the first sequel retailed at <strong>$29.99 and £24.99</strong>.</p>



<p>I can see Little Nightmares 3 either sticking to this price point, or because of extra work, slightly increasing Little Nightmares 3’s RRP to <strong>$34.99 and £29.99</strong>. This is guesswork, but don’t be shocked if it ends up in this ballpark.</p>



<hr>



<p>I’m ready for the new nightmares, are you? Will you be playing solo? Or are you grateful to finally have someone’s hand to hold through the visual hellscape unfolding before your eyes?</p>

                <p>Since the latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/" data-ref-id="5000-179949">Sims 4</a> update released, players have noticed some odd bugs--even by the Sims' standards. As of the latest patch, which introduced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-4-update-adds-burglars-back-to-the-series/1100-6529708/" data-ref-id="1100-6529708">burglar Robin Banks</a> to the game, child and baby Sims may appear pregnant, have beer-bellies, or be oddly muscular.</p><p>Some players on The Sims subreddit, as picked up by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-latest-patch-makes-some-children-appear-pregnant-players-say" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, noticed that some of their child sims were suddenly appearing pregnant--in one case, the user claimed the bug was affecting every male child in their game.</p><p>The bug appears to be visual only--the child Sims have thankfully not been given the actual pregnancy state and are not about to give birth to other Sims--but in a game like this, visuals are important to most players.</p><p>Other posts on the Sims subreddit suggest there are more visual glitches affecting young Sims, with one post showing a collection of strangely buff babies, and another showing a child Sim who looks like he's been hitting the gym.</p><p>One Reddit user theorized that the game is somehow mixing up child and adult body types, mistakenly applying adult musculature, beer bellies, or pregnant bellies to child and infant Sims. While it's easy to fix an adult Sim who's been assigned the wrong body type, child Sims' bodies can't be customized, making this bug difficult to get around. Even aging up and then regressing the Sim doesn't appear to reset the body-distorting bug, according to players' experiments.</p><p>The Sims has a history of unintentionally hilarious bugs, like the one that gave infants <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-4-bug-is-turning-babies-into-monsters/1100-6512406/" data-ref-id="1100-6512406">freakishly long limbs</a> back when the new life state was first introduced, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/25-years-into-the-sims-ea-is-still-making-the-same-mistakes/1100-6529270/" data-ref-id="1100-6529270">EA's poor track record</a> of fixing bugs means players are often anxious about how long disruptive bugs will stick around. While this bug hasn't been officially acknowledged yet, EA encourages players to report bugs through its forums, where <a href="https://forums.ea.com/idea/the-sims-4-bug-reports-en/toddlerinfantschild-body-and-face-distortions/11928891" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a thread</a> has been started to catalogue body distortion in child Sims.</p><p>EA recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-and-sims-2-legacy-editions-are-full-of-bugs-according-to-players/1100-6529205/" data-ref-id="1100-6529205">re-released The Sims and The Sims 2</a> as legacy editions, including all their DLC packs. However, these re-releases also launched with a number of bugs that have frustrated players. A Sims community manager has said that the legacy game bugs are currently being investigated.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-charger-first-look-suggests-it-may-have-a-detachable-cable.1120281/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-charger-detachable-cable/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new look at the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con grip and the very first look at the console's charger have come today thanks to a well-known leaker.</p>
<p>As shared on the&nbsp;<a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1639206" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Famiiboards forums</a>, the Xiahongshu forums user who obtained a CAD model of the console last year and provided some new images of the dock <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-new-dock-pictures-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday</a> also shared a few hours ago some new pictures of the Joy-Con grip and the new console's charger. While the Joy-Con grip looks identical to the current one, although the model shared in the picture may be incomplete as it's not clear how it would hold the Joy-Con controllers in place, the charger is definitely different from the one of the current Switch models, as it is generally a little smaller with only a slightly bigger width, according to some rough measurements provided by user <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1639220" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LiC</a>. The most interesting thing about the charger, however, is that no cable is visible in the model provided by the Chinese leaker, so there's the chance that it could have a detachable cable.</p>
<p>While this isn't exactly the news fans are looking forward to hearing regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, it's still nice to be able to learn more about the system before the floodgates open for real on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/">April 2nd</a>, when the Japanese company will host a dedicated Nintendo Direct to provide more information on the system. In addition, the company will host several preview events around the world where players will be able to get hands-on time with the system before its launch. A release window has yet to be confirmed, but the system should be out before the end of summer, according to a<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/"> former employee.</a></p>

            <p>
Motor company Honda has unveiled a glimpse at a Pokémon motorbike themed around Legendary creature Koraidon, star of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-scarlet-violet-walkthrough-tips-9015">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a>.
</p>
<p>
Koraidon, along with his buddy Miraidon, are dragon-like creatures which can be used as motorbikes in the games. So the theming is appropriate. 
</p>
<p>
But is this motorbike practical for the real world? Well, that's another matter. With spikes on its wheels and actual feet (although maybe that's a stand?), it seems like not. And that's before you get to the lack of license plate. Still, if you had the money and the space for it, you would. Wouldn't you?
</p>

<p>
Honda's sneak peek of the Koraidon motorbike, made in conjunction with The Pokémon Company, is available to watch above. A full unveiling - when we're likely to find out how much this beast might cost - will come next month. 
</p>
<p>
"Honda has realised an almost life-size reproduction of the shape of Koraidon in both weight and size, down to the finest details," the company wrote.
</p>
<p>
"Honda will use its proprietary self-balancing technology to enable Honda Koraidon to walk on all four legs, and self-stand on two-wheels which is unseen in the game. This balance technology... was developed by applying the self-balancing technology cultivated in ASIMO humanoid robot research. Honda will apply this technology to realise Koraidon's 'Sprinting Build'.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time a Pokémon has been transformed into a motorbike. Last year, Toyota took the reigns on a Miraidon prototype - though it's unclear if that design was ever proven road-worthy (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/random-honda-teases-real-life-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-motorbike">Nintendo Life</a>).

<p>Tripwire Interactive’s Killing Floor 3 is another bout of beautiful violence. Eviscerating Zeds and leaving them for dead is the name of the game—well, Killing Floor 3 is. If it’s your first time or you’re a returning fan, here’s the Xbox Game Pass status for the FPS title.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-platforms-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killing Floor 3</a> is already testing the waters well ahead of time. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-announced-along-with-closed-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed beta</a> lets players see what’s new, what works, and what needs fine-tuning. The second installment was fun but had a penchant for repetition, and the third mainline release is looking to be the best yet.</p>



<p>Eventually, Killing Floor 3 will launch, and if it’s on Xbox Game Pass, this is a victory before we even play the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-killing-floor-3-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Killing Floor 3 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Sir, this is a Wendy’s. Credit to Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Xbox Game Pass is not adding Killing Floor 3 to its collection of easily accessible games.</strong></p>



<p>You get access to hundreds of games if you’re a Microsoft Xbox Game Pass subscriber. Many of these arrive as day-one debuts on the Game Pass scheme. However, <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Killing Floor 3</a> is not a day-one addition as Tripwire Interactive and Microsoft don’t have an agreement for it to happen.</p>



<p>There’s no mention of Killing Floor 3 coming to Game Pass on its official store page. Nor has the opportunity been mentioned in any trailers, prerelease material, or press releases.</p>



<p>Titles associated with Xbox Game Studios are pretty much day-one Game Pass releases. Any other third-party titles are not guaranteed and it’s up to the two companies to come to an understanding. If not, the game launches of its own accord and it’s up to the publisher to drive sales. In this case, Tripwire Interactive is handling both development and publishing duties, so it’s up to them to generate interest and revenue for KF3.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-killing-floor-3-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Killing Floor 3 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s uncertain if Killing Floor 3 is coming to Xbox Game Pass at any point.</strong></p>



<p>The closest KF has come to Xbox’s Game Pass subscription service was in 2024 when Killing Floor 2 was offered as a “Free Play Days” promotion. Game Pass users were allowed to sample Killing Floor 2 for a few days. After this, the title went back to being another purchasable option on the Xbox store.</p>



<p>We’ll update this guide if Killing Floor 3 does come to Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<hr>



<p>Killing Floor 3 looks to be as brutal and painful as its predecessors. Can you envisage yourself losing hundreds of hours lopping off limbs and severing skulls? Or is Killing Floor 3 not your stop?</p>

Ubisoft has detailed the list of achievements for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and said the game won't require you to play twice or pick a particular character at certain points in order to unlock every award.
</p>
<p>
The full list of achievements lies below - and they're the same across Steam, Xbox and for Trophies on PlayStation. There are no spoilers.
</p>
<p>
Not requiring multiple playthroughs is probably for the best - Shadows looks like another Assassin's Creed epic, following previous games like Odyssey and Valhalla where I clocked up playtime in the 100s of hours.

</figure>
<p>
Having to finish the game once to then unlock a harder difficulty and grind for another achievement after completing that? No thank you.
</p>
<p>
"Available on day one, these Steam achievements (which are the same as the Xbox achievements and PlayStation trophies) can all be earned in a single playthrough, meaning no achievement can be missed regardless of what story choices you make," Ubisoft wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3159330/view/535468672209128051?l=english">blog post on Steam</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"And don't worry - your Leap of Fail will look just as spectacular whether you're playing on story mode or on expert level, as all achievements are unlockable regardless of difficulty level."
</p>
<p>
(At a guess, I'd say Leap of Fail will likely pop when you try to perform the iconic Assassin's Creed dive as samurai Yasuke - who is not trained for the purpose.)
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows' two protagonists offer two different gameplay styles (quiet assassin, or all-out samurai) and can be swapped between frequently - or not, if you so choose.
</p>
<p>
The game also features dialogue choices, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-has-a-canon-mode-story-option-without-narrative-choices">Ubisoft has also confirmed Assassin's Creed Shadows' canon story mode option</a> for those who want a strictly linear narrative.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-monster-hunter-wilds-too-easy.1120227/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/is-monster-hunter-wilds-too-easy/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Watching the credits roll on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> after twenty something hours, I had a sudden realisation. Apart from one completely avoidable KO (I forgot to pause the game while answering the door), I had managed to blitz my way through the game without failing a single quest.&nbsp;It got me thinking, is Monster Hunter Wilds too easy?</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a_wNFT4j6qI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For context, I barreled my way through all the main quests, engaging in as little side content as possible, and only started upgraded my weapons and armour during the game’s final act. Even then, I wasn’t paying any particular attention to my loadout, slapping together a patchwork of different armour sets and only caring about the overall defence rating.</p>
<p>The reason for this wasn’t for lack of caring – Wilds offers a huge amount of customisation and scope for build optimisation – but as with <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, there was little incentive to fuss over armour until reaching the endgame, mainly focusing on weapon crafting and making sure I had a small arsenal that could exploit any elemental weaknesses.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t accuse Monster Hunter Wilds of aggressive hand-holding, though there are plenty of revised features and mechanics that make it by far the most streamlined and accessible games in the series to date. With its shift towards a seamless open world (instead of travelling between self-contained biomes) there’s been a shift away from making meticulously pre-hunt preparations. Whether stocking up on items, swapping weapons, or even cooking a succulent meal, this can all be done in the press of a few buttons, no matter where you are.</p>


<p>The Seikret – your new bird-like mount – also helps to greatly simplify the core gameplay loop. It will automatically give chase to a target monster, paring back the investigation system introduced in <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter World</a>. By popping open the world map, you can set a waypoint anywhere then sit back and watch the Seikret do all the navigation for you. From the saddle, you can even use your grapple tool to scoop up resources instead of needing to be in close proximity – a couch potato’s dream! Initially, from a purist perspective, it feels kind of wrong though it’s definitely useful and, most importantly, saves time.</p>
<p>It’s no doubt Capcom’s intention to get hunters stuck into the combat gameplay as quickly as possible, and for as long as possible. It’s the reason for the season with each weapon being even more deadly thanks to the advanced movesets and abilities found in Wilds. Still, on the whole, monster battles offered little resistance during my playthrough – it was only the final two encounters that forced me to lock in and focus and, as a result, they were the most fun and engaging. There is an abundance of environmental interactions that can aid you in a fight, from impromptu traps and falling debris, to helpful critters that can heal or hinder.</p>

<p>Your feline Palico companion is also a bit of a handrail, occasionally dousing hunters with healing items and drawing a monster’s attention while also laying traps and barrel bombs. The Seikret proves itself as a worthwhile ally during battle too, quickly scooping up players if they want to make a speedy exit while also carrying a pouch of surplus items and a way to quickly switch between your two equipped weapons. If you need any further assistance, letting off an SOS flare will open the door to other players joining your session. Failing that, NPC hunters will turn up.</p>
<p>Overall, the main questline in Monster Hunters Wilds is pretty easy for returning fans and won’t be too much of an obstacle between newcomers and the end credits. While some hunts felt like an absolute cakewalk, this isn’t such a bad thing.&nbsp;As much as I cherish them, those first two Monster Hunter games were punishing for solo players and required many long minutes of prep work and navigation before you even caught a whiff of your target, whereas Monster Hunter Wilds opens this potentially intimidating series up to more players through the gradual ramp of difficulty. It allows them to experience a wider spectrum of different monsters, locations, and mechanics without needing to grind away between each milestone, and that acts as a lure to the endgame.</p>
<p>Thankfully, for hardened hunters and new inductees alike, there’s a glut of challenging endgame content that will no doubt expand over time, hopefully leading into an inevitable expansion similar to Iceborne and Sunbreak.</p>
