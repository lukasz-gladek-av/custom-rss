This time around, unlike in the previous films, humans aren’t hopping into the digital world, but instead, programs and elements from “The Grid” are being manifested into reality. It’s a strange concept, but this new official trailer has sold me on it, at least aesthetically. Seeing Recognizers and Light Cycles in the real world is striking. </p><p>Here’s the new trailer from Disney: </p><p>Everything is going great in this trailer until we reach the 40-second mark, when we’re reminded that Jared Leto is the film’s star. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://airmail.news/issues/2025-6-7/the-cult-of-leto&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://airmail.news/issues/2025-6-7/the-cult-of-leto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Earlier this year, at least nine women accused</a></span> the actor and musician of sexual misconduct.

Overall, he just has big creep vibes. So seeing him in the new <em>Tron </em>movie sucks.</p><p>On the flipside, Nine Inch Nails is handling the music for the film, and the first song off the <em>Tron: Ares </em>soundtrack sounds awesome. </p><p>Again, what a shame Leto is involved in what seems to be a really cool soft reboot of the <em>Tron </em>series. Even Jeff Bridges is back for this one. Great! Now, let’s digitally cut out Leto and replace him with someone who isn’t a dirtbag. </p><p><em>Tron Ares </em>hits theaters on October 10. Here’s the official synopsis from Disney: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>Tron: Ares</em> follows a highly sophisticated Program, Ares, who is sent from the digital world into the real world on a dangerous mission, marking humankind’s first encounter with A.I. beings.</p></blockquote><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/tron-3-ares-jared-leto-trailer-official-nin-new-song-1851786513]]></content:encoded>

                <p>What does a day in the life of billionaire gaming boss Gabe Newell look like? Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ZALKAR.SALIEV">Zalkar Saliev</a> from one of his yachts, the Valve co-founder said he enjoys the benefit of living on a boat while maintaining a fairly regular work schedule.</p><p>"I get up, I work, I go scuba-diving, work some more, [then] either go on a second scuba dive or I go to the gym and work out.

"In that sense I've been retired for a long time.</p><p>In addition to his responsibilities at Valve, Newell started the neural interface company Starfish Neuroscience, a competitor to Elon Musk's Neuralink. He's also working with a company that is creating an "aerosol pathogen detection device" that reveals what pathogens may be in the air.</p><p>"I just work all the time," he said. "But it's not like, 'Oh my god I'm up late at night slaving away on stuff.' It's more like, 'I can't go to sleep because I'm having fun,' you know?"</p><p>Newell dropped out of Harvard in the early '80s to join Microsoft, <a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-millionaires-unleashed-12-ex-194415077.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leaving the company as a millionaire</a> with Mike Harrington to form Valve.

			<p>The Epic Games Store has kicked off its new Summer Sale, which will run from today, July 17, to the end of the month on July 31, and while it'll feature a number of solid deals, its best deal is probably the fact that you can grab <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/civ-vi-rise-and-fall-expanding-greatness/">Sid Meier's Civilization VI</a> for free.</p>



<p>Not just the base game for Civilization VI, mind you, but the Platinum Edition of the game, which includes its six DLC packs and two expansions. It's everything under the sun that's Civilization VI related, and the perfect deal for anyone who was perhaps unsure about jumping into Civilization VII.</p>



<p>It was made available for free starting today, July 17, and will only be available to grab until next week on July 24 at 8am PT / 11am ET / 4pm BST. So make sure to redeem it at some point in the week before then, to add it to your library and ensure you can download and play it through the Epic Games Store at any time in the future. </p>



<p>When it comes to what's not free on the EGS, some of the more notable deals include Red Dead Redemption 2 being 75% off and Cyberpunk 2077 being 60% off. <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-patch-2-3-amd-fsr-4-frame-generation/">Cyberpunk 2077 also recently got yet another significant update</a> from CD Projekt RED, making it once again another good time to jump into the game if you've not yet played it. </p>



<p>There are also a few notable games that came out this year that are on sale, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/blades-of-fire-review-god-of-the-forge/">Blades of Fire</a> on sale for 20% off,  and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> on sale for 10% off. </p>

It’s a soccer game (or football for you Europeans)currently in early access. It’s a surprisingly authentic soccer game that takes some creative liberties, such as placing a barrier on the edges of the field so the ball can’t go out of bounds.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>That makes <em>Rematch</em> stand out from other soccer games like <em>FIFA </em>as matches remain uninterrupted. <em>Rematch </em>remains skill-based. You still need to shoot, pass the ball at the right opportunity, and navigate complex plays. It’s not always easy, so let’s go over some essentials to improve your game.</p><h2 id="h736181"><a id="1"></a>Actually go through those tutorials!</h2><figure id="" data-id="ed725046b4444d0fe762840129896519" data-recommend-id="image://ed725046b4444d0fe762840129896519" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows tutorial options for Rematch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows tutorial options for Rematch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sloclap / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ed725046b4444d0fe762840129896519" data-recommend-id="image://ed725046b4444d0fe762840129896519" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows tutorial options for Rematch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I know that lots of players love to ignore tutorials in video games or blow them off, but they’re a crucial part of mastering the mechanics in <em>Rematch</em>. The game has no lock-on feature at all, which means you’ll have to be incredibly precise when passing to teammates or trying to score a goal. Tutorials are a great place to get the hang of that.</p><p>The practice menu has an extensive gallery of tutorials and workshops with categories ranging from movement, defense, passing, scoring, and goalkeeping. After every kick off in <em>Rematch</em>, you’ll switch up positions, and you could potentially be made the goalie, so don’t neglect these tutorials and keep your skills sharp.</p><hr><h2 id="h736182"><a id="2"></a>Experiment with camera and field-of-view settings</h2><figure id="" data-id="da993498590cc2d527c0e295b69de07f" data-recommend-id="image://da993498590cc2d527c0e295b69de07f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows camera settings for Rematch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows camera settings for Rematch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sloclap / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="da993498590cc2d527c0e295b69de07f" data-recommend-id="image://da993498590cc2d527c0e295b69de07f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows camera settings for Rematch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll want to minimize your blind spots. There are no indicators that an opponent is nearby like in an action game like <em>God of War</em>. In <em>Rematch, s</em>patial awareness is essential, so it can be advantageous to maximize the amount of the field you can see.</p><p>Go into the settings and crank up the Camera FOV setting all the way to 90. This sets the camera as far back as possible and lets you see teammates and opponents alike easier. You can also adjust the camera motion sensitivity so that you can keep track of the ball as it travels across the field. Feel free to make it as slow or fast as you want.</p><hr><h2 id="h736183"><a id="3"></a>Take advantage of the walls</h2><figure id="" data-id="5107fd3c53d8130057f5200688e0a228" data-recommend-id="image://5107fd3c53d8130057f5200688e0a228" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player lines up a shot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player lines up a shot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sloclap / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5107fd3c53d8130057f5200688e0a228" data-recommend-id="image://5107fd3c53d8130057f5200688e0a228" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player lines up a shot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In <em>Rematch</em>, if you kick the ball away from the field, it’ll bounce off and land back into the field, keeping it in play at all times. You should use this to your advantage. An opponent is closing in on you? Shoot the ball towards the wall and use your burst run to catch up to it. After all, there are no out-of-bounds. You can kick it all the way across the field and hope that your teammate catches up to it.</p><p>There’s even a trick utilizing the walls to score goals. Since the wall encompasses the entire field, that includes the goal. You can kick the ball above the goal and have it bounce off the wall behind it. Since most goalies are expecting a direct strike, they’ll dive in the direction you think you’re kicking. However, since the ball is going above the goal and landing right in front of it again, goalies can easily get disoriented and wonder where the ball went. Use this window of opportunity to launch a follow-up kick and score a goal. Sure, it’s a bit of an underhanded tactic, but use whatever you have to to win, right?</p><hr><h2 id="h736184"><a id="4"></a>Manage your stamina</h2><figure id="" data-id="6dcad9daa443f1d1d1703cc7ad2d1d54" data-recommend-id="image://6dcad9daa443f1d1d1703cc7ad2d1d54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A plalyer stands on a soccer field." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A plalyer stands on a soccer field." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sloclap / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6dcad9daa443f1d1d1703cc7ad2d1d54" data-recommend-id="image://6dcad9daa443f1d1d1703cc7ad2d1d54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A plalyer stands on a soccer field." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>No, this isn’t a <em>Dark Souls</em> game, but you’ll have to manage your stamina almost as if it were one. You have a meter at the bottom of the screen that’ll deplete whenever you run. However, it won’t drain if you just jog, so make sure to juggle between running and jogging to make full use of your stamina. If your stamina hits zero, you’ll be stuck moving at a slower pace until it recovers.</p><p>You can also perform slide tackles, which can really mess up opponents by taking the ball out of their control, but it uses up a heft bit of stamina. It also takes a bit to recover from the ground after slide tackling, so don’t go spamming it everywhere you go.

A turn-based deck-building rhythm game clearly made by musicians with a care for the craft scratches an itch for me that a lot of more straightforward rhythm games don’t.

Its love of the genre that’s given us everything from <em>Slay the Spire </em>to <em>Balatro</em>d is obvious, but it’s the care it demonstrates for the music out of which every mechanic is built that helps it rise above its contemporaries in the ever-growing field of deck builders.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,196447" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Music is everything in <em>Fretless</em>. Melodies and percussion are found in every pixel of its retro-style world. Passing through a small garden of flowers will release a series of calming notes into the air like you’re running your hands through a series of hanging handbells or wind chimes. The monsters that Rob, the silent but always expressive musician, faces on his way to a literal Battle of the Bands competition are all based on instruments, with each one weaponizing the game’s eclectic soundscape to stop him from reaching his destination. The only way to fight music is with a setlist of your own, and that’s the entire deck-building premise: making music with your own instruments.</p><figure id="" data-id="d4bf0dde8acc2eaece87ee9cf3e02d91" data-recommend-id="image://d4bf0dde8acc2eaece87ee9cf3e02d91" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Fretless boss battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Fretless boss battle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ritual Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d4bf0dde8acc2eaece87ee9cf3e02d91" data-recommend-id="image://d4bf0dde8acc2eaece87ee9cf3e02d91" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Fretless boss battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Rob can wield one of four instruments: an acoustic guitar, a bass, a synthesizer, and an eight-string electric. Each axe has a different set of “riffs” that make up a deck, and while you can customize your loadout, each has a bespoke, core mechanic that makes every instrument demonstrably different. The bass has a “slap” meter that, if strategically raised, will power up certain attacks to devastating effect. The synthesizer, which quickly became my favorite of the bunch, utilizes “status FX” and exploits them to multiply damage to such a high output that if I placed the right cards down in the right order, I could wipe out powerful bosses in a turn or two. The eight-string is perhaps the most challenging but rewarding instrument to wield, with its push-and-pull playstyle sapping your own health in exchange for destructive attacks, eventually culminating in summoning a powerful ally who can turn the tide of battle.</p><p>Each instrument requires a different strategy, and an intimate knowledge of the way different cards interact with each other to use them effectively. There’s a surprising amount of minutiae to each deck, and every attack you use, spell you cast, and status FX you inflict has a timed rhythm element that, if you manage to land it, will increase their effectiveness. After playing games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span>, which also had timing woven into its turn-based battles but whose dodge and parry windows were often poorly communicated, it was refreshing to have something like <em>Fretless</em>, which ties its blocking and power-boosting mechanics to the actual rhythm of the music being composed in each battle. After I’d spent hours fighting with the synthesizer, its riffs were baked into my muscle memory, allowing me to compose a symphony of whoop-ass with my eyes closed.</p><p>The rhythm elements are only part of optimizing a deck. Each turn, you use up to three cards with different (or repeating) effects, and each funnels into an instrument’s playstyle. The synthesizer has cards that inflict status FX, then damaging cards that increase their output if an enemy is afflicted by specific ailments. Choosing what order to use the cards in so you can chain their effects together is the core of its deck-building. Each turn, you draw new cards and have to work with the ones you’ve got on hand, and figuring out how to min-max whatever you’re stuck with can be the difference between a wasted turn and a strategic sweep. You start <em>Fretless </em>with the acoustic guitar and its damage-dealing and shield-building cards lull you into a false sense of simplicity, only for every subsequent instrument to experiment with the game’s deep mechanics in ways that I was constantly surprised by.</p><p>All of this would be nothing without <em>Fretless</em>’ excellent, eclectic soundtrack. Rob’s arsenal determines the battle music for most of its fights, but bosses bring their own sound into the ring. <em>Fretless</em>’ music spans so many genres, from the electric beats of the synthesizer to the distorted heavy metal of the eight-string. But when people aren’t slinging music notes at one another, it dips into chill, nostalgic ambiance evocative of the retro RPGs that clearly inspired its aesthetic. <em>Fretless </em>could have fallen back on crowd-pleasing licensed music, but instead it carves out multiple aural identities, each of which is etched into the world and the battles waged within it. I don’t want to downplay the depth of its card-battling systems, but as a retired musician, I find <em>Fretless</em> to be at its best when it’s leaning into a clear love of music and building its world around a shared understanding of the language of composition.</p><figure id="" data-id="1fdae701f910563da419762dee24aab2" data-recommend-id="image://1fdae701f910563da419762dee24aab2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Fretless rhythm section mini-game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Fretless rhythm section mini-game." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ritual Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1fdae701f910563da419762dee24aab2" data-recommend-id="image://1fdae701f910563da419762dee24aab2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Fretless rhythm section mini-game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Fretless</em> is full of what are essentially worldbuilding puns based on its musical theme. It plays with old RPG tropes by giving them a musical twist. The inns at which you heal yourself are adorned with a big sign showing a quarter rest…because you rest there, you know? Its equipment loadouts are mods to your instruments like pedals, pickups, and strings. It’s like everyone and everything in its world lives and breathes musicality, and it’s such a consistent, cute throughline that it stirred a love of musical creation in me that I sometimes feel like I’ve lost. I always have music playing in my ears. I work with a 200+ person musical group in New York City every week. However, after I moved away from being a professional musician to write about video games for a living a decade ago, the compositions I once spun in my head like breathing became background noise in my everyday life. I’ll find a new song or artist I resonate with, one of my faves will put out a new album, or I’ll go to a live show and remember all my musical inclinations like I’m putting on an old glove. <em>Fretless</em> gave me that same feeling, all to the tune of a well-crafted deck builder. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fretless-wrath-riffson-deck-builder-music-rpg-review-1851786514]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">The current gaming industry is filled with remakes and remasters; some of them are faithful to their source material, while others are more open to changing things around when needed. It's not too often that the original creator of a remade work speaks about a modern reimagining, but recently the co-creator of Crash Bandicoot took to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrew-gavin-441765_in-my-opinion-key-word-opinion-the-crash-activity-7350944750100762624-wc29/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADS31r4B5UCbzMu8ZKusxOGCydRRQic55jc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> to give his thoughts on 2017's N. Sane Trilogy--and the "most important 30 milliseconds" worth of change that made a world of difference.</p><p dir="ltr">As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/crash-bandicoot/crash-bandicoot-co-creator-says-the-remake-got-almost-everything-right-except-the-most-important-30-milliseconds-and-thats-why-it-feels-worse-than-the-1996-original/" rel="nofollow ">GamesRadar</a>, Naughty Dog co-founder Andrew Gavin posted a wide range of thoughts about the modern remasters of Crash Bandicoot 1-3, While he says the games "nailed the visuals" and said they "looked great [and] faithful to the original," in his mind, things went south when it came to jumping--or, as he put it, the team "completely botched how jumping works."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4533892-crash.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533892" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4533892-crash.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533892"></a><figcaption>That polar bear is just happy to see Crash, right?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4533892-crash.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The original game, Gavin explains, read how long the player held the jump button down and measured Crash's jump accordingly--the longer a player held the button, the higher Crash jumped. This mechanic was lost in the N. Sane Trilogy, according to Gavin, and replaced with a system when every jump is always the maximum height possible.</p><p dir="ltr">"The remake developers either didn't notice this system or thought it wasn't important," Gavin's post said. "They reverted to simple fixed jumps, [and] then realized Crash couldn't make half the jumps in the game. Their solution was to make all jumps maximum height."</p><p dir="ltr">This solution, according to Gavin, fundamentally changed how jumping in the remaster worked, to the game's detriment. "Now every jump on the remake is huge and floaty. Those precise little hops between platforms are awkward," Gavin wrote. "The game's fundamental jumping mechanic feels worse than the 1996 original despite running on hardware that's 1000x more powerful."</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to try the altered jumping for yourself, Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy is available now for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/">Warner Bros.</a> has debuted a new trailer for Mortal Kombat II, the upcoming sequel to the 2021 Mortal Kombat live-action film. The sequel is set to hit theatres this coming October 24, 2025, and today's trailer shows off plenty of action that the film will feature, specifically around a character who was absent in the 2021 movie, Johnny Cage.</p>



<p>Karl Urban is the one stepping into the role of Johnny Cage, who by the looks of it, will be the focus of the narrative of this film.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Mortal Kombat II | Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdC5mFHPldg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Though, the real focus of anything Mortal Kombat, will always be the action, which this movie will hopefully have in spades. The trailer shows some of that, with Cage mostly dodging out of the way and discovering just how much he needs to punch above his weight if he wants to survive the tournament. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, we get to see more of Scorpion in action, as he slices Noob Saibot in half to close out the trailer. Which, admittedly, doesn't actually give the film the best setup it could, as the CGI doesn't look entirely clean.</p>



<p>But that could be due to a lot of things, and it's best to hold any final judgement until the film is actually out this October. Even if it's not able to deliver on a stronger story than the 2021 entry, hopefully, it will be able to deliver on more intense action, which was the strongest highlight of the 2021 movie.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like a lot of people, I mocked the term “friendslop” the first time that I heard it. It’s inherently funny to think of somebody getting upset about games that are made to give you an excuse to spend time with a few buddies. But as the term spread on social media, snowballing into a flurry of dunks and discourse, I started to realize that the term, said genuinely, had never actually existed at all. What does exist are platform dynamics, and the righteous dopamine hits they provide that have led to an entire cycle of people tilting at windmills.</p><p>“I call this genre of game ‘Friendslop,’” <a href="https://x.com/wooosaaaahhhhh/status/1901717577056780478" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote Twitter</a> user @wooosaaaahhhhh over images of <em>Lethal Company</em>, <em>R.E.P.O, </em>and <em>Content Warning </em>back in March, before coining another, even more deliberately nonsense term: “Its sole focus of existence is friendfarming.” In a follow up they attempted to clarify: “Ok so since this is actually getting hella traction I'll say I hope people see the word ‘friendfarming’ n realize I'm fucking joking LOL.” People did not.</p><p>The Tweet went viral, almost entirely through people taking it seriously. As it spread, the replies and quote tweets became a sea of derision: Anyone using the term “friendslop” surely had no friends to play with, people said. At first the backlash was mainly thousands of these mocking Twitter responses, but that changed after the release of <a href="https://aftermath.site/peak-climbing-impressions-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Peak</em></a> in June.</p><p>Having sold more than 5 million copies, <em>Peak</em> it also picked up a lot of interest in games media, which <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/peak-steam-landcrab-friendslop-update-interview-nick-kaman-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started to connect it</a> to the idea of “friendslop” becoming a catch-all term for co-op indie games. While it was once primarily used for horror extraction games, the inclusion of a current popular darling expanded the discourse around the term—<a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/article/not-every-co-op-game-is-friendslop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and made it more defensive</a>. As the discourse spread, Bluesky also took to mocking the supposed term, and it became a trending topic among commentary YouTubers and TikTokers, who took on the same contemptuous tone.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t have to call out randoms on the internet for this: In late June, a friend who I’ve been playing <em>Peak</em> with introduced the term to the group chat. I replied, “Me when I hate whimsy and joy and also literally ?????my friends???????” I, too, felt defensive of <em>Peak</em>, and it was also fun to mock the idea of the hypothetical miserable internet user who didn’t know how to find the enjoyment in playing it with good buddies.</p><figure></figure><p>I assumed the word, and the internet slapfights about it, would die off. I was wrong. It made me wonder if anyone was using it seriously, particularly on YouTube or Twitch, where contrarianism is lucrative. But I couldn’t find anyone responding to any specific video, or any big Twitch streamers using it. I couldn’t find a single example of someone saying “friendslop” except for as a joke or or a defense of the “genre.” Maybe they’re out there, but if they are, they’re absolutely buried under people who despise the term. Great news everybody! False alarm!</p><p>But people are still intent on dunking on the idea of someone using it, because ghost dunking is just as satisfying as real dunking. There’s no dopamine hit in quietly knowing that <em>Peak </em>and <em>Lethal Company </em>are just popular games to play with friends, safe from gamer slander. There is plenty of dopamine in saying “this guy has no friends lol” and getting 15 likes.&nbsp;</p><p>In <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abe5641" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2021 study</a>, researchers found that “positive social feedback for outrage expressions increases the likelihood of future outrage expressions.” In other words, the success of having a popular post yelling at something makes you more likely to do it again in the future. In this case, it’s a very low stakes situation, made up of the combination of people wanting to laugh at a silly term and to defend the honor of games without AAA polish that are mainly about collaboration and just hanging out, rather than the intense competition of some other multiplayer games. It’s also a collective outrage that people can participate in without having to think about the horror of the world like so many other collective outrages, and instead just reminisce on good times with good pals. But it’s still an example of the dopamine of discourse cycles making people get wildly carried away, sometimes based on absolutely nothing.</p><p>When we’re having an entire conversation that’s just barking at ghosts, it’s a good time to think about how these platforms impact more important discussions. To pick a recent example, it’s easy to post something popular about Microsoft’s recent layoffs. It’s more difficult to <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">avoid covering their games</a> as a gesture of solidarity towards the BDS boycott. To avoid talking about something by definition lacks engagement, so many people keep implicitly supporting Microsoft products. In short, posting about layoffs generates likes, and so does posting about how cool <em>DOOM</em> is. Therefore many people do both.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>Online discussion is all spurred by what does generate engagement, whether or not it's helpful or even true. For example, how we talk about generative AI. To be clear, among other issues, genAI broadly <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2479545-ai-hallucinations-are-getting-worse-and-theyre-here-to-stay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doesn’t work</a>. But when a (not yet peer reviewed) paper looked at the cognitive impacts, <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/your-brain-on-chatgpt/overview/#faq-is-it-safe-to-say-that-llms-are-in-essence-making-us-dumber" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their FAQ</a> asked people to avoid saying that it causes “brain damage” or makes people “stupid.” Nevertheless, that paper has been passed around by people claiming it shows “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgKmmGDx75U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ChatGPT is DESTROYING our brains</a>,” and causing “<a href="https://x.com/itsalexvacca/status/1935343874421178762" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cognitive bankruptcy</a>,”&nbsp; because it is an easy way to generate views, likes, and retweets.&nbsp;</p><p>In a 4000 word breakdown of what the study actually indicates, <a href="https://devonprice.medium.com/there-is-no-evidence-that-ai-causes-brain-damage-not-yet-anyway-7dcb0f4d667b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">educator and writer Devon Price</a> laments how it’s been misused, citing another study that shows that false news travels more quickly than truth on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is foolish, and defeatist, to say that today’s students have brain damage from using ChatGPT,” says Price, and it undermines the idea that “we can set things right at any time.” There’s plenty of genuine reasons not to use genAI without spreading falsehoods.</p><p>The fact that so much of social media is outrage, towards real or imagined slights, contributes to the&nbsp; everyday, grinding unpleasantness of how we use it; discourse cycles along with pile ons, doomposting, and so on aren’t the fault of individuals but instead symptoms of the same engagement-chasing platform designs that led to the defensive discourse around “friendslop.” They simply feel good—at least in the short term. But stewing in frustration, whether it be about a major news event or a made up genre term, only leads to a more negative experience in the long run. Even though platforms hook us in with the dopamine of easy outrage, taking a step back to double check whether something is entirely shadowboxing is still an option. So is just kicking back and enjoying a game of <em>Peak </em>with your friends.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lets-plays-sleep-youtube"><h3>Is Falling Asleep To Let’s Plays Medically Approved Gamer Melatonin Or Nah</h3></a><p>A gamer neurologist discusses whether YouTubers are onto something with this Millennial-meets-Gen-Z craze</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/godot-version-control-statistics-cms"><h3>A Salute To The 13%</h3></a><p>Let them live a little</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/horror-anime-crunchyroll-netflix-hikaru-takopi"><h3>Your Guide To Feel-Bad-Anime Summer</h3></a><p>The Summer Hikaru Died and Takopi’s Original Sin are a throwback to the disturbing, horrifying anime of yesteryear</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/friendslop-peak-lethal-company-social-media-discourse]]></content:encoded>

Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-film-trailer-sees-johnny-cage-jumping-over-a-bazooka-missile-with-some-very-wide-legs">yesterday's cheeky teaser trailer</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-2">Mortal Kombat 2</a> movie's ready for its full reveal, with two-and-a-half minutes of silliness, a little bit of splatter, and plenty of Johnny Cage.
</p>
<p>
A follow-up to 2021's mildly diverting live-action Mortal Kombat movie was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-movie-sequel-on-the-way-with-a-script-from-the-writer-of-moon-knight">announced all the way back in January 2021</a>, with Jeremy Slater - head writer on Disney+'s Moon Knight series - confirmed to be handling the script. Simon McQuoid remains on directing duties after helming the first movie, and the intervening years have brought various bits of casting news.
</p>
<p>
Top of the list, of course, is The Boys star Karl Urban, who's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-movie-reveals-best-look-yet-at-karl-urbans-johnny-cage">stepping into the high-kicking boots of series icon Johnny Cage</a>. This time around, it's Cage who's sucked through a portal and into the world of Mortal Kombat (Lewis Tan's Cole Young, who had a similar experience in the first movie is back too), and there's plenty of Cage in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tLZOvvf-n8">today's Mortal Kombat 2 reveal trailer</a>.
</p>

<p>

<p>
It's utterly daft stuff, leaning firmly into the pulpy ridiculousness of it all, even if the included Fatalities - which were rather underrepresented in the movie - aren't perhaps as outlandish as you might hope for. Still, who can resist a classic bit of surprise bifurcation, eh?
</p>
<p>
Mortal Kombat 2 also stars the likes of Jessica McNamee as Sonya Blade, Adeline Rudolph as Kitana, Ludi Lin as Liu Kang, Mehcad Brooks as Jackson "Jax" Briggs, CJ Bloomfield as Baraka, Tati Gabrielle as Jade, Chin Han as Shang Tsung, Hiroyuki Sanada as Hanzo Hasashi/Scorpion, and Max Huang as Kung Lao. And if all that appeals, it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-film-ties-down-release-date-but-its-not-out-until-next-year">out in cinemas on 24th October</a>.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's former editor-in-chief Wesley Yin-Poole wasn't overly keen on the first Mortal Kombat film, saying, "There's just enough low-rent entertainment to prevent [it] from being a complete disaster" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/save-your-gbp16-the-mortal-kombat-movie-is-boring">his review</a>. So fingers crossed for the sequel.

<p>USB-C what we did there?</p>

<figure><a title="switch 2 usb fan reddit" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5883b5e1b8818/switch-2-usb-fan-reddit.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Summer! It's hot. It's 'close', as they say round here. And when you're already hot and bothered, sometimes turning on your Switch 2 console in portable mode for a quick session, well, it's not gonna make you any cooler, let's put it like that.</p>
<p>And so, we've been delighted to see one gamer over on Reddit coming up with a very silly tip for hot days spent playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, or whatever else it is you've got on the go (this writer is all over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a> right now, FWIW).</p>
<p>Yes, as posted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1lxi84m/found_another_use_for_the_top_usbc_port/">u/Gamingjojo909</a> — who we're assuming is some sort of colossal genius — the top USB-C slot on the Switch 2 console can seemingly power a mini fan while you play (just probably not very safely). Huzzah!</p>

<p>Of course, as fun as this looks — and we're sure it's quite effective for beating the heat momentarily — it will also likely toast your battery pretty quickly and could, as noted a little further down in the comments, maybe even fry your Switch because of...science.</p>
<p>So don't do it. Just look at someone else doing it instead.</p>

<p>Right. Well, we're off to try plugging our favourite toothbrush into our consoles now. How dangerous could it be, right?</p>

However, I’ve spotted these games appearing in different parts of the store while looking for other stuff. And I can only imagine how many younger kids are searching up some of those “Italian Brainrot” memes and buying games based on them. Many of these titles featuring AI art are priced very low. <em>Tralalero Tralala Jumper,</em> for example, is only 50 cents. </p><p>I’m honestly baffled as to why Sony is letting this stuff live on the PlayStation Store next to big games like <em>God of War</em> and indie darlings like <em>Blue Prince.</em> It makes the store feel less like a curated collection of great games and more like a landfill where anyone can dump their garbage. It took me just a few minutes to locate dozens of these games, and it seems wild to me that Sony doesn’t have a few people on staff going through and deleting some of the most egregious crap on the store. </p><p>If something isn’t done soon I wouldn’t be surprised if this AI slop becomes a bigger problem, with more and more folks stumbling upon this junk as they shop the PlayStation Store. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps5-psn-playstation-store-ai-slop-brainrot-junk-spam-1851786494]]></content:encoded>

He beat the record for the most wins in season 41 back on July 15 when he hit his 9-day streak, so he’s really giving his other competitors a run for their money at this point. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/s41-28659-riccardi-home-1752768694584.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Smash player Scott Riccardi is also smashing Jeopardy.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/can-skate-revive-the-old-school-magic</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/can-skate-revive-the-old-school-magic.1246467/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Skate’s announcement way back in 2020 (originally dubbed Skate 4) we’ve seen an influx of skateboarding games, from sims like Session, to the arcadey Tony Hawk remakes, and unique experiences like VR Skater and Olli Olli World. No matter how you look at it, skateboarding video games are definitely back, but they’re still missing that open-world sandbox feel that the Skate series popularized back in the late 2000’s. When I got the chance to play an alpha build of Skate 3’s long awaited sequel, I was excited but also skeptical of how the Skate revival would work as a live service game, and most importantly, would it be able to recapture the magic from the first three entries?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Within minutes of my nearly six hours with Skate and after a few moments of me spectacularly ragdolling around San Vansterdam, I was able to reactivate my long dormant muscle memory to find myself grinding and kick flipping my way around Skate’s sandbox world. From the extremely intuitive and easy-to-digest first handful of missions that smartly taught me its gameplay mechanics in small digestible chunks, to its cleverly designed world that never slowed me down when I was cursing around, and its unique traversal system that plays more like an Assassin’s Creed and Spider-Man game than what I would expect from a skateboarding sim, it’s obvious that developer Full Circle took an “if it ain't broke, don't fix it” approach to this and made sure that Skate is a game that can be played and understood quickly. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Skate 4 Pre-Pre-Alpha Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the classic control scheme, Skate offers two variations of controls that can make the difficulty curve easier for new players as well as a multitude of quality-of-life features that, quite frankly, are a welcome addition. While I stuck with the original control scheme and didn't mess with any of Skate's accessibility features outside of a few less button presses, there's definitely a way to make Skate’s unique playstyle a little easier for both series newcomers and die-hard Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater fans. Regardless of how you want to play, Skate’s controls make pulling off gravity-defying tricks an easy and really fun process, thanks to its flick controls and intuitive movement system.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Skate’s controls make pulling off gravity-defying tricks an easy and really fun process.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Simply put, I had a ton of fun with my time cruising around San Vansterdam discovering cool things to skate on while riding from objective to objective. At its core, Skate is a big open sandbox where you jump on and off of things and do cool tricks in-between that. Because of this, I never felt pressured to complete any nearby objectives on my map, I never paid much attention to my score, nor did I feel stuck in that carrot-on-a-stick gameplay loop so many live service games rely on. While you are encouraged to complete objectives in order to unlock new areas and level up your character, I found myself ignoring that and just vibing around to the in-game soundtrack and finding new cool places to skate on. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, discovering those spots is extremely simple thanks to the ability to hop off your board and parkour around the map. I was able to easily scale buildings with Skate’s easy-to-use climbing controls and drop markers wherever I needed to spawn back to, which happened whenever I tried something stupid – like attempting to heelflip off a skyscraper onto a park bench. Which never worked out, by the way, but I still found myself trying over and over again. A movement system like this makes Skate less frustrating to mess around with and find fun and ridiculous areas to skate on all over the map. That being said, there are a hefty amount of objectives and story quests to complete that range from following a premade line, to getting a high score, and even one where I had to skydive off a building into a nearby bridge. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tonally, Skate looks and feels a bit different than the direction the original trilogy had. While I'm definitely nostalgic for the pseudo-realistic look of the originals, the world in Skate seems to be a bit more exaggerated and saturated. Early on in my session I had to complete a mission where I jumped off a building into a dumpster. The in-game narrator explained that nobody in that world feels pain when falling because a tech start up called ImpervaTEK figured out how to make people invincible. When asked to further elaborate, I was told to not worry because its science and the topic was never mentioned again. That’s pretty dumb, but OK, whatever. Let’s me keep skating, I guess. And while I loved the simple world building of Skate, the character models took a bit of time to get used to, since they kind of look like next generation Sims. But eventually, after a few costume adjustments, I was happy with how my bleach-blonde, mullet-wearing self looked, and I was back to landing triple kick-flips in no time. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you weren’t already aware, Skate is a free-to-play live service game, and while that is a major departure from the previous titles, its heavy focus on multiplayer gameplay really makes this version of Skate seem like it could be a game I would return to long after its release. The developers on site told me that there could be well over 100+ players on the map at once, and while proximity chat was not featured in my demo, I never really felt like I needed to speak out loud to anyone whenever I ran into another skater. Seeing other people casually mess around in Skate’s sandbox world is a unique experience that very few live service games seem to get right, and with its numerous customization features and evolving world, I’m pretty optimistic about the world feeling alive once it's released and I can absolutely see a map full of people hanging out and skating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, there is a level progression system where you can earn in-game cosmetics, one of which is that same pair of Vans a lot of us have been wearing for the past twenty-something years, notable decks from major skate brands, emotes, and a ton of cool and weird clothes to put on my custom character. As expected, there is also an in-game store full of cosmetic items and costumes, but I never felt like I needed to buy anything and was reassured that there are no “pay to win” microtransactions in Skate. While this is only from pre-alpha gameplay and that can all change, I didn't seem to find any of the typical trappings from other free-to-play live service offerings. Let’s hope it stays that way.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After playing Skate for well over five hours, not only I can clearly see the direction developer Full Circle is taking the series, but I can also say that Skate is shaping up to be a game worthy of being the long-awaited sequel to 2010’s Skate 3. The gameplay seems refined and lives up to its predecessors, the world is big and fun to explore, and the overall sandbox’s “do what you want” vibe is really making me look forward to diving back into Skate – and hopefully add it to my rotation of games that I can pick up and relax to after a long day. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/can-skate-revive-the-old-school-magic]]></content:encoded>

And if you're looking for a fun accessory to complement the instant Game of the Year contender, you'll find the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFTQ6B37?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Pro Controller: Donkey Kong Reveal</a> available for preorder.</p><p>Turtle Beach bought PDP last year--so if you've ever used a PDP Rematch, this is essentially the same controller, just with new branding. The Donkey Kong-themed model releases October 12, but with DK being all the craze nowadays, it probably doesn't hurt to lock in your order if you're interested. You won't be charged until it ships.</p><div title="6533233 - Donkey Kong Reveal Switch Controller" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3912" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6533233 - Donkey Kong Reveal Switch Controller" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFTQ6B37?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FFTQ6B37?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFTQ6B37?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Pro Controller: Donkey Kong Reveal</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFTQ6B37?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FFTQ6B37?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFTQ6B37?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$60 | Releases October 12</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>This controller is designed to work with Switch and Switch 2, though it lacks the C button for GameChat. Beyond that, it's fully compatible with the new hardware. Officially licensed by Nintendo, it offers up to 40 hours of play on a single charge, support for motion controls, two remappable back buttons, and an ergonomic design that should keep you comfortable during extended play sessions.</p><p>Overall, the Rematch is a good controller with well-rounded features and a solid build. There are better controllers for the price, but the main draw here is the striking artwork.</p><p>Covered in hues of green and black with red accents, it features DK and Diddy Kong racing through the jungle. The back buttons are red while the triggers are green, which should make it stand out in your game room. Its lenticular design means that, as you move the controller, the design will slowly morph, revealing new layers of detail. This is a fairly uncommon design feature--and one that makes it a bit more exciting than your standard gamepad.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4533680-589bde2c-ef7b-488a-a777-cac8efe1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533680" data-ratio="0.40983606557377" data-width="1464" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4533680-589bde2c-ef7b-488a-a777-cac8efe1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533680"></a><figcaption>Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Pro Controller: Donkey Kong Reveal</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4533680-589bde2c-ef7b-488a-a777-cac8efe1.jpg"></figure><p>It's worth noting that the Rematch is already available in a handful of Super Mario-themed designs.
