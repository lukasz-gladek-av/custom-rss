<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8f9ec0e258b23/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is shaping up to be an excellent outing for DK, but the recent previews did highlight some performance concerns.</p>
<p>The game's director Kazuya Takahashi has now reportedly acknowledged these issues in a chat with the <a href="https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20250710/10876902/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2-entrevista.html">Spanish outlet Lavanguardia</a> – seemingly confirming these frame rate drops will be in the final build during more destructive moments of the game. For Nintendo, it was apparently about prioritising "fun and playability".</p>
<p>Here's Takahashi's full response (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/donkey-kong-bananza-frame-rate-drops-director/">via Nintendo Everything</a>):</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8gkwtur&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“There are several factors to consider. First, we intentionally used effects like hit-stop and slow motion to emphasize impacts. Second, because we use voxel technology, there are times when there are major changes and destruction in the environment. We’re aware that performance may drop slightly at these times. However, as you say, overall the game is smooth, and at points where large-scale changes occur, we prioritized fun and playability.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although there will be some slight drops, as Takahashi mentions, the "overall" experience is still smooth.</p>
<p>In our recent preview of Donkey Kong Bananza, we noted how the experience in this new release felt a bit like a "TOTK situation" where the performance might not be perfect, but you forgive it for its ambition. So, if you're jumping into DK's new adventure on release and encounter changes in performance, don't be surprised.</p>
<p>We'll deliver our full review for Donkey Kong Bananza next week, so you can find out then how the final build performs.</p>

<p>Latency, performance and resolution investigated</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>GameCube has joined the Switch 2's library of classic games, and it was recently updated with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Mario Smash Football</a>. While the service's experience has been fun so far, there have also been some reports of underlying issues with the emulation.</p>
<p>Now, Digital Foundry has tested GameCube emulation and backward compatibility – investigating latency, analogue stick issues, frame drop issues on Switch 2, and resolution and performance improvements. The verdict is "certain details clearly need attending to by Nintendo".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For arcade-perfect accuracy in the likes of F-Zero GX, the extra input latency on Switch 2 should ideally be addressed, and likewise the sensitivity of those analogue sticks, the pattern of single frame drops in all games is also an obvious blemish but fundamentally the four games released on the GameCube classics page so far are faithfully represented."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows a video from game developer and YouTuber Modern Vintage Gamer about GameCube games on the Switch 2 – summing up the initial experience as "very good" but also having some "obvious" differences from the real experience.</p>
<p>To access this latest Switch Classics library, you'll need to have access to a Switch 2 and an active Expansion membership.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-new-resident-evil-game-has-been-announced">Resident Evil Survival Unit was only unveiled last week</a>, but already franchise owner Capcom is pulling back the curtain to give us our first look at the mobile strategy game.</p>
<p>Survival Unit is being co-developed by Aniplex Inc and Joycity Corporation, with Capcom working in "close collaboration" with the studios to "ensure authenticity and quality". A free-to-play title, Capcom reckons it will "offer a fresh, mobile-first gameplay experience that diverges from the traditional survival horror format of the main series".</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-survival-unit-is-a-global-multiplayer-experience-set-in-a-parallel-universe-featuring-leon-jill-and-the-resi-4-merchant">IGN</a> explains it, Survival Unit's story begins with your character's recovery as an Umbrella Corp test subject. In a bid to fight back, you'll meet and recruit Resident Evil characters, upgrading their skills and inventories with the now customary visits to the Merchant.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Survival Unit may be set in a parallel world and explore a new storyline, but players can expect to bump into familiar faces from across the main series, too, and make up their ultimate dream team, including series stalwarts Leon Kennedy and antagonist, Albert Wesker, as well as Jill Valentine, Claire Redfield, and Barry Burton.</p>
<p>You can also connect, and compete with, other players and set up and manage a base of operations in the guise of a mansion that long-time fans may recognise.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Survival Unit is expected to release in 2025, but we don't yet have a solid date.</p>
<p>As for the other recently-announced Resident Evil game, Resident Evil Requiem? Anticipation is evidently high, as Capcom recently announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-already-looks-set-for-massive-success-as-it-hits-significant-wishlist-milestone">over a million of us have already added Resident Evil Requiem to our wishlists</a>.</p>
<p>We got our first look at Resident Evil Requiem last month, when Capcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-officially-unveiled-coming-february">introduced us all to Grace Ashcroft and a destroyed Raccoon City</a>. The developer once considered having Leon Kennedy take on the protagonist role for Requiem, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leon-kennedy-actually-quite-a-bad-match-for-horror-says-resident-evil-9s-director">in the end decided he was "actually quite a bad match for horror"</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-survival-unit-stars-a-bunch-of-your-favourites-including-leon-jill-claire-and-the-real-mvp-barry-burton]]></content:encoded>

<p>While no specific time scales were provided for when players can expect an improvement to the Switch 2 launch title, the team is reportedly "working on some of those performance issues right now" and continue to do so "over the summer".</p>

<p>“So for Hitman, the team is working on some of those performance issues right now, and they are addressing it over the summer,” franchise director Jonathan Lacaille told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/io-addresses-hitman-switch-2-performance-issues-and-says-fixes-are-on-the-way/">VGC</a>.</p>
<p>“It's, of course, good learning for us to bring to First Light as well – so all of this will be learnings we bring to the next title."</p>
<p>While the news may not contain a specific timeframe or much detail, it should be good news nonetheless for those struggling to play the game on Nintendo's latest handheld. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/1lroncb/i_hate_the_switch_2_port/">Some</a> are reporting issues with interactionable objects, opening doors, and crashing, while <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/1lnz7bo/switch_2_performance/">others</a> complain of "horrible" frame dips and stuttering.</p>
<p>ICYMI, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-hitman-co-op-mode-with-stone-and-knight-is-in-the-works-at-io-interactive">developing a co-op mode for Hitman: World of Assassination</a>. Announced last month, the mode is still relatively under wraps, but does feature two names you may recognise: Stone and Knight. These two popped up in the Hitman Sniper mode.</p>
<p>On this co-op mode's release, players will be able to pop into "exciting missions" from the Hitman world with their pal by their side, "challenging" how players approach things now they are going in as one of a pair.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/io-interactive-is-working-on-some-of-those-nintendo-switch-2-performance-issues-right-now]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Dispatched by the crown as part of a secret expedition to a remote island part of the realm, you're ready for a life of adventure. But in third-person RPG Of Ash and Steel you're not one of the highly-trained, well-armored holy knights trying to enforce the will of the king… you're the clever orphan-turned-cartographer along for the ride because the maps of the island, Grayshaft, are pretty bad. Perhaps they're bad because the island suffers periodic volcanic eruptions so devastating that it's blanketed in deadly ash that cakes inside your lungs and kills you, eruptions so awful that ships avoid the island for the entire year when one seems imminent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is obviously why brave cartographer Tristan has agreed to go there. And so like many fantasy protagonists, Tristan will soon be in way over his head—all because he wanted a bit of adventure—when the holy knights are all dead and he's the only one left to deliver the urgent missive. At least, that's what a hands-on preview with a beta build tutorial and first few hours of Ash and Steel told me.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Of Ash &amp; Steel - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of Ash and Steel looks like a pretty traditional RPG, reminiscent of classics from the 2000s. It's unapologetic about not giving you quest markers or anything but in-world directions, but at the same time it does highlight loot on the ground or chests you can interact with when you're near them. It's somewhere between Gothic and the first Witcher game, in its own way, with a nod toward the survival-centric games of the last decade or so. While it doesn't go all-in on survival and encumbrance, Ash and Steel still has something of the 2019 RPG Outward in it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's unapologetic about not giving you quest markers or anything but in-world directions.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">More than anything, Of Ash and Steel feels like a game in the legacy of dearly departed mid-tier RPG studio Piranha Bytes, creators of the Gothic, Risen, and Elex series. That includes the signature campy acting mixed in with some decent drama, as well as plenty of oddball and unexpected humor. (One early quest has you finding the soiled trousers of a man who, when drunk, just craps himself and leaves the pants right there to clean up later.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps its most old-school feature is how it has no level scaling in its world—creatures are a fixed level in a fixed location, forever. You're warned early on that going off the path can be dangerous, and each new enemy encounter is often a question of getting close enough to see if it massively out-levels you before you decide to try and take it on or not—and hope for good loot when you do. Coupled with that lethal-but-rewarding exploration is the rudiments of a survival system, where staying fed and watered is a must to survive, and setting up shop at pre-determined campsites lets Tristan rest and cook to regain hit points and pick up buffs. It also passes time, which is useful in a world where the NPCs and monsters follow a schedule of their own as to when and where they appear, or even when they're taking a nap and won't talk to you about your very urgent quest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tristan has three skill trees, and perhaps the most pressing one is Combat. Investing in combat skills lets you pick up to three different stances to fight from, each of which looks to have different effects based on what kind of weapons you're wielding—there were axes, swords, clubs, daggers, and a crossbow. Sadly, poor starter Tristan wasn't strong or competent enough to wield most of them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is a big part of what I think the story developer Fire Frost is telling with Of Ash and Steel. This isn't a fantasy hero game where your character starts as competent at any useful skills relevant to his current situation. It's going to be a zero-to-hero story, with other characters in the world reacting to Tristan as he grows stronger. "If at the beginning of the game you were treated like a ragamuffin," said Fire Frost, "by the end of the game the characters will literally bow to your feet."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was a hint of that in action during the preview play, as characters who previously saw Tristan dressed only in threadbare clothing later had complimentary things to say about a suit of basic armor I'd purchased. Where before they'd just asked: "Are you really wearing <em>that?"</em> they later said, "Ah, I had a sturdy suit like that when I was younger."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And a sturdy suit of armor is much needed, because the fighting can get pretty brutal. Armor will help you survive a few hits, but the stamina-based combat was really based around perfectly timed dodges and parries. Tristan's attacks, at least at the start of the game, are slow and clumsy—he's literally never fought before. As he got combat skills, though, he moved more confidently and picked up the ability to parry in a way that opened up enemies for counterattacks. That blended well with a fast knife, which let him get in those hits before quickly going back on his guard. Still, there's some tweaking to do on the early stages of the fighting—some people will definitely bounce right off of how clumsy Tristan was, or just won't be familiar with the time-honored strategy of "train the difficult enemy into a nearby powerful NPC."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A sturdy suit of armor is much needed, because the fighting can get pretty brutal.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of trying to survive, that's the focus of Tristan's other two skill trees: Survival and Crafting. They're much more down-to-earth, practical skillsets simply due to their nature. Survival lets you keep yourself fed and alive, while Crafting lets you upgrade and upkeep your equipment. Crafting also does one very important job: Makes you money. Quests and other odd jobs are a great source of experience and cash, sure, but paying people to train Tristan in all these new skills ain't cheap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What was cool is that investments of money and skill points into the Craft and Survival trees actually did pay off in combat. A good craftsman can better sharpen their weapon for bonus damage, or reinforce their armor for extra defense. Survivalists, meanwhile, could pick up nasty tricks like thrown daggers and the use of poisons on their weapons—though poor preview Tristan was a bit too intellectually dull and low-level to get to try those skills out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with all the advantages of level and time, however, Of Ash and Steel is definitely going to be a game where you get your butt kicked. A lot. Quicksave, I expect, is Tristan's greatest friend in the world. Enemies hit hard, and enemies that are higher level than you hit extremely hard—or even so fast that poor low-level Tristan simply stood no chance of reacting in time, let alone getting a single attack in. As a result, he got splatted by a lot of things. He got mauled by a giant rat-thing. Trampled by a big bug. Eaten by a lizard-thing. Dismembered by all manner of bandits, both living and apparently undead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the only dang reason Tristan didn't get splatted by this giant troll is because when everything can splat you, well, you get pretty good pretty fast at running and climbing your way out of danger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some people might find that kind of thing frustrating, Of Ash and Steel was pretty nice on that count. The action-RPG combat was somehow clunkier than a FromSoftware game but settled into its own rhythm after a while, and hopefully gets more and more fluid with more skills and abilities in the full game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't expect miracles from Of Ash and Steel, but the preview was evidence of a promising mid-tier RPG that'll likely enthuse ye olde genre purists while still being accessible and interesting enough to draw in lovers of more modern character-driven action.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/of-ash-and-steel-is-an-old-school-rpg-with-on-the-job-training-for-fantasy-adventurers]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman may be widely regarded as one of the greatest pop culture icons of all time, but there’s one area where even the Man of Steel has struggled to fly. Why, after all these years, aren’t there any good Superman video games? Where is Superman’s answer to Rocksteady Studios' Batman Arkham series or Insomniac’s Spider-Man games?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With James Gunn’s Superman movie putting Kal-El back in the spotlight, let’s take a step back to explore Superman’s incredibly rocky gaming history, and why there still hasn’t been a great Superman game after all this time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">DC Universe: Every Upcoming Movie and TV Show</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman’s Ugly Gaming History</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In many ways, the problem with properly depicting Superman in games isn’t so different from movies or TV or even the comics. He’s an incredibly powerful character. Some would argue that he’s overpowered. When a guy has this level of strength, speed, and invulnerability, not to mention all the other handy powers like flight and heat vision, it’s hard to paint him as the underdog. How do you build a game around a guy who’s basically all-powerful and still create challenges for the player to overcome? </p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Problem With Superman’s Powers</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/11/maxresdefault-1752260901743.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Some Superman games have made the mistake of weakening Superman or walling off his powers. That problem dates all the way back to the very first Superman game, 1978’s Superman for the Atari 2600. Like a lot of licensed games on that system, you’d have to squint to even recognize the source material in those blocky, primitive graphics. But that’s not the core issue with the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman tasked players with repairing Lex Luthor’s damage to Metropolis and capturing the villain and his henchmen in as short a time as possible. Exposure to Kryptonite would cause Superman to lose his powers, with the only cure being a kiss from Lois Lane. Not the most auspicious start for the Man of Steel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The NES game is the perfect example of this frustrating trend. Similar to contemporaries like Castlevania II: Simon’s Quest and The Legend of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, the NES Superman featured a top-down overworld map that transitioned into various side-scrolling action levels. However, the game committed the same sin as many superhero games of the time by locking Superman’s various powers behind limited-use special meters. That, combined with a generally obtuse and punishing difficulty level, ensured the NES Superman was never much fun to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When your flight, heat vision, X-ray vision, and other powers are tied to rapidly depleting special meters, you don’t really get the sensation you’re playing as Superman. It’s not as if he normally has to ration his powers in the comics and films. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Superman’s Generic ‘90s Phase</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The late ‘80s and early ‘90s saw a handful of new Superman games released, including the 1988 Superman arcade game from Taito and the 1992 Sega Genesis side-scroller. These games weren’t as egregious as their predecessors about walling off Superman’s powers. The problem during this period was more that Superman was relegated to generic side-scrollers and beat-em-up titles - the same fare gamers were being inundated with across the industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most notable release in this crop is 1994’s The Death and Return of Superman. Based on the popular comic book crossover, that game cast players as both Superman and his replacements from the comics like The Eradicator and Steel. It was basically DC’s answer to Spider-Man: Maximum Carnage, coming in an era when the prevailing wisdom for superhero games was “when in doubt, make an arcade-style brawler.” Fine for keeping Superman in the public consciousness, but not for forging games that truly take advantage of his vast powerset. It’s tough to truly feel like a Man of Steel when you’re just moving left to right and punching endless waves of generic enemies.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Infamous Superman 64</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/11/superman64-1649369538183-1752260801225.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman’s gaming fortunes seemed to be on a slow upswing in the ‘90s, only for the franchise to reach its nadir with 1999’s Superman: The New Adventures. Or as we all know it, Superman 64. Put simply, Superman 64 is still widely regarded as one of the worst games ever made, with clunky flying controls, frustrating difficulty, and more bugs than even Superman’s heat vision could hope to melt. It’s not exactly a looker, either. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman 64 highlights the issue that no game has really nailed the art of controlling Superman in flight in a 3D environment. Superman 64 forced players to steer a clunky Man of Steel through an endless series of rings and obstacle courses in a fog-covered Metropolis. Much later, Superman Returns would emerge with a somewhat better and more intuitive system of flight control, but the lack of Superman games since means no one has iterated on that design. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, the franchise did bounce back a bit with the release of 2002’s Superman: Shadow of Apokolips on the PS2 and Gamecube. Compared to Superman 64, that game did a much better job of capturing the look and feel of the animated series. That said, the gameplay never matched up to the production values. If this is generally considered to be the best Superman game of all time, that’s still damning it with faint praise.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Superman the Protector</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the more modern games have veered in a different direction by making Superman himself invulnerable but centering gameplay on rescuing civilians and protecting Metropolis. In some ways, that feels like a step in the right direction. The key to understanding Superman is realizing that, as powerful as he is, he can’t save everybody. He does have limits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, the Xbox got its own Superman game in 2002 courtesy of Infogrames in the form of Superman: The Man of Steel. Based on the comics rather than the animated series or movies, this game pitted Supes against Brainiac. While the game succeeded in giving players control of a wide variety of super-powers, the lousy controls and emphasis on protection missions served as a one-two punch of doom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s 2006’s Superman Returns, a game with interesting ideas but subpar execution. The game featured most of the cast from the film reprising their roles, along with other iconic Superman villains like Bizarro and Metallo for good measure. To its credit, the game didn’t put many limits on Superman’s abilities as it introduced an open-world version of Metropolis. In fact, the Man of Steel himself was effectively invulnerable, with Metropolis itself having a health meter. But between the poor controls, equally bad graphics, and the fact that the game’s final boss was a literal tornado, Superman Returns was ultimately panned.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Building a game around rescuing innocent bystanders (like Superman: The Man of Steel) or protecting Metropolis itself (like Superman Returns) can be an exercise in frustration. Protection missions in games are always a tough sell. Without fine-tuned controls and an NPC AI smart enough not to be actively fighting against the player at all times, these missions can be aggravating at best and downright rage-inducing at worst.    </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">How Should the Superman Franchise Move Forward?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Shockingly, that’s it for Kal-El’s gaming career. It’s been almost 20 years since the release of Superman Returns, and the Man of Steel has yet to star in another dedicated game. His subsequent gaming appearances have been limited to Justice League-centric series like Injustice: Gods Among Us and LEGO Batman. Superman is also playable in Fortnite, but there he’s basically just a dude that flies and shoots lasers. At some point, developers seem to have given up trying to crack the Superman code. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gaming world has yet to deliver that satisfying Superman experience that embraces all his incredible powers while still creating a sense of danger. What’s the key? Do you load up enemies with Kryptonite weapons? Do you follow the example of the Injustice games and create a super-strength-bestowing MacGuffin that levels the playing field? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe there’s a better question to be asking. Does a Superman game even really need combat in the first place? Certainly, Telltale found success with the Batman franchise in an adventure game setting. Could Superman benefit from a similarly narrative-driven approach? Is a full-blown Superman point-and-click adventure game the way to go? Maybe, but there are other ways of downplaying action in superhero games.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Does a Superman game even really need combat in the first place?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re seeing modern AAA games like Death Stranding start to deemphasize combat in favor of other mechanics (some would argue the Death Stranding games would be better if they eschewed combat entirely). Maybe the key is to pivot away from a traditional action game focus in favor of finding other ways to explore and utilize Superman’s powers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2005’s Shadow of the Colossus offers another possible path forward. That game isn’t devoid of action, but it does break the traditional mold by focusing on exploration and limiting combat to the battles with a handful of massive boss characters. Maybe that’s the key to getting Superman right. Rather than pitting him against generic goons like Parademons or Intergang agents, perhaps the goal should be to focus on a handful of epic, prolonged boss battles. Picture Kal-El’s fight with the kaiju in James Gunn’s Superman movie and you’ll have some idea of how a Superman game could play out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, flight, not combat, is the most important component of a Superman game. Flight in Superman games is really as key to the overall success as web-slinging in Spider-Man games. Activision nailed that element in 2004’s Spider-Man 2, paving the way for Insomniac to cut loose in their Spider-Man games. We can’t say the same for Superman. Without more modern Superman games to take risks and explore the possibilities, the character has completely stagnated in this medium. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s probably going to take some trial and error before a developer hits upon the perfect, Arkham-esque formula for Kal-El. And that requires DC to prioritize Superman in the video game arena once more. With any luck, James Gunn’s Superman movie will be a major success, thereby serving as the catalyst the character needs in the gaming world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wolverine-history-marvel-video-games-x-men">Wolverine's clawful history in video games</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-video-games-history-arkham-asylum-telltale">the long road to perfecting Batman in games</a>.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/why-are-there-no-good-superman-games]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>The Playdate is easy to forget about. It’s colorful and weird, but it’s also <em>tiny</em>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/26/3494628/status-symbols-game-boy-micro">Like the Game Boy Micro before it</a>, sometimes I toss it in a bag and then can’t remember where I put it. But over the past few weeks, the yellow handheld has been in constant rotation in my house, despite being up against big distractions like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/690468/death-stranding-2-review-ps5"><em>Death Stranding 2</em></a>, thanks to the <a href="https://play.date/games/seasons/two/">Playdate’s now-complete second season of games</a>.</p></div><p>The seasonal structure is one of the unique aspects of the Playdate. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">When the handheld first launched in 2022</a>, owners got access to a curated selection of 24 games that were released over time. It was a great introduction to the device and its unique features — the crank, the little display, the black-and-white graphics — but it wasn’t until earlier this year that a second season kicked off. (I should note that this doesn’t mean there weren’t any new games for the Playdate, as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/7/23627413/playdate-catalog-store-launch-date-best-games">a digital shop launched in 2023</a>, and there are plenty of titles to sideload from marketplaces like <a href="http://itch.io/">Itch.io</a>.)</p><p>Season 2 kicked off in May, and while it’s smaller — you get 12 games for $39, plus <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/682711/blippo-plus-now-in-color">whatever the heck the FMV-based <em>Blippo Plu</em>s is</a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/677197/playdate-season-2-game-review">it also got off to a very good start</a>. And since then it’s expanded with quite a variety of games. There’s a post-apocalyptic adventure called <em>The Whiteout</em>, and a point-and-click exploration game called <em>Shadowgate PD</em>, which is actually a remake of a game from the ‘80s. The dozen titles in season 2 do a solid job of showing off the range of possibilities on the Playdate.</p><p>But what has struck me most are the games that make clever use of the handheld’s signature feature: its crank. For instance, <em>Tiny Turnip</em> is a climbing game where you play as a turnip with arms. Getting around means using the face buttons for grabbing on to things, and then moving your body around with the crank. It felt a little awkward at first, probably because I hadn’t played anything quite like it before, but eventually I was able to get into a solid rhythm of cranking my way across perilous terrain. It’s really satisfying smoothly moving your way through the world by twisting a crank around.</p><p><em>Taria &amp; Como</em> offers something similar within a more typical side-scrolling platformer. You can move and jump through a pixel art world, but in order to navigate the most perilous areas, you’re aided by a sort of drone / grappling hook that’s aimed with the crank. You fire it off and then swing yourself where you need to be. You can also use the crank to pull yourself up or down. <em>Taria &amp; Como</em> is a relatively slow-paced physics-based platformer with some challenging puzzles, and the inclusion of the crank adds a satisfying layer of tactility to the experience.</p><p>Perhaps my favorite game is also arguably the strangest. It’s called <em>Long Puppy</em>, and it’s almost like a spiritual successor to <em>Noby Noby Boy</em> (albeit one not developed by Keita Takahashi, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/674577/to-a-t-review-keita-takahashi-ps5-xbox-pc">who is off doing his own weird stuff</a>). The goal is simple: you are a dog who needs to fetch a ball. But it always seems to be in some hard-to-reach spot, and the only way to get to it is to stretch. In order to stretch longer, you need to eat lots of food. And so each level becomes a race to eat as much as you can so you can get to the ball before a weirdly angry ghost dog shows up.</p><p>Naturally, you use the crank to both grow and shrink, so even though <em>Long Puppy</em> is a game about a pup, you move more like a caterpillar inching its way through the levels to gobble up everything they can quickly. Again, it takes some getting used to, but the time limits forced me to get really good at stretching and it was a blast. Also, at the end of each level you use the crank to go poo.</p><p>Of course, these games would’ve still been enjoyable if I stumbled across them in the Catalog store. But there’s something exciting about the big moment the Playdate seasons create. Each week I anticipate something new, and am never really sure what it will actually be. It could be more channels for a bizarre fictional television service, or it could be the most challenging (and adorable) game of fetch I’ve ever played. That steady cadence of weird and fun makes the Playdate much harder to forget about.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/705348/playdate-season-2-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>Before we get into this week's What Are You Playing, let's recap the major news from the past seven days. The biggie was a tasty slice of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> info from a new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-bananas-interview-with-the-developers-of-donkey-kong-bananza">IGN</a> interview, where we learnt the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananzas-director-and-producer-have-been-confirmed">director and producer</a>, its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-like-mario-kart-world-was-initially-planned-for-switch-1">Switch 1 origins</a>, and how the team got its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/dk-bananza-devs-needed-to-know-more-about-donkey-kong-so-they-went-to-miyamoto">DK inspiration</a>.

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:184756,184745 @ 1752381983 -->
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>It’s all about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> this weekend. A few caveats aside, playing this collection was like that moment when Anton Ego tastes the ratatouille and is mentally transported back to his childhood. Wonderful stuff.</p>
<p>I’m keen to play a bit more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a>. Most of the time, when I’m done reviewing a game, it kinda just gets left on the dusty, digital shelf never to be played again, but there’s something about this game that keeps bringing me back. Have a good one, folks!</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I'm on a retro buzz this weekend. I've still got the Wii set up after a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/rock_band">Rock Band</a> bender I went on a few months back, and I've been meaning to blast through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/batman_the_brave_and_the_bold">Batman: The Brave and the Bold</a> with the kids. With the DC vibes in the air at the moment, it seems like a perfect time. I also want to show them GameCube <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/donkey_kong_jungle_beat">Donkey Kong Jungle Beat</a> with the bongos, and once they're in bed, I've got half a mind to fire up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/sin_and_punishment_star_successor">Sin &amp; Punishment: Star Successor</a>, a game I picked up in the last few years but didn't get around to playing properly.</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>By the time you're reading this, folks, I'll be trekking up through the gorgeous hills and paths of the Isle of Skye. Not the most relaxing holiday, but maybe the most beautiful? I'll report back in a few weeks.</p>
<p>So, not much game time! But on the train rides from London, Edinburgh, and back to the south, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a> is my trusty friend. Will I ever play anything else again? Well... you know what's coming next week. Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Felix Sanchez, Video Producer</h2>
<p>This weekend, I intend to finish <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/phoenix_wright_ace_attorney_trials_and_tribulations">Ace Attorney: Trials and Tribulations</a>! I'm at the last case, so I'm excited to see how it all wraps up after some brilliant cases in this third game.</p>
<p>I'm also probably gonna be playing some Mario Kart World, and practising some of the courses in time trials with my brother. And if I'm really feeling it, I'll free roam a bit around in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, which has piqued my interest with the Switch 2 edition.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still cracking on with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, polishing off a few more Moons before my mind goes bananas next week, and it is <em>still</em> wonderful. It's been eight years, but I still have a little giggle every time I see Mario take control of a photo-realistic dinosaur, and I don't think I'll ever stop.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'd like to squeeze in a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">Patapon</a> to relive some of my PSP days and remind myself why it's taken me the best part of 20 years to get those damn chants out of my head.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Kamurochō is on fire as I step into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a> Chapter 13. However, I made the silly mistake of making an avatar for the 30 fps World Tour mode in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>. I was not expecting to be so hooked on this mode and will continue Chapter 8 as a mix-and-match of special moves and clothing accessories. The throwback lore of the series is delicious, I’ve even found a Final Fight arcade in an alley and fought Retsu from the original Street Fighter!</p>
<p>Super happy to be wrong about the western eShop availability of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_super_dimension_fortress_macross_ii">Arcade Archives Super Dimension Fortress MACROSS II</a>, which will ensure my arcade stick will see action over the weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/robocop_rogue_city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a> is also super fun! I'll make sure to make some progress on that front as well, before everything inevitably goes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a> next week.</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend I'm playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/wilmot_works_it_out">Wilmot Works It Out</a>. I do like it when I have one VERY DRAMATIC game with EXTREMELY HIGH STAKES and another one that's more like "this frog needs to make a cup of tea!" Wilmot Works It Out was fantastic for calming my nerves on a plane journey after one cancellation and three delays, whereas Hundred Line is the second-slowest burn game I've played (after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_in_fata_morgana_dreams_of_the_revenants_edition">House in Fata Morgana</a>). It has a lot of lulls in-between story beats. But that's okay! I think it's about to blow up big time, anyway...</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Need for Speed Franchise May Have Been Shelved by Electronic Arts]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a new report, the Need for Speed franchise may have been shelved by Electronic Arts. The news comes from a rather unlikely place, albeit theoretically trustworthy all the same. </p>



<p>Matthew Everingham, one of the contributors to the website <a href="https://www.speedhunters.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speedhunters</a>, relayed the following message <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DL8zRnrTSwl/?img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Instagram</a>:</p>



<p><em>Speedhunters is on ice. EA shelved Need For Speed, and that means no more funding for the site.</em></p>



<p><em>Grateful for everything — the trips, the stories, the lifelong mates. I'm still shooting, just shifting gears into more video.</em></p>



<p>For those unfamiliar with Speedhunters, it is 'an international collective of photographers, writers and drivers with a shared passion for uncovering the world's most exciting car culture stories.' It was seemingly funded by Electronic Arts, for some reason, and it hasn't been updated in over three months, with the last post now dated April 8, 2025.</p>



<p>Truth be told, this probably doesn't come as a complete shock to Need for Speed fans. The series has gone through a series of middling releases, especially between 2015 and 2019, where the three games made 'solo' by Ghost Games all flopped. 2022's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/need-for-speed-unbound/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Need for Speed Unbound</a> was co-developed by Criterion Games and Codemasters and fared much better, but still didn't produce good enough sales to warrant a sequel, it seems. </p>



<p>Last we heard, in September 2023, Electronic Arts <a href="https://wccftech.com/criterion-games-added-to-ea-entertainment-to-work-on-next-battlefield-and-new-need-for-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved</a> Criterion Games to the EA Entertainment group so that they could work on the next Battlefield as well as a new entry in the racing game franchise. It's possible that the project wasn't coming along well, or perhaps EA simply decided that they should focus solely on Battlefield 6, where <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-development-studios-working-on-new-battlefield-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they are helping with both single player and multiplayer content</a>.</p>



<p>After all, Need for Speed doesn't really compare with Battlefield in terms of relevance to Electronic Arts; to give you an idea, the publisher is <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apparently hoping to reach 100 million players for Battlefield 6</a> somehow. A lofty task, but not completely impossible should the game turn out to be a massive success, whereas racing games are way more niche - even the most successful in recent years, Forza Horizon 5, 'only' reached 45 million so far, and that's counting Game Pass players as well.</p>



<p>In other Need for Speed news, EA has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-endings-need-for-speed-rivals-online-support-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Rivals, the 2013 game co-developed by Criterion and Ghost, will end its online support on October 7, 2025.</p>

<p>Launching in Japan this month</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ef273953df9f5/ys-x-proud-nordics.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nihon Falcom, NIS America</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2's packing a lot more horsepower than the original system, and as a result, a lot of games and series can now ship with higher resolutions and improved performance. With this in mind, the upcoming release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> will apparently support up to 120fps on Nintendo's new hybrid system.</p>
<p>This information comes from Japanese outlet <a href="https://s.inside-games.jp/article/2025/07/11/169368.html">Inside Games (via RPG Site)</a>, with the source reporting there'll be a special mode to prioritise performance, where players can apparently experience "smoother movements" thanks to the higher frame rate. The default performance is said to be 60fps.</p>
<p>Ys X: Proud Nordics is scheduled to launch on the Switch in Japan at the end of this month and is an "upgraded version" of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_x_nordics">Ys X: Nordics</a> including new story, settings and more. If we hear any significant updates or anything about a local release, we'll let you know.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[College Football 26 Review in Progress]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-26-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/college-football-26-review-in-progress.1242039/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s an old idea that second efforts generally aren’t as good as the first. It’s called the sophomore slump, and there are a dozen reasons for it. Sophomore students don't care as much as freshmen; bands have less time to write, practice, and record a second album than the “breakout” hit they worked on for years before anyone knew who they were; athletes who have exceptional rookie years regress to the mean; and so on. There’s no denying the power of new car smell. I think part of the reason College Football 25 popped off as hard as it did (and trust me if you’re unsure: it <em>popped off</em>) was it’d been more than a decade since NCAA 14 and people really, <em>really </em>wanted a new game based on college football. It didn’t hurt that it was also a good game, but the yearly “it’s the same game as last year” fatigue of the sports genre hadn’t set in yet. That makes College Football 26 the real test.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll be honest, reader: I haven’t had a ton of time with this sequel yet (I've been busy finishing up my review of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mecha-break-review"><u>Mecha Break</u></a>, which I thought was pretty great), so these impressions are going to be pretty light. One of the things I’m interested in as I play more is how this car handles after we’ve put some miles on her, and if it falls into the same slump so many games, bands, and students have hit before it. But while that remains to be seen, I’m having a pretty good time so far. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of that is College Football 26 is built on a really firm foundation. College Football 25 was a good game, and it still has that infectious spirit and sense of tradition that made it a nice change of pace from the more straight-laced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-review">Madden</a>. From what I’ve seen, College Football 26 builds on that in good ways. One of the things I’m appreciating most is the Trophy Room, which tracks the real world trophies you’ll accumulate across your entire career, no matter what mode you’re in. It’s cool to see stuff like the Heisman Trophy, the Unitas Golden Arm Award, and the Orange Bowl Trophy collected in one place, and be able to learn about them, too. There’s a lot of history to college football, and I appreciate that EA has tried to capture that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, most of my time has been spent sneaking Quick Play games in where I can, so I haven’t really dug into College Football’s major modes too much yet (something I plan to remedy this weekend), but I have noticed some on-the-field stuff that makes me happy. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Better defenders can now make plays average ones can’t.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The little change I’m happiest about is to how defenders play the football when it’s in the air. If you’ve played College Football or Madden in the last few years, you’ve probably been intercepted (or had one of your defenders intercept) a pass that they can’t see without turning around. They’ve essentially got eyes in the back of their heads, and it could be very frustrating. EA has said they’ve changed that, and in my testing, it’s proven true. Now a defender has to see the ball to pick it off, and you’ll notice defenders turning their heads (or not) before the ball arrives. If they don’t, however, it doesn’t mean that defender can’t make a play on the ball. They can still swat it. It’s a good change because it’s two-fold: you now actually have a reason to swat the ball down instead of going for the pick every time, and better defenders can now make plays average ones can’t.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also a big fan of dynamic subs and custom zones for defenders. The former allows you to swap players on the field and not just on the playcall screen (thank <em>God</em>), though you may have to wait a play for the substitution to take effect, and the latter is the defensive version of last year’s custom stems for routes on offense. I enjoy the defensive game more than the offensive one, so being able to set where I want my zones to be on the field in real-time and not in a menu is welcome. I’m enjoying playing around with this stuff, and I imagine I’ll be using it quite a bit.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Football Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that I have the time to really dig into College Football 26, I am excited to see all the new additions to Road to Glory, where I’m really looking forward to being able to play my high school career, as well as all the new bells and whistles in Dynasty, which is where I imagine I’ll be spending most of my time. But the on-field stuff is where it counts. I can’t say yet if EA has avoided the sophomore slump with College Football 26, but I’m going into this year optimistic, and that’s not nothing.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-26-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy made its debut in April and is currently a Switch console exclusive, with the title also available on Valve's Steam service for PC. The developer has already spoken about how it has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/the-hundred-line-director-has-insanely-ambitious-ideas-for-the-game">some ridiculously ambitious ideas</a> for the game going forward, but it was all riding on the success of its launch.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy">we reviewed The Hundred Line here</a> on Nintendo Life, we called it an "excellent" tactical RPG with a well-written and compelling story, as well as strong and strategic gameplay, an attractive art style, and passionate voice work. So, if you're a fan of this kind of experience, it's well worth a look.</p>

This model also comes with a keyboard cover, so you're getting an added layer of safety for the tablet and expanded functionality.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Cancelling-Optimization-Interpreter-Redesigned/dp/B0D9YZJ3V7?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SAMSUNG-Cancelling-Optimization-Interpreter-Redesigned\/dp\/B0D9YZJ3V7?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Cancelling-Optimization-Interpreter-Redesigned/dp/B0D9YZJ3V7?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Cancelling-Optimization-Interpreter-Redesigned/dp/B0D9YZJ3V7?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SAMSUNG-Cancelling-Optimization-Interpreter-Redesigned\/dp\/B0D9YZJ3V7?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Cancelling-Optimization-Interpreter-Redesigned/dp/B0D9YZJ3V7?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">$149.72 (was $250)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Samsung's premium line of earbuds look like they were ripped straight out of RoboCop's chassis with their sleek design.

    <p><span>New look at the sandbox simulation RPG.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Pathea Games [25 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/pathea-games">Pathea Games</a> has released a new trailer for sandbox <a title="Genres > Strategy RPG [433 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/strategy-rpg">simulation RPG</a> <em><a title="Games > My Time at Evershine [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/my-time-at-evershine">My Time at Evershine</a></em>, the latest entry in the <em>My Time</em> series. <span id="more-978519"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Pathea Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>My Time at Evershine</em> is the most adventurous and immersive installment in the beloved <em>My Time</em> series yet! Building on the overwhelming success of its predecessors, <em><a title="Games > My Time at Sandrock [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/my-time-at-sandrock">My Time at Sandrock</a></em> and <em>My Time At Portia</em>, this new chapter innovates and redefines the life-<a title="Genres > Simulation [791 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation</a> genre. Designed to appeal to both life-simulation fans and RPG enthusiasts, <em>My Time at Evershine</em> features deep <a title="Genres > RPG [17,415 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">role-playing</a> elements, from meaningful character progression to expansive exploration and quests. Pathea invites everyone to build a new home together.</p><p>The multi-million selling <em>My Time</em> series expands with a fresh and exciting formula that builds on everything players loved. Featuring a stunning new art direction, revamped gameplay mechanics, a diverse cast of romanceable characters, 40-plus hour narrative brimming with exploration and, new to the series, town <a title="Genres > Management [30 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>. RPG fans will find themselves right at home.</p><p>In <em>My Time at Portia</em> and <em>My Time at Sandrock</em>, players embraced the role of the builder, tasked with completing essential jobs to keep the town running—often taking on work others avoided. <em>My Time at Evershine</em>, however, introduces a fresh dynamic, transforming the player’s role and elevating you from builder to Governor. As the city’s key figure, you’ll start with nothing more than a modest campfire, but your vision and leadership will drive the development of the entire city and its citizens. With other characters handling the smaller, routine tasks, your role as Governor feels more relaxed, giving you the freedom to focus on shaping the city’s future and dive into the dangers that await.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>All New Story-Driven Campaign</strong> – Be the Governor of a brand-new settlement on the fringes of the Free Cities, facing the almighty Duvos Empire. Recruit settlers, build infrastructure, tame the wilds, and lead your people to create a new idyllic stronghold for the Alliance filled with enchanting characters and memorable stories to enjoy. This new sequel will feature a more defined antagonist, bringing even more <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,395 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> and excitement than ever before.</li><li><strong>New Art Direction</strong> – <em>My Time At Evershine</em> is the most beautiful and realistic game in the franchise to date. Environments are more expansive and varied, characters look more realistic, and animations are motion-captured to create a more believable world.</li><li><strong><a title="Genres > Multiplayer [554 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">Multiplayer</a> Cooperative Play</strong> – For the first time in the <em>My Time</em> series, the campaign can be enjoyed both solo and in <a title="Genres > Co-Op [304 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">co-op</a> mode with up to four players, making it perfect for family and friends. The host controls the pace of the main story, while all players share resources and money, allowing everyone to collaborate and contribute to the adventure together.</li><li><strong>Build a Society</strong> – This ambitious sequel casts players as the all-powerful Governor, who can not only build new facilities, and explore but also command a team of recruitable and customizable NPCs. These NPCs handle the day-to-day tasks like construction and resource gathering, allowing the Governor to focus on more important decisions.</li><li><strong>Meaningful Relationships</strong> – Social play was a key part of <em>My Time at Sandrock</em> and <em>My Time at Portia</em>. In <em>My Time at Evershine</em>, Pathea Games is set to expand these systems even more. Players can recruit up to three followers to stay with them during day-to-day tasks or they can dispatch them to do their bidding across Northern Eufala. Pathea Games is targeting eight to 10 romanceable characters in the campaign with dozens of other characters spread throughout the game. Players will also have to take their followers’ needs and wants into account with tiredness and hunger impacting morale and performance. RPG players will love the deep character interactions and the ability to forge meaningful relationships, with romanceable characters integrated into the storyline and more opportunities to develop connections earlier in the campaign.</li><li><strong>Tame A Wild New Frontier</strong> – Three years after the events of <em>My Time at Sandrock</em>, the Duvos Empire has taken over the Orzu Ruins which Ethea also claims as their own, leading to a tense situation just north of the Alliance of Free Cities border in the Northern Eufaula region. In response, the Alliance has launched the North Development Plan to move settlers into the area and establish a new City-State for better defense. Evershine is one of six major new settlements in the area and will prove pivotal in the ongoing hostilities.</li><li><strong>Mod Support</strong> – <em>My Time at Evershine</em> will include full mod support for both single-player and multiplayer modes, allowing players to customize and expand their RPG experience. Whether you’re playing solo or with friends, the possibilities for creativity and new content are endless.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>My Time at Evershine</em> will be available for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,896 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,522 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [239 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,666 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>.
