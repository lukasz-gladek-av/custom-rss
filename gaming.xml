            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>The new HD-2D title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a> locked in a June release last week, and alongside this news, the team has also revealed multiple save data bonuses if you own certain other Square Enix titles.</p>
<p>As long as you've got existing save data (or for certain platforms, purchase history on the same player account), you should be able to unlock these bonuses. It's noted how demo save data for titles "may also fulfill the bonus eligibility requirements".</p>
<p>The save data eligible includes saves from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/various_daylife">Various Daylife</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/triangle_strategy">TRIANGLE STRATEGY</a>. Here's the full rundown from Square Enix's official website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0</strong></p>
<p>"Sword magicite "Guidance of the Sacred Flame" - Increases sword damage dealt to enemies with 30% or lower vitality by 10%."</p>
<p><strong>DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</strong></p>
<p>"Sword magicite "Critical Hit" - Increases sword critical-hit rate by 6%."</p>
<p><strong>BRAVELY DEFAULT FLYING FAIRY HD Remaster</strong></p>
<p>"Sword magicite "Brave" - Increases sword damage dealt by 10%. Uses a little more shield stamina when guarding."</p>
<p><strong>VARIOUS DAYLIFE</strong></p>
<p>"Sword magicite "Expeditionary Wisdom" - Reduces sword charge time by 10%."</p>
<p><strong>TRIANGLE STRATEGY</strong></p>
<p>"Sword magicite "Counter Stance" - Increases sword damage dealt by 10% while shield stamina is 90% or greater."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Square Enix further note how save data for an "eligible title" must be on the same Switch 2 console. And if you're playing the game on Switch 2, and the applicable data is on an original Switch system, that data must be transferred to the Switch 2.</p>
<p>These save data bonuses can apparently be claimed at "any time", even if the save data for one of these titles is created <em>after</em> starting the Adventures of Elliot. As for the length of this promotion, it's taking place at the time of "release" but this does not guarantee it will be a permanent distribution or service, according to Square Enix.</p>
<p>Here's how you can claim these items in-game when it launches for the Switch 2 on <strong>18th June 2026</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How to claim the bonus items:</strong></p>
<p>- Select the Promotional Bonus option from The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales’ title screen and link with any corresponding titles.</p>
<p>- Linking occurs automatically by opening the relevant screen.</p>
<p>- After starting a new game, examine the desk on the second floor of the orphanage in the Age of Safekeeping.</p>
<p>- Select Claim bonuses from the menu options to claim the qualifying bonuses from the list.</p>
<p>- Please note that bonuses cannot be claimed at certain points in the game when the orphanage in the Age of Safekeeping becomes temporarily inaccessible.</p>
<p><em>- Departure Brooch - Increases the amount of tul (in-game currency) and magicite fragments dropped by enemies by a little</em></p>

<p>Oh, and it's got one other game planned for 2026</p>

<figure data-uuid="ee576a7524a55"><a title="Romeo Is A Dead Man" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ee576a7524a55/romeo-is-a-dead-man.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Grasshopper Manufacture</em></figcaption></figure><p>Grasshopper Manufacture, the developer known for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/no_more_heroes">No More Heroes</a> series, launches its new game <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/romeo_is_a_dead_man">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a></strong> on multiple platforms today, but this doesn't include Nintendo's systems.</p>
<p>If you have been wondering about the chances of this new title getting a Switch release, we've got another update. During a special five-minute <a href="https://youtu.be/f_PObigha-w">'Grasshopper Direct' broadcast</a> earlier on, company CEO Goichi Suda (aka Suda51) reiterated how the team is doing what it can to make a "Switch 2 version" happen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We're doing what we can to make it happen, so again, please give us a little more time."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This actually follows a comment Suda51 made last December, mentioning how the team wanted to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/grasshopper-wants-to-bring-romeo-is-a-dead-man-to-switch-2-but-needs-to-make-sure-the-engine-will-play-nicely-with-it-first/">bring the game to the Switch 2</a> but needed to make sure Unreal Engine 5 was "going to play nicely" with the new hybrid system, so it was testing everything out.</p>
<p>This update today also followed the news that Grasshopper is currently in talks with multiple parties about a "physical version" of the title.</p>
<p>And in one other surprising piece of news shared by Suda, it's been revealed the developer is "almost 100% certain" it will be releasing "one more game" in 2026. As for the details about this new project, the team can't reveal any information just yet, but another announcement should take place "soon".</p>

That means reveals for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv"><u>Diablo 4</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-ii-resurrected"><u>Diablo 2: Resurrected</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-immortal"><u>Diablo Immortal</u></a>, as all three games seek to keep players scrounging for loot in 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike the presentation for its hero shooter, Blizzard has given fans a taste of what to expect. Diablo 4, which launched in June of 2023 and received its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred"><u>Vessel of Hatred</u></a> expansion in October 2024, is barreling toward the launch of its next expansion, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4-expansion-lord-of-hatred-revealed-adds-not-1-but-2-new-classes-including-the-paladin-the-game-awards-2025"><u>Lord of Hatred</u></a>, this April. We already know one of its two new classes will be the Paladin, but <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24259137/tune-in-to-the-diablo-30th-anniversary-spotlight" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Blizzard says</u></a> the Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight will come with a look at the yet-to-be-revealed class, too. The World of Warcraft company also teased that fans should expect a deep dive into “major updates to skill trees” as well as its new endgame systems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Diablo 2: Resurrected is an unexpected but welcome addition to the Spotlight. Blizzard has been coy when it comes to what it will show for its Diablo 2 remake, only <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24246296/diablo-ii-resurrected-ladder-season-13-coming-soon" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teasing</u></a> that “there’s a lot we want to share with you,” as it prepares for the launch of Ladder Season 13 February 20. Some are hoping for quality-of-life changes while others speculate about a potential Steam release, but with the 2021 remake largely remaining faithful to the original 2000 experience, it’s hard to say what its future holds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, there’s Diablo Immortal, Blizzard’s 2022 mobile spinoff. A closer look at the 2026 roadmap is locked in, as the company has told players its ongoing story will carry them “deeper into a world shaped by corruption, conflict, and consequences.” Its <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24250353/witness-the-diablo-30th-anniversary-spotlight" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> on the matter promises more information about a new class, a new region, and “the return of a malevolent force.”</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight premieres tomorrow, February 11, at 2pm PT/5pm ET, and can be streamed on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/diablo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnAsWN-6hvw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>.

<p>We don't yet have a release date for SH: Townfall, and neither Konami nor <strong>Annapurna Interactive</strong>, which is developing SH: Townfall alongside Konami, have shared a release window. What we do have, however, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-listed-retailer-march-26-2026-launch/">a <strong>March 26, 2026,</strong> date from a retail listing</a> that popped up in November 2025. It could be the release date, but it could also have been just a placeholder. At the end of the day, we know that SH: Townfall has been in development for a number of years, even making it through a <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-is-still-in-development-despite-annapurna-interactives-woes/">massive shake-up at Annapurna</a>. A March 2026 release date doesn't feel like the most far-fetched idea. </p>



<p>We also have confirmation from Konami that it wants to keep up the pace of releasing a <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-aiming-to-release-new-silent-hill-game-each-year-to-keep-buzz-constant/">new game in the Silent Hill franchise every year</a>. A strategy that the company hopes to maintain after putting out <strong>Bloober Team's</strong> remake of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-silent-hill-2-remake-has-sold-over-2-5-million-units/">Silent Hill 2</a></strong> in 2024 and last year's wonderful new entry to the series, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-reaches-1-million-copies-sold-faster-than-silent-hill-2-remake-konami/">Silent Hill f</a></strong>, both of which saw strong commercial success.</p>



<p>Besides SH: Townfall, this could be the showcase where we finally get to see what Bloober Team has been working on with regard to remaking the first Silent Hill game. With that reportedly set to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-2027-launch/">arrive in 2027</a></strong>, it may just be early enough for us to get our first tease of the remake, though it's just as likely that we won't see it until a bigger showcase later on in the year.</p>



<p>What's also interesting to consider with this event, specifically due to the timing of it following the State of Play, is that we could get a trailer for SH: Townfall during the State of Play, only for Konami to follow it up with a deep-dive into the gameplay during the Transmission event.</p>



<p>Between the State of Play, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/">DICE Awards</a></strong>, and now this, it's clear that Thursday, February 12, 2026, will feel like a busy night in the video game industry.</p>

<p>If you haven't already seen our review here on Nintendo Life, we've given this new entry a score of eight out of ten. While it might be a bit slim in the single-player Adventure Mode, there's still a lot to like about it. Here's our summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The adventure mode is a letdown, and solo players don't have a ton of options, but there's depth and strategy at the core here that should see this one ace things online for some time to come."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/sony-san-diego/" id="2183">Sony San Diego</a> has shared an update on upcoming content for the “Road to The Show” mode in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mlb-the-show-26/" id="3187">MLB The Show 26.</a></p>



<p>This year, Sony is touting more control than ever for players looking to take their custom baseball player to the Hall of Fame. This control includes a new career simulation method, new Perks, and higher stakes in every game.</p>

<iframe title="WHAT'S NEW?! Road To The Show in MLB The Show 26" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Yx_Ci_OTfE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<h2>Amateur Years Gameplay Extended</h2>



<p>Of course, no baseball player starts their career in the MLB. As such, not only will you go through the amateur years in MLB The Show 26, but you’ll also have the option to extend them. Your character will be recruited out of high school to one of 11 new colleges, with 19 colleges in total, each offering recruiting packages. The package you choose will influence your skill development, equipment, scouting exposure, and more.</p>



<p>That level of control doesn’t stop at the amateurs, however. Once you’re in the major ranks, you can request trades and talk with coaches about potentially changing positions. You’ll also have more leverage to make big mid-season moves.</p>







<h2 id="h-changes-to-perks-in-mlb-the-show-26">Changes to Perks in MLB The Show 26</h2>



<p>This year, specific requirements unlock Perks for your ballplayer. This means you can pursue the options you believe will benefit you most. Also, a revamped menu simplifies learning and upgrading your player’s Perks.</p>



<h2>Simulate More and Simplify Your Career to Your Liking</h2>



<p>In MLB The Show 26, you can simulate parts of the career mode experience. Your sim options will be driven by your overall rating. Achievements such as hitting streaks will temporarily boost your ballplayer’s overall, improving performance in simulated games.</p>



<p>However, players are also alerted when big moments in their careers are approaching. This will allow you to regain control and stop the simulation experience if you choose.</p>



<p>Check out the full update <a href="https://theshow.com/news/mlb-the-show-26-fielding-feedback-rtts/?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=FieldingFeedbackRTTSBlog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>







<p>MLB The Show 26 is now available to pre-order in the Standard Edition and Digital Deluxe Edition. Those who pre-order the Deluxe Edition can play on March 13; the game releases to the general public on March 17. </p>



<p>There’s also a 10% discount on the Digital Deluxe Edition if you have purchased any previous digital edition of the game.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is fast approaching its first anniversary, meaning if it were a real human baby it would be legally unable to do anything really because have you met a one year old? Still, ahead of that anniversary, Capcom has outlined the game's next big update which, shock horror, includes a new monster to hunt, a new weapon to hunt with, a collab with basically itself, and more coming on February 18th. Oh, and there's DLC coming! But once again, the horror, the shock.
</p>
<p>
First, that new monster; this one is the 10 star Arch-tempered Arkveld which is joining as part of a permanent event quest. He's a big, dark, lightningy looking guy, not much to say about him. That new weapon is a doozy, at least stylistically, as it's basically what if Cloud's Buster Sword was a broken mirror. Looking mighty fine honestly, and comes as part of a weapon design contest, made by one Nolan Lu. Nice work Nolan!

<p>
The aforementioned collab is specifically with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-stories">Monster Hunter Stories</a> 3: Twisted Reflection (you see, itself!), which features a new side mission you can only get if you have a hunter rank of nine or higher. It's permanent though, so don't worry about missing out on it. The mission itself sees you teaming up with Rudy, a more cel shaded Palico from Stories 3, who needs you to find some monster eggs he dropped. Deliver enough eggs, and you can get rewards like a Rudy costume for your Palico, and a few different pendants too.
</p><p>
From the release of this update on February 18th through to March 18th, there'll be an anniversary event where you can "collect a special anniversary login bonus, and join in the seasonal festivities—a weekly rotation of each previous Festival of Accord!"
</p>
<p>
In terms of the DLC, details are slim pickings, but it will apparently be a "large-scale expansion," with plans to share more details about it in the summer according to this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/526493182068786774">Steam blog post</a>. It's something I guess! Look forward to it at your own risk.

            <guid>1431754</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>The name makes this sound like something that’s either a mobile strategy game with deeply <a href="https://aftermath.site/so-i-dont-totally-hate-those-hero-wars-ads/"><u>misleading Facebook ads</u></a>, or something for the ‘<a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/master-and-commander/master-and-commander-the-far-side-of-the-world-russell-crowe-paul-bettany-oceans-battlefields?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Oceans are now battlefields</u></a>’ crowd to play while they all <a href="https://aftermath.site/medieval-iii-total-war-fifa-netflix-delphi-announce/"><u>wait and hope for <em>Total War</em> to go back to its historical roots</u></a>. Lucky for me, you and all of us, <em>Master of Command</em> is the latter.</p><p>It’s a roguelike <em>Total War</em> game (bear with me!) set in 18th-century Europe during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the Seven Years’ War</u></a>, and puts you in command of an army that has to roam the countryside attracting new recruits, scavenging for supplies and upgrading your gear. Which sounds slightly mad given the historical context–I’m a general in the British Army, surely I have maps and supply chains, why am I wandering around fields looking for boxes of apples and hiring French regiments–but the narrative justification for all this meandering makes enough sense that I stopped questioning it pretty quickly and just rolled with it.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NAED5vzMEHw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Master of Command | Release Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>It’s not like the idea of coats-and-muskets armies being multinational forces was an alien one; the British army regularly included German troops, and Napoleon’s Grand Armee featured everyone from Poles to Austrians to the Irish. And living off the land was also a legitimate tactic; Napoleon himself relied on it all the time, which is one of the biggest contributors to his disastrous retreat in Russia, whose winter left nothing for him to scavenge. Putting a roguelike slant on all this is close enough to the time period’s reality for it to make sense.&nbsp;</p><p>And in this context it’s maybe the most interesting thing about <em>Master of Command</em>. We’ve played tactics games and shooters and card games with roguelike tendencies, but <em>Total War’s</em> enormous real-time battles are something new, and as a huge fan of that series I’ve been really impressed with <em>Master of Command’s</em> attempts at replicating Creative Assembly’s formula. And I do mean replicate: from the main menu down to the in-battle interface, <em>Master of Command</em> isn’t so much looking over<em> Total War’s</em> shoulders as it’s just tracing right over its lines.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is fine, because aside from cavalry being kinda broken and OP, and there being a few less tactical options for your units, for the most part <em>Master of Command</em> plays exactly like a battle in <em>Empire </em>or <em>Napoleon Total War</em>. In some ways it’s even better, like the way units will break much more easily here, resulting in lower and more realistic casualty counts, while some nice battlefield additions like a musket reloading progress bar over your units helps you better plan your tactics.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>There’s a campaign and a loose act-based structure here, where you have to complete sidequests before tackling an end-of-level army, but the basic loop throughout remains the same. You fight real-time battles, you wander around reinforcing, having random encounters and messing with your army, then you get back on the battlefield and do it all again, juggling your resources and keeping an eye on your objectives the whole time.&nbsp;</p><p>I really like it. The battles are snappy enough that I never feel too bogged down playing so many of them in quick succession, and the roguelike structure makes me <em>very </em>invested in keeping as many of my guys alive as possible. I’d also like to take this opportunity to apologize to both the game and its art; I was recommended this game by many, many people last year and noped out immediately because the art shown in the game’s trailer looked <em>so bad</em>. On the screen, though? It’s fine! Many of the loading screens are better than fine, they look great!</p><p>Even if you’re not a huge muskets and horses person, the roguelike implementation here is still really interesting. Seeing these trappings added to an existing genre is something we all encounter at every waking moment of our lives these days, but the way it’s done here, and how it slides so seamlessly into your feeling of investment and control over your army, is fantastic. If this had just been a tactical RTS I’d be nowhere near as into it as I am, knowing how much it costs to replace every casualty I suffer and every musket ball I expend.</p>

            <guid>1431739</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With the second season of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6</a> set to launch, the game’s communications team has shared a list of updates players can look forward to.</p>



<p>While new maps and challenges are already known to be coming to Battlefield 6<a href="https://x.com/battlefieldcomm/status/2021313449754755403?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">, major updates are also on the way,</a> bringing quality-of-life improvements, faster progression, and more.</p>



<p>One such change includes faster Battle Pass progression. The team notes that this season will be more rewarding and that Battle Pass Tokens earned from Career XP have been recalculated, allowing players to progress faster through regular gameplay and weekly challenges.</p>



<p>Additionally, in-game movement has been improved. The team behind Battlefield 6 now says it feels more predictable and readable during fast-paced action changes, including acceleration curves, smoother vaulting, and smoother ladder transitions. The team has also made fixes that reduce visual inconsistencies and unexpected behavior.</p>







<h2 id="h-updates-coming-to-redsec">Updates Coming to REDSEC</h2>



<p>REDSEC is Battlefield 6’s Battle Royale mode. This community update notes that there will be more rewarding progression in the mode, as Career and weapon XP earn rates have been increased. Hopefully, baseball helps progression feel more balanced between the regular gameplay experience and Battle Royale.</p>



<p>Also, they are increasing overall armor availability in REDSEC. Plus, they’re introducing a cooldown on Vehicle Keycards as a mission reward after players acquire one. This is intended to help balance tank access in Battle Royale mode.</p>







<p>Learn more about what’s coming in season 2 of Battlefield 6 at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-2-launches-next-week/" id="175564">this link.</a></p>

And it's largely thanks to its collaborations with other brands, via its Universes Beyond and Secret Lair releases.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its earnings call today, Hasbro revealed that MTG revenue was up 59% year-over-year, in no small part thanks to the Avatar: The Last Airbender set last year, which is now the third highest-selling set in Magic history after Final Fantasy and Lord of the Rings. Other Universes Beyond sets, as well as Secret Lair, also had a hand in the success.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That 59% is a huge increase, and one that is responsible for Hasbro's overall numbers looking good. The company overall was up 14% year-over-year, almost entirely driven by 45% growth in the Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment (Monopoly Go! also helped a little). Its other segments, Consumer Products and Entertainment, both saw declines of 4% each.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The revenue-raising capabilities of Universes Beyond and Secret Lair are a helpful look for Hasbro's C-suite, which has found itself the target of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lawsuit-claims-hasbro-misled-investors-regarding-sales-of-controversial-magic-the-gathering-anniversary-set">shareholder lawsuit on the very subject recently</a>. The lawsuit alleges that Hasbro has mismanaged Magic: The Gathering by overprinting sets of cards, specifically Universes Beyond and Secret Lair, thereby devaluing existing cards. The complaint itself contains some pretty sharp accusations that the company's top brass have been holding such sets in reserve to deploy whenever the rest of the company is struggling.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Avatar: The Last Airbender x Magic: The Gathering - Tea Time at the Jasmine Dragon Scene Box</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Hasbro has stated that such claims have "no merit," and has recently moved to dismiss a similar lawsuit with very similar accusations filed in 2024 by the West Palm Beach Firefighters' Pension Fund and City of Miami General Employees &amp; Sanitation Employees' Retirement Trust, on the basis that the complaint has been amended so significantly since it was originally filed that it is no longer related to the original issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hasbro reached out to share the following updated statement on these lawsuits as pertains to its earnings today:</p><blockquote>As we shared when you covered the matter in January, these claims have no merit. Our strategic plan for Magic was implemented, and the results underscore the strength of that strategy.

It’s already made back the cost of its roughly seven-year development, blew past internal sales expectations, and is currently approaching the highest peak concurrent player count of Isaac itself – and it only launched today at 6am PT.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So far this is beating expectations by quite a lot,” developer Tyler Glaiel tells IGN, saying it likely took less than three hours for development costs to be fully recouped. “Its a bigger launch than any of the Isaac expansions already, and its only been a few hours.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His partner Edmund McMillen, best known for games like Isaac and Super Meat Boy, put just how wide of a gap that is into a perspective: “I think the highest sales day for any game of mine, release-wise, was [The Binding of Isaac:] Rebirth, and it sold 40,000 units I think day one.” By comparison, McMillen says Mewgenics sold around 152,000 copies in its first five-and-a-half hours. “Isn't that kind of insane?”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mewgenics is also sitting at more than <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/686060/charts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>63,000 concurrent players</u></a> on Steam at time of writing, creeping steadily towards Rebirth’s all-time peak of 70,701. “We knew the game was good and would do good,” Glaiel says, “but Isaac is *HUGE* so we thought it was unlikely to beat that.” There are also almost 85k people watching it on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/mewgenics" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Twitch</u></a> – one of which is McMillen himself, who says he’s enjoying watching <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/northernlion" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Northernlion</u></a> be so immediately good at it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The critical reception for Mewgenics has been glowing as well, currently sitting at an 89 on sites like <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mewgenics/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Metacritic</u></a> and 96% positive user reviews on Steam (with roughly 1,700 in at the moment). IGN’s own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mewgenics-review"><u>Mewgenics review</u></a> gave it a 9/10, saying it’s “a fantastic tactical RPG that's good for more than a hundred hours of roguelike runs. Just when you think you have it figured out it'll throw something completely unexpected and hilariously gross at you – and probably a catchy new original song, too.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Associate Reviews Director.

The company revealed new age verification requirements on February 9 that would lock users out of certain features, like “age-restricted experiences,” unless they upload a face scan or a picture of their ID. The blowback was swift and loud, with calls to boycott Discord’s paid Nitro subscriptions and return to old-school website forums.</p>

 <p>Maybe that’s why Discord returned a day later to post a “<a href="https://x.com/zachbussey/status/2021297270281384424?s=20">novel</a>” that goes into more detail about its new age assurance rules. “Discord is not requiring everyone to complete a face scan or upload an ID to use Discord,” the company promised in a new addendum on February 10. “The vast majority of people can continue using Discord exactly as they do today, without ever being asked to confirm their age.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hmm let me play the roll of Clippy and help you</p> <p>Your Age Inference model is already running and has much more then just Age predictions. <a href="https://t.co/oj7j81DjNI">https://t.co/oj7j81DjNI</a></p> <p>Not requiring everyone: because you are already using your AI to capture data and age predict Age, Sex, etc. Hence…</p> <p>— Rakunvar 👀P.R. for @StreamerHouse🏘️ (@Rakunvar) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rakunvar/status/2021320521011560775?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>That’s because Discord’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7czEt1_Zeic">AI&nbsp;inference model</a> will be used to guess most users’ age. If it guesses a number that’s 18 or higher, you’re in the clear. If it doesn’t, you’ll have to give the company your sensitive data in order to get around the new teen safety protocols. But Discord is quick to stress that this doesn’t apply to most people because most people don’t ever access adult content on Discord.</p>

 <p>“You must be a confirmed adult to access age-restricted content and experiences such as age-restricted servers and channels or to modify certain safety settings,” the company <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally#age-assurance-clarification">explains in a new FAQ</a>. “The majority of Discord users don’t access age restricted content and will never go through a facial age estimation flow or ID verification. In the minority of cases where we cannot confirm you as an adult and you need to access age-restricted areas and settings, then you will be asked to go through additional steps.”</p>

 <h2>Archived servers and canceled Nitro subs</h2> <p>All of this “our big announcement wasn’t actually a big deal” energy came after an immediate user revolt that saw, among other things, Discord <a href="https://x.com/discord_support/status/2020863471550927243">repeatedly get community noted on X</a>. People didn’t like the idea that Discord is already constantly surveilling its users to <a href="https://x.com/Vuthakral/status/2020893257987748166">build an anonymous profile of you</a> that I’m sure it’s not hoping to further monetize <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-discord-union-rockstar-leaks-2000657761">once it reportedly launches its secret IPO</a>.</p> <p>It doesn’t help that all of this is coming after a <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-discord-hack-sounds-really-really-bad-2000633690">pretty bad hack of a Discord vendor last year</a> that saw age verification materials, including photos of users’ faces, obtained by malicious actors. The company says it doesn’t keep this information tagged to your user data, but if you think there’s a safe way to digitally transmit your face and/or your government-issued ID to a company over the internet in 2026, then I have some <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-bowl-60-ads-celebs-stars-ben-affleck-dunkin-jurassic-park-ai-de-aged-best-commericals-2000666913">totally not killer AI robot assistants to sell you</a>.</p>

 <p>While the backlash has been noisy, it’s not clear how many people will actually shift away from Discord over the new rules, though some diehard users on the Discord subreddit already claim to be calling it quits. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/1r09lrn/bailing_and_i_want_to_archive_my_server_are_there/">One popular thread</a> had a server owner looking for help with archiving it before they leave the platform. Some users on social media, meanwhile, have been making <a href="https://twitter.com/KuroSekaiAnime/status/2020954657502515520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2020954657502515520%7Ctwgr%5Ee4437406b5c679e87bcd39b015eb003b843caf6c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fdiscord-nitro-cancelled-age-verification%2F">public displays of canceling their paid memberships</a>, Discord’s main source of revenue.</p> <p>So far, non one seems to be biting on the company’s latest attempt to deescalate people’s fears. “If this isn’t reversed I will be cancelling my Nitro and all Boosts,” one user wrote on X. “I recommend everyone does the same.” Discord’s amended announcement, like the original, is already well on its way to getting ratio’d.</p>

      <p>Following in the commendable tradition of gargantuan charity bundles like <a href="https://aftermath.site/palestinian-relief-bundle-games-wandersong-short-hike/"><u>the Palestinian Relief Bundle</u></a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/play-for-peace-bundle-palestine-aid-fundraiser/"><u>Play For Peace</u></a>, over 600 game developers have come together to assemble a <a href="https://itch.io/b/3484/no-ice-in-minnesota?ref=aftermath.site"><u>No ICE In Minnesota bundle</u></a>. Just one day after release, it has already smashed through its initial $100,000 goal.</p><p>“We created this bundle to raise funds for Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota in response to the Trump administration sending ICE agents to the Minneapolis area and the reckless murder of an innocent people by ICE agents,” wrote the bundle’s organizer, a tabletop charity content creator who goes by the handle <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jesthehuman.itch.io?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jes The Human</u></a> on the bundle’s itch.io page. “ILCM provides free immigration legal representation to low-income immigrants and refugees in Minnesota and North Dakota. They also work to educate the community about immigration matters and advocate for public policies which respect the universal human rights of immigrants.”</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-k_JPei0YNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="No ICE in Minnesota Charity Bundle Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>The bundle includes 1,439 games for a minimum donation of $10, which is a steal so preposterous that you’ve gotta admire the audacity. Highlights include modern puzzling classic<em> Baba Is You</em>, fellow modern puzzling classic <em>A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build</em>, cozy game by which all others are judged <em>A Short Hike</em>, internet detective adventure <em>Hypnospace Outlaw</em>, cat cafe sim <em>Calico</em>, and multiple gun-focused games from <em>Demonschool </em>studio Necrosoft. There are also <em>over 1,000</em> physical games – tabletop role-playing games and things of that nature – ensuring that you’ll never need to rack your brain to figure out something to do when your friends come over ever again.</p><p>The bundle will be available until March 13.&nbsp;</p><p>"ILCM provides services based on capacity and has a generally high demand for services," wrote Jes The Human. "The more we are able to fundraise, the more people they will be able to assist."</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-ice-minnesota-minnmax/"><div><p>It’s Impossible To Keep Politics Out Of Games When They’re Literally Banging Down Your Door</p><p>“It doesn’t feel safe to be recording and having fun in the streets of Minneapolis these days”</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>
