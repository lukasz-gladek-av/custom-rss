During the 9-minute-long technical presentation, system architect Mark Cerny showed us all the new features, from advanced ray tracing to an upgraded GPU, and the upcoming console’s ability to hit higher frame rates at high resolutions. Some gamers are ecstatic that the PS5 Pro (which costs more than any other game console ever has) can produce beautiful graphics at the highly sought after 60fps, but I couldn’t care less. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,196143,196447" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I just want my console or PC to run my favorite video games without overheating, blowing up, or crashing—I do not give a shit if a leaf in the background of <em>Spider-Man 2</em> is sharper on the PS5 Pro, and quite frankly, I didn’t see much of a difference during the presentation. I can’t justify spending more on a video game console than I do during a quarterly Botox session, especially when the purported improvements seem barely discernible to the naked eye.<br></p><p>At a certain point in the presentation, Cerny compared the visuals of a variety of games running on both the PS5’s performance mode (which favors frame rates over graphics) and the PS5 Pro. “What we see here is a difference in detail,” Cerny says as a clip shows Ellie from <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> aiming down sights. I caught myself leaning in so close to my monitor my eyes went slightly wonky. The difference in detail? You can kind of read a sign tacked to a tower 50 yards away. Is this going to fundamentally change your gaming experience? Will the ability to read the warning on a watchtower help me better understand the dangers of contributing to a cycle of violence? I don’t think so.</p><p>“My favorite is the parade scene from <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>,” Cerny says, showing another side-by-side comparison of the PS5 in performance mode versus the PS5 Pro. “Distant details are much clearer.” The camera zooms in on the crowd of aliens populating the stands in the background of the scene, and though they are definitely sharper and more in-focus on the PS5 Pro, I once again ask: Does this matter? If I was in the midst of playing through this moment, would I stop to wonder at the fidelity of a bug-eyed alien waving in the stands?<br></p><p>There are some gamers who are frame rate and fidelity sickos (one of them works at <em>Kotaku</em>, and he goes by Zack Zwiezen), and I guess I can see why the PS5 Pro is their shit. I <em>did</em> let out a quiet “ooo” at a bright yellow car reflecting in the paint of a black car driving next to it in <em>Gran Turismo 7 </em>during the presentation. And for games where frame rates are key and stuttering or input latency can break immersion or even cause you to die or lose, I can wrap my head around why, maybe, you’d be amped to see a game running at 60fps with gorgeous graphics.<br></p><p>But with a $700 price tag (and no disc drive, you need to fork over an extra $80 for that) and only slightly discernible differences in terms of graphics and frame rates, I just can’t bring myself to get excited over the PS5 Pro. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Following Ubisoft's decision to shut down The Crew's servers earlier this year - a move made even more controversial when it began revoking players' licensing to the game - the publisher has announced plans to prevent other entries in the open-world racing series from suffering a similar fate by retroactively introducing offline modes.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft began <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">delisting The Crew from digital storefronts</a> last December, announcing it would be permanently shutting the game's servers down on 31st March this year. Unfortunately, its always-online nature meant players didn't just loose access to its multiplayer elements; all its single-player content became unavailable too. 
</p>
<p>
The fallout from that decision led to revitalised discourse around games preservation, and the launch of Stop Killing Games - an initiative <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-aims-to-mount-political-and-legal-challenges-to-games-going-offline">aiming to mount political and legal challenges</a> to the increasingly common occurrence of purchased games becoming unplayable. And debate only intensified when Ubisoft's later decided to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">quietly revoke owners' licenses</a> to The Crew - making it impossible to download and install, thwarting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-ubisoft-shut-down-the-crews-servers-this-group-of-modders-began-work-to-bring-them-back">fan plans to revive the game</a>.

<p>
Five months later, Ubisoft has finally acknowledged player concerns around access - or rather, the complete lack of access - to The Crew in a <a href="https://x.com/TheCrewGame/status/1833543516506435739">statement shared on social media</a>. And while it doesn't sound like there's much hope for the original The Crew, the publisher is at least looking to protect its sequels.
</p>
<p>
"We heard your concerns about access to The Crew games," the publisher wrote on Twitter/X. "Today, we want to express our commitment to the future of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a> and The Crew Motorfest." It then confirmed "an offline mode to ensure long term access to both titles" is in the works, promising more details "in the next months". 
</p>
<p>
In response to today's news, Stop Killing Games founder and YouTuber Ross Scott <a href="https://x.com/accursedfarms/status/1833575742854340839">wrote</a>, "The Crew 2 and Motorsport is getting an offline mode. Hopefully this is in response to consumer agencies in multiple countries investigating the legality of them disabling TC1, which was sold as a one-time purchase with no stated expiration date."

			<p>Genshin Impact is a gacha game that continues to take the world by storm, with new updates coming out regularly<span>.&nbsp;</span><span>After years of being on PC, mobile, and PlayStation, the game is finally making <a href="https://wccftech.com/hoyoverse-provides-details-regarding-genshin-impact-on-xbox/">its way onto Xbox</a></span>. By using the codes provided by the Genshin Impact developers, you'll get free rewards such as Mora, Hero's Wit, Primogems, and Adventurer's Experience. There are many codes, but make sure to use them as soon as possible, as they are usually time-gated and will expire, meaning you won't be able to get rewards if you try to redeem them.</p>
<p>Here are all of the current active Genshin Impact codes for September 2024 and the rewards you can get for redeeming them.</p>
<h2>All Active Genshin Impact Codes</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>GENSHINGIFT</strong>&nbsp;- x50 Primogems and x3 Hero's Wit</li>
</ul>
<h2>How To Redeem Genshin Impact Codes</h2>
<p>While it may seem daunting, redeeming Genshin Impact codes is simple and only requires you to follow a couple of steps. The main pre-requisite you need to meet is <strong>Adventurer Level 10</strong>. Without it, you won't be able to redeem codes. This is a relatively easy requirement to meet and won't take you too long to reach.</p>
<p>To redeem codes, you must go to the <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/gift" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Genshin Impact website</a>, where you can log in to your server and redeem them.</p>
<p>On the website, you'll be prompted to fill out three boxes. They are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Server</li>
<li>Character Nickname</li>
<li>Redemption Code</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've completed all of those, you press the Redeem button, and the rewards will be sent to your mail in-game.</p>

But for most, the headliner of the patch is the ending update that adds new conclusions for the evil choice you can make at the end of the game. Precisely what happens after you make this decision will depend on a few factors, primarily whether you’re playing as one of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-gale-romance-origin-shadowheart-popular-1850730799&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-gale-romance-origin-shadowheart-popular-1850730799">origin characters</a></span> or as a custom protagonist. But even within those distinctions, there are some slight variations. Let’s break down each of the new endings. Spoilers ahead!<br></p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure></div></div><div><p>If you’re playing as a custom character, your tyrannical ending is pretty straightforward initially. If, after fighting through the streets of Baldur’s Gate and defeating the final boss, you decide to take control of the Netherbrain, you gain absolute domination over the Illlithid army it once commanded. What you do with this newfound power will determine which of the dark, even disturbing endings you get. But you may have to pass one constitution check to get much choice in the matter. The possible outcomes include:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>If you consumed too many Mind Flayer Parasite specimens throughout your playthrough, you’ll have to pass a constitution check before you can make any decisions about where the game will wrap up. If you fail this, your character will turn into a mind flayer and will start fitting the citizens of Baldur’s Gate with tadpoles of their own. That’s the price of hubris, I suppose.</li><li>If taking over one world wasn’t enough for you, one choice you can make is to command the citizens of Baldur’s Gate as your personal army. Your character will force the people to take up arms in your name as you wage war on every other realm to expand your rule.</li><li>Not every evil ending has to end in violence, however. You can also choose to brainwash the people to serve you. Ignorant of what’s been done to them, they will happily rebuild the city to honor you, their savior. </li><li>The last two endings are some of the most disturbing. If you deem the citizens of Baldur’s Gate beneath you, you can execute them all with a flick of your wrist. Then your character just lays in all the carnage, basking in it.</li><li>The final ending is the most brutal. For those playing chaotic evil characters who don’t even care about ruling or mercy killing, you can send the people of Baldur’s Gate on a murderous frenzy through the city streets as you revel in the violence. </li></ul><p>All the origin characters can choose any of the above endings, but they also get an additional choice specifically tied to their stories. Let’s break those down.<br></p></div><div><p>Shadowheart’s story throughout <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>revolves around her crisis of faith at the center of two warring goddesses. If she gains the power of the Netherbrain, she can decide to become a goddess herself, creating a new church “united, in [her] image, and blessed with the blood of the faithless.”<br></p></div><div><p>Ever the jilted ex of a goddess, Gale’s evil ending has him set his sights squarely on the gods of Faerûn. With the Netherbrain subdued, the wizard looks to level the pantheon of gods with an army of brainwashed followers at his beck and call.<br></p></div><div><p>While Shadowheart and Gale are ready to fight gods, Wyll’s evil ending is a bit more ground level, though no less heinous in his manipulation of all of mankind. The Blade of Frontiers looks to subdue the citizens of Baldur’s Gate and rule over the people he once protected. He’s shown turning people into subservient mind flayers, even his own father.<br></p></div><div><p>Given how kind and caring Karlach usually is, I find it hard to even imagine an evil ending for her, but the conclusion Larian went with effectively pulls at some of the emotional threads of the Tiefling Barbarian’s history. Having been mistreated and outcast in Baldur’s Gate, she returns to the city to inflict the same pain onto its citizens that she felt in being rejected by them.<br></p></div><div><p>In most of Lae’zel’s endings, she seeks to overthrow Vlaakith, the ruler of the Githyanki. In her evil ending, she merely expedites the process with a mind-controlled force, leading an ambush on the queen on dragonback.<br></p></div><div><p>The handsome vampire bastard’s shift to full-blown evil is one of the easiest such turns to buy in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s new endings. If Astarion controls the Netherbrain, he becomes a king, using his rule to feed on his loyal subjects.<br></p></div><div><p>If, as the Dark Urge, you choose to give into your violent impulses one last time, your fate will be sealed. You are destined to commit wanton destruction, killing everything in sight until you eventually are the last living creature.<br></p></div><div><p>Also included in the new endings are a few variations for those who romanced the Emperor and chose to take over the world with the Netherbrain’s power. You can choose to rule together, or attempt to betray him.</p><hr><p>Well, there you have it. Look at all the awful shit you can make my babies do. Wouldn’t you rather the game end with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-new-ending-epilogue-patch-5-1851063292&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-new-ending-epilogue-patch-5-1851063292">everyone hanging out at camp</a></span>, reminiscing about the good ol’ days and catching up on what each of you have done in the time since?

Amazon-owned retailer Woot has brought back one of its popular deals on three-month subscriptions. For the next three days--or until Woot sells out--you can <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fdigital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-5&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsave-94-on-12-months-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-compared-to-new-price%2F1100-6526404%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">get three months of Game Pass Ultimate for $36.49</a></strong>, which breaks down to $12.16 per month--substantially less than the $20 price that goes into effect this Thursday.</p><p>One-month codes are also available at Woot, though these are more expensive at $13.79 each. Though there's technically a limit on the number of codes you can buy, we highly doubt you want 24 three-month codes. You may want more than one, though. You can stack Game Pass Ultimate for up to 36 months. This means you could buy and redeem up to 12 three-month codes.</p><p>The more you stack, the more you save overall. For instance, one year of Game Pass Ultimate will cost $240 directly from Microsoft, billed monthly, starting September 12. With Woot's deal, you can get a full year for $146. Across 36 months, Game Pass Ultimate's full price will be $720 under the new rate. Woot's deal drops the price to $438--that's a pretty awesome deal.</p><p>If Woot's deal sells out--and it almost certainly will--<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon has three-month codes for $45</a>. After the price increase, three months of Xbox Game Pass will cost you $60, so this is still a solid offer.</p><p>Other Game Pass price increases include PC Game Pass increasing from $10 to $12 per month, and the annual price of Xbox Game Pass Core is going from $60 to $75 a year. The $10 monthly subscription price will remain unaffected for that leaner gaming library.

The $15/month subscription includes access hundreds of games, online multiplayer, and other perks--but you don't get day-one exclusives like Indiana Jones until a later date.

                <p>Activision has revealed Season 6 for Modern Warfare III, Warzone, and Warzone Mobile, and like with past seasons, this one also has a new BlackCell DLC offering. The headliner of the latest BlackCell bundle is an operator named "Alone," who is something of a monster.</p><p>Alone is described as a "three-headed zombified mutation" of the character Ghost, and as you can see in the image below, the character certainly lives up to that grisly description. It's a fitting and timely operator, as Season 6 also coincides with the return of Call of Duty's annual Halloween-themed Haunting event that brings <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/michael-myers-returns-to-call-of-duty-in-season-6-of-warzone-and-mw3/1100-6526390/" data-ref-id="1100-6526390">all manner of spooky elements to the game like Michael Myers</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4365034-mwiii-s6-announcement-051%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365034" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4365034-mwiii-s6-announcement-051%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365034"></a><figcaption>Season 6's BlackCell DLC has been revealed</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4365034-mwiii-s6-announcement-051%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>Pricing was not disclosed in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/09/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-warzone-wzm-season-6-haunting-returns-maps-modes-zombies-announcement#BlackCell" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Activision's blog post</a>, but previous BlackCell bundles sold for $30, and it's expected that will be the price for this one as well.</p><p>Buying the BlackCell bundle gets users access to a BlackCell-specific part of the Season 6 Battle Map, and comes with 20 instant tier skips, along with an allotment of 1,100 COD Points, the aforementioned Alone operator, and the "Ghost Charmer BlackCell" blueprint for the STG44 Assault Rifle with "Chromatographic" tracers and "Cenotaph Slam" death effect. The bundle also comes with the "Maximum Aspect BlackCell" blueprint for the Rival-9 SMG. It also has a new finishing move called "Throat Rip," and it's not hard to imagine what that might entail.</p><p>Additionally, everyone who buys the new BlackCell bundle gets special, BlackCell-specific rewards in the Season 6 battle pass, including:</p><ul><li>10 Operator Skins for: Farah (x2), Michael Myers (x1), Makarov (x1), Banshee (x1), Valeria (x1), Slamfire (x1), Dokkaebi (x1), Riptide (x1), Jabber (x1)</li><li>6 Weapon Blueprints with Chromatographic Tracers and Cenotaph Slam Dismemberment Death Effects</li></ul><p>Anyone who buys BlackCell after purchasing the Season 6 battle pass will get 1,100 COD Points back.</p><p>Season 6 launches on September 18 for Modern Warfare III, Warzone, and Warzone Mobile, as all three games share progression.

			<p>A couple of hours ago, the official Focus Entertainment Twitter/X account <a href="https://twitter.com/Focus_entmt/status/1833537959326339304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1833537959326339304%7Ctwgr%5Edb17e9dc9db64f3f0c366b2ff0ed3dd966bc624d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dsogaming.com%2Fnews%2Fwarhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-two-million-copies%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 has already sold two million units.</p>
<p>The long-anticipated sequel only launched yesterday, so it's likely the number is due, in large part, to the pre-orders. Indeed, during my Gamescom 2024 chat with Saber Interactive Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits, the industry veteran <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-qa-with-tim-willits-we-have-a-game-that-will-exceed-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>We're very proud of where it is now. We're very happy with our work, and the people who played the preview were happy. Preorders are great. Right now, what we're focused on is September 9, you know, making sure that the servers are up and running for everyone, making sure that any issues are ironed up, but everything's looking good; it's all green lights. The game is fun and solid, so yeah, I'm excited about the launch.</em></p>
<p>So far, user reviews are largely positive on Steam. However, our own Chris Wray wasn't quite enamored with Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2, giving the game 7 out of 10 in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>:</p>
<p><em>In all, while Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 isn't a bad game, not in any sense of the word - it's arguably good at what it does - I haven't enjoyed it that much. The repetitiveness of combat, particularly with the limitations directing you down the repetitive execution spam route, was the core reason for this. There's a good story with an awe-inspiring setting, narratively and visually, which will likely keep you going if you're like me. All in all, it's not a bad game at all and a worthy sequel. It&nbsp;is a decent game, but one that becomes repetitive quite quickly, though fans of this sort of action combat could find it enjoyable.</em></p>
<p>The developers already promised a lengthy <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-reveals-first-year-of-post-launch-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post-launch roadmap</a>, with lots of content coming, as well as frame rate-enhancing features like <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-dlss3-fsr-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS3 and AMD FSR 3</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/towerborne-tips-and-tricks/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>When you imagine a side-scrolling adventure, it’s usually not a complex game. You move across the screen, slaying monsters and completing objectives from point A to point B. A few Towerborne tips and tricks should serve you well in your adventures beyond The Belfry, and Insider Gaming intends to take this adventure alongside you!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-towerborne">What is Towerborne?</h2>



<p>Towerborne is a side-scrolling action-adventure game with RPG elements from Stoic, the developers behind The Banner Saga. You take on the role of a hero, an Ace, born of spirits and with incredible abilities to defeat the monsters encroaching upon The Belfry. You’ll venture out—solo or with a party of up to three other players—to explore new lands, acquire powerful gear, and defeat creatures of varying sizes and difficulties. If you intend to venture alone, you can hire Umbra—unique companions joining you in combat and enhancing your abilities.</p>



<p>But it’s not all fighting. Towerborne features an untold number of quests, the ability to reforge your equipment to become more powerful, and other RPG mechanics that promise to keep players enjoying the experience for years, according to the studio.</p>







<h2 id="h-towerborne-tips-and-tricks-for-new-players">Towerborne Tips and Tricks for New Players</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite its simplicity on the surface, Towerborne does offer complex mechanics and a few confusing design choices that have new players scratching their heads. We’re here to help with a handful of Towerborne tips and tricks!</p>



<ol>
<li>You don’t need to rush into combat. While the enemies prove squishy in the early game, some of them hit hard. They telegraph their tells, so learn your foe’s moveset, watch for their wind-up, and know when to dodge forward, backward, or strike to interrupt attacks.</li>



<li>Don’t fret over character creation too much, as part of the lore revolves around you being essentially immortal, which means you can alter your appearance anytime you wish from the hub area!</li>



<li>You can switch classes anytime, so long as you’re not in the middle of a mission, so experiment with the four available—Sentinel, Pyroclast, Rockbreaker, and Shadowstriker—to figure out which one meshes well with your preferred play style. They all feature unique abilities and weapons, allowing for plenty of variety.</li>



<li>Learn the game’s various roles and how they fit into a party-based environment. For example, the Sentinel excels as a frontline fighter that takes the brunt of the attack, while the Pyroclast moves up in the second slot to deal heavy damage to groups with its fire-based heavy attacks.</li>
</ol>



<p>As we continue playing Towerborne, we’ll update this tips and tricks guide with additional insights!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Every Game That's Enhanced for PS5 Pro]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/every-game-enhanced-for-ps5-pro</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/every-game-thats-enhanced-for-ps5-pro.977295/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/every-game-enhanced-for-ps5-pro<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>After weeks for speculation and leaks, Sony has officially revealed the PS5 Pro during a nine-minute presentation that touched on some of the enhancements the console will offer. Boasting better GPU performance, advanced ray-tracing, and AI-powered upscaling, the PS5 Pro aims to eliminate the choices many of us currently have to make between performance and fidelity modes. In short, it aims to  give us both of those modes running at the same time, and as part of the reveal we saw glimpses of games that will be enhanced for PlayStation 5 Pro by offering up higher-resolution visuals that run at a smoother 60-frames-per-second.</p><p>Although specific enhancements were mostly kept to first-party Sony games, we did get a broader look at what games will make use of the hardware when it launches. Here’s every game we know so far is going to be enhanced for PS5 Pro.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Game Enhanced for PS5 Pro So Far</h3></div></output><h2>Alan Wake 2</h2><p>Thanks to the power of Remedy’s advanced Northlight engine, Alan Wake 2 was already one of the best-looking games on the PS5 platform. The PS5 Pro will hopefully take it to new heights, especially when it comes to the atmospheric lighting effects in the New York City-like Dark Place.</p><h2>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2><p>Ubisoft has purposefully upgraded the Anvil engine for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, its upcoming feudal Japan-set historical adventure. The added power of the PS5 Pro will hopefully allow that engine to render a sprawling open world at 4K resolution with high frame rates, without having to sacrifice beautiful extras such as gusts of cherry blossom and tree pollen. Running at a steady 60fps will also keep the combat feeling as sharp as Yasuke and Naoe’s blades.</p><h2>Demon’s Souls</h2><p>Despite being a launch title released back in 2020, Demon’s Souls remains one of the most visually arresting games on PS5. The standard version features a Cinematic mode, which has all the bells and whistles tuned on and runs at 4K resolution capped at 30fps, and a Performance mode which drops the resolution to 1440p in order to hit 60fps. The visual difference between the two is only slight, and so most people opt to play in Performance mode considering timing is a vital part of Souls combat. Being able to have the full force of Cinematic mode at 60fps will be a treat if that’s what PS5 Pro delivers.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Dragon’s Dogma 2</h2><p>When it launched earlier this year, Dragon’s Dogma 2 was scrutinised for its choppy performance on console, with 60fps all but impossible to achieve. Sony has yet to detail what to expect from the confirmed PS5 Pro enhancement, but hopefully it brings the framerate up to 60fps so we can enjoy those giant monster battles exactly how they were meant to be. With any luck we’ll also be able to do that at 4K so we can see all the detail rendered by the impressive RE Engine.</p><h2>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</h2><p>Another 2024 game that suffered performance woes, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is frequently a graphical stunner but is locked in the 30fps jail cell. Shifting from fidelity to performance mode makes the combat run buttery smooth, but it comes at the cost of upsettingly blurry visuals. FF7 Rebirth is a game that deserves to be played in the best situation possible, so best to showcase its gorgeous world design and lovingly rendered characters, and hopefully the PS5 Pro upgrade will unlock its full potential.</p><h2>Gran Turismo 7</h2><p>Gran Turismo 7 already looks pretty damn good on PS5 and runs at a slick 60fps, but on PS5 Pro the main focus looks to be ray tracing, especially between the cars as they race around the tracks. This was demonstrated when a bright yellow Corvette edged past a blue Porsche Cayman GT4, and you could clearly see the reflection of the Corvette in those blue body panels as it passed by. It looks nice, but $700 nice? That’s up to you to decide.</p><h2>Hogwart’s Legacy</h2><p>Hogwart’s Legacy was another game that really showcased the PS5 Pro’s improved ray-tracing capabilities, and when we walked through the doors to the Hogwarts' Great Hall I was almost dazzled by how shiny the stone floor was. In addition to <em>more</em> reflections, we’re promised a <em>greater variety</em> of reflective surfaces, a point that was made as a hippogriff flew gracefully over the Great Lake, the distant hills reflected in the icy waters. Lastly, the ray-tracing will benefit shadows too, promising greater realism.</p><h2>Horizon Forbidden West</h2><p>Guerilla Games’ Horizon Forbidden West was another first-party game showcased during the reveal that, thanks to the improvements of the PS5 Pro, promises to bridge the gap between Performance Mode and Fidelity Mode by taking full advantage of the improved GPU. During the presentation we saw Horizon Forbidden West on PS5 Pro with an improved level of graphical fidelity, from better lighting to more detailed skin and hair texture during cinematics.</p><h2>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</h2><p>Insomniac’s Spider-Man 2 is the benchmark to which all PS5 games aspire to, with high-end graphics and insane performance – but not necessarily at the same time. PlayStation architect Mark Cerny promises that, with the PS5 Pro, a game like Spider-Man 2 will no longer have to choose between performance or graphics, and that Spider-Man 2 will achieve high fidelity graphics at performance mode level of framerate, so you get all that gorgeous detail at a sweet 60fps.</p><h2>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</h2><p>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart was an early PS5 technical marvel, highlighting in particular the kind of whiz-bang effects that were only achieved thanks to the faster SSD loaded in the base console. With the PS5 Pro’s promised improvements, we saw that Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart is now able to maintain that high level of performance and gameplay, while improving the graphics that took a hit to meet peak performance. We even see that the PS5 Pro can hit greater visual details while maintaining the same level of frames during Performance Mode.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>The Crew Motorfest</h2><p>Ubisoft’s online racing game The Crew Motorfest was briefly shown during the montage of games that will be improved thanks to the PS5 Pro. While we don’t have any details on what those specific improvements are, the brief sizzle showed what looked to be improved reflections on the car surfaces, potentially meaning a similar visual improvement to Gran Turismo 7’s graphical upgrade, while maintaining 60fps.</p><h2>The First Descendant</h2><p>Nexon’s free-to-play MMORPG The First Descendant also appeared in the PS5 Pro montage, indicating that it too will receive performance and graphical upgrades with the new console. The clips shown during the sizzle were only from cinematic cutscenes, making it hard to determine what specific improvements will be added, but the PS5 Pro promises to bridge the gap between Performance and Fidelity Mode, so expect to see even greater graphical details while maintaining a consistent higher frame-rate.</p><h2>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</h2><p>During the presentation we saw a side-by-side comparison of The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered running on PS5 Pro alongside the PS5 version in fidelity mode. The wooded environments Eliie explores look as sumptuous and detailed as ever on the Pro, but the key difference is the frame-rate – it runs at 60fps, which looks much smoother compared to the standard PS5 version running at a choppy 30fps. When the presentation compared the original’s performance mode, the difference in detail was obvious – it’s noticeably sharper on PS5 Pro. It’s another clear demonstration that the Pro will offer both high resolution visuals and a smooth framerate, if you’re willing to fork out $700.</p><p>Those are all the games we know will be enhanced for PS5 Pro so far. We’ll be sure to add others when they’re announced. In the meantime, check out how the internet has reacted to the PS5 Pro $700 price point, and check out the console’s reveal trailer.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Photo modes have become a common sight in big-budget games in the years since the release of Dragon Age: Inqusition, but it nevertheless marks an important milestone for BioWare's fantasy series.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/image-2-1725923531726.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Manfred is here to introduce Dragon Age: The Veilguard's photo mode.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Happily, Dragon Age: The Veilguard's version of the popular mode has plenty of toys for fans who want to indulge their dreams of being a fantasy photographer. Here's some of what The Veilguard's photo mode has to offer.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Free-roaming camera, tilt, focal length, and lens distortion</li><li>Depth of Field</li><li>Auto Focus</li><li>Distance</li><li>F-Stop, which lets you control the lighting</li><li>Vignette mode, which darkens the edge of the screen and gives it a more cinematic look</li><li>Bloom strength </li><li>Saturation, brightness, and contrast</li><li>The ability to hide the player, the party, enemies, or NPCs</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - 15 Exclusive Screenshots Taken Using Photo Mode</h3></div></output><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard's photo mode owes a debt to Mass Effect: The Legendary Edition, which introduced a photo mode of its own when it was released in 2021. Director Corinne Busche credits Mass Effect: Legendary Edition producer Brenon Holmes for getting photo mode implemented into The Veilguard.</p><p>"Not only did he drive this feature, he did a lot of the work to support it," she explained. "What I really like is the tab that lets you hide various characters. So hide character, hide party, hide enemies, hide NPCs. You can really curate the shot to your liking...You might be mid-fight with a dragon, but there’s a character in the way, so you can clear them out.”</p><p>In the slideshow above, you can see some of the pictures we were able to take using Dragon Age: The Veilguard's photo mode, including some of its more atmosphere areas. We also grabbed a shot of a cat that we happened to run across, because we love fantasy cat photos.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Personally I'm enjoying this lady because she's absolutely the type of characters I usually make. <a href="https://t.co/WgmtltzRIp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/WgmtltzRIp</a></p>— *CR* - Dragon Age: Status Effect (@CorbynRed) <a href="https://twitter.com/CorbynRed/status/1831803711167066412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>These aren't the only images making the rounds, of course. When we posted our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-watch-22-minutes-of-exclusive-gameplay-diving-into-exploration-and-more-ign-first">exclusive Dragon Age: The Veilguard footage last week</a>, fans were quick to notice the Rooks created by myself and my colleague Alex Stedman. While they weren't taken in photo mode, I can't resist posting them here.

                <p>Ubisoft has announced that it will be adding offline modes for The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. The company announced this along with its Year 2 plans for The Crew Motorfest.</p><p>"...Ubisoft Ivory Tower committed to long-term access for both The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest, ensuring that both games will be playable for many years to come, including in an offline mode coming in the future," Ubisoft said in a <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/1fiTcUyVqBbYf2zM4uhaaR" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>.</p><p>Motorfest's Year 2 starts on November 6 with Season 5 and players will get access to the entire map of Maui for free. There are three Seasons in Year 2, which will have Made in Japan Volume 2 and sees the return of neon-filled races, events, and locations.</p><p>Year 2 will also add The Chase Squad, which is the game's PvE content. Players can hunt down racing rivals across the game's islands. Those who own the Gold and Ultimate Editions of the game will receive access to The Chase Squad as part of the Year 2 pass, as well as unlock 20 additional vehicles.</p><p>The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest receiving offline support is crucial because the online servers for the first Crew game were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-crew-is-delisted-servers-shutting-down-at-the-end-of-march-2024/1100-6519967/" data-ref-id="1100-6519967">shut down back in March</a> after 10 years of support. The Crew is now rendered completely unplayable because it requires an internet connection, even for its single-player content.</p><p>The Crew Motorfest was released on September 11, 2023 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

What makes <em>MvC3 </em>an incredible game in its own right (and a fantastic companion piece to anyone looking to grab the new collection when it drops) is how it translates the franchise formula into a more modern fighter. But every good fighting game starts with its roster, and <em>MvC3 </em>has an impressive one, with 50 characters to choose from. As is series convention, you get to mix and match the roster into a team of three, creating a wide variety of playstyles that you can essentially tailor to your needs as a player. That roster also includes the introduction of iconic Capcom and Marvel characters like <em>Ace Attorney</em>’s Phoenix Wright, <em>Resident Evil</em>’s Nemesis, and Hawkeye, all of whom are perfect additions.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="667ea9c08302bcf8e34a55dc934bcd02" data-recommend-id="image://667ea9c08302bcf8e34a55dc934bcd02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dormammu faces off against Tron on the field of battle" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dormammu faces off against Tron on the field of battle" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="667ea9c08302bcf8e34a55dc934bcd02" data-recommend-id="image://667ea9c08302bcf8e34a55dc934bcd02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dormammu faces off against Tron on the field of battle" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of course, gameplay is king when it comes to fighting games, so it’s good that <em>MvC3 </em>still delivers in this regard. It continues the fast and frenetic tag team battles of its predecessors with a more refined design. Perhaps the most important change is the introduction of the X-Factor mechanic which lets players move faster, deal higher damage, regenerate more health, and extend combos. It’s a skill that can only be activated once per match by a player and gets stronger the more knocked out characters you have on your team. It’s effectively a hail mary that gives everybody a chance to come back and win it all, making every match feel like a true competition that can turn on a dime at any second.<br></p><p><em>MvC3 </em>also introduced a simplified control scheme that (prior to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a></span>’s incredible modern controls) felt like the textbook example of how to make a fighting game more beginner friendly while retaining a focus on strategy. To this day, the three-button scheme makes <em>MvC3 </em>one of the easiest fighting games to pick up. As an added bonus, the transition from pixelated sprites to 3D character models with cel-shading make the world of <em>MvC3 </em>look more like a comic than the series ever had before. It gives the game a unique look that feels in line with the grand multiversal clashes you get to engage in, and hasn’t been matched by any entry in the series before or since. So even if you can’t wait to dive into <em>MvC2 </em>again on September 12, don’t ignore the modern classic that is <em>Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
