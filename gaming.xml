			<p>A remaster of The Sinking City, the Lovecraft-inspired open-world detective game released back in 2019 by Frogwares on PC and consoles, has been announced today ahead of the end of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-qa-frogwares-on-renewed-combat-focus-ue5-switch-and-continued-war-impact/">sequel</a>'s <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-shows-off-gameplay-and-launches-kickstarter-campaign/">Kickstarter campaign</a> conclusion.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the remaster, which will be available for free to all owners of the original game on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, will feature an upgraded visual experience, sporting 4K textures, new lighting, improved detail and reflections, 4K textures, support for NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and TSR upscaling and more. The Sinking City Remastered will also feature some requested quality-of-life features as well as a brand-new Photo Mode, providing players with plenty of reasons to dive back into the flooded city of Oakmont together with Charles Reed.</p>

<p>The upgraded visuals featured in The Sinking City Remastered will make the experience even more immersive, as the original game definitely nailed the atmosphere. Hopefully, the quality-of-life improvements will make the game more fun to play, especially the combat, which I found pretty lacking compared to the excellent investigation mechanics, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-sinking-city-strongest-fear-unknown/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Sinking City is probably the best Lovecraft-inspired game currently available on the market, thanks to its oppressive atmosphere and its story, which utilizes the lore masterfully without deviating from the canon. AI and technical issues, as well as the clunky combat, are often immersion-breaking, but the excellent investigation mechanics and exploration features make it easy to look past these issues. Highly recommended to survival horror fans and those who live and breathe Lovecraft.</em></p>
<p>The Sinking City Remastered launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

This is where their most obvious differences come into play: mobility and defense. The Heavy Bowgun, true to its name,restricts your hunter to pretty slow movement. For the cost of slow movement, however, this weapon lets you guard and even trigger a Power Clash against monster attacks.</p><p>The Light Bowgun doesn’t slow your hunter down and ends up feeling a lot smoother in comparison. It lacks the option to guard, but offsets this with fun movement options such as a sidestep and slide. Rapid Fire Mode expands upon these and incorporates a strafing dodge that lets you keep shooting called Burst Step.</p><p>I’ll also add that both weapons (and in particular the Heavy Bowgun) are great to use on your Seikret. Being limited to only standard fire and Focus Blasts while mounted isn’t that restrictive with so many ammo types.</p><h2 id="h32080"><a id=""></a>Rate of fire and damage</h2><figure id="" data-id="133022d7f7e7b206f4f92ca8d466b98d" data-recommend-id="image://133022d7f7e7b206f4f92ca8d466b98d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Congala is pelted by a Light Bowgun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Congala is pelted by a Light Bowgun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="133022d7f7e7b206f4f92ca8d466b98d" data-recommend-id="image://133022d7f7e7b206f4f92ca8d466b98d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Congala is pelted by a Light Bowgun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Although the standard fire for either weapon can use the same ammo, there are still some important differences. With the Heavy Bowgun, you’ll deal with a slower rate of fire and strong damage numbers. The range for critical damage also tends to be a bit farther away from your targets.</p><p>All of that is naturally reversed with the Light Bowgun. Your shots come out faster, but they won’t hit as hard. I’ve also noticed that the critical damage range is comparatively closer across all ammo types.</p><h2 id="h32081"><a id=""></a>Special modes and ammo</h2><figure id="" data-id="fa5022c41dfaa01b25166c385820dc87" data-recommend-id="image://fa5022c41dfaa01b25166c385820dc87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Customize Bowgun screen, highlighting Special Ammo choices." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Customize Bowgun screen, highlighting Special Ammo choices." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa5022c41dfaa01b25166c385820dc87" data-recommend-id="image://fa5022c41dfaa01b25166c385820dc87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Customize Bowgun screen, highlighting Special Ammo choices." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Each of these has access to a secondary firing mode and choices for Special Ammo.

When it comes to the Bowguns, some ammo types are just a better fit on one or the other. Pierce Ammo is arguably the best ammo type in the game and works well for either weapon. I’ve enjoyed using it on the Heavy Bowgun more, simply due to how much damage it does.</p><p>Ammo associated with elements or status ailments meanwhile shine with the Light Bowgun. Any extra elemental-based damage adds up nicely with all the rounds you shoot off. Similarly, it’s a lot easier to trigger a status effect when you’re constantly hitting a monster with status ailment ammo.</p><p>Both bowguns are fantastic tools that serve as excellent secondary weapons if you prefer having a melee as your primary.

<p>A Minecraft Movie is one of the biggest movie prospects in 2025, and while promoting it, Jason Momoa told journalists that he doesn’t let his kids play video games or have phones.</p>



<p>Jason Momoa plays Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meet-the-minecraft-movies-cast-in-the-game-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Minecraft Movie</a>. The character has become one of the most iconic images from each trailer. Aside from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jack-black-has-logged-more-than-100-hours-on-minecraft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jack Black</a>, Momoa is easily the biggest star power. It’s hard to see A Minecraft Movie not doing well, and it’s likely to help the already-enormously successful franchise.</p>



<p>While promoting A Minecraft Movie, Momoa shared fascinating details about his kids and specific strict measures he implements.</p>







<figure><figcaption>It’s a strict lifestyle. Credit to Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://x.com/Deadline/with_replies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Momoa was asked if his children play video games. The actor answered frankly: “We don’t have a TV, my son doesn’t even have a phone. He’s 16 and doesn’t have a phone—we’re different dude. Sorry, man.”</p>



<p>The actor explained that his son can have a phone when he turns 18, and “explore the world” after that. Momoa justified the decision by saying he wants his kids to “use their creativity in a different way.” He also adds that he didn’t grow up with a phone and “everyone was doing just fine” without them.</p>



<p>You can see the full exchange for yourself.</p>



<div><article><p><span>‘A Minecraft Movie’ star Jason Momoa on why he doesn’t let his kids play video games or have phones: “We’re different dude. I just want them to use their creativity in a different way”</span></p></article></div>



<p>It’s a unique way of operating life, of course, but it’s interesting to see one of A Minecraft Movie’s key stars admitting he doesn’t let his kids play video games when he’s starring in an overtly video-game movie.</p>



<p>Let us know what you think of Momoa’s parenting style here at IG, and in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The Game of Thrones franchise is one of the most popular in modern entertainment history. Unfortunately, for as well-received as the books and shows have been, the games—for the most part—have left a lot to be desired. For developer Netmarble, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is an attempt to turn that around and release a new game in the series that will have people talking.</p>



<p>Sadly, the type of talking most people will have about this game is its uninspired gameplay and heavy monetization practices.</p>



<h2 id="h-game-of-thrones-kingsroad-early-access-review">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad Early Access Review</h2>



<p>As the title mentions, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">currently in early access</a>. While the game will be free-to-play once out of early access, those who want to play now will have to buy one of three bundles of the game. The cheapest is the standard pack for $24.99 while the most expensive, the Ultimate Pack, costs $89.99. Each of the three packs come with access to the game along with various benefits like Iron Bank Marks, outfits, emojis, and even battle pass access for the two higher bundles.</p>



<p>Without giving away much in terms of spoilers, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad’s story takes place during the fourth season of the show. You play as a brand new character to the world who is the heir to House Tyre.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Getting started, you pick one of three classes—knight, sellsword, or assassin—and create your character using a pretty limited character creator. I mean, you can’t even make yourself bald. What’s up with that?</p>



<p>In and of itself, the story isn’t too bad. The dialogue is solid, and nothing feels out of place as you play. What does feel out of place, though, are the animations. In an area where the game feels exactly like a mobile game or something from the mid-to-late 2000s, everyone’s mouth either looks like it’s chewing the words being said or is nowhere close to how it should be. In some cases, you kind of feel like you are watching a 1970s kung fu movie with English voiceovers. And yes, I likely dated myself with that reference.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Moving on to gameplay, there’s nothing really special to write home about. It’s your typical action RPG with your basic attacks, special attacks, blocking, and dodging. Most of the moves look solid, but there’s no weight behind the attacks. Every swing of a weapon or kick you make just feels like you are swinging around the lightest paper towel tube. Even dry pool noodles feel like there’s more power behind attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other animations also feel janky, such as any movement in a diagonal direction. Whether you are running, walking or riding a horse, it all looks and feels like your characters are sliding around and/or floating. Like the attacks, there’s no weight behind what’s being done. It just all feels like going through the motion with no sense of reward for anything you do.</p>



<p>There are three different trait trees—attack, defense, and support—that you can progress through as you play. They add things like increased damage, mount stamina, parrying ability, and other skill improvements that you’d expect. They are fine for what they are, but the trees are so small that it just feels like something to be added to the game rather than help improve your play.</p>



<p>One other area with the game that bothers me is with your equipment. You can buy, find, and unlock better equipment like other games. But, when you equip them, you don’t see it. It’s there, but the only look you have is the basis of your character. Get a rare set of gloves to equip? They are there in stats only. Some might not care about it, but not being able to see the gear I’ve found is a major turn off with games like this.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-the-mobile-monetization">The Mobile Monetization</h3>



<p>Now onto what is, arguably, the most frustrating of the game: the microtransactions. First things first, this is going to be a free-to-play game, so in-app purchases are expected. However, there’s a way to do it right and then the way Game of Thrones: Kingsroad does them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As expected, there are various cosmetics that you can pay to unlock for your character. That’s the norm in almost every game, free or paid, at this point. The problem lies in some obvious cash grabs within the game right now.</p>



<p>Should you die and you want to revive with your health, it’ll cost you copper. Want to fast travel to an area you unlocked? It’ll cost you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early on in the game it’s not too bad, but the further into the game you go, the more and more tedious it becomes. There are energy restrictions throughout, and timegating becomes a major concern that will make you feel like you wasted the dozen or so hours you have spent in the game to that point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game is advertised as co-op, but only dungeons are able to be played with friends. Oh, and that’s another area where an in-game currency is needed in order to access. It’s easy to continue on with the problematic monetization practices, but it’s not really worth rambling at this point.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-game-of-thrones-kingsroad-review-verdict">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad Review Verdict</h3>



<p>Don’t let the fact that it’s available on PC fool you, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is a mobile game. It looks like a mobile game and plays like one, too. While in 2025 that’s not necessarily a bad thing, it’s when it attempts to pass itself off as something more that it becomes an issue.</p>



<p>At this present moment, it’s hard to tell anyone not to hold off for the game to go free-to-play after the early access period ends. Even then, with the heavy—and I mean heavy—microtransaction push, the lack of exciting gameplay and frustrating animation issues, this is one trip to Westeros you’re better off postponing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>VERDICT: SKIP</strong></p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has launched an official <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a> 25th anniversary website, ahead of the game's quarter century milestone in July.</p>
<p><a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th">The website</a>, which is in Japanese, says the team is busy "preparing various projects", including merchandise and other collaborations as part of its anniversary celebrations. Some of the already announced Final Fantasy 9 collaborations include a <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th_news/5482">picture book</a>, an <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th_news/5481">anniversary vinyl</a> and <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th_news/5480">some cute little figurines of both Garnet and Zidane</a> among other collectables.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000793.000002864.html">collaboration with eyeglass brand Zoff</a> has also been announced, and within this release the company notes Final Fantasy 9 has sold 8.9m units worldwide.</p>

<p>But, what of those projects that are yet to be announced? Well, I for one am now very hopeful for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rumoured-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-is-reportedly-real">that long rumoured remake of</a> - in my humble opinion - one of the best Final Fantasy games yet. My goodness, how I wanted to be Garnet. I hold her and April O'Neil responsible for my love of yellow clothing.</p>
<p>And, I am not alone in hoping that a Final Fantasy 9 remake will soon actually materialise. "I beg you square enix please let there be a remake," <a href="https://x.com/SiKthYEXP/status/1906662931061784939">reads one comment on social media</a>. Plenty of others echo this sentiment, with variations on the begging and praying post found scattershotted in replies.</p>
<p>Interestingly, some are now speculating we will hear more about this hypothetical Final Fantasy 9 remake during Nintendo's dedicated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> Direct, which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">scheduled for this Wednesday</a>.</p>
<p>Well, now I've really got my hopes up…</p> <div>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/pocketpair-announces-palworld-dating-sim/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pocketpair-announces-palworld-dating-sim.1149855/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/pocketpair-announces-palworld-dating-sim/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The April Fool's dating sim from Pocketpair has made a return, and this time, it doesn't seem to be a joke. Last year, Pocketpair released a trailer for a dating sim called Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~, where it was released as an April Fools joke.</p>
<p>However, today, Pocketpair has released another trailer for Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~, an the game seems legitimate and actively developing. So, for those who want to date some of the pals you find in Palworld, this will be your opportunity. There is now an <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/3620480/Palworld_More_Than_Just_Pals/?snr=1_5_1100__1100&amp;utm_source=steamwidget" target="_blank" rel="noopener">active Steam page</a> for the game, where you can wishlist it and get a little bit more information about what the game will be.</p>
<p>Below is the trailer that was released today by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/">Palworld developers</a>. From the description on the YouTube video, it seems that the game will be available to wishlist on Steam and the PlayStation Store. Thus far, there is no mention of whether this will be available on Nintendo Switch or Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~ | 2nd trailer | Palworld | Pocketpair" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZUpilXM6638?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this title, you enroll as a transfer student in the Palpagos Private Academy, where you will be introduced to some unique friends (pals) and get to enjoy the school life alongside them, with the option to romance them along the way. You can choose whether you stay friends with them or work on a romantic relationship with them. There is also the third option of dismembering and eating them if you want a touch of horror to your gaming experience.</p>
<p>The Steam Page for Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~ also reveals some of the students that you will meet, including Lovander, Chillet, Zoe, Chillet Ignis, Quivern, Nurse Saya, Tarantriss, and more. It seems that there is a wide range of options for those who want to participate in learning the stories of each character, with some seeming on a bit of the darker side of things.</p>
<p>From the screenshots available, it seems to share similarities to Doki Doki Literature Club, luring you into a false sense of security. There are two trailers for the game, with one of them being the trailer that was released as an April Fool's joke last year.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no set release date for this title, and the announcement has come very suspiciously close to April Fool's once again. The Pocketpair Community Manager, John "Bucky" Buckley, assured Eurogamer that this is, in fact, legitimate and not another April Fool's joke.</p>
<p>So, will you be playing Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-easing-up-its-vram-hogging-toughening-up-even-more-monsters<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ahead of this Friday's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-will-release-on-pc-in-april-adding-a-grand-hub-mizutsune-and-new-quests">big content update</a> for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, Capcom have put out a <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/director-letter/">new blog from director Yuya Tokuda</a>, detailing more scaly, slimy, and shiny additions. The main theme here is "harder fights", with arch-tempered variants of monsters besides the announced Ray Dau. But there's plenty of other planned smaller tweaks and goodies, including a reduction in VRAM usage coming "very soon".</p>
<p>Friday's update includes long n' purple Mizutsune, plus repeatable fights with Zoh Shia, previously a one-off story monster. There's also a new gathering hub, which I'm especially happy about - I miss what I once referred to as "Astera's gung-ho trumpetbastardry". I want to see people and I want to see lights, and I also want to see virtuosic cat chefs.</p>

<p>That's all ancient soup though, so what's new? First, there's seasonal event Festival of Accord: Blossomdance starting April 22nd. These are limited events that offer new cosmetic gear, gestures, and decorations, with the titular blossoms being a theme this go around. April 30th brings a limited time arch-tempered Ray Dau event, with a permanent free hunt from May 7th. At least, this is what the text says, the image above seems to contradict that. Either way, arch-tempered Raymond is on the way.</p>
<p>Then, at the end of May, there's a 'Capcom collaboration', plus additional features. Monster Hunter World featured a Dante (from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a> series) set, so I'm assuming it's something similar. I'll avoid any easy wanking jokes about Capcom 'collaborating' with itself, obviously.  Finally, there's another big update due sometime in Summer, fonted as such to suggest a similar sized offering to Friday's monst drop.</p>
<p>Tokuda then goes into details about future plans. First up: more 8 Star Tempered Monst in the vein of Tempered Arkveld, with Tempered Mizutsune being the first. "In addition, the update at the end of May will add the Tempered Monsters (★8) Gore Magala and the apex predators of each locale: Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad," say Capcom.</p>
<p>Next, there's balance adjustments across the board, with hammer buffs and corruption mantle nerfs mentioned specifically. There's some quality of life bits mentioned, specifically "the ease of restocking items, checking skill information, participating in multiplayer quests and using the Seikret; and camera behaviour during hunts". A bit later on, there's also the mention of layered weapons, endemic life previews, and "a wider look at overall gameplay flow, which encompasses a range of things, such as the in-game economy, balance and other areas".</p>
<p>In terms of PC performance, Capcom say the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>The team is continuing to identify stability issues and make improvements where possible, especially on the Steam version. This will be an ongoing process, where we'll aim to make continual steps forward in this area and respond to critical issues.</p>
<p>Improvements coming very soon include a reduction in VRAM usage and an upgrade to the DirectStorage version of the Steam version in Free Title Update 1. These should result in an overall improvement in stability for our PC players.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jubilant news indeed. If you're still having issues with performance and/or general ugliness, I found that the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/93">REFramework</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/245">Disable Lens Distortion</a> mods work wonders, although official improvements are obviously welcome. Now give me an Arch Tempered Greater Jagras. He deserves revenge.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’m 90 percent sure it was just because we could carry him. I was like a 12-year-old Hanzo main who was barely in Silver. He was a Bronze Torbjörn main. He was fucking dogshit. Awful. Like, godawful. So no, I don’t believe the fucking- ‘I am a pro <em>Path of Exile</em> whatever the fuck.’ Like, no the fuck you are not. This is so cringe. Why would you even pretend to be? It’s fine not to be a gamer.”</p><p>The Bronze ranking is funny enough on its own, but the revelation that he was having such a hard time climbing the ranks as Torbjörn, arguably one of the lower-skill heroes on the roster, is also pretty good. However, nothing beats knowing he had to force pre-teens to help him climb out of the Bronze hole into the illustrious ranks of…Silver.</p><p>All of this comes after years of Musk trying to position himself as a pro-level gamer in games like <em>Path of Exile 2 </em>and <em>Diablo IV</em>, seemingly in an attempt to buy credibility in the eyes of nerd followers who will stroke his ego on X and elsewhere. As his business ventures have grown over the years, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-asmongold-poe-2-account-boosting-controversy-1851741223&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-asmongold-poe-2-account-boosting-controversy-1851741223">people have become increasingly skeptical of his claims</a></span> because one person running half a dozen companies likely doesn’t have time to be sinking hundreds of hours into grinding away at video games. Now we have another story to add to the fake gamer saga, and the evidence is really piling up. I don’t care that Musk might not be good at video games, but it’s pretty funny that he’s so desperate for people to think he is.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The 15-month wait for more information has fueled increasingly bizarre conspiracy theories about when Rockstar will release GTA 6 Trailer 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These have included <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/on-the-gta-6-trailers-1-year-anniversary-fans-are-debating-youtube-playlist-updates-and-batting-away-misleading-ai-generated-images"><u>counting the holes in Lucia’s cell door net</u></a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/were-now-at-the-bullet-holes-and-braille-stage-of-gta-6-fan-theory"><u>bullet holes in the car from Trailer 1</u></a>, and even registration plates. But chief among the conspiracy theories is GTA 6’s ongoing moon watch, which was, remarkably, proven to have accurately predicted the date Rockstar announced when it would release GTA 6 Trailer 1, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-community-devastated-by-gta-6-trailer-announcement-no-show-after-moon-theory-proved-incorrect"><u>debunked as a hint at the release date for Trailer 2</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the big question right now is, when <em>will</em> GTA 6 Trailer 2 be released? We’re no closer to finding out, but based on comments from Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick, fans may have to wait until much closer to GTA 6’s actual release date for their next look at the most anticipated video game in the world.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/0M53-LKlECk?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, Zelnick was asked straight up: why is GTA 6’s release date such a carefully held secret?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The anticipation for that title may be the greatest anticipation I’ve ever seen for an entertainment property," Zelnick replied. "And I’ve been around the block a few times and I’ve been in every entertainment business there is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement. And we do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance. And we found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand and balance the excitement with unmet anticipation. We don’t always get it exactly right, but that’s what we are trying to do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a few things worth digging into here. The first is Zelnick’s comments about keeping GTA 6’s release date such a carefully held secret “to maintain the anticipation and the excitement.” That’s something fans and the media alike have assumed to be true, and indeed former Rockstar developers have tried to explain is true.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Key Art's Hidden Map..?</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mike York, who worked as an animator at Rockstar New England for six years helping to build Grand Theft Auto 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 before leaving the company in 2017, said on <a href="https://youtu.be/TnTIV8AFs2o?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>his YouTube channel</u></a> that Rockstar is playing up to the conspiracy theories, deliberately avoiding saying anything about the game or when Trailer 2 will be released in order to fuel even more speculation within the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They're reaching and pulling and trying to come up with these really cool theories to decipher when the next trailer will be,” he said of fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Specifically Rockstar, they're very secretive about what they do, and this is a really cool tactic because it creates allure and it creates mystery and it creates people talking about it without them having to do anything. The more they're silent the better it is, because the more people will be antsy and want to talk about it and have this feeling of not knowing what's going to happen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">York went on to say that Rockstar is likely resisting pressure from its army of fans to announce the GTA 6 Trailer 2 release date for this exact reason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They could easily release the trailer date and be like, ‘Hey this is when the trailer's coming out,’ but they don't do it. And they don't do it on purpose because it's a really, really good marketing tactic. If you think about it, it creates these really cool theories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This brings the fans together. This is a really cool way to get fans to talk about your game when you’re not releasing anything yet, in-between the times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“All these theories are great. They only create hype, they create talk, they create mystery behind the games.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The second thing worth pulling out of Zelnick’s quote is the suggestion that GTA 6 Trailer 2 won’t be released until we’re closer to the game’s actual release date in fall 2025 (assuming it’s not delayed). If that’s true, it may be half a year before we get another look at GTA 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you wait for GTA 6 to come out, check out IGN’s coverage of an ex-Rockstar dev who says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-delayed-to-2026-one-ex-rockstar-dev-says-the-studio-probably-wont-be-able-to-make-that-call-until-may-2025"><u>the studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025</u></a>, Take-Two boss Strauss <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6"><u>Zelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out</u></a>, and the expert opinion on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts"><u>whether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

More Than Just Pals, a dating sim set in its massively popular monster-catching universe — and no, it’s not an April Fools’ Day joke (this time).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team behind 2024’s Pokémon-like survival experience revealed its plans to inject a bit of romance into its catalog today, March 31. It’s an announcement that, on any other day of the year, fans would accept without question. However, April Fools’ Day gags, fake games, and more strange announcements from game developers will surely flood the internet as soon as the new month rolls in tomorrow, so most fans are already taking Palworld! More Than Just Pals with a grain of salt.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair wants to <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1906694803632644593" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>be clear for the non-believers</u></a>: Palworld! More Than Just Pals is indeed a real video game. The idea was seemingly born out of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep4kasLrZug&amp;t=2s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>its 2024 April Fools’ Day stunt</u></a>, which saw the team announcing More Than Just Pals as a fake game for little more than a quick laugh. Well, now it’s real, and it’s coming to PC via Steam at an unspecified point in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld! More Than Just Pals sounds like an especially out-there addition to Pocketpair’s popular universe. Its description teases an experience that allows players to befriend and fall in love with a cast of student Pals who attend Palagos Private Academy. The project’s official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3620480/Palworld_More_Than_Just_Pals/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam page</u></a> highlights characters like the “cute” and “mysterious” Katress and the “timid” Chillet, with many names pulled directly from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a>’s library of creatures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You, the protagonist, enroll as a transfer student in the prestigious Palagos Private Academy,” an official description from Pocketpair said. “You will meet unique friends (pals) and enjoy school life through friendship and romance. It's up to you whether you stay friends with the pals, develop romantic relationships with them, or even dismember and eat them.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">This doesn't concern April Fools :)</p>— Bucky | Palworld (@Bucky_cm) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/1906694803632644593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 31, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair’s Palworld celebrated its one-year anniversary this past January as it continues development with more updates. Its string of content will surely help with the wait for the Palworld dating sim, as players most recently got their hands on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-update-050-adds-crossplay-across-all-platforms-blueprint-upgrading-photo-mode-and-more"><u>an update that added</u></a> crossplay support, Blueprint upgrades, photo mode, and more.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-weve-played-it</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-weve-played-it.1149837/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-weve-played-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I went into my hands-on with Doom: The Dark Ages I was prepared for intense violence and high volume heavy metal, but what I didn’t count on was such an exhilarating amount of demon-killing variety. By the end of my two-hour demo I’d used a saw-toothed shield to slice through demons like it was Beelzebub’s Beyblade, stomped around a war-ravaged city as a colossal Mecha-Slayer, and even brought a snarling Cyberdemon to an explosive end by breathing fire directly down its throat with my faithful dragon steed – which seemed as though it had come to life from one of the sketches I used to draw in the margins of my high school maths books. In fact, every aspect of it looked and felt incredible. It may take place in the dark ages of the Doom timeline, but the Slayer’s latest slaughterfest might well represent the peak of the series’s modern era.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with the most crucial new change: the shield. While 2016’s Doom was focussed on run and gun, and 2020’s Doom Eternal evolved into jump and shoot, the core combat principle of Doom: The Dark Ages is to stand and fight. That’s not to say I wasn’t immediately strafing through the strife as I met each new wave of Satan’s soldiers, but the Doom Slayer’s new shield allowed me to hold my ground and block or parry enemy attacks, and even deflect projectiles back at them whenever I managed to nail the timing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to which enemy attacks can be deflected and which can’t, it’s basically traffic light rules – red means stop and green means go. Or for Star Wars fans, red is bad and green is good. The point is, you must constantly stay on the move to weave your way through the red waves of enemy fire, but the moment you see a green burst you need to dash towards the danger in order to perfectly bat back everything from searing bolts of energy fired by enemy archers to the deadly volleys launched by the hulking Hell Tanks.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Dark Ages’ shield makes the new Doom feel like the greatest unofficial Captain America game ever made.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It introduces a welcome new test of your timing and positioning on top of the already high intensity gunplay – which has also been revitalised by an awe-inspiring arsenal that includes a machine gun that crushes skulls and spits out shards of bone and just might be the most heavy metal weapon ever conceived – but the shield isn’t there simply to block and deflect. It can also bare the brunt of a powerful lunging bash that instantly closes the distance between you and your target, and you can even rev up its spinning saw-toothed edge like a chainsaw and hurl it. The shield will pinball through crowds of weaker enemies like the Imps, or it can be lodged straight into the sternums of the beefier Imp Walkers to stun-lock them in place while you mop up the lesser minions around them. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Doom: The Dark Ages - Preview Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Slayer’s shield can also work in tandem with your bulging bag of boomsticks in some incredibly satisfying ways. Come up against a platoon of soldiers marching behind seemingly impenetrable steel shields of their own? Just pump a few super shotgun rounds into their metal mobile cover to heat it until it’s visibly molten, before frisbeeing your shield straight at them to ignite the entire group and shower yourself in valuable armour pickups from the resulting explosion.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dark Ages’ shield is perhaps the most devastating interpretation of the phrase ‘the best offense is a good defense’, and it makes the new Doom feel like the greatest unofficial Captain America game ever made. Only, instead of fighting an army of Nazis you’re battling the most evil villains that Hell has to offer. Which, I suppose, are both one and the same.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At any rate, no sooner had I settled into The Dark Ages’ sensational new shield-wielding combat system, than I was suddenly whisked into the cockpit of a massive Mecha-Slayer to take on the tallest terrors to ever emerge from a Hell portal. The Atlan assault mechs have only been teased in the past couple of Doom games, but in The Dark Ages they’re finally pilotable, and I was absolutely thrilled to get behind the controls of one of these green-helmed goliaths in order to raise some hell. Or should I say, raze some hell, as I stomped out tiny tanks and crashed through bridges lined with troops on my way to going toe to towering toe with each Titan demon trying to take me down.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Best of First-Person Shooter Campaigns</h3><p>It’s easy to immediately think of classic multiplayer matches and modes when thinking about the history of first-person shooters, but the genre is full of captivating campaigns and memorable stories.  From the far-reaches of the galaxy to the literal pits of hell – and everywhere</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, Doom: The Dark Ages takes the series’ signature ultra violence and literally elevates it into Kaiju-sized carnage. Its Atlan combat is simple in setup but seriously satisfying in execution, as you repeatedly pump the right trigger to unleash combos with a pair of school bus-sized fists, with each successful blow you land filling up a special meter consisting of two halves. Fill it halfway and you can deliver a powerful stomp that sends a shockwave through the earth below and opens up cracks of damaging lava that stagger your opponent. Fill it completely and you can deal a devastating finishing move to force Lucifer’s leviathans to go in peace. Or more specifically, in freshly shredded pieces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like your 50-storey-tall fisticuffs with a side order of gargantuan guns then fear not, because midway through the level a whopper of a weapon drop gave my mech access to a machine gun so large it could use an aeroplane hanger for a holster. Performing perfect dodges on incoming enemy attacks powers up both barrels of this not-so-mini-gun, and I was soon blasting gloriously gory chunks of flesh off each Titan’s torso that showered on the soldiers below. You don’t normally see this much raining blood without buying a ticket to a Slayer concert and sticking around for the encore.    </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You don’t normally see this much raining blood without buying a ticket to a Slayer concert and sticking around for the encore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately I was only given the smallest taste of these supersized shootouts, since my hands-on quickly switched tracks from Godzilla to Game of Thrones as I slipped out of the Atlan’s cockpit and into the saddle of a cybernetic dragon, complete with twin cannons and a pair of dazzling laser wings. Soaring through the skies above a humungous holy city, I took the fight to a series of Hell Carrier airships, again performing perfect dodges to power up my attacks to demolish the artillery along their sides and the deadly assault cannons atop their hulls. With each airship’s defenses down, I was then able to swoop down to its exposed landing zone, leap off my dragon to briefly blast through Hades’ hordes on the flight deck, before shield-bashing into its central power core and forcing the whole thing to erupt like a Hellspawned Hindenburg, as I flew to safety aboard my scaly skybound steed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both the Atlan and cyberdragon sections proved to be propulsive palette cleansers rich with spectacle, but I was itchin’ for more of that bitchin’ shield and shoot ’em up action. Thankfully the Slayer was soon brought back down to earth to unleash further terror on terra firma as my hands-on finished with a taste of one of Doom: The Dark Ages’ sprawling sandbox levels. While the previous gameplay stretches were dynamic but somewhat directed action set pieces, this bumper battlefield level dubbed The Siege gave me the freedom to tackle its objectives in any order and progress through it entirely at my own pace.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thus, in between exhilarating encounters with waves of heavily armoured Mancubuses and shield-based slugfests with super heavy Cyberdemons, I was also able to scour the landscape in all directions for gold to spend on weapon upgrades, collectible toys, and even brand new guns to add to my growing arsenal of demon-destroyers. This included the Reaver Chainshot, which delivered powerful charged up attacks that basically allowed me to fire a cannon ball to instantly mulch a monster, before retracting it on a chain and firing it again to crush their minion mate beside them. Kind of like a Chain Chomp but not nearly as adorable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The expanded map also provided plenty of nooks and crannies to hunt through for health and armour pickups, including melee ammo for the Slayer’s new flail and electrified gauntlet attacks. That’s right, as if the Slayer wasn’t already badarse enough, he now manually reloads his punches like he’s Henry Cavill in the bathroom brawl scene from Mission: Impossible - Fallout. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The overall impression I got from The Dark Ages’ Siege map is that, although it’s large in size, it’s still dense with breathtaking discoveries and diverse encounters. Some open-field fights locked mini-bosses behind a morale meter, keeping them immune to my attacks until I’d hustled to take out a few dozen of their underlings. Other caves I explored featured almost no combat at all, instead challenging me to use my shield for environmental puzzle-solving, either as a grappling hook to launch me to otherwise unreachable areas or a tool to manipulate the controls of a variety of arcane machines. There were wonderful surprises almost everywhere I looked, but also some not so wonderful ones… like the giant tentacle that suddenly emerged from the ground beneath my feet in a swamp area and turned me from unstoppable beast to recently deceased in an instant.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that, my time in the Slayer’s combat boots was up, and what a brief but utterly brilliant ride it had been. If this small taste is anything to go by, then I'm pretty sure that the only reason id Software is calling this one Doom: The Dark Ages is because the title of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-ultimate-doom">The Ultimate Doom</a> was already taken three decades ago. From its satisfying shield-based combat shake-up and enticing sandbox level structures, to its Pacific Rim-rocking skyscraper-sized beatdowns and its dazzling dragon-riding dogfights, the team behind Doom: The Dark Ages is seemingly throwing everything but Hell’s kitchen sink into making this the biggest and best campaign seen to date in the seminal shooter series.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Doom: The Dark Ages seems to have the flexibility to allow any level of player to become a god tier Slayer.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also set to be the most accessible. If you’ve ever wanted in on the wanton demon destruction but have previously been too intimidated to try, Doom: The Dark Ages looks to have you covered. Not only is there an expanded number of difficulty settings to choose from this time, with six different levels of challenge from the exceedingly gentle Aspiring Slayer to the absolutely mental Ultra Nightmare, but there are also tools to tweak almost every aspect of the experience. That includes sliders to adjust everything from parry timing windows to the damage dealt from each attack, and the overall speed of the action. Whether you want it to be a friction-free power trip or a synapse-straining punishment, Doom: The Dark Ages seems to have the flexibility to allow any level of player to become a god tier Slayer. What’s more, since it’s a prequel to the 2016 reboot, you can go in completely fresh even if you have NFI what a BFG is. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom: The Dark Ages is set to arrive on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on May 15th. Until then, if you want a daily dose of doom, you could just spend a few minutes scrolling through social media. But if you want more Doom: The Dark Ages, be sure to check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/doom-the-dark-ages-developers-discuss-the-future-of-doom">interview with the team at id Software</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/doom-the-dark-ages-gameplay-overview-xbox-developer-direct-2025">gameplay overview trailer</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tristan Ogilvie is a Senior Video Producer at IGN's Sydney office.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-exclusive-ghost-of-ytei-gets-new-story-info-commits-to-2025-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">We haven’t heard much about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> in recent months, but after fans spotted a morsel of new story information published to the game’s website, they’re having fun speculating about how Sucker Punch’s hotly anticipated PlayStation 5 exclusive will actually play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official website</a> includes the following story snippet:</p><blockquote>300 years after the events of Ghost of Tsushima, a new warrior – Atsu – rises from the ashes of her homestead.</blockquote><blockquote>Filled with fury and determination, Atsu will hunt down those responsible for the death of her family and exact her revenge. Every odd job and bounty will provide the coin she needs for her journey. But how she fights, survives, and evolves the legend of the Ghost, will be up to you.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">We already knew Ghost of Yōtei’s setting and the time period, and that Atsu was on a revenge mission of some kind. But what we didn’t know was that she’s hunting down those responsible for the death of her family after her homestead is destroyed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there’s the mention that “every odd job and bounty will provide the coin she needs for her journey. But how she fights, survives, and evolves the legend of the Ghost, will be up to you.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are speculating that Ghost of Yōtei will have a bounty hunting mechanic in which Atsu takes on jobs to earn money needed for other things in the game. There’s the potential here, then, for an actual in-game economy, where Tsushima didn’t really have any sort of money mechanic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If true, this may tap into Sucker Punch’s stated goal of giving players more control over Atsu's story. Creative director Jason Connell has said that one of the changes compared to Ghost of Tsushima will be a less repetitive open world: “One challenge that comes with making an open-world game is the  repetitive nature of doing the same thing over again. We wanted to balance against that and find unique experiences.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ghost of Yotei</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, the website retreads old ground, mentioning new weapon types (ōdachi, kusarigama, and dual katanas), “massive sightlines that let you look far across the environment, skies of twinkling stars and auroras, and vegetation that sways believably in the wind,” and “enhanced performance and visuals on PlayStation 5 Pro.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s the crucial point: the website lists 2025 as the release window for Ghost of Yōtei. There’s been much talk about Sony maybe waiting for Rockstar to announce GTA 6’s release date so it can make sure Ghost of Yōtei doesn’t clash. GTA 6 is currently set for a vague fall 2025 launch, but some are wondering if parent company Take-Two will delay the game into the winter or potentially beyond. With that in mind, perhaps Ghost of Yōtei will release this summer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever the release date, it does feel like things may be ramping up for Ghost of Yōtei. Hopefully we'll hear and see more soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

"I'm hoping that discovery is half the fun, and a big reason that these soundtracks resonated in the first place. So listen and enjoy the ride.

This isn't the only omission from the remasters, as when it was first announced, it looked like former Jackass star Bam Margera had been cut from the roster, although Hawk has since claimed (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bam-margera-is-seemingly-not-returning-for-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>) that he demanded the controversial skateboarder be included in the game.</p><p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 releases on July 11 for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. It'll also be coming to Game Pass on day one, and it'll feature several new skaters on its roster as well as reworked gameplay for the remaster of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, so that it can better fit the classic two-minute objective format of the older games.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-pals-in-palworld/2900-5039/" data-ref-id="2900-5039">Palworld</a> established itself by doing things that Nintendo would never do with Pokemon, including arming pals with lethal weapons. Now, Palworld developer Pocketpair has revisited its 2024 April Fool's Day joke with a new look at Palworld: More Than Just Pals, which lets players romantically court pals and even date them. And what started out as a joke could be real this time. </p><p>Even if this new update is just a continuation of the original joke, some of the Pocketpair devs clearly put a a lot of work into this one. Palworld: More Than Just Pals <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3620480/Palworld_More_Than_Just_Pals/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has a page on Steam</a> with multiple screenshots, and a detailed breakdown of some the characters that the players can supposedly pursue. Most of the romantic options are for pals, but there's one adult, Nurse Saya, that players can also flirt with. Most of the main characters are showcased in the announcement trailer that was created for the game and published a year ago.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep4kasLrZug" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ep4kasLrZug" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The newly released second trailer continues the flirtations as Nurse Saya and the pals practically throw themselves at the players-character.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUpilXM6638" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZUpilXM6638" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Palworld's social media accounts have also announced a contest for a More Than Just Pals Lovander body pillow. Lovander is a character in the game who is described as "A senior who makes a love approach to new students every year. She calls her love approach 'hunting.'"</p><p>Although Palworld's communications director, John "Bucky" Buckley, <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1906694803632644593" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">insists that the game is real</a>, our bet remains that this is just an elaborate April Fool's Day joke. But there probably would be an audience for this game.</p><p>Despite the ongoing lawsuit with Nintendo, Bucky recently hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-could-come-to-switch-2-if-the-system-is-beefy-enough/1100-6530302/" data-ref-id="1100-6530302">Palworld could come to Switch 2</a> if the system is powerful enough. Earlier this month, Palworld also received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/huge-palworld-update-adds-cross-play-photo-mode-and-new-pal-storage/1100-6530211/" data-ref-id="1100-6530211">a big new update with cross-play, photo mode</a> and more additions to the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/the-key-to-eggy-party-s-ugc-success-lies-in-recommendation-system-iteration<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discoverability is just as much of a challenge in the User Generated Content (UGC) space as it is on Steam, console marketplaces, and many other parts of the video game industry. Sometimes it can be seen as even more of a challenge on emerging platforms within games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eggy Party</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. These platforms are still developing features that are commonplace on popular platforms in other mediums like YouTube and Twitch. Since these platforms also rely on user-submitted content, they can be defined as “UGC” platforms as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How can UGC platforms learn from the functionality of YouTube and Twitch? Netase data mining engineer Xingchen Zhou explored the UGC landscape and the specific ways the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eggy Party</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developers have adjusted their recommendation system to appeal to its massive audience of players during a talk at the 2025 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eggy Party</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, according to Zhou, is the most "popular competitive casual game in China." The party game, which shares similarities with games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stumble Guys</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fall Guys</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, surpassed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/neteases-eggy-party-reaches-500-million-players-in-under-two-years/">40 million daily active players</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> during Lunar New Year in 2024. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eggy Party</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has surpassed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/eggy-party-sails-past-100-million-user-generated-maps/#:~:text=60%25%20of%20players%20actively%20create,by%20the%20game's%20incentive%20program.&amp;text=NetEase%20Games%20has%20revealed%20that,100%20million%20user%2Dgenerated%20maps.">100 million user-created maps</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as of last March.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Recommendation algorithms are key to UGC platforms">Recommendation algorithms are key to UGC platforms</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/-we-need-to-define-what-it-means-to-be-safe-as-gamers-around-the-world-a-code-of-ethics-in-gaming" target="_self" data-discover="true">'We need to define what it means to be safe as [players] around the world:' a code of ethics in gaming</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zhou covered a common thread among other UGC platforms outside games, arguing that their uniting element is an effective distribution system. He compared them to Vine, a popular short form video platform that shuttered at the beginning of 2017, saying the Twitter-operated video app failed due to its lack of "personalized recommendations and a lack of innovation" which led to a loss of content creators.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"TikTok, Google, Netflix, Spotfiy - having a strong distribution capability is key to achieving market leading position," Zhou said, also alluding to non-UGC platforms like Netflix. "They all share one advantage - a powerful distribution system with algorithmic recommendations."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Games are far more complicated to distribute effectively than short videos. In a game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eggy Party</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, players will need to play a map for at least 5 minutes in order to "truly experience a map," according to Zhou . Short videos only take a matter of seconds for a user to understand what they are watching, and then decide if they want to continue watching for the full duration of the video. Despite the difference, the main factors in the success of a UGC platform are similar.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Although the product forms are different, the core always lies in the interaction and connection between users and the platform," Zhou said.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/cyberpunk-2077-developer-cd-projekt-taps-scopely-to-develop-franchise-spin-off" target="_self" data-discover="true">Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt taps Scopely to develop franchise spin-off</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zhou went into detail about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eggy Party's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> "digital DNA bank," which helped the platform create a portrait of players in "1000 dimensions." These portraits include thousands of tags that identify personal attributes of players, including what sort of content they enjoyed in the past and what they might enjoy in the future. Tags included a player wanting more challenging maps, multiplayer experiences, and genre-specific maps like puzzles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Outside a recommendation system, Zhou emphasized the importance of first impressions during discovery. The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eggy Party</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> user interface includes titles, cover images, and statistical data highlighting the number of players and likes a map has at a moment's glance. Players need to get an idea of what a map is and how popular it is in seconds, making those first few moments in front a player crucial for success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"High rated maps receive more exposure opportunities," Zhou said, talking about how player interaction is also important for discovery.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zhou also covered some mistakes the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eggy Party</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> recommendation system made, including recommending what he called a "female-oriented dress up" map to male college students, which led to dissatisfaction for both the players and the creator.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/activision-user-research-workers-are-unionizing-to-create-an-industry-that-works-for-them-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Activision user research workers are unionizing 'to create an industry that works for them'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Missteps like that can prevent creators from building more experiences for other players and can dissuade players from using a games' built in recommendation systems, both problems that could harm the overall health and reputation of a UGC platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eggy Party's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> recommendation system can also lead to rapid success. Zhou pointed out another use case where a creator had a critically low player count on their maps, but integration within the system led players who enjoyed similar maps to this specific user. It led to a huge uptick in interactions with players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">NetEase has been running an incentive program that rewards players who create popular with cash prizes, which has brought in a large number of creators to their UGC environment. Zhou didn't bring this up during the talk, but did mention the importance of not falling into the trap of the "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect">Matthew Effect</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">," which refers to certain users gaining an advantage over others, leading to a wider gap between those who have resources and those who do not.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That result has become common on some UGC platforms, where some users have the advantage of more time in the space, publisher favoritism, monetary resources, or something else giving them a leg up on the competition. Creating a system that can bypass any of those advantages and lead players to maps they would enjoy naturally is a key to success.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/schedule-1-is-what-would-happen-if-breaking-bad-was-stardew-valley.1149807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/schedule-1-game-early-access-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Politically, I am very much in favor of decriminalizing weed, but on a personal level, I absolutely can’t stand it. I feel bad about this–who hates weed?!--but after years of trying not to feel like the world’s biggest dork, I’ve learned to just quietly slip away when people are using it. Given this, recent early access drug-dealing game <em>Schedule 1</em> should in no way be my thing, but somehow I’ve been playing the hell out of it.&nbsp;</p><p>I hadn’t heard of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Schedule 1</em></a> until Aftermath pal Javy Gwaltney <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jgwalt.bsky.social/post/3llkbykvm3c2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned it on Bluesky</a> over the weekend, but it rocketed to Steam’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top seller</a> slot as of this writing and has reportedly been <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/simoncarless_valve-has-just-given-solo-indie-megahit-schedule-activity-7310837300601442305-AvHb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wildly successful</a> for its solo developer. It’s a simple-looking, cartoonish game where you play as a small-time drug dealer who flees your desert town for a modestly-sized city, where you have to rebuild your supply chain and customer base from scratch, steadily crafting a bigger and bigger empire while evading cops and rival dealers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Schedule I Release Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dUxiQ1qN0rg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Lest this sound like <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> or similar flashy, high-octane games, <em>Schedule 1</em> is scratching my <a href="https://aftermath.site/long-dark-survival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survival game</a> itch far more than any desire for shootouts and action. A day in my game is full of wonderfully tedious chores: skateboard over to the hardware store to buy some more soil and baggies, head across town to pick up some different weed seeds from a dead drop, trek all the way back to my shitty apartment above a Chinese restaurant with my haul. Growing weed requires pouring soil, planting seeds, and watering them, all with the need to slice the tops off bags and pop the lids off containers and make sure to throw all that stuff away in the trash when you’re done. Weed needs to be harvested and then packaged by hand, in a wonderfully physical assembly line of placing nuggets in bags and sealing them up. The game is on a day/night cycle that often feels way too short for all the things you need to get done, though time stops at 4am until you go to sleep, in effect pausing the clock to let you catch up on things.&nbsp;</p><p>At first, you deliver your goods by yourself: accepting orders on your phone, arranging a meeting time, and even haggling on price, amount, or strain. Buyers have connections to others; by strengthening your relationships with customers and handing out free samples to new ones, you slowly build a customer base that can connect you to new suppliers. It can also connect you to dealers, who can sell drugs for you–once you manually deliver the product, decide which specific customers they can sell to, and then remember to come back to top them up and collect your money. Later, you can hire workers to do some of your chores and buy machines that can automate the process, all of which will require more space and money as you work your way toward building a grand operation.</p><p>In the early hours I’ve played solo, <em>Schedule 1</em> is a decidedly <em>unsexy</em> game. (It also has co-op, though I haven’t checked that out yet.) Games like this often want to be about becoming untouchably powerful, but my most memorable experiences so far have been times I’ve had to escape the cops like any small-time hood. While the trailer suggests car chases and shootouts, I’ve mostly faced challenges by fleeing. Cops patrol the streets and institute a nightly curfew, which I get around by sneaking through alleys and clambering through ditches. In the game’s intro area, the cops wanted to frisk me; thinking fast, I ran behind a dumpster and smoked all my weed so they wouldn’t find it, only to learn you can hide it on your person in a clever little mini-game. In another instance, the cops busted me when I brilliantly made a drug deal right in front of them; I fled into a taco shop and hid under a booth until they stopped looking. There are cars and guns to buy, but I kind of like the idea of seeing how small I can keep things.</p><p>This desire extends to the kinds of drugs the game lets you make, too. So far, I’ve mixed weed with mouthwash and painkillers to make new strains; on the horizon is the ability to make harder drugs like meth and cocaine, but I feel uncomfortable with that idea. I’m curious to see if the game will let me avoid it; I might not <em>like</em> weed, but at least it generally isn’t hurting anyone. I like the idea of playing the game like a regular person, just trying to get by and survive the (<a href="https://aftermath.site/starting-a-website-has-taught-me-too-much-about-myself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relatable</a>) challenges of scaling a business, rather than some kingpin introducing dangerous drugs into my new community.</p><p><em>Schedule 1</em> is obviously a game about drugs, but I appreciate how low-key it is about them so far. Characters have bloodshot stoner eyes, but I haven’t encountered any over-the-top drugs jokes or other stuff I’d find too off-putting. I feel like I could be <a href="https://aftermath.site/wanderstop-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">running almost any kind of business</a> and a lot of the game would play the same, minus all the running from the cops. I’m surprised to find myself liking it so much, and I think that’s down to all its mundane moving parts and unexpectedly soothing chores. (I love the idea of being a drug dealer who spends a chunk of his day picking up street litter; you can exchange your trash for money, which is a great way to help finance your operations.) The early access <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/schedule-1-updates-roadmap-with-map-expansion-fishing-cartel-interactions-3170476/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a> sounds full of cool stuff to look forward to, including more side activities that will hopefully keep me from losing all my money in the game’s casino in my rare downtime.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-severance-season-two-review"><h3>Severance Season Two Stuck The Landing</h3></a><p>With big tech trying to automate everything, Severance just keeps feeling more and more relevant</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/best-split-keyboards-diy-qmk-zmk-corne"><h3>Split Keyboards Are Superior And The Reason I’m The Writer I Am Today</h3></a><p>Split keyboards are the best, but no company offered one that satisfied me completely.

		<p>Frogwares has announced that it is releasing The Sinking City Remastered, with owners of the original release for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S getting this as a free upgrade. The Sinking City Remastered sees the original game being ported to Unreal Engine 5, joining The Sinking City 2 on that platform. While a trailer or gameplay footage is not yet available, Frogwares has released screenshots of The Sinking City Remastered.</p>

		
		

<p>In other The Sinking City 2 news, Frogwares has opened up submissions for people to have their voices in the game, becoming part of a choir that praises the Eldritch god Yog-Sothoth. To enter, people just need to submit a voice recording saying the word “Yes”, in whatever style they wish. A form will need to be filled out along with an upload of the submission, and that can all be done <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tally.so/r/wQOPMY&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1743346118601063&amp;usg=AOvVaw13x8tRr9K5rXe2MkOnnojn">at this link</a>. Frogwares will then choose 100 submissions at random to be in the game, and of of those 100 will get The Sinking City 2 Collector’s Edition.</p>


<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/27/the-sinking-city-review/">The Sinking City Review</a></h2>
<p>In our The Sinking City review, Steve said,<em> “The Sinking City promises a nightmarish journey through a Lovecraftian townscape filled with monsters and threatening cults, but too often falls into a loop of forced combat and resource hunting. The investigative parts are excellent, and this is probably the best Lovecrat adaptation since Call of Cthulu: Dark Corners of the Earth, but it still never really lives up to its potential. Close, but no Shoggoth.”</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-preview-%E2%80%93-doom-unlike-any-other.1149795/</guid>

			<p>Few people predicted the triumphant return of DOOM in 2016. Bethesda was unwilling to have games reviewed before launch. The overwhelming feeling was that the game wouldn't be as good as they had hoped from DOOM, with the prior multiplayer beta underwhelming players. Needless to say, DOOM was great, DOOM Eternal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-eternal-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which I reviewed</a>, was also great, and now we have DOOM: The Dark Ages.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Or, at least, we will have DOOM: The Dark Ages. I recently got hands-on experience with the first level of the game and the first portion of the second. Then, parts of two later levels, before an even later - open - level, for a chunk of time. Essentially, ID Software and Bethesda wanted me and others at the event in Frankfurt to have a feel for what the game will offer and its variety.</p>
<p>Now, I'm working on memory here, but something that I wasn't a massive fan of in DOOM Eternal, in retrospect, was that it had gone quite platform-heavy in some areas. Not enough that I expected an Italian plumber to show up, but maybe a Gecko dressed like a spy. Somebody at ID Software must have agreed because this has been toned back significantly, though the verticality isn't lost from what I have seen here.</p>
<p>No, the first level I could play feels like DOOM as we know it. The maps are large; you have several secrets to find if you choose to, and little bits of exploration may also net you extra health and armour. This is in between moving from one arena, where you kill hordes of enemies, to the corridors in between until you reach the next arena. So far, so DOOM. It's what you would expect, too, and my initial impression is that it brings the tight combat from DOOM Eternal to the tighter design of DOOM 2016.</p>

<p>That will be until you explore some of the newer things in DOOM: The Dark Ages. So, to put it quite simply, I could play parts of, not all, two different levels. You are essentially riding a DOOM Guy Gundam in the first of these two. The second, you get to fly a dragon with mecha wings and guns. Now, DOOMdam, as I will now call it, feels similar enough to other levels. It's just that you're now a big machine. You get to punch the hell out of Titans, sometimes shoot them, and there is a sense of scale due to the surrounding combat. I don't know how impactful it will feel over time, but it offered something different while still feeling like the DOOM we know.</p>
<p>The dragon, however, I'm not entirely as sold on. Now, when I get more time with it, I could be blown out of the water - it needs to be remembered that I played part of a level. The initial rush of zooming out of a cave system on the back of a dragon is pretty impressive. Particularly so, when you see the level of devastation happening, you will be there, fighting off giant hell-ships, and the sense of scale is awe-inspiring, even at first glance.</p>
<p>This isn't a case of more artificial corridors moving from ship to ship. You will fly around, and there are extra things to defeat and paths to find before you weaken a ship's defences enough to land on it and deal the finishing blow. Of course, the last part is done on foot, and you go around areas bigger than just the ship as it has crashed into the city below. All of that was good. I wasn't enthralled by the combat on the dragon itself, if only because, once locked on, the controls felt a little too rigid. It's an area I am looking forward to exploring more.</p>

<p>Understandably, ID Software knew DOOM: The Dark Ages would shine in a later area they had us play, giving us an hour to do what we wanted. This massive battlefield was far more open than what you generally get in a DOOM title. Some trappings remained, in that you have arenas to encounter and loads of secrets to find via some exploration, but it never felt constrained by the usual corridors you come to expect. While still somewhat driven, it offered a bit of an open feel, where you could maybe find yourself at odds in one area, decide to tackle somewhere else and rearm before coming back.</p>
<p>Combine this more open approach with the excellent fast-paced combat from DOOM Eternal, where you will be finishing off enemies to have extra life and ammo fall out of their bodies, combos and well-timed attacks being rewarded with more to keep you going, and you have a recipe for greatness. It's even better to use new weapons, like the shield saw, in an enjoyable combination of attacks that makes you feel like the DOOM Slayer in overdrive.</p>
<p>I am also intrigued by the narrative of DOOM: The Dark Ages. This is an entirely single-player-focused title, and I am all on board with that. I have zero interest in multiplayer; anybody who knows me knows that my time on this planet has been one of ensuring humans keep as far away from my fun as possible. This focus on single-player also means that resources haven't been diverted, and there's no need to start balancing guns, melee weapons, or any other nonsense about how they work around other people. No, this is about the DOOM Slayer, his time before DOOM, and the medieval-ish world he came from.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages will be released on May 13th, 2025, if you buy the premium edition, or on May 15th if you don't. Needless to say, after the resounding success of both DOOM 2016 and DOOM Eternal, and what was a very fun time I had with the game in Frankfurt, I'm looking forward to DOOM: The Dark Ages.</p>

Also it features an adorable black mage named Vivi. </p><p>In the past, <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> producer Naoki Yoshida has been coy about the rumors. “Of course, I do know there are requests for<em> Final Fantasy IX</em> to be made, but when you think about <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>, it’s a game with huge volume,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/yoshi-p-thinks-a-final-fantasy-9-remake-would-take-more-than-one-game&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yoshi-p-thinks-a-final-fantasy-9-remake-would-take-more-than-one-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said last fall</a></span>, appearing to pour cold water on the rumors. “When you think about all of that volume, I wonder if it’s possible to remake that as a single title. It’s a difficult one. It is a tough question.”</p><p>July 7 will be exactly 25 years since the game shipped and Square Enix hints that fans should expect to hear more announcements leading up to it. Maybe a sneak peek of the game itself at an upcoming PlayStation or Summer Game Fest showcase will be one of them.

                <p>The slogan “Stand and Fight” has been plastered all over Doom: The Dark Ages marketing: a catchphrase that feels at odds with the modern Doom series. Doom 2016 was applauded for its fast gameplay and Doom: Eternal took that one step further with the Meat Hook that let you whip around the battlefield at breakneck speeds. The movement--for many--is what makes Doom, Doom. So to see Doom: The Dark Ages’ encourage players to hold their ground and fight seemed antithetical to that finely tuned formula. At least, that’s what I thought. After three hours of hands-on time with id Software’s next shooter, it seems like Doom: The Dark Ages has found a hypnotic balance between its iconic fast-paced gameplay and the blow-for-blow combat that Dark Ages is bringing to the mix.</p><p dir="ltr">Doom: The Dark Ages is a prequel to Doom 2016. The forces of hell are invading a realm heavily inspired by the medieval era, and the Doom Slayer is summoned to do what he does best: Rip and tear through demons. Although this may sound like standard fare for a Doom game, The Dark Ages appears to be taking its story a bit more seriously. It’s still a campy, somewhat self-aware, bloodsoaked romp through demon guts, but the team wanted to use the fantasy setting to its full potential. According to game director Hugo Martin, “When you think of fantasy, and Lord of the Rings, you think huge… There’s a grandness, an epicness to fantasy that people expect.” Despite the shift to fantasy, some of Doom: The Dark Ages’ biggest narrative inspirations for its story were action films like Roadhouse, Die Hard, and First Blood, when it comes to keeping the story engaging throughout its runtime.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467012-screenshots_round_2_5logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467012" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467012-screenshots_round_2_5logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467012"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467012-screenshots_round_2_5logo.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">While I loved Doom 2016’s minimal approach to storytelling, I’m curious to see what id Software does with Dark Age’s setting. The arenas, enemies, characters, and weapons have all received a medieval makeover that fits the setting and series perfectly. Gothic castles loom over battlefields, enemies use a mix of medieval weaponry and sci-fi firearms, characters are donned in plated armor, and macabre weapons like the Pulverizer grind up skulls and fire out deadly bone shards. It’s a match made in heaven, or rather, hell. That said, Doom: Eternal’s greater emphasis on story felt superfluous. There were some clever callbacks to previous games and fun moments, but when it comes to Doom, all I want to do is shoot, shred, and eviscerate demons. Thankfully, The Dark Ages has plenty of that.</p><p dir="ltr">As with previous Doom games, the weapons are the star of the show. There are some returning firearms like the iconic Super Shotgun, but The Dark Ages brings a slew of new guns that fit neatly into the gothic setting. The aforementioned Pulverizer fires out a horizontal spread of skull bits that can shred multiple demons at close range, the Impaler fires out rune-adorned rail spikes that deal high damage at long range, and--my personal favorite--the Chainshot launches a retracting cannonball that pulverizes demons at close range. Of course, each weapon comes with a handful of upgrades and modifications that can alter their characteristics. Doom’s weapons have always been larger than life, but The Dark Ages setting has allowed id Software to really push the boundaries of what a weapon in Doom can be. “[They’re] brutal. […] The Rail Spike, the Skull Crusher. They’re all supposed to be like little torture devices you’re holding,” Martin told me.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467013-screenshots_round_2_4logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467013" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467013-screenshots_round_2_4logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467013"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467013-screenshots_round_2_4logo.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Doom: The Dark Ages biggest shake-up to the gameplay is the Shield Saw. During combat, you can block and parry attacks with it, bash enemies, and throw it around the battlefield. It’s most useful purpose--at least for my playstyle--was the dash. By holding your up shield, you can lock onto an enemy and rush them down in one swift motion. While it doesn’t offer the same verticality as the Meat Hook, it’s far more controlled. Your inertia and momentum aren’t working against you when you rush down an enemy. Instead, you speed across the battlefield and deliver a satisfying shield bash to whatever poor demon the Doom Slayer sets his sights on.</p><p dir="ltr">While I didn’t use the Shield Saw’s block all that much, the parry is paramount. When an enemy or projectile glows green, a well-timed block will stun the demon or send the projectile right back. It’s a fairly straightforward mechanic that fits in surprisingly well with Doom’s gameplay loop. You can’t parry every move so you’re still spending most of your time running and gunning, but when I did see that green glow, I found myself subconsciously repositioning in hopes of exploiting it. It may seem like a simple addition, but the parry does what any good parry system does: It adds more risks for more rewards. I would regularly put myself in harm's way to rush down enemies and projectiles as they started to glow green just to hit the parry.</p><p dir="ltr">The Shield Saw feels like a natural extension to the Doom Slayer’s kit, but it isn’t just for bludgeoning unfortunate demons. A lot of Doom: The Dark Ages’ puzzles and platforming segments are built around the Shield Saw. Like Kratos’s axe in God of War (2018), the shield can be used to activate switches, knock down weak walls, and launch the Doom Slayer up to hard to reach areas. While the puzzles in the Doom games rarely offer more than a brief change of pace, the Shield Saw brings just enough to the table to keep the moments interesting.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467014-screenshots_round_2_3logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467014" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467014-screenshots_round_2_3logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467014"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467014-screenshots_round_2_3logo.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Shield Saw goes hand-in-hand with Doom: The Dark Ages’ new melee weapons. The chainsaw from Doom 2016 and Eternal has been replaced by a handful of blunt weapons and new mechanics. These weapons require a “charge” in order to use them, and--at least in the beginning--can hold up to three charges. You can find pickups on the battlefield or you can parry an attack to charge your weapon. Unlike the chainsaw, the further along in the preview I got, the rarer these pickups were. As a result, I mostly relied on parries to refill my melee charges. This loop fits seamlessly into the “stand and fight” mantra because when you’re facing down a Tyrant, the most efficient way to kill it is to get in its face, parry its attacks, and follow up with a powerful melee attack. Of course, you can still melee enemies without a charge, but it’s fairly ineffective against anything other than the imps and fodder demons.</p><p dir="ltr">Doom: The Dark Ages brings a lot of fresh ideas to its combat loop, and in order to let players experiment with all these new weapons, mechanics, and strategies, id Software has created some of its largest arenas to date. The final level I played in my preview, titled Siege, took place on a wide-open battlefield that consisted of multiple objectives that could be completed in any order. This approach to level design is nothing unique, but it’s a first for the modern Doom games. While I still think I prefer the more linear level design when it comes to Doom, this section was a nice change of pace and gave me ample opportunities to test out some of the new mechanics with some unique encounters. One of these optional scenarios had me eliminate a VIP demon. However, in order to damage the special demon, I needed to lower its morale by killing dozens of other demons. I died a handful times, but with each new attempt I was able to try out different approaches in a more free-form and open-ended way than we saw in Doom 2016 or Eternal.</p><p dir="ltr">These large, open-ended battlefields complement the “epicness” Martin mentioned, but another component of The Dark Ages’ grand scale are the Dragon and Atlan mech missions. While neither of the segments I played had the mechanical depth of Doom’s grounded combat, they did offer a different perspective on The Dark Ages' world. I soared over a sprawling city as an aerial assault took place, occasionally dismounting my dragon to decommission Hell Carrier dropships from the inside. In the Atlan mech, I was going toe-to-toe with some of Doom’s most formidable demons that are typically saved for boss fights.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467015-screenshots_round_2_2logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467015" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467015-screenshots_round_2_2logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467015"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467015-screenshots_round_2_2logo.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The aerial and mech combat are built around well-timed dodges. Like on foot, enemy attacks that glow green are your tell. Dodging a green attack slows down time and lets you strike back with a deadly attack of your own. The Atlan feels great to pilot. Each step satisfyingly crushes fodder demons and levels buildings. Meanwhile, its weighty punches and hooks can shatter demon bones and pop their skulls into a mess of blood and gore. Unfortunately, as of now, aerial combat seems to be the weakest link. Speeding through tunnels and over cities feels great, but the second you lock onto an enemy, all that speed comes to an abrupt halt as you awkwardly maneuver around the space directly in front of the locked-on enemy holding down the attack button. Martin made it clear that the team was still fine-tuning the aerial combat and will continue to up until launch. Hopefully a little extra polish is all the dragon combat needs.</p><p dir="ltr">According to executive producer and game director Marty Stratton, “With each game we’ve done more. We get better at what we’re doing. The stories we’re telling have gotten bigger, and [Doom: The Dark Ages] feels like the realization of the last 10 years and the last two games.” After wrapping up my demo, it feels like The Dark Ages might be the most comprehensive Doom game to date. Id Software is bringing a lot of new mechanics and ideas to the series, while maintaining its hypnotic flow state. It’s hard to say if they’ll be able to keep that momentum as new ideas and mechanics are introduced, but it’s made an excellent first impression. Doom: The Dark Ages comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox, and PC on May 13, 2025.</p>

                <p>Actor Jason Momoa stars in the upcoming A Minecraft Movie, which is based on the hugely popular video game.

He's 16 and doesn't have a phone," when asked if his children play video games. "We're different, dude. Because when he's 18 he's gonna have a phone and it'll be out of the house and he can explore the world after that."</p><p>Why no phones or video games? "Because I just want them to use their creativity in a different way. So, we do other things. These [phones] are new to the world. Everyone was doing just fine [before phones]. We watch movies together, and that's beautiful."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/DEADLINE/status/1906509819684512095" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">‘A Minecraft Movie’ star Jason Momoa on why he doesn’t let his kids play video games or have phones: “We’re different dude.

He said, "My mother, when I was growing up, wouldn't let me play video games. She was like, 'Get outside, climb a tree, go skateboard.' I wasn't allowed to have video games."</p><p>Momoa's A Minecraft Movie co-star, Jack Black, is quite a different case.

But Boyter told Momoa that his lack of experience with the game is exactly why he wanted Momoa to be in the movie. "Because you're not supposed to know shit about it," Momoa said he recalled Boyter telling him.</p><p>A Minecraft Movie releases in theaters on April 4. It's directed by Napoleon Dynamite's Jared Hess and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-a-minecraft-movie-could-compare-to-other-video-game-films-at-the-box-office/1100-6530115/" data-ref-id="1100-6530115">expected to make around $60 million in the US for its opening weekend. </a></p>

            <p>If you cast your minds back to last year, you may recall <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2024s-best-april-fools-day-jokes-includes-sonic-cyberpunk-elden-ring">Pocketpair releasing a trailer for a dating sim spin-off called "Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~"</a>. This was all part of some good ol' fashioned April Fools Day fun… or was it?</p>
<p>Earlier today, the developer released another trailer for Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~, and I have to say, it seems to be the real deal, complete with a sales page and all.</p>

<p>"You, the protagonist, enrol as a transfer student in the prestigious Palagos Private Academy," reads the official blurb on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3620480/Palworld_More_Than_Just_Pals/">game's Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>"You will meet unique friends (pals) and enjoy school life through friendship and romance. It's up to you whether you stay friends with the pals, develop romantic relationships with them, or even dismember and eat them."</p>
<p>I reached out to Pocketpair community manager John "Bucky" Buckley, and he assured me that if I covered today's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> trailer I would not get egg on my face. So, here I am covering it.</p>
<p>Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~ doesn't have a release date as yet, although Bucky told me it won't be tomorrow.</p>
<p>So, will you be snuggling up to Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~ on its release?</p>

</p><p>Elsewhere in the news, Bucky previously revealed the Palworld team would have happily seen its monster-catching survival game on the OG Switch, but due to how "beefy" Palworld is, it wasn't able to find a home on Nintendo's console.</p>

            <p>A previously announced RoboCop VR title has been kiboshed after it transpired that the game wasn't officially licensed before its reveal.</p>
<p>RoboCop: Streets of Anarchy, as it was known, was a VR game based on the sci-fi film which <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/robocop-streets-of-anarchy-vr-quest-3-pc/">first made the rounds earlier this month</a>, when it appeared on developer Coffee Moth Games' website.</p>
<p>At this time, the game was said to be being created in partnership with Amazon-MGM and would promise an "original narrative and complex storylines interwoven with bombastic action".</p>

<p>However, fast forward a couple of weeks, and those promises are going to have to be left unfulfilled, as it turns out RoboCop: Streets of Anarchy wasn't actually officially licensed before its reveal.</p>
<p>An Amazon MGM representative told <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/robocop-streets-of-anarchy-not-officially-licenced/">UploadVR</a> the company never actually entered into any agreement with Coffee Moth Games. "Furthermore, Amazon MGM advised that RoboCop isn't officially licensed with that studio, and the official website page for Streets of Anarchy has since been removed," UploadVR continued.</p>
<p>The publication had previously been in contact with Coffee Moth Games, and a representative from the studio revealed they're actually an outsourcing company with no direct relationship to Amazon MGM. However, "the company responsible for contracting the rights from Amazon MGM contacted us for the game's development," the representative said.</p> <div>

As <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-2-gets-first-gameplay-trailer-smashes-crowdfunding-goal-in-less-than-a-day">hugely successful crowdfunding campaign</a> nears its conclusion, Ukrainian developer Frogwares has announced a fresh bit of business for its Lovecraft-inspired open-world detective series: the original game is being remastered in Unreal Engine 5.
</p>
<p>
Frogwares' first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city">The Sinking City</a> instalment released in 2019, telling the story of private investigator Charles Reed as he travelled to the flooded city of Oakmont, Massachusetts, in search of a way to quell his hellish visions. As you might expect, cosmic horrors ensued.
</p>
<p>
Six years on and Frogwares' newly announced The Sinking City remaster will take the Unreal Engine 4 original and shift it to Unreal Engine 5, promising an "upgraded visual experience alongside some requested quality-of-life features". It will, for instance, be fully relit in the new engine, with locations gaining "additional levels of detail and objects". There's also a new Photo Mode, 4K textures, improved reflections, and support for DLSS, FSR and TSR upscaling.

The Sinking City Remastered (as it's officially known) doesn't have a release date yet, but it'll be available for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC when it does arrive. Additionally, all owners of the original can upgrade to the new version for free. Comparions shots between the 2019 original and upcoming remaster can be found below.

And that's not all; fans are being invited to lend their vocal talents to the remaster by <a href="https://tally.so/r/wQOPMY">submitting a voice recording saying "yes"</a> in whatever manner they choose. 100 randomly selected entries will be transformed into a chanting choir - one with a particular fondness for Yog-Sothoth - and will see their names featured in the credits.

<p>
As for The Sinking City 2, it's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2?ref=checkout_rewards_page">crowdfunding campaign</a> is set to draw to a close this Friday, 4th April. At the time of writing, it's sailed past its original £83K pledge target, raising over £347K. Frogwares has said the survival horror sequel will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-2-will-pivot-to-a-horror-focus">shift away from the investigation focus of its predecessor</a>, with combat and exploration said to be the core mechanics this time around.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-dating-sim-might-be-an-april-fools-joke.1149750/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-dating-sim-announced-again<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair has seemingly announced a dating sim spinoff by the name of&nbsp;<em>More than Just Pals</em>, but there's reason to believe it might not be a serious prospect.</p>

<p>The game was revealed via <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1906687045130653704" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on X earlier today, in which Pocketpair calls the game "a <i>Palworld&nbsp;</i>school romance VN (visual novel)" and invites players to wishlist it via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3620480/Palworld_More_Than_Just_Pals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">brand new Steam page</a>.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time&nbsp;<em>More than Just Pals&nbsp;</em>has appeared, though. The first announcement for the game came <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/april-fools-day-2024-gaming-roundup" rel="nofollow">on April Fools' Day last year</a>, at which point Pocketpair said it would launch on the same day the following year (i.e. tomorrow).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-dating-sim-lovander.jpg?itok=a_-BkLAL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-dating-sim-lovander.jpg?itok=pVaYh1Zt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I don't think I want to do that, Lovander.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the fact that the game was already announced as part of Pocketpair's April Fools' japery last year doesn't necessarily mean it isn't real this time around, but I think it's fair to take the project with a very large pinch of salt, at any rate.</p>

<p>Then again, back then, I wrote that Pocketpair had willed the project into genuine existence by virtue of creating it as a joke, and that may well be what's happened. If it is, well, we might be beyond help this time around.</p>

<p>Assuming&nbsp;<em>Palworld: More than Just Pals&nbsp;</em>is real, you'll be attending the Palagos Private Academy, where you'll meet a number of romanceable Pals. You can "stay friends with the Pals, develop romantic relationships with them, or even dismember and eat them".</p>

<p>It rather looks like&nbsp;<em>More than Just Pals&nbsp;</em>is taking a more&nbsp;<em>Hatoful Boyfriend</em>-style approach to dating sims rather than the conventional path; this feels rather like a parody effort to me.</p>




<p>Pocketpair also says it's giving away a Lovander body pillow to celebrate the new announcement of&nbsp;<em>Palworld: More than Just Pals</em>. If you want to enter the competition (again, assuming it's real), <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1906688298925633793" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">you can do so on X</a>.</p>

You have a power washer, and you clean the dirt off an ever-more elaborate series of settings. Things begin with relatively simple targets, like a motorbike or a bus, but later you’ll be tackling vast, three-storey treehouse networks, or the outside of Lara Croft’s mansion. Each level’s features are invisibly divided into hundreds of distinct sections, such as a fence panel or a novelty plastic penguin, and each gives a (mostly) satisfying “Ding!” when it’s clean. With various nozzles and soaps, you methodically spray away the dirt, and that’s it. And it’s enough. (There’s also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-did-no-one-tell-me-powerwash-sim-has-actual-lore&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-did-no-one-tell-me-powerwash-sim-has-actual-lore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the most wonderfully batshit crazy storyline going on</a></span>, which is far too easy to miss.)</p><p>For as long as I’ve been playing <em>PowerWash Simulator</em>, there have been two aspects that have enormously nagged at me, and I believe represent two serious problems with the game. The first occurs when you’re left searching an entire adventure playground for a single pixel of dirt on a microscopic section of a fence before you can finish the level. The second is the exact opposite, when you’re merrily cleaning a large section of dirty wall or floor and it all suddenly pings clean on its own. Each is infuriating, and they’re the main things I’m desperately hoping a sequel will address. However, they’re just top of a list of requests I have for a superior game. And yet, when I watch the trailer for <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, I’m deeply worried none of them will be met.</p><p>The main reason is because...well, it looks like the first game. The washer gun is a different shape to any of the many variants currently available, but after that? It <em>might</em> be a graphical upgrade, but the first game already looks great, and it’s not exactly the sort of thing where shadow fidelity plays an important role. When I watch that trailer and it <em>finally</em> moves past being about garden gnomes (which while present in the first game, really weren’t a key thing in it, and seem the oddest, most generic thing to bank on as a gimmick here), it looks like it could be for yet another DLC pack for <em>PWS1</em>. And, while I would be very happy to live in the universe where that’s what keeps happening, it isn’t the significant shift I’m really hoping for. That I’m still hoping for.</p><figure id="" data-id="18af7e79560a07cca43433fddfb1187a" data-recommend-id="image://18af7e79560a07cca43433fddfb1187a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cleaning a slide on the deck of a cruise ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cleaning a slide on the deck of a cruise ship." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FuturLab</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="18af7e79560a07cca43433fddfb1187a" data-recommend-id="image://18af7e79560a07cca43433fddfb1187a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cleaning a slide on the deck of a cruise ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I reckon my two main complaints might have the same cause. I suspect (and I’m guessing) that it’s a percentage game. When you’ve cleaned up, say, 99.5 percent of a section’s dirt, the game considers it done enough to ding. And on the majority of features, that works fine. But when something is especially tiny, or especially large, that remaining 0.5 percent can be either an incredibly tiny, or an incredibly large, amount of remaining dirt. Hence it being impossibly fussy, requiring you to hunt tirelessly to find it, or the inverse, so deeply unsatisfying as to be magically cleaned before you were done. That certainly makes sense as a time-saving development device, but I’m desperately hoping a better solution is found for <em>PWS2</em>. Anyone who’s played the game will recognize these issues—it would be so, <em>so</em> disappointing to see this repeated.</p><p>But there are other things I’m always finding myself pondering as I play, and they primarily focus on the reality of power-washing. Now, I’ve no shame left to preserve, so I’m just going to tell you one of my current YouTube obsessions. In between watching <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@SMN&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@SMN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some More News</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@BigJoel/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@BigJoel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Joel</a></span>, I love to watch real-life people doing real-life pressure washing. </p><p>I guess you’ll get it or you won’t, but there’s something so incredibly rewarding about watching a dirty thing get clean, about seeing years of grime and moss getting blasted away so rapidly, and the results being so dramatic. But the more of this I see, the more convinced I am that <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> needs water physics.</p><p>I want drips. I want channels of water to cut into the dirt as it falls down the side of objects. I want spraying the ground to spray up dirt onto the sides of nearby furniture. I want to be able to see a river of water running away from my target and into a nearby drain. Because, honestly (and again, re-read that first paragraph if you think I’m slipping into being a hater), <em>PowerWash Simulator</em> is not a power-washing simulator, but a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Lawnmower_Simulator&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Lawnmower_Simulator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lawnmower sim</a></span>.</p><p>You cut perfect strips into the dirt like a mower cutting a path in the grass. As you sweep the green nozzle, rotated vertically, left and right, you’re mowing stripes into a lawn. And watching that trailer, that raccoon’s face that gets blasted clean is being yet another front yard.</p><p>Sure, I know the counter-argument. The whole point of <em>PWS</em> is to be a relaxing, therapeutic play. It’s about that methodical process, and a part of that is the simplicity of cutting through the dirt. But here’s my counter-counter argument: that game exists! It’s been out for nearly three years. You can (and should) go play it right now. And if you finished it, seriously, go back to it. Not only are there now cheap DLC packs adding huge new levels based on the unlikeliest of licenses (<em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, <em>Shrek</em>, <em>Back to the Future</em>, <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>...), but also piles of new, free levels in the “seasonal updates.” There’s a Halloween-themed witch’s place, and an elaborate ice rink with polar bear and penguin decor (and yes, the story <em>does</em> address this faux pas), and much more, and it’s all as good as or better than the main game.</p><figure id="" data-id="37b8a78621f9f192a40cf9cea5d3f1cd" data-recommend-id="image://37b8a78621f9f192a40cf9cea5d3f1cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cleaning an orange submarine from above." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cleaning an orange submarine from above." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FuturLab</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="37b8a78621f9f192a40cf9cea5d3f1cd" data-recommend-id="image://37b8a78621f9f192a40cf9cea5d3f1cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cleaning an orange submarine from above." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Given this, and given the possibility of continually adding new levels and content to the first game, doesn’t that make room for the sequel to be more experimental? Because otherwise, other than promising a “home base” and some slightly soapier soap, what is it going to add?</p><p>I wanna blast some moss! I want to use gravity when washing; give me the realistic advantages that come with cleaning top to bottom. I want to see the dirt get wet and run, not just get wiped away like in an infomercial. Heck, I’d love a little business mode, a more fleshed out version of getting hired for jobs, where I’m able to gradually improve my equipment in a much more subtle way than the current game’s systems, which essentially equate to levelling up, allow for.</p><p>Obviously I’ll get what I’m given. And if it ends up being more of the same but soapier, I’ll be right there for it. Honestly, the only thing that’d actually piss me off is if I’m still searching for that one percent of a roof bracket that I’ve missed on a twenty-bedroom manor house, or watching all the dirt I was looking forward to cleaning pinging itself away. That sucks, that needs fixing. The rest is cherries. Gloopy, dripping, gravity-dragged cherry juice, waiting for someone to clean it up.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
