<p>We've grown used to the <strong>Disgaea</strong> series' tried-and-tested tactical gameplay on Nintendo consoles over the last ~20 years, but the next game promises something a little different. In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disgaea-mayhem">Disgaea Mayhem</a>, it's all about the action.</p>
<p>NIS America has today announced that this action RPG spin-off (which launched in Japan as '<strong>Kyouran Makaism</strong>' last month) will be launching in the West on Switch 1 &amp; 2 at some point this summer.</p>
<p>The headline feature that we need to mention here is, yes, Mayhem lets you take <em>direct control</em> of the on-screen action. Using an arsenal of weapons, you'll slash, shoot and explode enemies as you would in any other ARPG — quite the departure from the tactics that we're used to from the series.</p>
<p>There's a touch of something vaguely <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dynasty-warriors-origins">Warriors</a>-esque about the gameplay footage shown in the above reveal trailer, and even though we're not completely sold on the visuals as they stand, we've got to commend the switch-up. And yes, it's officially labelled as a 'spinoff', so don't worry about the core gameplay loop being gone for good.</p>
<p>Here's a brief rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screens from NIS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Magichange into Action</strong>: Take direct control of the combat in this action RPG spinoff of the Disgaea series! Beat down hundreds of enemies with classic Disgaea weapons, including the sword, gun, fist, and axe!<br>
<strong>Grind Up to Get Down</strong>: It wouldn't be Disgaea without the ability to get stronger. Head to the Item World to power up your equipment, reincarnate for higher base stats, or grind out levels to make sure you're at the top of the food chain!<br>
<strong>Satisfy Her Cravings</strong>: It takes a demon to feed a princess! Princess Tichelle loves her flan, and N.A. loves a paycheck. By working together, they can both get what they want! Dessert brings people (and demons) together in this light-hearted tale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Limited Edition physical release is now available to pre-order from the <a href="https://store.nisamerica.com/products/disgaea-mayhem-limited-edition?variant=42797437812784">NIS America online store</a> for <strong>$99.99</strong>. Alongside a boxed copy of the game (Game-Key Card for Switch 2), this release includes a collector's box, artbook, CD soundtrack, acrylic stand and keychain.</p>

<p>We've already had a taste of the Disgaea series on Switch 2 with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disgaea-7-complete">7 Complete</a>, which launched in October 2025. While we found it to be quite the time sink, with most of the biggest additions being tethered to the post-game, we described Complete as "every bit as great [as Vows of the Virtueless] and stands tall as the ultimate, feature-complete iteration of the game" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/disgaea-7-complete">our review</a>.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping an eye out for a more specific Mayhem release date in the coming months, with our fingers crossed that NIS America can keep the Disgaea good times a-flowing.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/resident-evil-requiem-pc-performance-analysis-tuning-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Don't have the PC</a> to play <strong>CAPCOM</strong>'s new <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong> game, but you'd really love to experience it anyway? If you have a solid Internet connection (and live in a supported region of the world), <strong>NVIDIA</strong> can give you the chance through its <strong>GeForce NOW</strong> cloud platform, and they're also bundling the game with new 12-month Ultimate memberships. For the record, a year-long GeForce NOW Ultimate subscription sets you back <strong>$199.99</strong>, but the game itself is <strong>$70</strong>, which you'd be saving if you were planning on buying it anyway.</p>



<p>With GeForce NOW Ultimate, you'd have access to <strong>nearly all of the game's features available to GeForce RTX 50 Series GPU owners</strong>: NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction, and path tracing. The only thing not supported right now on the cloud is the new <strong>DLSS 4.5 second-generation transformer model</strong>, which debuted on local GPUs earlier this year.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of features that the GFN Ultimate membership offers over the Free and Performance tiers:</p>



<ul>
<li>8-hour gaming sessions</li>



<li>Up to 5K resolution</li>



<li>Up to 240 FPS (360 FPS on RTX 5080 servers)</li>



<li>First priority access to the queue</li>



<li>16 vCPU cores 56 GB DRAM</li>



<li>Surround 7.1 audio</li>



<li>DLSS Frame Generation</li>



<li>NVIDIA Reflex</li>



<li>Cloud G-Sync</li>



<li>GeForce RTX 5080-class performance </li>



<li>DLSS Frame Generation (Multi-Frame Generation on RTX 5080 servers)</li>
</ul>



<p>Here's a tease <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-requiem-encyclopedia-evil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from our Resident Evil Requiem review</a>, penned by Nathan Birch:</p>



<p><em>Resident Evil Requiem is the Every-Evil, as Capcom has taken all the things they've done with the franchise over the past decade or so and stitched them together into a towering monster of a survival horror game. Parts of this game are the best, scariest, and most intense this series has ever been, other parts are merely alright, but no part of the game is bad and it's all very distinctly Resident Evil. While it won't be everyone's new favorite, Resident Evil Requiem should hit enough right notes for most fans.</em></p>



<p>Besides CAPCOM's latest entry in the renowned survival horror series, <strong>here's the full list of new GeForce NOW games joining the library this week</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>TCG Card Shop Simulator (New release on Xbox, available on Game Pass Feb. 24)</li>



<li>Blizzard Arcade Collection (New release on Ubisoft Connect, Feb. 25)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-ii-resurrected-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diablo II: Resurrected</a> (New release on Ubisoft Connect, Feb 25)</li>

<li>Yellow letters are correct, but in the wrong position.</li>

<p id="block-cde2c274-bfd9-4d27-a0d9-3ebe6f1ff7f2">Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <p>The team behind 2D side-scroller God of War: Sons of Sparta has shared details on how to access the game's two player co-op content without finishing the main story first.</p>
<p>God of War: Sons of Sparta was announced and shadow dropped earlier this month on PS5. Developed by Mega Cat Studios in partnership with Sony Santa Monica, it is a retro-inspired canon story all about Kratos and his brother Deimos in their youth at training at the Spartan Agoge (which was very "brutal").</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>On its debut earlier this year, many had assumed the game would be able to be played in single player, or as a two-player co-op experience, due to the wording on the PlayStation Store which said the game was suitable for "1-2 players". However, it turned out this was only partly accurate, as the co-op gameplay was actually a roguelike challenge mode which was only accessible <em>after </em>Sons of Sparta's main story had been completed.</p>
<p>This led to a certain amount of disappointment among the God of War community. Comments like "this might be legit false advertising" and "locking co op behind beating the full story is such a weird call" soon <a href="https://x.com/SonySantaMonica/status/2022393739986244098">peppered Sony Santa Monica and Mega Cat Studio's social media</a>. But, it now seems that the Sons of Sparta team has heard these cries, and sought to remedy the situation by providing a code players can enter on the start menu which will unlock the separate endgame roguelike challenge mode from the off.</p>
<p>And that code? Well, it's:</p>
<p><strong>Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, L1, R1, Touchpad</strong></p>
<p>If you pop that in, you will then get a new option on your menu which will allow you to access Sons of Sparta's The Pit of Agonies, which can be played solo or in two-player local co-op.</p>
<p>As for what The Pit of Agonies is all about, well the reason the team initially decided to keep it as endgame content is because it is apparently very difficult. But, if you are up for it, this challenge mode will present you with different enemies and reward pools each time you play. You can check out a trailer about it all below.</p>

<p>As well as this Sons of Sparta, the original God of War trilogy is getting remade. However, this particular project is still in the early days of development, so don't expect anything more soon. "As we look to the future, we also want to invest in the past and tend to the series' roots that got us to where we are today," Sony said earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-goes-2d-with-pixelated-sons-of-sparta-which-is-out-right-now-as-original-ps2-trilogy-eyes-up-the-remake-treatment">announcing the remakes</a>.</p><p>"We know that remaking the Greek saga has been a frequent request – the genuine, passionate interest from fans to see the original games return is something we're very thankful for and can’t wait to share more when the time comes!"</p>

Pokémon is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-30-super-bowl-spot-lady-gaga-and-jigglypuff-performance">30 this week</a>. Stardew Valley is 10! Coincidence? YOU DECIDE. Our focus here, though, is developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone's smash-hit farming game, which is celebrating its major birthday milestone with a special video featuring, among other things, a look at its forthcoming 1.7 update.
</p>
<p>
Stardew Valley launched for PC on 26th February, 2016, meaning today, specifically, marks its tenth anniversary. And Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2026717852162732412">confirmed he had a bit of a treat planned for the occasion</a> on social media earlier the week. Officially, the video - which is set to air at 7pm in the UK this evening - is a "retrospective and new spouse reveal", which will include some old pre-release footage of the game, with Barone providing commentary.
</p>
<p>
He'll also be talking about the many updates Stardew Valley has received over the years, which brings us to that "spouse reveal". Last August - despite previously saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-promises-no-more-updates-until-haunted-chocolatier-releases">there'd be no more Stardew Valley updates</a> until after the release of his next game, the Haunted Chocolatier - Barone revealed he'd <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-will-be-getting-another-update-after-all">had a bit of a change of heart</a>. Then, back in February, he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-getting-new-marriage-options-better-children-in-next-update">teased the forthcoming 1.7 update</a> would include upgrades to the children of Stardew Valley, making them "a little more interesting", as well as two new marriage candidates for players to woo. And it's the latter we'll be meeting tonight.
</p>
<p>
And that's pretty much all there is to report until after Barone's anniversary video airs. So if you fancy meeting your new potential life partners, you'll be wanting to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geiTg6Z7w3A">point your face at YouTube</a> starting 7pm GMT/8pm CET/11am PST. 
</p>
<p>
As for the long-awaited Haunted Chocolatier, Barone <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/im-alive-the-game-is-still-in-development-stardew-valley-creator-concernedape-gives-update-on-haunted-chocolatier">recently revealed</a> that work on his next game, originally announced back in 2021, had been "very productive lately". There's still no whiff of a release date yet, however, with Barone only saying it'll "come out when it's done."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco is continuing their string of re-releases with the launch of <em>Tales of Berseria Remastered</em>. Originally out for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PC, this year marks ten years since the game was first available.</p><p>While <em>Tales of Berseria</em> isn’t necessarily old enough to warrant a full overhaul, the <em>Remastered</em> version includes many of the same quality of life updates found in the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-review-spirited-journey" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em></a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tales-of-xillia-remastered-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em></a>. These include things like access to the Grade Shop right away, which lets players boost the gameplay experience.</p><p>They’re nice additions to have and make one of the more standout entries in the series even better.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-berseria-remastered_20260223223413.jpg?itok=bqBoX8Nk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p><br><em>Tales of Berseria</em> tells the story of a woman named Velvet who, in a series of tragic situations, loses her family. Left with her ailing younger brother, the pair live in a quiet village with her brother-in-law Artorius.&nbsp;</p><p>As time passes, the calamity that killed her family returns. Known as the Scarlet Night, daemons are brought to their village once again – and this time it’s Velvet’s brother Laphicet who gets tangled up in a sacrificial ritual.&nbsp;</p><p>It turns out Artorius has bigger plans, and Velvet gets tangled up in them too, resulting in an element called Daemonblight infecting her arm and turning her into a Daemon known as a Therion – a being that can eat and absorb other daemons.</p><p>Tossed into prison with revenge on her mind, Velvet’s story picks up three years later when she’s freed along with fellow prisoners who form an unlikely band of bad guys to get back at Artorius for his role in the state of the world.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-berseria-remastered_20260224204816.jpg?itok=DlrKK3Xm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p><br>Along the way, Velvet meets up with the likes of other daemons, witches, and spiritual beings known as malakhim. Together, they’re tasked with defeating the Exorcists with the greater goal of eventually stopping Artorius.</p><p>There’s a lot of drama along the way, and <em>Tales of Berseria</em> doesn’t shy away from darker themes – there’s nothing heroic here. But that works to its advantage, and one of my favorite things about the story is peeling back the layers of these characters and seeing them as more than just villains.</p><p>It’s really, really ambitious, and the payoff is certainly worth the nearly 50 hours it takes to reach the conclusion.&nbsp;</p><p>In between all that, <em>Tales of Berseria</em> has a more action-specific battle system. That is, it’s approached more like a hack and slash game in terms of pushing buttons for combos, and a lot of this can be customized in the Artes menu depending on how you prefer to play.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-berseria-remastered_20260224171819.jpg?itok=nggFbWSd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p><br>Known as the Liberation-Linear Motion Battle System, each character can use a number of physical or magic attacks, with the player controlling Velvet and the other party members operating through the CPU. Skills are assigned to each button and can be chained through pressing them in succession, like a typical combo.</p><p>Each character also uses what’s called a Soul Gauge, which can stack up to five souls and deplete when Artes get used and then recharge as the battle continues. It's definitely a more involved battle system, but getting the hang of each skill and building up those skills is plenty satisfying.</p><p>While <em>Tales of Berseria</em> sticks to the four character party in battle, additional characters can be swapped in or out with the press of the d-pad. Characters can also be given stock commands, such as going all out or putting up more defense.</p><p>Outside of battle, there are various other things to keep you busy, like gear customization, cooking, ship exploration, monster hunts, card-based minigames, and some sidequests that populate near the end of the game. There’s not a huge variety, but it’s at least something in addition to the main quest.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-berseria-remastered_20260221213137.jpg?itok=KFHxTpd9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p><br>On the visual side of things, <em>Tales of Berseria</em> is about what you’d expect from a game that already existed on PS4 and PC ten years ago. That is to say, there’s not much in the way of visual upgrade other than making it run on PS5, and I did notice some glitches here and there. Specifically, some low-resolution textures, blinking lighting, and it seems like the element that makes up the save point isn’t scaled properly, and that really stood out to me.</p><p>That said, everything else seems to be more or less intact. The voice acting is stellar, the game runs smoothly during gameplay, and most of the visual art style holds up. And again, it’s only been ten years since release, so it hasn’t had time to really age out of style.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, if you haven’t played <em>Tales of Berseria</em> on PC or PS4, now’s a good time as any to check it out. The game acts as a prequel to <em>Tales of Zestiria</em>, which will no doubt see a re-release down the line, as Bandai Namco seems keen to keep the series fresh in people’s minds as they prepare an all-new entry.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Tales of Berseria Remastered</em> does its job in the meantime, and while there are some minor issues with textures and lighting, the core of the game remains as delightful as ever.</p><hr><p><em>TechRaptor reviewed <strong>Tales of Berseria Remastered</strong> on PlayStation 5 with a code provided by the publisher.

The campaign is for Neon Odyssey, a sci-fi space opera setting inspired by retro games, pop culture, and synthwave.</p><h2>The <em>Neon Odyssey</em> Kickstarter Announcement</h2><p>According to a press release, <em>Neon Odyssey</em> is a fantasy-forward sci-fi setting. It prioritizes optimism, adventure, and stylish presentation over hard sci-fi rules or attempts at real world physics. The focus is more on fun and atmosphere than simulation. The book will feature character-driven adventures with big tone, big style, and table-ready momentum.</p><picture>

  </picture><p><em>Neon Odyssey</em> is set in Legends of Avantris' own <em>Stardust Rhapsody</em> setting. Players will explore various planets and space stations as bounty hunters. These jobs involve targeting people, robots, data and more. Those jobs will earn credits, which can be used in upgrading ships and gear, and may pull players into deepening conflict with larger factions at play.</p><p><em>Neon Odyssey</em> differs greatly from Avantris' last project, the spooky adventure <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/crooked-moon-review-incredibly-spooky-adventure-that-dms-will-love" rel="nofollow"><em>Crooked Moon</em></a>. This book is not a single scripted adventure, but a setting book packed with modular content and plug-and-play missions. Meaning it can support everything from one-shots to major years-long campaigns. Its influences include 80s and 90s anime, synthwave edge, and pop culture nostalgia.</p><p>The Kickstarter will produce three books. The <em>Outrunner's Handbook</em> contains re-imagined, sci-fi versions of classic D&amp;D classes, subclasses, species, backgrounds, spells, and more. The Cosmic Codex contains worldbuilding material on the setting, including 13 factions, over 30 alien worlds, 6 interdimensional realms, over 250, monsters, 40 missions, and more than 120 items.&nbsp;</p><p>The third book is the <em>Overdrive Expansio</em>n, which contains more of everything. This includes optional and advanced systems like Professions, Racing, Stress &amp; Entertainment, and ship upgrading. Combined, all three of these books will proved 1,400 pages of new material for your gaming table.</p><p>The Kickstarter campaign for Neon Odyssey will go live on May 5, 2026.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>A decade on from its 1.0 launch, action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grim-dawn">Grim Dawn</a> is getting some new Fangs of Asterkarn DLC that adds 5.5 square kilometres of in-game terrain. Picture the extra geography barrelling out of the atmosphere like a boisterous asteroid, teeming with bosses and minibosses and unique items. Look out below!</p>
<p>The DLC will increase the size of the base game by 76%, and will be prefaced by a free update with a new scaleable UI and revised stash feature, offering dedicated crafting and components pages. My, my, Grim Dawn, you’re certainly looking sprightly and well-padded, for a Diabbler of your seniority.
</p><!--more-->
<p>“Fantasy/horror action RPG Grim Dawn is a huge and slick affair which clings tight to a doomy tone, eschews online funny business and is careful to keep lore overload at arm's length,” Alec Meer (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grim-dawn-review-2">wrote back in 2016</a>. “A lack of overblown cutscenes aside, you'd never guess that it was made comparatively under the radar and on surely a fraction of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iii">Diablo III</a>'s budget.” 
</p>
<p>Grim Dawn certainly found an audience both during and after early access, as developers Crate Entertainment recall in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/219990/view/532124583945306256?l=english">an anniversary Steam post this week</a>. “Grim Dawn's success enabled Crate Entertainment to grow from a studio of just 8 people to a team of 29 today, with 4 projects currently in development,” they write. “Your early support has allowed us to not only stay independent from publishers, but to pour our passion into each of our creations.
</p><p>“Likewise, when we started, we never could have imagined that 10 years later Grim Dawn would not only still be receiving major updates but it would have another expansion on the way. Our engineers bent the old engine to their will. Even as recently as last year, we addressed bugs that have been there since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titan-quest">Titan Quest</a>. 
</p>
<p>“Across 82 updates both big and small, we refined and polished, revamping everything from melee animations to how Nemesis bosses spawn on the map. We overhauled loot tables and added loot filters, revamped UIs and smoothed out the difficulty unlocks. Now with v1.3.0 on the way, truly nothing feels off the table to make the game better for you.”
</p>
<p>You can read a playtest changelog for v.1.3.0 <a href="https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/v1-3-0-playtest-changelog/150992">here</a>. This being an ARPG, it includes a lot of sentences like “Hamster of Ventriloquism Deafening Modifier Increased to 300/s”. I leave it you veteran Grim Dawners - now presumably well into the Dismal Afternoon of middle age – to make sense of things.
</p>
<p>The developers had planned to wind things up with Grim Dawn's second expansion, Forgotten Gods, in 2019. They figured that “sales would naturally decline” thereafter, but were caught out by growing player counts in 2023. “Despite having 3 games already in development, we knew we had to reassemble the team for one more loop around the sun,” the Steam post enthuses. “As it turned out... that may have been a bit of an understatement as we enter 2026!”
</p><p>Fangs of Asterkarn development is now “in its final stretch”, and they’re absolutely sure this time that it’ll be “Grim Dawn's final hurrah”. You can expect over 60 new bosses or minibosses, 370 unique items, eight new nemesis monsters, and 116 monster infrequents. The DLC will also add a new alchemy system, “awakened Epic items and Affix Rerolling”, a 10th mastery, and a new class combo maximum of 45.
</p>
<p>Not having played Grim Dawn, I can only gaze in terror upon the bulk of this jargon. But I <em>can</em> get my head around the concept of shapeshifting - “a system we once thought was untenable in this old engine”. Sounds like there’s a juicy story there. In general, I’m automatically pleased and interested by efforts to keep older games in the pink. All we need now is a release date for Fangs of Asterkarn, but alas, there is none.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-metacritic-ai-review-videogamer-2000674042</link>
            <guid>1447345</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> review published by long-standing UK gaming news site <em>Videogamer</em> has been <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-best-reviewed-main-entry-in-over-20-years-2000673626">removed from Metacritic</a> after readers pointed out it was written by a fake AI journalist who doesn’t actually exist. <em>Videogamer</em>‘s human masthead was gutted last week, sources tell <em>Kotaku</em>, and the site has been publishing apparent genAI slop ever since.</p> <p><span><em>Videogamer,</em> purchased BGFG a few years back and recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-escapist-esports-insider-clickout-media-layoffs-2000669743">sold to gambling seo spam agency Clickout</a>, gave <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> a 9/10 in its review this week. But readers pointed out that the writing “reeks [of] AI,” and its author, “experienced iGaming and sports betting analyst” Brian Merrygold, appeared to be a made-up person complete with an AI profile image.</span></p>

 <p><span>The review in question is full of clichés and generalities rather than specifics about the game and how it plays. Here’s an excerpt:</span></p> <blockquote><p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem is not just a victory lap for Capcom’s survival horror dynasty; it is a chainsaw-revving, blood-soaked testament to why we love getting scared stupid.</strong>&nbsp;It is the sort of finale that effectively grabs the franchise by the lapels, shakes it violently, and demands you acknowledge just how far it has come since the tank-control days of 1996. While other series limp toward their conclusions,&nbsp;<strong>RE9</strong>&nbsp;arrives with the confidence of a Tyrant smashing through a brick wall.</p> <p>It happens like clockwork with every major&nbsp;Resident Evil Requiem leak, doesn’t it? We worry if the developers can balance the scales. After the southern gothic reinvention of&nbsp;<em>RE7</em>&nbsp;and the action-hero theatrics of the recent remakes, the franchise has been having something of an identity crisis. This game solves it by simply doing both.&nbsp;<strong>It bonds the trauma of Raccoon City with modern design sensibilities</strong>, proving there is plenty of life left in this undead horse. It frames the horror not just as a series of jump scares, but as a legacy that haunts its characters as much as it haunts our backlogs.</p></blockquote> <p><span>It was previously scraped and featured on Metacritic for its review score roundup on launch day. It raises concerns about quality controls for the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/metacritic-co-founder-marc-doyle-lifts-the-veil-on-how-the-site-works">main video game review aggregator</a> that fans consult before buying games and companies mention in their quarterly earnings reports when touting the success of recent releases.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">It's bleak. I was reading some RE Requiem reviews and found this thing published by videogamer. Can't find anything about the writer, everything about it reeks AI (dead giveaway being the image). Low effort, gargabe.</p> <p>Mind you, this review made its way to Metacritic. <a href="https://t.co/4STN8DjAwe">https://t.co/4STN8DjAwe</a> <a href="https://t.co/awk26P9wSA">pic.twitter.com/awk26P9wSA</a></p> <p>— Andrés (@Andrew_east) <a href="https://twitter.com/Andrew_east/status/2026919935641895380?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“The <em>RE Requiem</em> review and a handful of other Videogamer reviews from 2026 have been removed from Metacritic,” site cofounder Marc Doyle told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email.</p>

 <p><span>As spotted by </span><i><span>Gfinity’s </span></i><span>Andrés Aquino in a post on </span><a href="https://x.com/Andrew_east/status/2026919935641895380?s=20"><span>X</span></a><span>, everything about Brian Merrygold’s profile on Videogamer comes off as suspicious. The byline appears to have no prior online history and the profile image url is tiled </span><span> “ChatGPT-Image-Oct-20-2025-11_57_34-AM-300×300.png.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Several other authors on the site have similarly suspicious-looking AI-generated profile pictures that don’t mention they were generated by “ChatGPT” in their file names, suggesting this may have been a slip-up on by Videogamer site management as it pivots the outlet to completely AI-generated junk.&nbsp;</span><span>Other current bylines on the site include </span><a href="https://www.videogamer.com/author/shooter-orson/"><span>Shooter Orson</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.videogamer.com/author/steven-danielson/"><span>Steven Danielson</span></a>. Like the <span>Merrygold account, all three had their X profiles created in October 2025.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000674047" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674047"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674047">X</figcaption></figure> <p>Sources told <em>Kotaku</em> that Clickout began publishing AI-generated content under the casino and gambling portions of Videogamer around that time last fall, but it wasn’t until the staff was axed last week that AI content started being pushed out into the gaming news, reviews, and features sections as well. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrhiki.bsky.social/post/3l7qicbpbza2n">Older human bylines</a> from the site’s 15 year history have been completely wiped out as well and overwritten with fake AI profiles.</p>

 <p><span>While it’s impossible to verify what content is or isn’t generated with AI with complete accuracy, multiple AI-checkers <em>Kotaku</em> used to verify the legitimacy of the </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span> review sounded alarm bells. It wasn’t the only recent review to get picked up by Metacritic either. A Recent </span><i><span>Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</span></i><span> review, which was published on <em>Videogamer</em> and subsequently featured on Metacritic on February 23, has also been removed from the aggregator’s roundup.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Ethan Gach.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Santa Monica has provided a code that players can use to access God of War: Sons of Sparta’s roguelike mode, The Pit of Agonies, early. </p>



<p>Santa Monica <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-son-of-sparta-shadow-drops-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shadow-dropped</a> God of War: Sons of Sparta during the latest Sony State of Play event, and fans have fun in the 2D metroidvania adventure ever since then. The title has always had the Pit of Agonies roguelike mode, but players had to finish the game to access it; now, they can do it earlier. </p>







<h2 id="h-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-the-pit-unlock-code">God of War: Sons of Sparta The Pit Unlock Code</h2>



<p>As revealed in the new blog post, the only way previously to unlock God of War: Sons of Sparta’s Pit of Agonies roguelike mode was to beat the story. However, now players can unlock it early by entering a code in the starting menu. The code is a series of inputs on your DualSense controller that you can check out below: </p>



<p><strong>Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, L1, R1, Touchpad</strong></p>

<iframe title="God of War Sons of Sparta - The Pit | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5oqO5WuxoVE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>For those unaware about the Pit, it is a separate rougelike mode where players battle different enemies to access new reward pools. The game mode can be played solo or with another player through local co-op as Kratos and Deimos take on this challenge. </p>



<p>The game mode also features a difficulty modifier called Agony, which can be chosen at the start of a run. This introduces variety to gameplay and changes how players approach the game. For example, “the Agony of Torment will manifest healing vessels that must be destroyed to prevent enemies from regenerating health, while the Agony of Calamity will cause defeated enemies to burst into a fiery explosion.” </p>



<p>After finishing each run in God of War: Sons of Sparta’s The Pit mode, players will be rewarded with a Symbol of Suffering for their chosen Agonies. When players hit thresholds of Symbols, they unlock new agones, and completion provides them with Ashes of Agony, which allows them to get permanent upgrades that last between attempts.</p>

Additionally, the upcoming remake trilogy features a new ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-trilogy-remake-features-new-fighting-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fighting system</a>.’ What are your thoughts on the devs of God of War: Sons of Sparta providing a code to unlock the Pit roguelike mode early?&nbsp;Leave your thoughts down in the comments, and join the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Gotta count 'em all</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Pokémon officially turns 30 tomorrow, but with Japan already ticking over into 27th Feb, The Pokémon Company has released a special video to celebrate the series' big birthday.</p>
<p>The vid is all about those new 30th anniversary icons that you may have spotted online in recent weeks. TPC has designed one for each Pokémon — yep, all 1,025 of them — and a select few get put in the spotlight above, accompanied by an adorable little animation.</p>
<p>It's mainly the series starters and legendaries that are highlighted in this one, but the final zoom-out throws a bunch more into the mix — if your eyes can keep up. If you want to catch 'em all up close, you can head over to the <a href="https://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/30th_logo/">official Japanese Pokémon site</a>, where each of them is laid out in Pokédex order.</p>
<p>The logos have been distributed as part of a social media campaign by <a href="https://x.com/poke_times" tabindex="-1">@poke_times</a> on <a href="https://x.com/poke_times/status/2025782669104349237">X</a>, with all those who retweet being assigned a random icon. They have also been cropping up on large billboards in popular Japanese locations, like Shinjuku Station in Tokyo and Namba Station in Osaka.</p>
<p>We have to admit, it's a really cute way to celebrate the 30th anniversary. Here's hoping that TPC can keep the good times going in tomorrow's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-presents-february-2026-time-date-how-to-watch">Pokémon Presents</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“The Real Fruits Will Start Coming in ’27-’28”: Warner Bros. Games CEO Hints at Games in WB’s “Biggest Franchises” Coming Next Year]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-teases-return-to-biggest-franchises-in-2027-2028/</link>
            <guid>1447294</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After the massive flop that was 2024's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a></strong>, the whole industry could feel that <strong>Warner Bros'</strong> games division was not in a good place. So when we learned that <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/"><strong>Monolith Productions</strong>, <strong>Player First Games,</strong> and <strong>San Diego Studio</strong> had all been shut down</a> just two months into 2025, it was upsetting, especially in the case of Monolith, but we couldn't exactly call it surprising, even if <strong>Hogwarts Legacy</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-has-sold-over-40-million-units-to-date-confirms-wb/">continued to sell like gangbusters</a>.</p>



<p>What followed was a major reorganization of how Warner Bros. would approach games, focusing in on four verticals: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/"><strong>Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat</strong>, and the <strong>DC Universe</strong></a>. At the time, Warner Bros chief executive officer of global streaming and games, <strong>JB Perrette</strong>, said "<em></em><em>Our company is home to some of the biggest franchises in the world, and we are optimizing our team structure to develop long-term franchise roadmaps to delight players and fans</em>."</p>



<p>Now, in a new interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2026/biz/news/warner-bros-discovery-david-zaslav-hbo-sale-1236673449/">Variety</a>, Perrette has reiterated that 2025 was "<em>a year of reset</em>" for the company's gaming division, adding that the games team got "<em>distracted going after too many IPs with too broad a set of studios</em>." And while we only know of two game releases from Warner Bros in 2026, the upcoming (and highly anticipated)<a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-date-the-game-awards-2025/"> <strong>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</strong></a> and a Game of Thrones mobile title, Perrette went on to tease that bigger things are coming in the next couple of years.</p>



<p>"<em><strong>The real fruits will start coming in '27-'28</strong></em>," Perrette said, "<em>when we <strong>return to some of our biggest franchises</strong></em>."</p>



<p>The obvious guess is that Perrette is talking about <strong>Avalanche Software's</strong> upcoming Hogwarts Legacy <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sells-30-million-units-hogwarts-legacy-2-huge-priority/">sequel,</a> which was reportedly prioritized over making a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-canceled-by-wb/">'Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition' of the breakout 2023 hit</a> because Warner Bros didn't believe it to be worth the cost over just focusing on making the sequel.</p>



<p>There's also the possibility that Perrette is referring to the return of the popular DC-focused fighting game series with <strong>Injustice 3</strong>, a game that was practically <a href="https://wccftech.com/superman-green-lantern-voice-actors-seemingly-confirm-injustice-3/">confirmed to be on its way last year by two members of its voice acting cast</a>. Meanwhile, WB Montreal is reportedly working on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-montreal-might-be-making-dc-comics-live-service-game/">DC-based live service game</a>, which might not be the most exciting thing for players, but for an executive like Perrette, it wouldn't be surprising for him to have that project in mind when dropping hints about what's coming down the pipeline.</p>



<p>All of those titles would qualify as Warner Bros returning to its "<em>biggest franchises</em>," so we'll just have to wait and see which of the four franchises WB is focusing on in its games division ends up being first down the line.</p>



<p>But this is all assuming that the major acquisition of Warner Bros from either <a href="https://wccftech.com/paramount-bids-108-billion-to-grab-warner-bros-discovery-out-from-netflix-nose/"><strong>Netflix</strong> or <strong>Paramount Skydance</strong></a> goes through without interrupting anything. A highly unlikely scenario, to be clear, and one that could cause us to go without another big game from any of WB's studios for years. We don't even know if Netflix will want to keep the games division going, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-didnt-attribute-any-value-to-wb-games-as-part-of-deal-relatively-minor/">based on how much value it placed on it when it looked at the total value of Warner Bros</a>.</p>



<p>If WB ends up selling to Netflix, instead of hoping for a big WB game, we may be left simply hoping that WB is still making games by 2028.</p>

			<p><span>A photo I took while making my own way up Mount Kami. I </span><i><em>never</em></i><span> use photo mode.</span></p>
		</div><div>
		<p>Playing <em>Cairn</em>, the latest game from <em>Furi</em> and <em>Haven</em> developer The Game Bakers, is hours of trials, tribulations, revelations, successes, failures. It's telling the story of a world-class alpinist, Aava, trying to find herself on One Last Climb, but it's also letting you embody her and experience the climb itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Through meticulous re-creation of the process of mountain climbing, it gives you the tools to try and answer the question of why someone like Aava is attempting something so dangerous and potentially futile. It's a deeply fierce gaming challenge to ascend, carefully placing one limb at a time on hand and footholds, to the very top of an inaccessible mountaintop. <em>Cairn </em>is an experience that leaves one breathless, moved, and, in all honesty, changed.</p><p>It’s one of the most remarkable video games of the past 10 years, let alone 2026.</p><p>“We want to leave players with everlasting memories,” said The Game Bakers co-founder and CEO Audrey Leprince. “We want our games to mark them and to bring them an experience.”</p><p>art19:9685f6a1-24dc-4b1f-b3c1-efbbeae36770</p><p><em>Cairn</em> tells its story in two distinct modes.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s Aava’s emotional journey, which largely plays out in cutscenes, as Aava reaches different milestones alongside her quest to scale Mount Kami, a kaiju-sized beast of a mountain that is, for most, a doomed endeavor. There is a reason the natural inhabitants of Kami have finally abandoned it, why the cable cars no longer run. But Aava is drawn to Kami and what might exist at the top. Plus, the world wants to watch her try. They want the happy photo at the top of a mountain. But will reaching the summit provide an explanation for why she climbs, despite how much anxiety it causes the rest of the people in her life? An understanding of why she chooses isolation over community? It’s a question the game asks, even if Aava tries to avoid an answer.</p><p>“It was really the fascination of all of those people who put their lives in danger for a sport or a hobby,” said Leprince. “And alpinism was really embodying that idea of 'Why do you do that?' Why do you make yourself so miserable in some ways? It's so dangerous and it's so hard and it's so painful and you might die out there and yet you want to go again.”</p><p>It’s a story that’s personal to Leprince, too; her father was an alpinist. He’s even listed in the credits, because he was an active advisor during development. He was also part of climbs that caused Leprince stress as a child. In one instance, half the people in her father’s group didn’t make it back. On some level, <em>Cairn</em> is a chance for Leprince to explore a family question:&nbsp;</p><p>Why?</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p><span>Photos of Audrey Leprince's father scaling mountains and looking very Cairn-like. Strong Dad energy here.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>“I am lucky that I share the question with everyone and I think people will make their own answer to it,” she said. “There’s no answer in <em>Cairn</em>. We don't want to give answers. We more want to ask the question and then let you decide what you think is the answer. But [I’m] definitely closer.”</p><p>Then, there’s the player’s own arc. In <em>Cairn</em>, you have full control over Aava’s arms and legs. The majority of your time in <em>Cairn</em> is spent slowly placing one of those arms and one of those legs in increasingly precarious parts of Kami, as you slowly (hopefully) climb up. It feels like solving a puzzle every time you move a single part of her, and any mistake could be her last. Aava is a world-class athlete, but Kami is a world-class opponent, and the additional tools Aava has access to—pitons and a rope, mostly—are distressingly limited.</p><p>Leprince described the development of <em>Cairn</em> as three-year journey with a three-fold challenge:</p><ol><li>How players control the character</li><li>The physics and climbing system</li><li>The level design of the mountain itself</li></ol><p>All three challenges had unique issues of their own to overcome, but the mountain itself was the one that required the most work on The Game Bakers’ part. There was no path to follow.&nbsp;</p><p>“No one's ever done it before,” said Leprince. “People just put holes and pre-calculated animations that are going to trigger and everything. We arrived and there was nothing. We had to invent all our workflow, all our pipeline, all our tools, all our process to reach that level of level design. And it took us some time, I can tell you. We spent at least a year just in pre-production, just trying to figure out is this going to work.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nvidia-gpu-prices-eurogamer-layoffs-wolfenstein-3-casting-2000674011</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>GPU prices are out of control and all Nvidia can do is shrug its shoulders and count its billions. <em>IGN</em> continues downsizing after its big acquisition of sites in 2024. And casting has begun for <em>Wolfenstein 3</em>. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. Say it with me now: “<a href="https://t.co/pdWIGN2YH7">Not everything is <em>Concord</em></a>.”</p> <h2>Nvidia soars as GPUs slump</h2> <p>“As much as we would love to have more supply, we do believe for a couple of quarters it is going to be very tight,” CEO Jensen Huang said during this week’s earnings call. “If things improve by the end of the year, there is an opportunity to think about what that is from a year-over-year growth, but it is still too early for us to know at this time. We will get back to you as soon as we can.”</p>

 <p>While the company continues raking in the cash thanks to the AI boom, sales of gaming GPUs <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2026">actually fell 13 percent last quarter</a> as people look at the price of upgrading their PC and go “hell no.” “We expect supply constraints to be a headwind to gaming in the first quarter of fiscal 2027 and beyond,” Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said. Yikes.</p> <p>Surely Nvidia is doing everything it can to <a href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-rtx-3060-returning-2026-dram-shortage-gpus-expensive-prices-2000656687">increase available supply</a>, right? Right? “If things improve by the end of the year, there is an opportunity to think about what this is from a year-over-year growth, but it’s still too early for us to know at this time,” Kress <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0saM9rLGj0Y">later said</a>.</p>

 <h2>Fresh games media cuts at<em> IGN</em>-owned <em>Eurogamer</em></h2> <p>As first <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/games-media-set-for-more-layoffs-as-ign-owned-eurogamer-cuts-editorial-staff/">reported by <em>VGC</em></a>, <em>Eurogamer</em> is losing some top editors as well as its entire video team. <em>Kotaku</em> can corroborate that the popular Outside&nbsp;Xbox YouTube channel, which includes the <a href="https://www.oxventure.com/"><em>Oxventure</em> show</a> for live tabletop playthroughs, is part of the cuts.</p>

 <p>The group had just finished multiple sold-out shows as part of its 2026 tour across the UK. It’s unclear if they’ll have the opportunity to buy themselves out and go independent as <em>Digital Foundry</em> did last year or if the entire enterprise will just entirely shut down.</p> <p>Sources told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> that <em>Eurogamer</em>‘s editorial director is part of the downsizing, which comes after other waves of cuts and departures since <a href="https://kotaku.com/ign-john-davison-ziff-davis-layoffs-union-games-media-2000616972"><em>IGN</em> acquired</a> the site as part of the Gamer Network in 2024.</p>

 <h2>Casting is underway for <em>Wolfenstein 3</em></h2> <p><a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-wolfenstein-3-first-story-details-unveiled-as-casting-begins"><em>Mp1st</em> reports</a> on details of one of the project’s new characters and its recording schedule, with sessions planned for 2026 and 2027. <em>Kotaku</em> corroborated that the game was in development <a href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-3-in-development-machinegames-bethesda-2000657758">last month</a>.</p> <h2><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> director defends using older version of Unreal Engine for the next sequel</h2> <p>“These represent the current trend in graphics pipelines, and of course, such pipelines are important to us as well,” he <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-third-entry-is-progressing-very-smoothly-we-ask-director-naoki-hamaguchi-why-the-team-chose-not-to-switch-to-unreal-engine-5/">told <em>Automaton</em></a>. “However, if we had tied our development schedule and milestones too closely to Unreal Engine 5’s roadmap, we would have risked our own progress being stalled if the engine encountered any kind of delay.”</p> <h2>Sony might be backing off its PC push for single-player games</h2> <p>There was speculation on two podcasts this week that games like <em>Wolverine</em> are no longer a priority for porting to PC. That’s in stark contrast to Microsoft’s everything everywhere strategy. “I have an inkling that they’re pulling away from PC,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnZsurPI5EY&amp;t=1413s"><em>Digital Foundry</em>‘s John Linneman</a> said. “Watch the space. But I can’t help, based on some of the decisions and the way things have been going lately, I get the feeling that under the current leadership, that PC has become less important.” <em>Bloomberg</em>‘s Jason Schreier echoed a similar sentiment <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-phil-spencer-retired-and-whats-next-for-xbox/id1507834679?i=1000751690666">on <em>Triple Click</em></a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Smiling Friends</em> calls it quits</h2> <p>The breakout Adult Swim animated comedy hit will end with season 3. “To be honest, after Season 3, Zach and I both had the same feeling where we felt pretty burnt out after putting years and years into this, but also pretty accomplished,” co-creator Michael Cusack explained <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DVNI_xlDJ6L/">in a new message</a>. “We came to this feeling where we were like, ‘This can just be it.'”</p> <p>The news comes as a shocker since season 4 and 5 already appeared to be greenlit. <em>Smiling Friends</em> will have two more episodes to release as part of season 3 before saying goodbye.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-steam-pc-new-version-release-bugs-problems-blurry-2000673604">Square Enix replaced the Steam version of<em> Final Fantasy VII</em> with something much worse</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-review-leon-grace-capcom-ps5-pc-2000673329"><em>Resident Evil 9</em> is a great game that plays it too safe</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/its-not-just-you-everyone-is-getting-xbox-spam-messages-right-now-2000673695">Xbox accidentally spammed people with tons of junk test messages&nbsp;</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Just over a week ahead of its release, Marathon is already climbing the Steam Top Seller charts, surpassing the likes of ARC Raiders. </p>



<p>Bungie’s new extraction shooter, Marathon, is all set to release on March 5, 2026, for all platforms. A week before the release, the developers are hosting a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-server-slam-test-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">server slam test</a> this weekend for players to try out the game one last time before the final release. However, the game is now already climbing the Steam Charts. </p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-ranks-third-in-steam-top-sellers-list">Marathon Ranks Third in Steam Top Sellers List</h2>



<p>At the time of writing, Marathon has climbed the Steam Top Sellers list to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third rank in the United States</a>, and to the sixth rank in the United Kingdom. The title has managed to surpass another highly popular title in the extraction shooter genre, ARC Raiders, which currently sits in fifth position in the US. It is worth noting that Embark Studios’ extraction adventure was released almost 3 months ago. </p>



<p>Marathon is also ranking higher than other popular multiplayer titles, including Hellduvers 2, Marvel Rivals, Apex Legends, and more. The only games that are ranking higher than Bungie’s upcoming extraction shooter are Resident Evil Requiem (which releases tomorrow) and Counter-Strike 2. </p>



<p>The game’s title reaching number 3 on the Steam top sellers list speaks volumes about how the developers have successfully changed the public’s perception since its reveal. Bungie faced several challenges before the release, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">departure of top executives</a> and issues related to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-artist-satisfied/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plagiarism</a>. However, they have clearly managed to overcome these obstacles.</p>







<p>In other news, here are Bungie’s plans to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-outlines-plans-to-counter-cheaters-in-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">counter cheaters</a> in Marathon. Additionally, here’s a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-runner-shell-in-marathon-all-abilities-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comprehensive guide</a> on all seven Runner Shells in the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Can we have a little bit of silly, stupid fun for a second?"</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Surgent Studios, the developer behind Tales of Kenzara: ZAU, has unveiled its next game today, and it's...absolutely nothing like Tales of Kenzara: ZAU. It's called FixForce, and it's a chaotic cooperative "extraction platformer" about a team of robots fixing machines using random parts they find lying around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FixForce puts up to six players together as a robot repair crew sent into an area to fix various broken structures littered around the area within an allotted amount of time. Each broken machine indicates what parts are needed to fix it, and those parts can be found scattered around the level.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, many of those pieces will be stuck behind obstacles: bodies of water robots can't swim through, up tall towers, guarded by evil enemy robots. To collect them, you'll need to use your robot building abilities to pick up and place objects strategically so you and your friends can climb across them to reach whatever it is you need. And if you're injured by an obstacle, your head will fall off, and your teammates will need to find your head and body and stack them back together to resurrect you back into the game. Teams earn points based on how many things they fix within the time limit.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">FixForce Reveal Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I got a chance to play a round of FixForce ahead of the announcement alongside the developers, and yeah, the level of silly chaos implied in the announcement trailer pretty much encapsulates it. It's easy to get distracted goofing around with all the objects in the level and building weird, random things, but FixForce also lends itself to silly emergent moments, like when one of the devs tried to toss platforms at me to save me from being stuck on an island, and instead slammed one into me and knocked me right into the water.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a surprisingly cheery and silly time for a studio that just made a game about grieving the death of a loved one. That fact is not lost on founder Abubakar Salim, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As FixForce came together, we saw the pure chaos and hilarity it was unleashing and made the decision to move quickly and publish it ourselves," he said in a statement. "Yes, FixForce is completely unlike anything we’ve ever done before, but look: we made one game about grief and another about abuse and thought, ‘can we have a little bit of silly, stupid fun for a second?’ I promise we’ll go back to dark and depressing after this.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, this isn't the same game Salim announced in 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-kenzera-zau-creator-says-its-time-for-aaa-studios-to-move-away-from-safe-bets">Project Uso</a>, nor is it the horror game announced last year to be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-developer-pocketpair-moves-into-publishing-to-release-tales-of-kenzera-devs-next-game">published by Pocketpair</a>. Surgent clearly has a lot of irons in the fire here, but its eagerness to get something released quickly makes sense given the scale of its long-term ambitions and its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-kenzera-zau-team-put-on-redundancy-notice-amid-funding-struggles">financial struggles in 2024</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FixForce is dropping in early access on March 12 on PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, and its full, final release will also be on Xbox, the studio says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>1447270</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">After 15 years at Ubisoft working on Far Cry, Splinter Cell and Rainbow Six, veteran developer Patrik Méthé fancied doing something different — and three years later, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pubg-publisher-krafton-finally-reveals-project-windless-an-ambitious-open-world-action-rpg-from-ubisofts-former-far-cry-director-sony-state-of-play">at Sony's recent State of Play</a>, viewers were treated to exactly that: a trailer for a blockbuster open-world action RPG starring a hulking bird warrior.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/project-windless-the-bird-that-drinks-tears">Project Windless</a>, a game set in the world of the popular Korean novel series The Bird That Drinks Tears — albeit a franchise that many in the West won't have heard of. Reaction to the game's big reveal trailer was positive, Méthé tells IGN, though tinged with some jokes about its main character that is, essentially, a large humanoid chicken.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But after that initial moment of surprise, well, the game and its world look intriguing. And it's protagonist is certainly unique — a quality Méthé said had been key to centering the game on this particular hero, and why he was interested in the project overall. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"What you're playing is the rise of a mythical character that you will hear about in the [The Bird That Drinks Tears] novels, but obviously he's not there anymore because it's more than 1000 years before," Méthé said, making clear that the game has been created as an entry point for the fantasy franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You're really playing the foundation of this universe," he continued. "Whether you read the novels or not won't change your immersion, your understanding of the game itself."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Project Windless is set to be the first project from Méthé's Krafton Montreal, a studio forged around the idea of making this game that now houses 90 people. A further 40, meanwhile, are assisting development in a studio near Seoul.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was receiving a bunch of contacts on LinkedIn and stuff, and I received one from a company called Krafton," Méthé recalls of how his involvement began, shortly after leaving Ubisoft. "I had no clue what [Krafton] was so I almost closed it, but then it was written: 'the creator of PUBG. I'm like, 'oh, okay, might be worth [taking a look]'."</p><p>"We have this incredible IP, beloved in South Korea, you have the experience doing great AAA single-player games"<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a bit of research, Méthé found an old article suggesting that Krafton had been "looking to do the Korean Witcher" — and while this description wasn't in the official pitch for the project he eventually heard, it still piqued his interest. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What Krafton asked us was simple, it was: 'We have this incredible IP, beloved in South Korea, you have the experience doing great AAA single-player games. What would you do with that in order to introduce it to the Western market?' Not that we don't want to sell to [Korean fans too], but what would you do?'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"My answer was: 'if anyone answers you [on the spot] to that kind of question, you should stop the call immediately. Because to answer that alone, without thinking about it for more than a few minutes, it's a joke. This kind of project requires the expertise of many people, so if you want a serious answer and not just buzzwords — the used sales car pitch — give me the time to sync with experts and we'll get back to you with a real answer."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's what Krafton allowed Méthé to do. After some initial discussion around directly adapting The Bird That Drinks Tears' first novel, Méthé realized that setting the action generations before allowed for more flexibility in crafting a more unique story suited to a video game, rather than adapting the books' stories to a different medium while  trying to hit all the same beats.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Project Windless Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"For me it's more that we have the novels, which is great for us as developers because it answers a lot of questions that often take up a lot of resource and time," Méthé says. "We have those answers already in place, and we can then easily add layers of depth into the stories and the motivation of each race."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It hasn't all been plain sailing — Méthé says he underestimated how much of a "hectic and a bumpy adventure" it was going to be, figuring out what Project Windless would be while also "building a studio, finding a place, recruiting people, trying to understand the ecosystem of the company." He continued: "We knew it would be a good challenge and it is a good challenge. So it's never boring. Let's say it like that." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, it sounds like a welcome change for Méthé after more than 15 years working on Ubisoft shooters, including Splinter Cell Conviction, Far Cry 3, Far Cry 4, Far Cry 5, Far Cry New Dawn, and Rainbow Six Extraction — all of which he served as game director for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's very refreshing," he says. "We're not a shooter at all. Sometimes as developers, because we're repeating stuff because we're say we're doing follow-ups, you find a certain pattern that works, whereas this time it's quite the opposite. We don't have a clear benchmark to follow, and we need to come up with our own vision of what we want."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, plenty about the game remains under wraps. Apart from that trailer, there's still much to learn about the game, and more work to be done to convince players that this is a franchise that can stand alongside other open-world action RPG staples. Méthé, however, believes his team is off to a good start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What I really loved, of all the comments I've seen and all the content creator reactions I've seen, most of the time it went like this: You see the start of the trailer and they're like, 'okay, interesting, interesting. Then they're like, 'what the...', and then they're like, 'I'm in,' without any hesitation. And that's gold. That's what we wanted. But it's our first communication. It's the first time people are hearing about this. There will be a bunch more down the road to clarify what the game is, how unique it is. For the time being we're just taking the time to celebrate this moment. And when the time comes, we'll be able to explain a bit more in detail."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Connecting the world through a GTX 1660.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">Death Stranding 2</a> isn't even a year old, but the PC version is already on the way in just a couple of weeks. When it launched on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-review-2020">PS5</a>, it was one of the most beautiful games on the platform, and while that would usually mean it's kind of hard to run on PC, the system requirements are forgiving. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike some recent PC launches, Sony released different quality standards for its minimum and recommended system requirements, which should help pin down what to expect when you try to run the game on your PC. For instance, the minimum spec calls for either an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/29/evga-geforce-gtx-1660-super-review-and-benchmarks">Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660</a> or an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-radeon-rx-5500-xt-review">AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT,</a> which should run the game at 1080p with low settings, at 30 fps. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to max out the game, though, you're going to need a bit more hardware, but it's still pretty reasonable. The recommended spec calls for an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-review">RTX 3070</a> or a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review">Radeon RX 6800</a>, and will run the game at 1440p with the High quality preset at 60 fps. Not bad. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I went ahead and listed all of Sony's recommended PC specs below, but as long as you have a relatively modern PC, the game should be able to run flawlessly onj your machine. Nixxes, the studio handling the PC port has also added a "portable preset" which should make it run smoothly on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-handheld-gaming-pc">PC handhelds</a> like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/steam-deck">Steam Deck </a>or the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review">Xbox Ally X.</a> </p><div><div><p>Death Stranding 2 Minimum Specs</p></div><div><div><p>Graphics Card</p><p>Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 / AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT</p></div><div><p>Processor</p><p>Intel Core i3-10100 / AMD Ryzen 3 3100</p></div><div><p>Storage</p><p>150GB (SSD recommended)</p></div></div></div><div><div><p>Death Stranding 2 System Requirements (1080p60)</p></div><div><div><p>Graphics Card</p><p>Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 / AMD Radeon RX 6600</p></div><div><p>Processor</p><p>Intel Core i5-11400 / AMD Ryzen 5 5600</p></div><div><p>Storage</p><p>150GB (SSD Recommended)</p></div></div></div><div><div><p>Death Stranding 2 System Requirements (1440p60)</p></div><div><div><p>Graphics Card</p><p>Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 / AMD Radeon RX 6800</p></div><div><p>Processor</p><p>Intel Core i7-11700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5700X</p></div><div><p>Storage</p><p>150GB (SSD Recommended)</p></div></div></div><div><div><p>Death Stranding 2 Recommended Specs (4K60)</p></div><div><div><p>Graphics Card</p><p>Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 / AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT</p></div><div><p>Processor</p><p>Intel Core i7-11700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5700X</p></div><div><p>Storage</p><p>150GB (SSD Recommended)</p></div></div></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Humble Requirements</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even at the high end, Death Stranding 2's system requirements are pretty humble by today's standards. While the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-16gb-founders-edition-review">GeForce RTX 4080 </a>seems like a lot, keep in mind that this is likely for maxing out the game at 4K, which you very much don't need to do. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keep in mind that the minimum spec is calling for a GTX 1660, which was a low-end card when it came out in 2019, and that was almost seven years ago now. I won't know exactly how this game performs until I'm able to run it on my own hardware, but the wide range of GPUs being represented here likely means that the game is incredibly scalable. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Death Stranding 2: 45 Amazing Details That Blew Us Away</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also important to note that even on the PS5 Pro, Death Stranding 2 did not use ray tracing, which means the higher graphics settings are going to be a lot more approachable than other recent AAA games – unless, of course, ray tracing is added to the PC version. Luckily, Nixxes is also adding support for DLSS, XeSS, FSR and Guerilla's Pico upscaler, so you should be able to find some way to boost your performance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Death Stranding 2 launches on PC March 19th, so at least we won't have to wait too long to see how it performs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen.

Sadly, the Collector Booster is the real value proposition here, because they’re like gold dust.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Collector Boosters include cards that are functionally the same as the cards you’d get from a Play Booster pack, but since they feature foils and alternative art treatments, they’re where you’re much, much more likely to find pricier cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The product listing suggests players use the Collector Booster as a prize for whoever wins Draft Night, but I can see scalpers pulling it out and selling it on to make money on the secondary market.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also in stock, however, is the new <a href="https://zdcs.link/QG8ppJ?object_uuid=e22d702d-1344-44b9-9d93-9b61c2a734bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Turtle Team-Up</u></a>.

Use your drill-wrench to build your way across a vibrant post-apocalyptic world, find replacement parts, and fix broken machines. And if you lose your head, don’t worry: it’s all part of the job.</p><p><strong>Build With Friends</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As FixForce bots, you and up to five friends will build towers and paths out of scrap parts, using the structures to climb all over the worksite. Rescue each other when things get hairy, and remember: how high or far you go is limited only by how much scrap you can find.</p><p><strong>Find + Fix</strong></p><p>In each round, you and your team will be dropped near machines in desperate need of repair. Once you’ve found them, use your drill-wrench to scour the site for the perfect replacement parts to get them working again so you can clock out on time. You might even find a few extra odd jobs around to line your pockets…</p><p><strong>Workplace Hazards</strong></p><p>No job is the same, but they’re all teeming with hazards and violent rogue robots. Keep your eyes peeled so you can protect yourself, your friends, and your precious towers and bridges from their destructive wrath while you finish the job.</p><p><strong>But Don’t Lose Your Head</strong></p><p><em>FixForce</em> means reliability, and high-risk assignments are your bread and butter. If you take a tumble, slip into the water, or find yourself on the wrong side of a rogue bot, your friends can simply recover your head and snap it onto another body. Good as new!</p><p><strong>Perks of the Job</strong></p><p>The work is relentless, but so is your resolve!
