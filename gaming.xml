<p>Epic Games is not letting Fortnite cheaters off the hook, and those caught doing so at the competitive level are getting the strictest punishment: total embarrassment. The punishments levied by Epic are being cheered by the community, with some fans wishing other games would follow suit.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-pro-caught-account-sharing-gets-embarrassed-by-epic-games">Fortnite Pro Caught Account Sharing Gets Embarrassed by Epic Games</h2>



<p>A player caught account sharing in Fortnite has been banned from all tournaments by Epic, forced to donate their prize winnings to charity, and had to make an apology video. </p>



<p>By sharing his account with another Fortnite player, Australian pro Morgan “RepulseGod” Bamford unfairly qualified for the 2023 Fortnite Championship Series (FNCS) Grand Finals. In a 30 second description-less video, RepulseGod <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XouE9KalIVA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> his actions, and explained that he has received a permanent ban and has to forfeit his winnings:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Epic took legal action against me and now I’m banned from participating in Fortnite tournaments forever. I also have to pay a monetary settlement, which includes the prize money I received but did not fairly win, which Epic will donate to charity. Cheating in tournaments ruins the fun for the players who earned their spot in tournaments and I apologise to the Fortnite community for my actions. I won’t ever cheat in Fortnite again.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Epic Games <a href="https://x.com/FNCompetitive/status/1891564240604999725" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted this update</a> and a link to the player’s video on their official FNCS account, effectively laying out a warning to anyone else who cheats. In a similar method as Valve took with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/counter-strike-pros-caught-matchfixing-finally-unbanned-after-10-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the iBUYPOWER match fixing scandal</a>, Epic is setting a very high punishment standard in an attempt to deter future cheaters.</p>



<p>Many players online have now seen this from Epic and want to see it implemented in other titles, such as Call of Duty. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-ranked-play-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The release of Black Ops 6’s ranked mode was plagued by a prominent amount of cheaters</a>, and many would like Activision to take a firmer stance like Epic’s. Since RepulseGod cheated to qualify for tournaments and win actual money, their punishment was more severe, but Call of Duty fans still want to see cheaters shamed like this.</p>



<p>What other games should see this sort of anti-cheat action? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-reportedly-planning-fortnite-roblox-style-ugc-push/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier today, the website DigiDay <a href="https://digiday.com/media/rockstar-games-talks-with-top-metaverse-creators-with-an-eye-on-making-grand-theft-auto-the-next-creator-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Rockstar Games has been meeting with Fortnite and Roblox creators, in addition to existing GTA content creators, about GTA VI and its purported push into user-generated content. The creators would be allowed to modify the game, presumably in the online component, to create wholly custom experiences for their fans.</p>
<p>According to the report, which comes from three anonymous insider sources, the conversations are still at an early stage. In fact, it's unclear if Rockstar would offer a cut of the revenue from their creation, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-is-getting-the-full-unreal-editor-later-this-year-creators-will-be-able-to-monetize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as is the case in the aforementioned games</a>.</p>
<p>Still, the developer has been making steps towards that direction for a while. The most significant instance was, of course, <a href="https://wccftech.com/previously-banned-gta-5-fivem-and-rdr2-redm-creators-are-now-part-of-rockstar-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the acquisition of Cfx.re</a>, the team behind the exceedingly popular Grand Theft Auto RP FiveM mod.</p>
<p>Pete Basgen, global gaming and esports lead for WPP agency Wavemaker, told DigiDay:</p>
<p><em>It is my firm belief that the reason that they purchased FiveM is exactly that — to spin up a metaversal universe of custom-built experiences, and potentially UGC items, with an attached UGC creator economy. It will essentially occupy that adult-enumerated space at the top of the ecosystem; there’s a very natural place there for people that graduate from Roblox and Minecraft.</em></p>
<p>Chad Mustard, COO of UGC gaming studio JOGO, added:</p>
<p><em>If Rockstar embraces UGC, it’s a game-changer, plain and simple. The demand for creator-driven experiences is already massive, and this could unlock unprecedented opportunities for studios like ours. The economics are proven, the audience is there, and we’re ready to build. This is the moment GTA creators have been waiting for.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps this could explain why, according to the Corsair Gaming CEO at least, GTA VI <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-pc-might-launch-early-next-year-according-to-corsair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might be launching sooner than we thought on PC</a>. If Rockstar really intends to push on the metaverse side of the game, it would be better to do it with as wide an audience as possible, especially since UGC and PC are practically synonymous.</p>
<p>It does seem like more developers are embracing user-generated content. Studio Wildcard did the same with ARK: Survival Ascended, opening up premium mods even on consoles. When we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-premium-mods-on-consoles-qa-by-2030-time-spent-on-ugc-will-be-way-bigger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chatted with them</a>, we learned from their partner (Overwolf's CurseForge) that they estimate playtime spent on user-generated content to be much&nbsp;bigger by the end of this decade.</p>
<p>Do you think this would be the right path for GTA VI? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/final-fantasy-commander-decks-coming-to-magic-gathering<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> Commander deck crossover. Joining similar crossovers with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/mtg-x-fallout-mutant-menace-review-and-improvements" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/doctor-who-commander-decks-will-have-50-new-cards-each" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doctor Who</em></a> are official <em>Final Fantasy</em> Commander decks, bringing iconic characters from the RPG series to the acclaimed card game.</p>

<h2>The <em>Final Fantasy</em> Commander Decks Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official report <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers" rel="nofollow">from IGN</a>, Wizards of the Coast have announced several <em>Final Fantasy</em> Commander decks coming to Magic: The Gathering. The release will include a draftable, Standard-legal set alongside four premade decks made of 100 cards. Those cards will include reprints of certain cards featuring Final Fantasy art as well as brand new Commander-format cards.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-commander-deck-character-artwork.jpg?itok=fkcYgrJO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-commander-deck-character-artwork.jpg?itok=FXj942O_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In a slight change in model, the <em>Final Fantasy</em> Commander decks aren't based around certain characters or themes, but on iconic entries of the Final Fantasy franchise.</p>

<p>The first deck, Revival Trance (Red, White, Black), is based on <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> and showcases Terra, the herald of hope. The second, Limit Break (Red, Green, White), is <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>-themed featuring the iconic Cloud Strife. Deck number three, Counter Blitz (Green, White, Blue) is based on <em>Final Fantasy X</em> and the underwater football star, Tidus. The final deck, Scions &amp; Soulcraft (White, Blue, Black) revolves around <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> and Y'shtola from the Shadowbringers expansion.</p>

<p>The report includes an interview with Wizards of the Coast about how they chose to adapt the world of <em>Final Fantasy</em>. Each deck came with its own set of challenges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How do you translate the expressive but minimal pixel art of <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> into the more expressive painterly style of <em>Magic</em>. When adapting <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, do you prioritize the PS1 original or the retelling/reimagining/remixing of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></a>? What storyline or character do you focus on from the sprawling MMO world of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>?</p>

<p>Principal Narrative Designer Dillon Deveney had some answers to these questions. For <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, they ultimately decided to capture the spirit of the 1997 original release while taking some aesthetic inspiration from the Remake games. Alternatively, the artwork for <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>&nbsp; was a combination of Yoshitaka Amano's original character concept art and the original sprite artwork.</p>

<p>The <em>Final Fantasy</em> Commander decks will be available June 13.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Elden Ring Nightreign Preview - Night Fever]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-night-fever</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-night-fever.1111680/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-night-fever<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>might be cursed with an unrepresentative name. Sure, it plays like&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, looks like&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, and even has tons of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s enemies and assets, but if there's one thing I've learned about&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>,&nbsp;it's that this ain't&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</p>

<p><em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is very much its own beast. Rather than the careful, methodical exploration of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>- and, indeed, of previous FromSoftware titles (from which you'll <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-confirmed" rel="nofollow">also spot a few enemies and bosses</a> here) -&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s action is fast-paced and frenetic from the off.</p>

<p>I managed to get a few hours with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>during its recent network test, and what I experienced was fascinating, if initially overwhelming. I'm confident this could become a real hit for Bandai Namco and FromSoftware, even if it might alienate some fans of the original.</p>

<h2>What the Heck Is&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, Anyway?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-explanation.jpg?itok=lUvGrMFS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-explanation.jpg?itok=_xrLI839 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>isn't the easiest game to figure out to begin with.</figcaption></figure><p>At first glance - and, indeed, even after a few minutes spent running around like a headless chicken in Limveld - it's hard to know exactly what&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is. In essence, it's&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fortnite" rel="nofollow"><em>Fortnite</em></a>, with a dash of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/risk-of-rain-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Risk of Rain 2</em></a>&nbsp;thrown in for good measure.</p>

<p>Don't worry, though; you won't be fighting any of your fellow players, and this isn't a battle royale game. Each round of&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>spans three days, although you'll only actually be exploring the map for two of those days. On the third, you'll fight the boss you selected as your hunt for this session.</p>

<p>In the case of the network test, that boss is Gladius, a three-headed dog you'll battle in an arena that resembles the one in which you fought Starscourge Radahn in an age past. I'm assuming the main game will come with many more beasties to wrangle.</p>

<p>Each session sees you and two other players (it is possible to play solo, but I couldn't do so during the network test) sprinting around Limveld, exploring key locations for loot while fighting whatever monsters and minibosses have taken up residence in those places.</p>

<p>The goal is to level up enough to stand a chance of taking on a bigger miniboss when night falls, and eventually to amass enough levels and gear that you can fight Gladius (or whichever boss you've elected to take on) when the three-day cycle ends.</p>

<p>As you explore, a circle will constantly shrink towards a point on the map, and being outside that circle will cause you to take constant damage, just like in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>. Once the circle has shrunk to its smallest size, the boss will appear at its epicenter.</p>

<p><em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>even has roguelike elements; runs, whether failed or successful, will net you trinkets you can use to add bonuses to your characters that persist between sessions.</p>

<h2><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>Feels Uncanny at First</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-knight.jpg?itok=JSp8YHYB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-knight.jpg?itok=hq4j1Lq5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You might be a little put off by&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s paucity of context, but stick with it.</figcaption></figure><p>My first impression of&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s gameplay loop was dizzying and confusing. Don't make the mistake of jumping in without checking out the tutorials available in the Roundtable Hold; if you're anything like me, you won't have the faintest idea what's going on, especially if your fellow players insist on sprinting ahead without waiting for you (which they probably will!).</p>

<p>Eventually, you'll get a handle on&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s zippy core loop. Get any thoughts of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>out of your head; there is no room for careful, slow exploration here.&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is all about killing as many enemies and looting as much as you can, all while watching that ever-present&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>-esque circle drawing in.</p>

<p>Rather than creating your own character, you'll have access to one of eight archetypes, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>I spent the most time with Wylder during the network test, simply because his grappling hook allowed me to close distances and zip around the map that much quicker. There should be archetypes for all play styles, though; the Guardian is a slower-paced tank, for instance, while the Recluse slings spells from a distance.</p>

<p>I won't lie: at first, I really thought I was going to hate&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>. I'm a massive fan of the original (as well as FromSoftware's other games), and&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>feels eerie and uncanny to begin with.</p>

<p>It feels like being parachuted into a particularly well-made mod; seeing Limgrave's inhabitants plopped into this space, devoid of context, felt instinctively wrong. When Margit, the Fell Omen himself appeared, I felt despair, not joy; how could this proud, stoic warrior be stripped of his backstory and forced to fight in this narrative-free arena?</p>

<p>Eventually, though, I grasped what&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is trying to do and found myself sinking into it. This isn't meant to replace FromSoftware's lore-heavy action RPG excursions; it's an accompaniment, a side dish, a little extra to tide you over while Hidetaka Miyazaki cooks.</p>

<h2>Gameplay Is King in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-spider_0.jpg?itok=rNZq4b6g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-spider_0.jpg?itok=0J27cDEL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is a gameplay-first experience, and that gameplay is... pretty fun, actually.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is all about its frantic gameplay, or at least that's the impression I got in the network test. Very little care seems to have been taken to explain what&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls</em>' Centipede Demon is doing in Limveld; instead, it's all about how you and your team are going to take him down.</p>

<p>Once you've gotten rid of that pesky voice asking why this isn't just more&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, you can start to settle into what&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is, and it turns out that&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is a tremendous amount of fun.</p>

<p>Speeding through Limveld dispatching enemies and grabbing loot without worrying about whether it'll suit your meticulously crafted build feels like cracking&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>wide open and discovering the power fantasy within.</p>

<p>Margit gave me no end of trouble in the base game, but here, my team and I took him down inside a few minutes, despite the crafty extra moves FromSoftware have outfitted him with.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong; this is still a very challenging experience, but the challenge comes from how much you were able to do inside the time limit you were given rather than from careful observation and mistake punishment.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring</em>'s core combat remains intact, too. This is still a Soulslike, so if you're an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>veteran, the basic ideas of the gameplay will be familiar to you, even if the crushing pace of the experience might be overwhelming at first.</p>

<p>The one brand new boss in the network test, the aforementioned Gladius, feels like he could stand toe-to-toe with some of <i>Elden Ring</i>'s better bosses, too. There's even a rather enjoyable moment where FromSoftware nods to the fact that it's specifically designed&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>around three-player excursions.</p>

<h2>I Want to Play More&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-gladius.jpg?itok=UQ_dChOJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-gladius.jpg?itok=vEHCu30J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I want to play more&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>A full&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>excursion, if done right, will probably take you less than two hours, and while I felt like the end couldn't come soon enough when I first started, I was desperate for more by the end.</p>

<p>In many ways, this is one of the most interesting moves FromSoftware could have taken. This is a company known for savvy asset reuse, after all, and&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is arguably the savviest. It's not just reusing visual assets; it's recontextualizing gameplay concepts as well.</p>

<p>I'm very excited to find out what other creations FromSoftware has cooked up for the full game, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">arrives on May 30th</a>. In the meantime, I'm just sore I can't head back into Limveld for one more fight against Gladius.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/avowed-dawnshore-lighthouse-obsidian-microsoft-xbox-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Avowed </em>is a vast game with some <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/papapishu.bsky.social/post/3lif7buua4s2n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weirdly complicated progression elements</a> about which the jury’s still out, but I want to praise a moment of pure, perfect simplicity. Near the beginning of the game, you encounter a lighthouse. It calls to you, not via a quest but by virtue of looking really cool and being very tall. It rules.</p><p>The lighthouse lies just off the beaten path of a harbor you arrive in after completing the game’s opening tutorial. Let’s start with the glaringly obvious: It’s a Ghibli-ass lighthouse. That, unto itself, was enough to ensnare me in its gravitational pull. My newly-acquired companion, Kai, was happy to tell me that it’d been abandoned under mysterious circumstances, which only provided additional incentive to climb it.&nbsp;</p><p>This lighthouse is ideally placed in terms of both physical location and when it appears in your journey. By this particular point, you probably haven’t jumped all that much; you’re still coming to grips with how far a regular leap will take you, how much a sprint will add to that, etc. The lighthouse is by no means a complicated climbing puzzle, but it includes just enough dicey jumps to make you tense up every time – especially as you ascend ever higher. It’s quietly thrilling in a way it wouldn’t otherwise be if it came later in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>It also wordlessly conveys a series of important mechanical messages: first and foremost, that there’s gonna be a lot of jumping and clambering in this game! More than you’re maybe used to from others in the genre. But it’s all very intentional. <em>Avowed</em>’s setting feels carefully handcrafted in a way open worlds – often characterized by interminable expanses, map size for map size’s sake – don’t always, and verticality is a big part of that. Each area is denser than it initially appears. You’ve just gotta look up.&nbsp;</p><p>The visual language of said verticality then takes center stage. Ropes dangle from surfaces you can hoist yourself up onto. Nooks and crannies give way to alternate jumping paths which lead to loot and other goodies, but you’ve gotta pause for a beat and allow your eyes to happen upon them. And, most importantly, chests and other collectibles make a shimmering noise when you’re near them – a fact you may not have internalized in the tutorial area, but which is on full display as you make your way into the combat-free lighthouse’s upper reaches.</p><p>Then you reach the top, and a couple things happen: 1) You find a treasure map, which introduces you to one of the game’s many quest types. 2) You take in the view, which is exquisite.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Obsidian</figcaption></figure><p>It’s a moment not unlike what you’d encounter in an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game, except no map markers told you to go there, nor was climbing itself functionally automated. Similarly, I didn’t take in the sights and gain a clearer understanding of the map’s scope because a cutscene grabbed me by the digital eyeballs and said “Look over there!!!” I did so because I’d put real effort into reaching that point, and I decided that I was going to make the most of it. Also, <em>Avowed</em>’s art design is so gorgeous that I found myself compelled to try viewing it from another angle, to test if it could maintain its picturesque quality. It passed with flying colors.&nbsp;</p><p>My business with the lighthouse seemingly finished, I turned my attention to the tall task of getting down. I didn’t really want to retrace my hops, skips, and jumps if I could avoid it, and then I saw precisely what I was looking for: a slight outcropping with some ropes dangling over the edge. Again, in this instance <em>Avowed </em>adds back a small amount of friction that games like <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> remove: No tutorial voice told me to take a leap of faith. In fact, as I gingerly peered out over the ledge, I saw the ocean, but also a whole lot of cliffside that I wasn’t sure even a full-speed sprint jump would allow me to clear.</p><p>But I had to try. And so I ran, leaped, and plummeted. On the way down, my character let out one of the least dignified screams I’ve ever heard from a fantasy hero. Then he crashed into the water, rattled but blessedly intact. In real life, I laughed out loud, exhaling the anxiety I’d kept pent up during both the climb and the descent.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a palpable human touch to <em>Avowed</em>’s environment design. I’m nearly certain that this is the exact experience a person wanted me to have – the full range of emotions they wanted me to feel – while maintaining the illusion that I’d happened upon all of this myself, in the course of my own exploration, and made each granular decision of my own accord. It is, like climbing an abandoned lighthouse that’s been partially reclaimed by nature, a tricky balancing act. But <em>Avowed </em>both takes the leap and sticks the landing.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/viktor-antonov-art-director-rip"><h3>RIP Viktor Antonov</h3></a><p>Antonov was one of the driving forces behind the art style of Half-Life 2 and Dishonored</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, Warhorse Studios <a href="https://x.com/KingdomComeRPG/status/1891487774571626904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> via the official Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 social channels that the game has sold over two million units in the first two weeks on the market. It had only taken one day to <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">break one million units sold</a>, although that was obviously with the help of pre-orders.</p>
<p>We don't have an official platform breakdown of the sales. However, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1771300/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Steam data</a>, owners on the largest PC platform are estimated between 1.46 million and 1.72 million, making up the vast majority of the user base. When it comes to the concurrent player peak, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has reached 256K concurrent Steam users, which is just enough to get it on the All-Time Top 50 chart ahead of Team Fortress 2.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ_GnoOjxU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week's live-streamed Q3 2024/25 earnings call</a>, Embracer Group CEO Lars Wingefors publicly praised developer Warhorse for their achievement, which is surpassing the publisher's expectations:</p>
<p><em>I'm just so happy and pleased with Warhorse and what they have executed. They <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-kingdom-come-deliverance-warhorse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined Embracer in 2019</a>, they had their vision to create a sequel of a fantastic game and we have been allowing them to pull off their vision that they wanted to do and have given them more time and the freedom to really create a masterpiece. The sales are exceeding our expectations and even my a bit higher expectations, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is actually achieving that, so I think it's a 'well done'. I'm really happy to see it. Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, and the first one for that matter as well, will continue generating substantial revenues for us for many years to come.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, Warhorse is <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-will-get-official-mod-support-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning</a> to release mod tools soon, which should undoubtedly increase the game's longevity on PC. Moreover, there's a whole 2025 roadmap that they already <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-gets-2025-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">communicated</a>: barbers, horse racing, and Hardcore Mode in Spring; the Brushes with Death premium DLC in Summer; the Legacy of the Forge premium DLC in Autumn; and the Mysteria Ecclesiae premium DLC in Winter.</p>
<p>For our detailed review of the game, featuring a perfect score from Chris Wray, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">head to this article</a>.</p>

<p>Kaizen Game Works is known for Paradise Killer. In our<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/10/02/paradise-killer-review-pc-switch/"> Paradise Killer review</a>, Miguel wrote,&nbsp;<em>“Paradise Killer is a pure, unguided detective mystery that doesn’t dare hold your hand. You, and you alone, are in charge of seeking out not only the truth of this locked room murder, but the truth of the wild and cosmically corrupt world that the game takes place in. The open ended nature of the investigation can be daunting at first, and while some clunky platforming and frequent periods of downtime can sour the experience just a bit, Paradise Killer still manages to be one of the most well put together and utterly satisfying mystery games I’ve ever experienced.”</em></p>

His phantom versions can pop out and surprise you throughout the campaign, and it seems like that particular facet of Morgott made it into Nightreign, where an unnamed Fell Omen (essentially an upgraded Morgott) can jump-scare invade players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Morgott isn't the only boss that can invade your squad as you run through Nightreign, he is a very fitting invader. Not only does it line up with his surprise appearances in Elden Ring, but he even gets some extra voice lines and a few new moves to throw at you. If you get to bring two pals to the fight, it's only fair Morgott gets some new moves!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While he can invade you, the Fell Omen can also appear as an end-of-night boss, one of the conclusive fights you can face as the sun sets in the Elden Ring Nightreign test.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">How did morgott even manage to sneak into nightreign to fight us. generational hater this is like the 5th time <a href="https://t.co/t7euCmkBRy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/t7euCmkBRy</a></p>— Nightreign Countdown (@SoulsCountdowns) <a href="https://twitter.com/SoulsCountdowns/status/1890945931912036486?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 16, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Plenty of early testers, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/let-me-solo-her-elden-ring-community-hero">including the player behind Let Me Solo Her</a>, took on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3wS3s5omcW0?si=v92LESpAKaVPlKie&amp;t=2070" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Fell Omen during the Elden Ring Nightreign sessions</a> that took place over the weekend.

Whether as a night boss, on an elevator, or in a tower, Morgott seems ready to appear wherever, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zulliethewitch.bsky.social/post/3licizequas2i" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with some potentially hilarious consequences</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fell Omen's sudden invasions have hopes high for other enemies to suddenly appear and attack the players. The Pursuer from Dark Souls 2, for example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1iqa3pv/comment/mczm1t4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">would make a great candidate</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-hackers-tear-through-billions-of-possibilities-to-debunk-a-15-year-old-record-speedrun-no-one-thought-could-be-beaten<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Speedrunning has been a time-honored tradition of video game enjoyers for years, with some records being held not just for months or years, but even decades. One particular legendary Diablo run, though, has been the subject of scrutiny, an intense investigation, and now a thorough debunking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2009, Maciej "Groobo" Maselewski recorded an Any% segmented run, as the Sorcerer, made up of 27 segments. The final time, at three minutes and 12 seconds, appeared on Speed Demos Archive, where no concerns were raised, and was subsequently published on February 26, 2009. It would garner two Guinness World Record entries, and Diablo speedrun attempts would proceed to decline as the run seemed nigh-impossible to challenge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the years went on, though, scepticism arose. In 2024, speedrunner Funkmastermp approached Allan "dwangoAC" Cecil to create a Tool-Assisted Speedrun, or TAS, of Diablo. Longtime Games Done Quick viewers will recognize dwangoAC as team leader for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/04/sgdqs-most-mindblowing-speedrun-wasnt-humanly-possible">TASBot</a>, the fun mascot that would appear during TAS blocks at GDQ's charity events.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team got to work, and <a href="https://diablo.tas.bot/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as detailed in a lengthy writeup by dwangoAC and other team members</a>, started to discover inconsistencies as they attempted to replicate Groobo's run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We just had a lot of curiosity and resentment that drove us to dig even deeper," team member Staphen told <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/the-diablo-hackers-that-debunked-a-record-speedrun/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ars Technica in a report detailing their investigation</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because Diablo uses seeds to generate maps, it should theoretically have been possible to replicate Groobo's run. To discover the seed Groobo used, the TAS team <a href="https://github.com/Matthew-petroff/diablo-mapgen" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built a custom map tool</a> that could reverse-engineer game seeds and determine the map, item, and quest possibilities therein. Then, a scanner tool built on top of it could sift through all the seeds and search for dungeons that might suit speedrunners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team searched across roughly 2.2 billion RNG seeds, attempting to recreate Groobo's run, and couldn't find one that imitated all the seemingly perfect generation. It seemed to indicate this wasn't made up of segments from a single file or run, but from different runs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The deeper they dug, the more oddities popped up; strange version markers in the main menu, inconsistent inventories, quests, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a final conclusion, the team said its discoveries demonstrate Groobo used "illegitimate means to produce the results shown in the run," including combining gameplay from different runs, modifying memory, and using "gameplay-removing video splices."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Overall, the team's analysis conclusively reveals the run was not possible as Groobo described without disqualifying modifications," the team said. "The run should therefore be immediately retracted from all leaderboards."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The writeup goes on to detail a response from Groobo, who told <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-hacker-who-hunts-video-game-speedrunning-cheaters/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wired</a>: "My run is a segmented/spliced run. It always has been and it was never passed off as anything else, nor was it part of any competition or leaderboards. The speeddemosarchive page states that outright."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The investigation team presented its analysis to Speed Demos Archive, which then discussed the findings independently with Groobo. On September 10, 2024, SDA posted an update announcing the removal of all Diablo runs by Groobo. The Diablo speedrunning community, meanwhile, kicked back into gear and started setting new records.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At a presentation, as reported by Ars Technica, dwangoAC said he pursued the investigation because "it did harm."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Groobo's alleged cheating in 2009 completely stopped interest in speedrunning this category," Cecil said. "No one tried, no one could."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sometimes to chill out I watch timelapse videos of ocean creatures such as starfish colonising patches of sea floor. Perhaps they're gracefully <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG17TsgV_qI">devouring a seal's carcass</a>, or moving to escape a lethal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcUouLOmQuU">descending finger of ice</a>. Look, I'm quite a morbid guy, but 'beauty of nature' and all that.
</p>
<p>
It turns out there's an equivalent in Warhorse's recent RPG-palooza <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>: drop dozens of items in a random town square, and passing NPCs will gradually gather them all up according to preferences dictated by class. Here's a video showing that in action, created by Redditor Mcloganator, with three thousand groschen worth of goods to harvest.

<p>
Hypnotic, yes? We could do with this kind of thing in Bethesda games. The Reddit video has now been circulated on the Xeetbox, and Warhorse programmer and open world scripter Patrik Papšo has chimed in with some thoughts about the social systems powering such wholesome feats of litter collection.
</p>
<p>
"Haha, that's an NPC behaviour I made!" he <a href="https://x.com/BlueX_ow/status/1890444455028600836">wrote</a>. "They choose what they pick based on the value of the item and their social status. That's why nobles might ignore cheap items, but beggars will pick them up." Under the game's node-based AI system, Papšo <a href="https://x.com/BlueX_ow/status/1890788009802350674">explained</a> in a subsequent tweet, when an NPC sees an object dropped by a player, the system checks its price against the NPC's own "social multiplier", then checks to see if another NPC is already picking it up. 
</p>
<p>
Papšo also has some insights in that tweet thread about roads-not-taken. For example, Warhorse once had a system whereby if you dropped a stolen item, the original owner might spot it and trace the theft back to you. The developers cut this feature, however, because it was too difficult for players discarding dozens of items to make the connection between a particular item and suddenly being accused of a crime. There was also once a bug whereby if an NPC "reserved" an object for collection and the player picked it up first, they might filch it from your inventory instead.
</p>
<p>
The soothing, glacial spectacle of Kuttenberg townsfolk swarming a heap of worn-out gambesons aside, I like all this because I can imagine a game where NPCs actively acquire, exchange or discard objects, and you entertain yourself simply following an object's passage from hand to hand. Imagine somebody nicking your favourite boots early on, and flogging them over the black market. A few dozen hours later, you spy somebody else innocently wearing them while traversing a mountain pass.
</p>
<p>
There's probably a simulation that does this? Right now, I can think only of how dwarves claim items for their own use in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>.

<p>FromSoftware’s newest project is an interesting tie-in with Bandai Namco. Let’s find out everything we know about Elden Ring Nightreign, its release date, price tag, and much more.</p>



<p>Elden Ring Nightreign gets more surprising by the second. The Game Awards 2024 took everyone by surprise with the announcement of Nightreign. It was even more shocking to realize it’s a collaboration between FromSoftware and giants Bandai Namco! But we’ve learned from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/after-technical-problems-more-elden-ring-nightreign-test-sessions-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nightreign Network Test</a> the new Souls title is a fascinating battle royale and roguelike hybrid.</p>



<p>It’s not a full-scale release, but it has enough content to keep you busy for a few months. That said, let’s dig through the dirt.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-elden-ring-nightreign-coming-out">When is Elden Ring Nightreign Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We were just passing through, good sir. Credit to FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign is gearing up for a May 30 release date worldwide.</strong></p>



<p>Early indications suggest Early Access isn’t happening for <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>. None of its editions or pre-order incentives include mention of playing Nightreign early. This makes May 30 a global launch for FromSoftware and Bandai Namco’s joint title. </p>



<p>Let the wait for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign’s release date</a> commence—Tarnished.</p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-platforms">Elden Ring Nightreign Release Date Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Old-gen users will be pleased to learn Elden Ring Nightreign is debuting on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>2022’s Elden Ring also launched on the mentioned formats. However, it’s three years later, and many developers and publishers now opt to skip the PS4 and Xbox One. It’s not the case here, so if you’ve been able to play Elden Ring before, you’ll be able to endure the nightly grid of Elden Ring Nightreign without a fuss.</p>



<p>Additionally, I<em> </em>would be remiss to mention the Nintendo Switch misses out. It’s not much of a shock, but there’s no mention of Nightreign coming to Nintendo Switch. We’ll keep our Two Fingers crossed for a future port to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-editions-amp-price">Elden Ring Nightreign Release Date Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign Standard Edition, Deluxe Edition, Seeker’s Edition, and Collector’s Edition are releasing to give fans a tough decision over which one to buy. They clock in at $39.99/£34.99, $54.99/£47.99, $59.99/£49.99, and $199.99/£179.99. </strong></p>



<p>There’s no typo here: <strong>Four editions</strong> are available for Elden Ring Nightreign. Each caters to the level of satisfaction you want from your Nightreign experience.</p>



<p>Check out every edition below and its price for a quick table to consult.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Elden RIng Nightreign Edition</th><th data-align="center">Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Standard Edition</td><td data-align="center">$39.99 or £34.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Deluxe Edition</td><td data-align="center">$54.99 or £47.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"> Seeker’s Edition</td><td data-align="center">$59.99 or £49.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Collector’s Edition</td><td data-align="center">$199.99 or £179.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<hr>



<p>I’m looking forward to Nightreign as a Souls fan. I’m obviously never getting a Bloodborne remake, so a new Elden Ring spin-off should suffice. Should this be the end of Elden RIng after this, freeing up FromSftware a new title?</p>

Doubly so if the competitor is a blindfolded speedrunner who can't see the chat telling him that his webcam is off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, as spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-mario/blindfolded-super-mario-64-speedrunner-gets-near-world-record-pace-doesnt-realize-the-runs-been-invalidated-by-a-broken-webcam-until-its-already-over/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a>, speedrunner Bubzia was working on beating the world record for a blindfolded 70-star run in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a>. It's a record he set himself last June at one hour, 25 minutes, and 11 seconds. He'd spent days — 72, at the time of this incident — trying to topple his own record. And on February 10, while on good pace to break his record, Bubzia's webcam shut off.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Yesterday, it finally happened. My webcam died in the beginning of a 70 Star run, and I did not know until I finished an hour later. Luckily, it was a few seconds behind World Record 😅😅 <a href="https://t.co/7BJzFwYHVH" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/7BJzFwYHVH</a></p>— Bubzia (@Bubzia1) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bubzia1/status/1889231128441106440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Bubzia had been having some difficulties with his webcam before the run started. "That's a new one, dude," he said in a run prior to the big one, where his webcam turned off about one minute and 34 seconds in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The heartbreaker in question would happen after, at 23 minutes and 59 seconds into a really solid run. You can check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svH7ru0XzWQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube VOD</a> of his run to see the chat, in real-time, react. "This could be the funniest WR," one person in chat said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The facecam is crucial because it's required for the run to be valid. On <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/sm64ce?h=Blindfolded-70-star&amp;x=xd17xo7d-38do6x0l.814d20e1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Speedrun.com rules and regulations</a>, it specifically states: "The player must be visibly devoid of sight during the gameplay, i.e. something must be covering the eyes." Ergo, if you couldn't verify Bubzia had his eyes covered the entire time, the run would not qualify.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having a back-up of some kind, like a notification, might be a thought. But the second category-specific rule says runners can't have any assistance from other people. This includes hints from a Discord call or text-to-voice chat. After the first webcam failure, Bubzia confirmed he had "everything disabled" to alert him in case of a failure, and had received multiple Discord DMs trying to catch his attention while running.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some viewers, it might be agonizing to watch someone run a game for over an hour, unaware their attempt has been invalid since the 24-minute mark. Bubzia's chat even leaned into the irony, hoping for the runner to <em>not </em>set a world record, to avoid the heartbreak when the blindfold came off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So in that way, it may have been a relief that Bubzia's time came in a few seconds behind the world record. The pace clock concluded at 1:26:09, almost a full minute behind Bubzia's standing record.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If this would have been world record, I would have cried," Bubzia said, after taking off his blindfold and realizing the facecam had been off. "Dude, I would have quit SM64, man." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can follow more attempts from Bubzia, whose facecam is currently working at the time of this writing, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Bubzia" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on his Twitch here</a>.

            <p>
Characters from Mortal Kombat will finally be able to square up against Street Fighter legends such as Ryu, Chun-Li and Guile - within <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games' ever-popular battle royale will be the first video game to officially feature characters from both fighting game franchises, when Mortal Kombat crosses over with Fortnite next season. 
</p>
<p>
The announcement that Mortal Kombat would feature in Fortnite came via artwork teasing the game's next battle pass character line-up - in which ice ninja Sub-Zero will star.

<p>
Street Fighter characters have already been part of Fortnite for several years, of course - with Ryu and Chun-Li added as Shop skins back in February 2021, before their fellow fighters Cammy, Guile, Blanka and Sakura all arrived a short time after.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite even paid tribute to Mortal Kombat during this weekend's eye-catching mini live event, which featured a fight to the death between antihero Daigo and demon boss Hunter X. 
</p>
<p>
The showdown, a culmination of Fortnite Chapter 6's story so far, included a moment where Daigo appeared to have been skewered by Hunter X's sword - though there was no Fatality here. Instead, the masked fighter fought back, ultimately appearing to defeat Hunter X for good after slicing off his arm. You can watch the full event below:

<p>Fortnite being Fortnite, of course, there is no blood - or any realistic-looking violence at all. So, it will be interesting to see the extent to which Mortal Kombat's famously gory antics get translated here.</p>
<p>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 is set to arrive later this week, on 21st February, and feature a criminals theme. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-new-crime-season-will-let-you-play-as-a-giant-pickle">Other new character skins are set to include a giant pickle</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Earth has been completely wrecked by a malevolent company ironically branded as Rebirth. Once seen as a final hope against climate change, the STRATOS towers that they had their workers build only worsened the forces of nature in a coordinated action, leaving even more apocalyptic storms to ravage what’s left of mankind. And what of the remains of civilisation? Just as Rebirth’s lie was uncovered, they hijacked all of the exo-rigs of their workers, turning them on innocent civilians and protestors.</p>


<p>You’re one of those who was able to break free, detaching your suit from the network and joining the resistance movement as the towers start to ominously come back online. Your role is to head out into Colton County, scavenge for valuable resources from Rebirth and the general area, and bring it back to base.</p>
<p>Sharkmob –&nbsp;last seen with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/11/bloodhunt-review-ps5-vampire-the-masquerade/">Vampire: The Masquerade –&nbsp;Bloodhunt battle royale</a> –&nbsp;has created a large open world map for their extraction shooter to take place in. It goes beyond roads being littered with abandoned and destroyed vehicles, with bridges having collapsed, the terrain having shifted, and now with major weather events just rolling into the world every ten minutes or so. And when I say major, I’m talking fire tornados, incessant lightning storms that make wearing a lot of metal feel really, really dumb, and more.</p>


<p>As they roll through the world, they’re both a danger and a boon to you. They can transform parts of the map and reveal new points of interest and loot, or more fundamentally, they will often kick up the wind so that you can use just hop up, trigger your paraglide and zoom across the world – it’s great for getting around quickly. Combined with your exo-rig’s grappling hook, this really gives off echoes of mid-2010s Call of Duty and Just Cause here.</p>
<p>Deploying into Coulton County, you pick and choose what gear to take with you. You can have a main gun and sidearm, you need to pack ammo, health kits, a daypack for a larger inventory, and throwables and tactical gear. These are paired with exo-rigs that each have distinct abilities, such as a ground-pounding attack or a force of wind that can knock enemies away.</p>
<p>The first thing to decide is where you actually want to go and what to do&nbsp;–&nbsp;you’ve got 20 minutes before Rebirth can run a trace and reveal your location to other players, and you’re dropping into a dynamic world where teams can join partway through. Opening up the map reveals the scale of this region, but there’s also just a bunch of vague icons and points of interest that don’t really mean that much to me yet – there’s a series of assignments and missions, but early on, they’re things like “extract successfully 2 times”.</p>
<p>This is PvPvE, so heading to map markers will have you running into NPCs to fight, often human, but sometimes Rebirth’s robots and drones. On one occasion, we happened across a downed Rebirth VTOL that had a door to hack open as we fended up a steady stream of bipedal bots, suicide balls and larger minigun bots. We booked it out of there as soon as we’d emptied the cache of its rewards… not least because the VTOL self destructed moments after the doors opened!</p>

<p>It’s tricky to distinguish between the human NPCs and real players, though. Most of our run-ins with other players felt like they were a complete surprise, where the main distinguishing factors were their approach to combat and that they would be downed instead of simply killed off. Of course, if they’re shooting down on an exfiltration point from an overlooking bridge, you can put 2 and 2 together to figure out they’re other players springing a trap.</p>
<p>There’s that rush and relief if you manage to get away as another team tries to take you out, alternating with the annoyance and loss of being wiped out at the last moment. That’s the genre, though, and if you don’t make it out, it’s not just your loot that you’re leaving behind, but all of your gear as well. You’ll then have to buy it all again, or draw from your stash of exo-rigs, guns and other gear.</p>
<p>If you’re on a bad run, that can really sap all of your reserves, and there’s no way to insure your gear against loss. Instead Exoborne has a fallback baseline Exo that can’t be modded, can’t have equipment, but has that core functionality, letting you go scavenging on the entry-level map and tiers without risk.</p>

<p>We’ve only scratched the surface of what Exoborne offers, and from our handful of runs during the latest Exoborne playtest, I think there’s something potentially really appealing to this take on the genre. It’s toeing that line between mil-sims and sci-fi shenanigans, having to lean heavily on the ostentatious weather effects to stand out from that generic military feel, but then that should appeal to a certain cachet of gamers who decry over-the-top cosmetics. Also, the audio-visual feedback as you land shots and crack armour is right up there with the best of them.</p>
<p>Oh, and I’m happy to report that jumping into the rotor of the extraction VTOL will down you immediately.</p>
