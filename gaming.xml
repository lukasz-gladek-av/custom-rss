Retro is, after all, the original developer of the Prime series, and while many of the veteran team members have since left, the sheer quality of the fourth entry on Switch 2 demonstrates that the studio is still one of the very best in the business.</p>
<p>The folks over at Retro didn't do it alone, though. As highlighted in the game's credits sequence, many separate companies lent their talents to the development of Prime 4, including Next Level Games and Virtuos.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>Next Level Games, as you may know, is already familiar with the Prime series, having worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/metroid_prime_federation_force">Metroid Prime: Federation Force</a> for the 3DS in 2016. As of 2021, it's a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nintendo alongside Retro Studios itself. The specific developers at Next Level Games credited as helping out on Prime 4 were Matt McTavish, Cavin Yen, Mark Blanchin, and Christopher Rice.</p>
<p>Here are the teams listed in the credits:</p>

<p>Meanwhile, longtime producer Kensuke Tanabe at Nintendo also provided the text for the in-game scans, while Samus herself is now voiced by Erin Yvette with motion capture by Krystle Martin. Fans of the series will know that Jennifer Hale had previously provided the voiceover for Samus in the original Prime trilogy.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a> for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond for the Switch 2, we said that it "manages to replicate that magical sense of discovery from the GameCube original while pushing the series in some incredible new directions", awarding it a score of 9/10.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p>I’ve been waiting a long time for this. Ever since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a> ended on a slight cliffhanger (provided you obtained the 100% completion rating) back in 2007, I’ve been wondering where exactly Nintendo and Retro Studios might take the series next. 18 years would follow, and that’s an awful long time to formulate an idea of what the perfect sequel might look like.</p>
<p>Now that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is finally here, it’s absolutely nothing like I’d imagined – and that’s a good thing. What Retro Studios has delivered might well be the studio’s finest work yet, and it’s certainly up there as one of the very best Metroid games of all time.</p>
<figure><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160796/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I should say, however, that I think this game may prove divisive. Retro has successfully replicated that magical feeling of discovery from the GameCube original, but it’s also taken some pretty wild swings with Beyond’s new open-world hub, high-speed motorbike traversal, and yes, Galactic Federation companions. I’m not sure everybody is going to get along with it like I did, but what I do know is that Beyond feels like a natural evolution of Corruption. The Prime games have set themselves apart from the rest of the series by expanding Samus’ world to introduce more and more side characters, and this latest entry takes this concept further than ever.</p>
<p>To illustrate, Beyond kicks off on the planet Tanamaar, with Samus fighting alongside a host of Federation troopers against an attack from Sylux and their Space Pirate cronies. It’s a great sequence to get reacquainted with your beam attacks, missiles, morph ball, and double jump before most of it gets ripped away in classic Metroid style. Y’see, following a confrontation with Sylux, Samus gets transported to the mysterious world of Viewros, seemingly alone in a hostile environment stuffed with creatures looking to kill you.</p>
<p>What follows is an intriguing mystery that introduces the brand-new Lamorn race, which is essentially Prime 4's Chozo. Uncovering what happened to the Lamorn is a joy, and you don't need any prior series knowledge to enjoy this story. Phazon's out, Dark Samus is out, and Sylux gets enough screen time as the new Big Bad. Fans will adore it, but newcomers can get right on board, too.</p>
<figure><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160792/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The first thing that leapt out when wandering around the lush opening section of Fury Green was just how beautiful Beyond really is. Environments and creatures are brought to life like never before, with accompanying lighting and particle effects making this the best-looking game Nintendo has ever published. The art design is simply astonishing, constantly compelling you to just stop and soak it all in, which was easy given how much there is to uncover with the Scan Visor. Go back to (the lovely-looking) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Prime Remastered</a> and you'll see just how much of a step up this is.</p>
<p>The visuals are augmented by the incredible soundtrack, which is comfortably the best since the original Prime. You've likely already heard the Fury Green theme from trailers, but every major biome rocks its own awesome variant, from the thumping, electrically-charged Volt Forge to the calming, ethereal Base Camp. I quite literally sat for about 10 minutes just vibing in the latter, and with the combined effects of the art style and audio, it was the first of many moments where I thought, <em>'Okay, yes, this is a really special game.'</em> It's the kind of thing you just know you'll be going back to in 10, 20 years' time.</p>

<p>The enemies and boss characters are comfortably some of the best, most grotesque in series history, and the battles that ensue are equally thrilling and challenging. Even better, they're all completely new and don’t lean on nostalgia – sorry Ridley, maybe next time. There are <em>loads</em> of different enemy types, including the ferocious Grievers, the exploding Pyremite, and the deadly Psy-Bots. I only wish there was a 3D model feature like Prime Remastered to better appreciate their incredible designs.</p>
<p>Provided you have the right setup, you can choose between two performance modes on Switch 2: Quality at 4K/60fps (1080p handheld) or Performance at 1080p/120fps (720p handheld). The bump up to 120fps in Performance Mode is certainly noticeable, but not half as much as the resulting downgrade in resolution. As such, I spent the vast majority of the time in Quality Mode; it looks absolutely gorgeous in 4K while docked, with performance that appeared locked at 60fps with no noticeable dips. Trust me, you’ll want the highest resolution possible for this game.</p>
<figure><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160789/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You've also got several different control methods from the off, including dual-stick aiming and motion aiming. Opt for the former, and you use the analogue sticks for your movement, while gyro aiming can help with fine-tuning. Mouse controls are also featured for both options, so if you're playing with the Joy-Con 2 detached, you can put the right controller side-down to immediately activate mouse mode. It's a little erratic at first, so you'll probably need to bring the sensitivity down a bit, but it feels pretty great. Overall, my control method of choice remained dual-sticks with a Pro Controller, but all options feel perfectly viable.</p>
<p>In typical Metroid fashion, you’ll be exploring various biomes throughout the world of Viewros, including the luscious forest of Fury Green, the frozen laboratories of Ice Belt, and much more. In addition to familiar abilities and armaments — missiles, grapple beam, morph ball — Samus gains a host of new psychic powers early on. This includes the ability to move devices remotely and open up paths, hurl your morph ball bombs at enemies and bomb slots from a distance, and directly manipulate the direction of your ‘Control Beam’ to hit multiple targets at once.</p>
<figure><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160798/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In pre-release trailers depicting the psychic powers, I was worried that they might prove gimmicky, but this isn’t the case. It makes for some really cool sequences, including (but not limited to) the new Psychic Boost Rails, which hurl you around the environment on an almost-but-not-quite invisible path; perfect for locating those coveted Missile Expansions. Think of the Magatsu Rail from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/shin_megami_tensei_v_vengeance">Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</a>, and you’re on the right track.</p>
<p>Of course, you’ll also gain new weapons on your travels, and these work a little differently this time. In the past, you’d acquire new beams while your standard missiles would remain the default sub-weapon. In Beyond, your Power Beam is maintained throughout, while elemental beams — specifically Fire, Ice, and Thunder — are mapped to the missile input and require their own ammo called Shots.</p>
<p>So, in addition to Missile Expansions, you’ll also be on the lookout for Shot Expansions. I was concerned this might limit my approach to battles if I’m constantly worried about running out of ammo, but truthfully, you’ll find so many expansions on your travels, depleting your supplies is never a major concern.</p>

<p>Travelling from one biome to another is also a little (a lot) different this time around. A few hours in, you’ll gain access to Vi-O-La, an awesome futuristic motorbike that comes equipped with boost abilities and projectile weapons. It controls like a dream, too, with light touches of ‘L’ allowing you to slide and turn sharp corners at will. Upgrades found in the environment add more boosts to your arsenal, and soon you’ll be racing from one end of the hub world to the other in no time at all.</p>
<p>Sol Valley itself is a pretty vast area, and at first it felt completely empty, but looks can be deceiving. In addition to connecting the major locations necessary to progress the story, Sol Valley also includes a bunch of Shrines (yes, there’s that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> influence), Galactic Federation debris sites, and dozens upon <em>dozens</em> of Green Crystal clusters that you simply drive through at speed to collect.</p>
<p>Ultimately, including such a meaty open world amongst the usual labyrinthine biomes is a stroke of genius on Retro's part. Think about how previous Metroid games (or really <em>any</em> Metroidvania titles) work: completely different environments will be separated by a mere door or an elevator, and while this works perfectly well from a gameplay perspective, logically it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.</p>
<figure><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 7 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160794/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>What Sol Valley demonstrates is that these games don't need to be confined to dense corridors for the duration of the experience. You can open up the world, make the biomes link together more logically, and still maintain the essence of that classic Metroid experience. I can't wait to see how it influences the genre going forward.</p>
<p>Like the missiles, energy tanks, and whatnot, those Green Crystals found in Sol Valley are a finite resource. You’ll need to nab the whole lot to bag some sweet rewards, but the game introduces some neat little perks later on that make this a lot easier than you might think. Truth be told, this is possibly the most approachable Metroid game ever, since hidden Scout Bots located in each environment can also ping their radars and reveal the locations of any undiscovered items on your map. Granted, you won’t be able to activate these until much, <em>much</em> later in the game, but it makes chasing that 100% completion rating a lot more digestible than ever before.</p>

<p>As you make your way across Viewros, you’ll also run into a handful of Galactic Federation troopers: Myles Mackenzie, Reger Tokabi, Nora Armstrong, Ezra Duke, and VUE-995. Honestly, none of them are even remotely as irritating as previews suggested, and I genuinely came to enjoy their presence. There are brief moments where one or two might join you in the fight, but these are kept to a minimum, and Retro wisely ditches them before they outstay their welcome. Overall, the dialogue is a lot stronger than anything seen in Corruption, and the voice actors do a wonderful job at bringing them to life.</p>
<p>But this is also where my one little nitpick comes in. While exploring Sol Valley, Myles will occasionally ping you on the radio to let you know what you should be doing next. Whether it’s making your way to your next objective or heading back to Base Camp to activate a new beam upgrade, Myles is essentially Prime 4’s Navi from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">Ocarina of Time</a> - always there to nudge you in the right direction.</p>
<p>It’s not as frequent as you might fear — once you’ve heard him once, that’ll be it until your next major outing on Vi-O-La — but I’d love it if Retro Studios could add the ability to mute him completely. Sometimes I just want to ride around in peace, y’know?</p>
<figure><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 9 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160795/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I did find myself longing for a couple of extra features: namely, the ability to change the bike's colour and to listen to some custom music while roaming about. Well, these are both here... if you buy the amiibo.</p>
<p>The Vi-O-La figure unlocks skins for your ride, while Samus adds the Vi-O-La Radio, letting you toggle through a small selection of banging Metroid-themed tunes. It's frankly irritating that Nintendo decided to lock these features behind amiibo; they should have been in the game by default, no question. The Sylux amiibo apparently unlocks a specific cutscene early, which you'll otherwise need to 100% the game to see. All other Metroid series amiibo just play a random Metroid-themed jingle.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, I’ve beaten the game with 100% items and 97% logbook scans, and this has taken me roughly 16 hours (don’t worry, I'm already looking for that remaining 3%). Keep in mind that I’ve sped through for review, so playing through at your own, slower pace could nudge your time to over 20 hours if you’re after absolutely everything; mainlining the story may shave it down to around 10 hours.</p>

<p>I’d recommend finding all collectibles if you can, though, since this will uncover everything in the game’s Gallery section, which is filled with concept art from Beyond’s development – it’s a lovely behind-the-scenes look at a game that’s been heavily shrouded in mystery for years.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>After 18 years of waiting, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond manages to replicate that magical sense of discovery from the GameCube original while pushing the series in some incredible new directions. Separating the main biomes with a vast open world sounds ridiculous on paper, but the slick traversal provided by Vi-O-La makes exploration more satisfying than ever.</p>
<p>Combine this with the stunning art direction, ferocious new boss characters, and a surprisingly endearing squad of Federation troopers, and Beyond is quite possibly the boldest, most well-realised Metroid game to date. Make no mistake, the long wait has been more than worth it. Welcome back, Samus.</p></section>

            <title><![CDATA[Outward 2 Preview – Doubling down on the Outward concept]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/02/outward-2-preview/</link>
            <guid>1370359</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The original Outward was well received by players with its offering of an RPG with survival elements, where the world was dangerous and you had to use your wits to survive and make progress. Outward 2 looks to continue on and build on those foundations, making for a more densely packed and more dangerous experience as a result, and still without the compromises of fast travel or quest markers.&nbsp;We sat down with Guillaume Boucher-Vidal, the CEO and creative director of Nine Dots Studio, and producer Natasha Collin to play the alpha build of Outward 2, and find out what is in store for players.</p>
<p><iframe title="OUTWARD 2 - Official Release Window Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PKSH4d-iN-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“One of the four pillars of what we wanted to improve in Outward 2 was character creation, increase the the role play opportunities and like being who you wanted. And part of it is that we have three starting areas and they all come with a very different Quest that explains how a regular person ends up living a life of an adventurer.”, said Guillaume as we checked out the creation screen.</p>


<p>Players of Outward will be happy to know there are a lot more options available when designing your character to allow you to make them more personal, from body shape, skin colour, hair colour, styles, and various body markings. Once you have crafted how your character looks you then pick their base skill set and attributes. For those of you who really want a challenge, Deadbeat will provide you with the weakest and most vulnerable character build. While it is Guillaume’s favourite, he steered me away from that, so I settled on a book loving brute instead. Your choices will impact the dialogue options open to you and how some quests may play out, as well as your general survival skills in the world. When it comes to factions, you can only join one out and that is your faction for life. You can also not become an expert in every ability, so the decisions you make on which skills to learn need to be carefully thought through so you focus on a particular playstyle.</p>


<p>For this playthrough of Outward 2, we started in the new location of Haboob, a city which was cut off from the world for centuries surrounded by large flora and a persistent sandstorm. Only those who are exiled seem to leave the walls of the city, and for good reason. There is danger pretty much everywhere outside the walls for anyone unprepared. What you notice about Haboob is its distinct style of interesting architecture pierced with a purple lighting interspersed around, and a perpetual sandstorm above the vast cave system in which the city is located. This is one of three starting areas and depending on your choices you may not see Haboob until much later in the game.</p>
<p>You have your own apartment in Haboob, a market nearby where you can purchase items and weapons, and an opportunity to make a name for yourself, except that all comes crashing down after your first night because of Sebastian. In this story, you wake up to find a guard in your chambers looking for something only for Sebastian to kill him and place the smoking gun in your hands before disappearing. This is where the clock starts ticking as you only have 18 in-game days to track Sebastian down and prove your innocence or lose everything. Each day lasts an hour, so 18 hours seems like plenty of time to save your home, except Outward 2 is not forgiving when it comes to time. If you sleep, which you will need to, you will lose those hours. If you lose a fight and get knocked unconscious, you will lose time and have to deal with whatever situation you have woken up in.</p>
<p>There is no death in Outward 2, unless you play the Hardcore mode, where losing consciousness comes with a 20% chance of your save being permanently deleted. But for a regular playthrough, just because there’s no death doesn’t mean there’s no challenge. Depending on where you fall and your luck you may wake up in a friendly situation or in a dangerous one. In one situation I was found by the Menders, a group of helpers and healers that travel Auriel. They are also one of the factions you can join. They mended me up and even gave me information about Sebastian that I could use.</p>
<p>This was actually the first time Guillaume and Rebecca had seen this scenario play out, which was exciting for them too. I asked about how many different defeat scenarios would be in Outward 2. Guillaume responds, saying, “Hey, it’s a tough question. Like a lot, really? A lot. We need them because we die often and so if you keep seeing the same things it eventually gets frustrating. And we need different defeat scenarios for every dungeon as well. So like, that’s why it’s not a cutscene or something. It’s just a little bit of text.”</p>

<p>Two of the criticisms that were levied at Outward included combat being stiff and the world itself be relatively sparse leading to prolonged sections of nothing happening. Guillaume and the team took those comments to heart, and the world in Outward will be more exciting to explore while retaining a similar size to the original’s map. On map Guillaume says, “The emptiness is one of those four pillars. The first one was character creation. The second one is making a world which is more alive. And so to do that, it has to be a bit more filled. You need to have a bit more random events, to have encounters that are not hostile, to populate visually the world a bit more. It will never be as packed as, say, one of those Ubisoft type worlds where you’ve got, like, every 30 seconds you got something coming at you. We’re not trying to do that. But even as you walk around in the city, I feel like it’s luscious. It has lot of places to visit, and when you’re outside, it is more dense than the first. We’ve got it similar in scope, but because it is more packed, it feels significantly bigger.</p>
<p>“[There are] four regions, four cities, lots of dungeons spread across regions. Normally, we calculated we have a budget of about six to eight dungeons, like major dungeons per area, and then we have many, what we call micro dungeons, so interesting destinations that might not take you an hour to just go through.”</p>
<p>Combat in Outward 2 has been improved with weapons have a wider variety of moves depending on direction inputs, and you can carry different combinations of weapons to inflict damage on enemies. For my playthrough I had a small axe in one hand and an ice pick in another, allowing for quicker attacks. Later, I equipped a trident that allowed slower but more powerful attacks, while also providing ways to evade incoming attacks. Locking on to enemies and moving around them gives a fluid feel to fights, but for some fights you do need to prep.</p>
<p>At one point, we came across a ghost in a cave, which could not be defeated with conventional methods. Guillaume took old clothing, tore it into linen, attached it to a stick, doused it in oil, and set it on fire, as the ghost was susceptible to fire magic. Outward 2 is a game where you have to think logically to come up with solutions or suffer the consequences. I drank straight from a stream which gave my character indigestion, but had I boiled the water, I would have been fine. Magic is another viable combat route in Outward 2 with various spells to equip and learn, but is not something that I saw in the alpha build.</p>

<p>Outward 2 has had its development challenges with Guillaume saying that one of the biggest was switching engines from Unity to Unreal 5 partway through development – a decision made when Unity pitched the idea of the Runtime Fee which would have seen a charge applied to developers for game installs after a certain revenue point. “We were a specialist studio with 10 years of experience in Unity. Starting with Unreal was even worse, having to migrate the work that we had already done. So there is something that is lost in the process because the structure, the architecture of the game has to be thought of in terms of what are the strengths of the engine. So now we are kind of trying to massage it back into a shape that fits these strengths and weaknesses of Unreal Engine.”</p>
<p>Outward 2 is a project that clearly means a lot to Guillaume and the team at Nine Dots Studio, so I asked what kind of legacy do they want Outward 2 to have? Guillaume takes a moment to think before saying, “I want Outward 2 to prove that Outward was not a fluke and I want this game to be a complete expression of architecture. We’re not trying to be more accessible, but we want to attain a level of execution where the people who were not receptive to the first one. Now, we’ll know is it because we didn’t execute it well? Or was it because the vision is not for them?</p>
<p>“For Outward 1 I understand that some people like it was too rough for me – that’s valid. I want Outward 2 to be very tight. It’s the first game in a very long time that we are self-publishing. So it is a game that is about the emancipation of Nine Dots, and taking having more control over how we sell the game, how we communicate with players, how do we collaborate with other developers because we are acting as publishers as well.</p>
<p>“We were very successful with Outward, so we used some of that money to fund another studio called Ever Curious Entertainment and their game called Witherbloom. And we can just keep doing more of that if Outward 2 is successful, even a fraction of the success of Outward. Because we are self-publishing, we would keep so much of that success for ourselves and we would share that success.”</p>

<p>Outward 2 is a game that will appeal to those that want an RPG with survival elements, where no quest log tells you what to do, no markers to pinpoint exactly where you are, and where you deal with cold, heat, hunger, and thirst as well as the dangers around you. It is a tough experience but Outward 2 comes across as a game that will reward those who persevere. If it is successful it could also see more studios benefit as Nine Dots expands into publishing, allowing for a more varied game industry at a time when it is needed.</p>

			<p>The journey to get here has been as long, challenging, and convoluted as many of Samus Aran’s own adventures. The last original release in the Metroid Prime series came out over 18 years ago, with the fourth entry in the series being announced in 2017 when the Switch was in its infancy. <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-retro-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A complete development reboot</a>, which saw original series creators Retro Studios taking back control of the project, followed, and numerous delays got stacked on top of that, so it’s honestly hard to believe <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/metroid-prime-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> launches this week. No, really. It’s happening.</p>



<p>Has the lengthy wait for Samus' latest adventure been worth it? Or is this series past its prime? Suit up and roll on for the answer.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime49.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond opens in the midst of a chaotic attack on a Galactic Federation base orchestrated by the mysterious bounty hunter Sylux, who has harnessed Metroids to take control of his own Space Pirate crew. Of course, our trusty heroine Samus Aran steps in to kick some Space Pirate ass, but when a mysterious artifact is disturbed in the melee, she finds herself transported to an uncharted corner of the galaxy. And thus, Samus finds herself marooned on Viewros, a sprawling, beautiful planet once ruled by a technologically-advanced civilization known as the Lamorn. Samus must figure out why exactly she's been summoned to Viewros and how to get home. As an extra complication, Sylux has also been transported to this new world and is plotting trouble.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime410.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>However, Samus is also joined by some new allies. As anybody following the pre-launch coverage of Metroid Prime 4 has no doubt heard, the game has friendly NPCs – a quintet of Galactic Federation soldiers who pop up throughout Samus’ journey, eventually congregating at a home base and helping her through various missions. The reaction to the previews that first revealed the existence of these NPCs, particularly the nerdy, self-effacing engineer Myles MacKenzie, was... mixed, to say the least. Alarmist takes that Metroid — <em>Metroid, of all things!</em> — had been dealt a game-destroying dose of Whedonesque snark ran wild.</p>



<p>Well, I'm here to say, you can calm down<em>. It's okay</em>. While Myles comes on strong, the sequence that previewers reacted so negatively to literally lasts around 20 minutes. After that, Myles continues to be the guy you go to for certain upgrades, and he will chime in via radio from time to time, but he's much more subdued once he settles in. The rest of the Galactic Federation crew, while all a bit trope-ey, are generally less jokey and potentially annoying.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime411-1.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Don't get me wrong, I get the initial knee-jerk reaction. I <em>never</em> liked Buffy and tapped out on Marvel movies well before most people (how was Avengers: Endgame?). As somebody sensitive to cringe, let me assure you, Metroid Prime 4 is <em>not that cringe</em>. Samus is still a lone wolf for the large majority of the game, and hey, what's so wrong with her having friends for once? The only issue I have with Samus' new crew is that, at a certain point, the game asks that we actually care about them, and I never really did. They didn't annoy me terribly, they didn't ruin the game, I just found them forgettable for the most part.</p>



<p>Broadly speaking, "forgettable" is the best word to describe the Metroid Prime 4 plot. While some of the backstory of Viewros and the Lamorn is interesting, the game doesn't weave its various threads into a particularly satisfying whole. Of course, Metroid Prime games have always had relatively uninteresting stories, and nothing here descends to the dire storytelling lows of something like Metroid: Other M, but there was potential for something a bit more engaging here. What if, for instance, Samus had actually been allowed to have some back-and-forth interactions with her new crew (she's given the Nintendo silent protagonist treatment here)? What if this story felt more interconnected with previous Prime games or the larger Metroid mythos? Alas, these are mere pipe dreams.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime420.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>But again, this franchise has never really been about story, and on the gameplay front, Metroid Prime 4 delivers. If you've ever played a Metroid Prime game before, this entry feels pretty much identical — the silky-smooth movement, the surprisingly solid-feeling first-person platforming, the fun Morph Ball physics. This time around, there are more control options than ever, with players being able to make use of gyro aiming, flip their Joy-Con 2 controller on its edge for well-implemented mouse controls, or go old-school with Gamecube-style lock-on aiming. <span>The newer control options aren't really&nbsp;<em>required;</em>&nbsp;the series is built around lock-on aiming, and that's largely what I used during my playthrough, but it's nice that those who want to play this game as a more traditional shooter have valid options.</span> Also lovely is Metroid Prime 4's impressive level of technical polish, offering both 4K/60fps and 1080p/120fps modes, with the former never dropping so much as a frame as far as I noticed.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime412.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Metroid fans will be familiar with most of the abilities Samus gains this time around, from the Space Jump to Super Missiles, with the main addition being the new "psychic powers." Most of these powers essentially complement existing abilities, with, for instance, Samus being able to move bombs she produces in Morph Ball mode with telekinesis or direct shots from her arm cannon to hit tricky switches. Psychic abilities don't radically alter that classic Metroid Prime gameplay, but they do open up some new level design avenues.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime413.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>And really, Metroid Prime 4's world and level design is where it truly shines. This game is all about scope. If most Metroid games to this point were obviously inspired by the claustrophobic feel of the early Alien movies, Metroid Prime 4 feels inspired by Ridley Scott's (underrated in my opinion) prequel, Prometheus. In contrast to past Metroid entries, this is a game about dramatic, imposing openness and size. You see that in the stark, rolling dunes of the game's desert hub as well as its various "dungeons," which are all grandiose in their own ways, offering up large-scale, immaculately-designed architecture set amongst beautiful skyboxes.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime414.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Make no mistake, while it may not be designed for the strongest hardware on the market, Metroid Prime 4 is one of the most striking-looking games I've played in recent memory. Again, the focus here is more on bold, beautifully designed structures and open spaces rather than the cramped approach of past Metroids (although the game is often dark and atmospheric when it chooses to be). On Switch 2, this is easily the sharpest-looking game Nintendo has ever offered, with even the publisher's usual lack of anti-aliasing being much less obvious than usual.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime415.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The scope of Viewros is reinforced by <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-vi-o-la-motorcycle-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samus's bitchin' new motorbike, Vi-O-La</a>, which is fun and easy to control, whether you're cruising around the world's central desert area or the paths that connect different sections of some dungeons. There's also been a fair amount of concern about Metroid Prime 4's central desert, Sol Valley, with some worrying it’s a huge, all-encompassing open-world similar in scope to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's Hyrule, but that's not really the case. Granted, Retro has borrowed somewhat from recent Zeldas, as Sol Valley is dotted with a handful of shrines to explore and other collectibles to find, but the reality is, you can drive from one edge of the desert to the other in maybe 2 or 3 minutes and can largely ignore it for much of Metroid Prime 4's runtime (although you shouldn't, for reasons I'll explain soon).</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime416.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>As good as Metroid Prime 4’s overall world design is, it’s in its traditional exploration-focused “dungeons” that it reaches its zenith. These parts of the game are perhaps the most fun and engaging Metroid Prime has ever been, and while each dungeon has a predictable elemental theme (fire, ice, electric, forest, etc.) they all have a unique secondary theme and often a backstory that defines them. For instance, the electric-themed dungeon is an automated factory where Vi-O-La bikes are manufactured and the ice area is actually a horror-tinged experimental bio lab where shadowy experiments were conducted.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime417.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Almost all the dungeons are designed in a "there and back again" format, with players pushing downward into their furthest depths, upon which, you usually battle a boss and the area transforms, resulting in a completely different experience as you try to extract yourself. And then, the dungeons often change again as you backtrack to them later.</p>



<p>Yes, classic Metroid backtracking is still very much a thing here. While the early hours of Metroid Prime 4 feel relatively on rails, around a third of the way in, the game really opens up, freeing the player to unravel how to progress through the rest of the game. There is a specific path you have to follow (although I'm sure clever folks will be able to sequence-break) and the game is refreshingly willing to let you find your own way. Myles will occasionally chime in over the radio to give you high-level pointers on what to do next, but it's up to you to figure out how exactly to get there, and once in dungeons, you're fully on your own.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime418.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>During the middle stretch of Metroid Prime 4, as I was happily hacking through one intense, magnificent-looking dungeon after another and figuring out where to backtrack to next, I was fairly sure I was playing the Nintendo game of the year, and quite possibly the best Metroid Prime title to date. Unfortunately, Metroid Prime 4 does lose some of the momentum that it previously built so expertly in its last few hours. Retro doesn't outright fumble the ball, but it does kind of feel like they're running out the clock near the end.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime419.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Without giving too much away, Metroid Prime 4 makes a mistake that seems to be endemic to this series -- sending players on a last-minute scavenger hunt just when the game's story seems to be reaching its climax. This portion of the game is largely focused around Sol Valley, which is why I suggest you try to make some piecemeal progress there throughout the game, but even if you do, you're still looking at a fairly significant diversion just when you're eager to move full speed ahead. As for the climax itself, it’s solid, but compared to other big 2025 Nintendo games, it doesn't land the epic knockout blow that, say, Donkey Kong Bananza delivered.</p>



<p>That said, while Metroid Prime 4's final hours left me a bit flat, there's no diminishing how great the first three-quarters of the game are. Metroid Prime fans still have a mostly-tasty meal to look forward to, and the portions are generous. This is a solid 15-hour campaign and completionists could probably spend at least twice that time getting to 100 percent, so warm up your scanners.</p>

				<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond ascends to higher peaks than any previous Prime entry, delivering an impressive sense of scale, breathtaking visuals, and classic Metroid level design at its most immersive and riveting, but a few missteps, including an unengaging story and flat final act, may exclude it from best-of-series conversations. That said, those who have been waiting for this game for nearly two decades needn’t worry too much, as Metroid Prime 4 largely locks onto the core of what made this series great.</p>

			<p>ROUTINE has been a long time coming. Not that I would have known, or at least realized. Watching old trailers from its 2012 reveal didn't help me remember whether I had seen the trailer at the time (at first). In the decade-plus since Lunar Software put out its first trailers, I had entirely forgotten about them and <a href="https://wccftech.com/routine-comes-back-from-a-ten-year-slumber-with-a-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ROUTINE's development</a> when I started playing through this new-old horror game.</p>



<p>Needless to say, I had a lot of questions when I started. First of which being 'what took so long.' According to Aaron Foster, ROUTINE's art director and project lead at Lunar Software, in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/routine-is-an-indie-horror-game-over-a-decade-in-the-making-developer-interview-ign-first">IGN</a>, it was just personal reasons. They had to stop working on the game, and only came back to it in 2020, eight years after ROUTINE was one of the highlights of Gamescom 2012. </p>



<p>Lunar Software also essentially had to start from scratch. It couldn't exactly keep making the game in Unreal Engine 3 if it wanted to stand out on modern platforms. So the decade-plus since reveal isn't down to development hell, just regular life reasons, and then needing to essentially restart and overhaul the whole thing. Altogether, you'd probably be more accurate in saying ROUTINE took about six or seven years, instead of fifteen.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_007_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>But anyone who does remember the 2012 Gamescom trailer has been waiting for fifteen years. So, has it been worth the wait? Well, I can't answer that question because even after eventually remembering that I did see the trailer when it first debuted, I haven't spent the last fifteen years wondering where ROUTINE is. So, from where I'm sitting, I'm just so goddamn glad we have another horror game shooting for, and frankly, nailing, all of the same targets Alien: Isolation was aiming for.</p>



<p>I'm not going to spend the entire review comparing ROUTINE to Alien: Isolation, but the comparison is, at least partially, unavoidable. Part of this comes from how both games strive for a retrofuturistic aesthetic, with ROUTINE showcasing the best VHS-era designs Lunar Software makes pass for technology capable of bringing you to the moon and maintaining a base there for years.</p>



<p>Besides some of the practical facts like both games forcing you to hide from all manner of enemies and both games featuring robots, what invites the comparison to Alien: Isolation is the unique ways in which Lunar Software builds a dense, rich atmosphere in ROUTINE. Little details like how you seamlessly transition from looking around to interacting with the many terminals you'll need to use to read the emails and diary entries that contain the core of the game's storytelling make the world feel all the more real.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_003_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Or how the game takes the very old-school approach and gives you absolutely no help at all. No waypoints, no map markers; you can't even use the only tool you have in the game while crouched, which also means you can't use a flashlight. You're meant to slow down, to remember your limitations, and try to use your own common sense to solve the many, many puzzles that you'll have to work your way through across six chapters. </p>



<p>It's almost funny in a way that ROUTINE arrives over a decade later than it would have if Lunar Software didn't have to pause for personal reasons, and in that same year, Rouge Faction tries to front the same 'no hand-holding' philosophy for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/">Hell is Us</a>. And ROUTINE does it better in almost every way. I'd still say Hell is Us might be the better game overall, but there's a simplicity to ROUTINE that makes its environmental guidance work so well that I was never truly lost.</p>



<p>I'm getting ahead of things here. Backing up a bit, ROUTINE opens with you waking up on a lunar base to find that everyone is gone - or dead, and you have to figure out which it is if you don't want to end up the same way. Once you get yourself situated with how to bend down and grab something on the floor (a mechanic that is singled out in the early game and grossly underused afterwards), upon walking out your room door, you notice there are some pretty heavy-duty robots walking around.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_001_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>Don't let the gun-like shape of your C.A.T. tool fool you; you can't actually take the robots down permanently; you can only stun them. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>These are Type-05s, or 'T5s' for short. You learn through the aforementioned emails, diary entries, and more than a few voice recordings found at key intervals that these robots used to help run the base, and now they've started killing all the humans in it for some mysterious reason.</p>



<p>I'm not going to get much deeper into the plot for spoiler reasons. Not because the plot is central to the core experience. Unfortunately, I found the general plot of the game difficult to follow, not just because of the disjointed way in which it was told, but because you're liable to take well over an hour in any given chapter, and because you can't go back and re-read/re-listen to the emails, diary entries, a voice notes that tell the story, it's easy to forget where you are in it.</p>



<p>It's especially easy to forget all the little lore details that are trying to clue you in on what's going on underneath the surface. It's all very interesting, and I'm looking forward to playing ROUTINE again to pay more attention to these aspects, but it's difficult to keep track of in a first playthrough, because you have to keep track of all the practical elements you see.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_002_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You begin to learn your way around the base and the few levels you get to see of it, since you'll be running around them enough times, hiding from your would-be killers at every corner. The constant game of hide-and-please-don't-seek-me in the circles you create in each area as you solve puzzles to unlock new elements of the environment actually felt a bit overwhelming at times. It can also create a frustrating loop where you can't figure out where to go next because you don't have time to look around and you don't have time to look around because you'll get caught and die if you're focusing on looking around and not hiding but if you want to survive you have to hide but then you're not looking around and not figuring out where to go etc.</p>



<p>But you only stay in that loop for as long as you allow yourself to. ROUTINE is balanced by the fact that anything looking for you will give up relatively easily if you hide, and while there are many robots to be found in the abandoned base, only one of them is active at a given time, so you're not just bombarded by enemies you can't kill. The second method feels cleverer than the first, especially because it's something you have to figure out based on the robot's actions, but both together get the job done, so no complaints there.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_004_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Finding your way around is only one of the puzzles you'll constantly be asked to solve in ROUTINE. This game is filled with puzzles, but some of the smaller, more contained puzzles are far more interesting than their large-scale siblings, and most of those bigger puzzles that involve multiple steps are more about tedium than they are interesting puzzle-solving.</p>



<p>At least there's a lot going on as you run back and forth between terminals to try and unlock a specific door because, my goodness, this is such a thrilling horror game to play. ROUTINE is a tense game, for almost every second you're on the moon. It's a huge amount of emotional pressure to sustain for ten hours, but its unrelenting nature without being overly drawn out is what makes all ten of those hours the most tense you'll feel from a horror game in 2025.</p>



<p>As a horror fan, I can't help but feel electrified by just how terrifying ROUTINE is. Its jump scares are thoughtfully placed, its visual design is wonderfully retro, and I'd argue it's best enjoyed at a lower resolution than you'd play most modern games, almost made to look like you're playing a game off of a VHS.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_006_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>What cinches it all, like any other classic horror game, is the soundtrack. DOOM, Prey, and Wolfenstein composer Mick Gordon and the rest of Lunar Software's audio team deserve all the credit in the world for creating an extremely terrifying soundscape. From the heavy thuds of T5s walking, to the ways their necks creak with sounds of old technology, not to mention the sounds they make while scanning their environment, and of course, the sounds they make during your death scene.</p>

						<section>
				<p>ROUTINE is an excellent puzzle-focused first-person horror game that, despite its slow pacing, is able to keep you at the edge of your seat for 10 hours straight, with a tense, rich atmosphere created by wonderful execution of its retro futuristic aesthetic and stunning soundscape that immerses you in its world and gets you listening for the sound of a pin drop to avoid getting caught. Its narrative may be unable to shine through, but at the end of the day it is altogether an interesting game, a game worth playing again, and the game that Alien: Isolation fans should play while we all wait for Alien: Isolation 2.</p>

<p>With speeds of up to 2,000 MB/s, it outperforms many other portable drives on the market, including its predecessor, the Samsung T7, which has a maximum speed of 1,000 MB/s. This makes the T9 perfect for handling large files.</p>
<p>Despite its high transfer speeds, the Samsung T9 remains impressively cool even during extended use. Thanks to its built-in Dynamic Thermal Guard, the drive efficiently manages heat, ensuring that it stays within an optimal temperature range. This means you can work on intensive tasks like video editing or large file transfers without worrying about overheating.</p>
<p>For videographers, the Samsung T9 SSD is an exceptional choice, allowing you to record directly onto the drive from compatible cameras or smartphones like the iPhone 15 Pro. It supports 4K video recording at 60 frames per second. Great for when your iPhone storage is near capacity and you don’t feel like scrolling through a decades worth of photos and video, looking for stuff to delete to make room.</p>



<h2>Strong. Solid. Stable.</h2>
<p>Built with durability in mind, the Samsung T9 can withstand the wear and tear of daily use. The drive is drop-resistant from heights of up to three meters, making it perfect for creators on the go. If you’re traveling for work or shooting in unpredictable environments, the T9 is a drive you can rely on. Plus, it comes with a generous five-year warranty, providing peace of mind in case something goes wrong.</p>
<p>If security is a concern, the T9 allows you to enable password protection. For anyone who frequently travels with their drive, it ensures your sensitive files remain secure, even if you accidentally leave the drive behind at a coffee shop or airport.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6173/">For a limited time, the Samsung T9 SSD is available at a significant discount</a>. The 1TB version is priced at just $95, while the 2TB model is available for $185, and the 4TB version is down to $299.</p>

              <p><span>As we get closer to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span> next Wednesday, December 10, Game Freak is adding another missing monster and Mega Evolution to the RPG’s roster. Thankfully, you won’t have to buy the $30 DLC to get this one, as Mewtwo and its two Mega Evolutions are coming to </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>as a free Mystery Gift side mission.</span></p> <p><span>Mewtwo and its Mega Stones are available now in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, and they’re totally free. To capture this Legendary Pokémon, you’ll have to download a new side quest through the game’s Mystery Gift feature. Open up the Link Play option in the pause menu, then click on Mystery Gift, and then the “Get via Internet” option. Here, you’ll find a new side quest called “Project M,” which will add the psychic legend to the game.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>With this addition, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is one step closer to hopefully adding every Mega Evolution-capable Pokémon to the roster with </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>. As of right now, the base game has just about all of them, with around a dozen or so still missing in action. Most of these are legendary Pokémon like Mewtwo, Latios, Latias, and Rayquaza, but a few of the old starters like Blaziken, Sceptile, and Swampert are also missing in action.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>is also introducing several new Mega Evolutions that weren’t in the base game, including Mega Raichu X and Y. Also today, Game Freak announced Mega Lucario Z, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-lucario-z-2000649602"><span>a new form for Lucario</span></a><span>, who previously had a Mega Evolution prior to the DLC. So it sounds like even some Pokémon who already had these superpowered transformations might be getting more. Outside of new Megas, the DLC is also introducing a roguelike mode that will </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-level-cap-100-2000641765"><span>break the series’ long-established level 100 level cap</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Shovel Knight developers have revealed that Mina the Hollower is going to be their ‘make or break’ moment. </p>



<p>A new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/creator-of-hit-game-shovel-knight-is-at-make-or-break-moment?srnd=homepage-asia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> by Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier reveals that Shovel Knight dev, Yacht Club Games, might be in trouble if their next title, Mina the Holler, doesn’t perform well. For those unaware, Mina the Hollower was delayed indefinitely last month, just weeks before its previous release date. </p>







<h2 id="h-mina-the-hollower-s-performance-can-make-or-break-it-for-them">Mina the Hollower’s Performance Can Make or Break It for Them</h2>



<p>The new report first describes how the developers invited Schreier over to showcase their title, only for the conference room to fill with smoke. The game was still demoed after, to show where the developers stand at the moment and why they have to delay the game further. </p>



<p>The report reveals that only in the past weeks has the game reached a point where the Shovel Knight developers were able to play all the content from start to end. During this process, they have identified several areas that need improvement. However, they have only identified all the problems and will need some more time to fix them. </p>



<p>Shovel Knight developers can only remain independent if Mina the Hollower is a success. The dev studio has already undergone downsizing and now has only 15 employees left, with finances at a low point as well. The co-founder, Sean Velasco, has stated, “It’s make-or-break for sure,” adding that if the game sells 500,000 copies, they are golden; if it sells 200,000, they are still happy; however, if they sell only 100,000, that could be a problem. </p>

            <p>Styx: Blades of Greed - the next entry in Cyanide Studio's infiltration series, which plops players into the shoes of a caustic goblin - will now release next year.</p>
<p>"Over the past months, the team has been pushing hard to bring this game to the level it deserves," the studio wrote, with a new release date trailer you can see further below in this article. "We've been polishing systems, tightening the stealth and combat loops, and making sure every area feels as sharp and atmospheric as it should.</p>
<p>"With this extra time, we can deliver the best possible version of the experience we've been building."</p>

<p>Cyanide Studio said it was "incredibly proud" of the work it has achieved so far, and it is now "even more motivated for the final stretch" of Styx: Blades of Greed's development. "Thank you for sticking with us," it closed. "Your support genuinely fuels the team."</p>
<p>Styx: Blades of Greed was initially set to release this year, but that date has now moved to 19th February, 2026. When it does arrive, it will be available across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles.</p>

<p>Blades of Greed all kicks off after the events of Styx: Shards of Darkness, though the developer has said you won't need to have played any of the previous entries to still enjoy the upcoming release.</p>
<p>I actually got to go hands-on with Styx: Blades of Greed earlier this year, and while I wasn't very good at it (in fact, I was terrible), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/styx-blades-of-greed-managed-to-impress-with-its-stealth-gameplay-despite-my-attempts-to-do-the-opposite">I had an absolute blast playing as the titular Styx and causing all sorts of chaos</a> for those that got in my way.</p>

<p>Catching Zs</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Pokémon Company has revealed yet another new Mega 'mon arriving in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_legends_z-a_mega_dimension">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension</a> DLC, but more than that, it has revealed a whole new <em>type</em> of Mega Evolution.</p>
<p>Mega Lucario Z is the latest Fighting- and Steel-type Mega Evolution to join the line-up, boasting a swanky blue and yellow look as well as some particularly fetching fringe work. This marks the debut appearance of Z Mega Evolution — a new take on the mechanic that sees Pokémon able to fire off their moves quicker, but also burn through their Mega Power at a faster rate.</p>
<p>Pokémon that undergo a Z Mega Evolution might not be best suited for long battles, then, but they'll likely pose a good way for wrapping up fights with a decisive victory.</p>
<p>Here's the official rundown of Mega Lucario Z and a handful of snaps from The Pokémon Company:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While Mega Lucario concentrates its aura into a destructive force, Mega Lucario Z uses it to surround its entire body, cloaking itself to increase its defense, flexibility, and agility. It can utilize its aura in a variety of ways, including stretching it into a shield or channeling it into physical blows by concentrating it into specific parts of its body, such as its legs or fists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mega Lucario Z will arrive with the <em>other</em> new Megas in the Legends: Z-A DLC on 10th December.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1, ROUTINE, Lost Records: Bloom and Rage and More Join Xbox Game Pass This Month]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-routine-xbox-game-pass-december-2025/</link>
            <guid>1370305</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/02/xbox-game-pass-december-2025/">announced the first batch</a> of Xbox Game Pass games heading to the service for the first half of December, with Mortal Kombat 1 and Lunar Software's ROUTINE headlining the games this month. And while most months are about the new games joining the service, December's lineup is also about games already on the service becoming available to players at the lower-level Premium and Essential tiers.</p>



<p>Starting with the new games, ROUTINE and Death Howl are the two titles entering the service this month that are day one releases into Xbox Game Pass. The former is a game that some people <a href="https://wccftech.com/routine-comes-back-from-a-ten-year-slumber-with-a-new-trailer/">have been waiting for over a decade for, after it was initially announced back in Gamescom 2012</a>. The latter is a Soulslike deck builder. </p>



<p>Mortal Kombat 1 is the big triple-A addition this month, though it's also a direct series trade, because as this game enters the service, Mortal Kombat 11 will exit the service as of December 15. You could even make the point that ROUTINE is another like-for-like trade, because while it joins the service, Still Wakes the Deep also exits on December 15.</p>



<p>As far as what's becoming available to more than just players paying for Game Pass Ultimate, the big headlining title is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Of course, it was already on Game Pass, but it was only available for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. Now, it's available to players paying for the middle-tier Premium Game Pass subscription, along with 33 Immortals, which is still currently in a 'game preview' state on Game Pass.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, World War Z, Stellaris, and Medieval Dynasty are all now available at the base-level Essential Game Pass tier. Lastly, a small additional note on this month's Game Pass announcements is that Xbox has started to identify games that are optimized for its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X handhelds</a> in these Xbox Wire posts. </p>



<p>It'll now list "<em>Handheld</em>" as an available platform for a game, which is a good indicator, even if in reality all of the games available on PC Game Pass are available on the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of Xbox Game Pass games for the first half of December 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lost Records: Bloom and Rage - December 2 - PC, Cloud, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Monster Train 2 - December 3 - PC, Cloud, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Spray Paint Simulator - December 3 - PC, Cloud, Console - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>World War Z: Aftermath - December 3 - PC, Cloud, Console - Game Pass Essential and up</li>



<li>Stellaris - December 3 - PC, Cloud, Console - Game Pass Essential and up</li>



<li>Medieval Dynasty - December 3 - PC, Cloud, Console - Game Pass Essential and up</li>



<li>33 Immortals - December 4 - PC, Cloud, Console - Game Pass Premium</li>



<li>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - December 4 - PC, Cloud, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>ROUTINE - December 4 - PC, Cloud, Console, Handheld - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>A Game About Digging A Hole - December 9 - PC, Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Handheld - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Death Howl - December 9 - PC, Handheld - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Dome Keeper - December 9 - PC, Cloud, Console, Handheld - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Mortal Kombat 1 - December 10 - PC, Cloud, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Bratz: Rhythm and Style - December 11 - PC, Cloud, Console - Game Pass Premium and up</li>
</ul>



<p>As far as what is leaving the service, as previously mentioned, Mortal Kombat 11 and Still Wakes the Deep will exit on December 15, along with Wildfrost. Following that, on December 31, Hell Let Loose and Carrion will also leave the service.</p>



<p>It's worth noting that this batch of games takes us all the way to December 11, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">which is also the day of The Game Awards</a>. Perhaps that's because Xbox will be announcing and shadow-dropping a new title on Game Pass that day. We'll see how that develops.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GameStop’s Pokémon Card Loot Box Program Just Led To A Record-Breaking $30,000 Trade-In]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/gamestop-power-pack-pokemon-tcg-trade-in-gengar-2000649582</link>
            <guid>1370302</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A holographic Gengar from the Pokémon TCG set Skyridge just fetched over $30,000 at GameStop. The company is touting it as an “own” aimed at all the “<a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1995625203460891061/photo/1">trolls</a>” who make fun of its infamously poor trade-in values. But the record-breaking deal is really a window into the meme stock retailer’s slimy new loot box idea: trading card Power Packs.</p> <p>Pokémon cards are a giant cash cow. <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalpers-tcg-gamestop-weigh-scale-lifetime-ban-2000646859">Scalpers raid GameStop</a> stores multiple times a month to buy up all the new products that the Pokémon Company can’t print fast enough. But GameStop barely makes any profit off of those sales. It can’t just print its own Pokémon cards and start selling them either. So it’s done the next best thing: It’s started opening its own packs and reselling the rarest cards as part of Power Packs, which are effectively digital slot machines.</p>

 <p>To participate, customers set up Stripe accounts (a payment processing platform), select the Power Pack they want, and then watch to see what card they get. The program is done in partnership with Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA), so all of the cards are graded and slabbed. While the average value of a pack might be $100, most cards people get will be worth less than what they paid for the virtual blind box.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was offered $30 for RDR2 8 days after it came out and my 100k reward points I had saved up for years were not restored when my auto renew membership was turned off from an update despite being a member for 15 years. Never forget <a href="https://t.co/Obq4ytTPu0">https://t.co/Obq4ytTPu0</a></p> <p>— Nathan 🗡️ (@DistantGalaxy96) <a href="https://twitter.com/DistantGalaxy96/status/1995646241313882496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>GameStop promises to buy back any cards players don’t want at 90 percent of “fair market value” minus a 6 percent commission. That commission is essentially GameStop’s cut since PSA also runs its own <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokeInvesting/comments/1okzzky/psa_buying_back_their_own_slabs/">90 percent buyback program</a> without the fee. Some folks think <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pkmntcgcollections/comments/1nqagls/scammy_move_by_gamestop_powerpack_please_read_if/">it’s a rip-off</a>. Supporters who are still banking on “GameStop to the moon” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/1mdyr9e/the_genius_buyback_system_behind_gamestops_new/">think it’s genius</a>.</p>

 <p>This new system is how one Pokémon card collector found a PSA 10 Holo Gengar worth an estimated $33,883 in their Power Pack. They decided to sell it back to GameStop for $30,494.70. It’s still listed as a Power Pack high-value card for someone else to chase now.</p>

 <h2>From GameStop to “Cardstop”</h2> <p>GameStop gets to promote the exchange as “the most valuable single trade-in ever recorded in GameStop history,” even though the amount is contractually obligated through a completely separate program than the one people use to trade-in retro games, old controllers, and last year’s <em>Madden</em> for a fraction of their original sale value.</p>

 <p>“I did get the chase card, I decided to sell it,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PSAPowerPacks/comments/1pbp6wr/comment/nrtpgwd/?context=3">wrote</a> user Fredflinstone00 on the Power Pack subreddit. “I purchased (2) of the $2,500 packs, I was able to sell my cards from each pack and pulled the Gengar on the 6th pack.” They said they’re getting about $28,000 after fees, which puts them up overall after being down $4,000 before the Gengar.</p>

 <p>“I just sell the cards I don’t want and keep the ones I do want, I’ve had plenty shipped to me,” they told the community on Reddit. “With this card, the sales history is not the greatest, don’t want to risk a $10k move downwards, so I took the payout.”</p> <p>That volatility is another one of the risks with Power Packs. The Gengar in question was only selling for around $5,000 as recently as 2023, and GameStop’s estimated market value matched the <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/pokemon-skyridge/gengar-h9#completed-auctions-manual-only">highest known sale</a> of the card from back in October.</p> <p>Others cash out the minute they get a chase card as well. A couple of weeks ago, Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooPies662/" aria-label="Author: SnooPies662" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false">SnooPies662</a> snagged a PSA 10 Blaine’s Charizard worth $13,700. “Subsidized by my gf after losing 6k total on diamonds,” they wrote. “Safe to say I’m done forever now and achieved everything I could have possibly wanted from this.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon Legends: Z-A Is Giving An Old Favorite A Second Mega Evolution]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-lucario-z-2000649602</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Lucario is one of Game Freak’s favorite Pokémon and has long been one of the faces for <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolutions-best-worst-designs-legends-z-a-2000625459">Mega Evolutions</a> since the powered-up transformations debuted in </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. Now, the steel/fighting-type monster is getting another Mega form called Mega Lucario Z as part of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i></a><span>DLC.</span></p>  <p><a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/news/mega_lucario_z"><span>According to the official </span><i><span>Legends Z-A</span></i><span> website</span></a><span>, these Mega Evolution Z forms will play a little differently than their standard transformations, as they will have shorter cooldown times for their attacks, but use more of the Mega Gauge that lets them sustain their transformations. They hit faster, but use fewer moves before reverting to their original forms, so Game Freak says they’re less suited for longer battles.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Mega Lucario Z doesn’t change the Pokémon’s steel/fighting typing, so it will be interesting to see how it differentiates itself from the original Mega Lucario in the competitive space. The fact that Z forms have their own special mechanic makes it sound like other Pokémon will be getting these alternate forms. This lines up with some of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-evolutions-2000641670">datamined leaks from earlier this year</a> that claim Absol and Garchomp are also getting these new transformations in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Lucario isn’t the only old favorite getting a new Mega Evolution in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s DLC, which is also adding two forms for Raichu, and new transformations for Chimecho, Baxcalibur, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-zeraora-reaction-industry-plant-2000645789">Zeraora</a>. Outside of new Megas, the expansion is also adding a roguelike mode that will <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-level-cap-100-2000641765">break the series’ original level 100 cap</a>, so it could be one of the biggest challenges these games have offered to date. It does seem to take place <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-korrina-lucario-az-galar-how-to-get-2000639831">after the events of the main game</a>, though, so if you haven’t beaten <em>Legends: Z-A </em>yet, you might want to lock in. The expansion will launch next week on December 10.</span></p>

<p>Discord is rolling out a new commerce experience for users and has partnered with Marvel Rivals as the first title with integrated shopping and gifting.</p>



<p>Launching just in time for the Marvel Rivals anniversary celebrations and the holiday season, players in the Marvel Rivals Discord will be able to browse and purchase digital goods within the Marvel Rivals Discord.</p>











<figure><figcaption>New feature. Image via Discord</figcaption></figure>



<p>Players in the Marvel Rivals Discord can now create a wishlist of the items they want to add to their collection and gift in-game items to their friends, with purchased and gifted items instantly accessible within Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p><a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-introduces-a-new-commerce-experience-for-gaming-communities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord says</a> the integration is a huge boost for players and developers alike, as gifting isn’t limited to players of the game, so items can be gifted to friends to encourage them to jump into the game, extending in-game currency, and building upon the existing gifting behavior on Discord.</p>



<p>It’s added that 20% of all Shop purchases on Discord are gifts, a number that increases to almost 30% during the holiday season, so the integration is described as “a natural evolution of how people use Discord to connect and celebrate together.”</p>



<p>Initially, the integration will support purchases in USD only on the Discord desktop client, though players from the US, Canada, Ireland, and Oceania will be able to use it. Additional regions and platform support will be explored in the future, Discord says.</p>



<p>Additional game support is expected to be added in the future as part of the feature’s evolution.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There’s a moment in </span><i><span>Routine</span></i><span>, a new sci-fi horror game launching on Xbox and PC on December 4, that I won’t forget for a long time.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>To explain this moment and why it is burned into my brain would involve spoilers, but suffice it to say, in a game that rarely relies on jump scares, this moment</span> <span>was so perfectly crafted that it caught me completely off guard. So much so that I found my hands shaking a bit. And with no pause button, all I could do in the game was slide into a corner of the room and try to collect myself. So yeah, if you don’t like scary games, </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>ain’t for you.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>is a spooky first-person horror game set in an alternate future where humanity made it to the Moon and partially colonized it sometime in the 1980s. This means a lot of the technology you’ll encounter during </span><i><span>Routine’s </span></i><span>six to seven-hour story feels dated, mechanical, and retro. Old CRTs and ’80s-era computers are everywhere, offering up some</span><i><span> Alien Isolation </span></i><span>vibes, which I didn’t mind at all.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Buttons and doodads and switches</b></h2> <p><span>This retro sci-fi aesthetic includes your trusty Cosmonaut Assistance Tool or CAT, which you acquire right at the start of the game as your character arrives at the now-abandoned moonbase to make repairs.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Part computer, part camera, and part gun, the CAT features switches and modes that must be activated by fumbling around with it. It’s designed to be a clunky way to save your game, unlock doors, and scan equipment. And it makes even something as simple as swapping to a different mode a scary moment where you have to stop looking around and focus on your CAT to find the right switch. It’s one of many ways </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>uses clunky mechanics to add tension.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000649247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649247"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649247">©Lunar Software</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>also hides items and pieces of information in hard-to-reach spots, forcing you to stretch up or bend down using a few extra buttons. Like operating the CAT, this isn’t hard to do, but it does become far trickier to interact with this world using these deliberately clunky methods when a killer robot is quickly approaching.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And yeah, as you might have guessed, you aren’t alone on the moon. Pretty quickly after arriving, killer robots become a problem. They dot the hallways and rooms of the deteriorating moonbase, just waiting to spot you and take chase. And while you can stun them with your CAT, it’s a brief delay and not a viable strategy for survival. Stealth is much more effective, though panic-running to the game’s few safe areas also works, too. Don’t ask me how I know.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Expect the unexpected</b></h2> <p><span>The thing is, there’s… more to </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>beyond what I’ve already mentioned. Obstensibly, as seen in all the pre-release gameplay footage of </span><i><span>Routine</span></i><span>, this is a creepy sci-fi game built around trying to repair a moonbase that features once-docile robots who are now deadly machines determined to find you and snap your neck. That’s not all </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>is, but to spoil any more would be a crime. Just know that the second half of this game ratchets up the horror and goes in a direction I wasn’t expecting.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“Moon’s haunted.” </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Lunar Software</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Photorealistic first-person sci-fi survival game</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Gorgeous graphics, creepy vibes, mechanical controls, wonderful second-half swerve  </p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Some annoying puzzles, ending is a bit meh</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Xbox Series X/S (played), Xbox One, PC</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Finished the game’s story in about 6 hours. </p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>I appreciated the swerve that occurs in </span><i><span>Routine’s </span></i><span>second half. Up until that point, I found </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>to be a solid </span><i><span>Alien Isolatio</span></i><span>n-like experience, but nothing too remarkable. But by the end, after it zigs and zags, </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>had fully escaped </span><i><span>Isolation’s </span></i><span>shadow, becoming its own worthwhile horror game and scared the shit out of me in the process.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And while I can’t say much about the second half, I can gush about </span><i><span>Routine’s </span></i><span>visuals. This is one of the best-looking video games I’ve played this console generation.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Looks that kill, puzzles that annoy</b></h2> <p><span>At times, the derelict environments of </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>look photorealistic. Lighting and texture detail, in particular, are astonishing. At one point, I was hiding and shaking behind a large piece of machinery and spotted a detailed warning label with scratch marks. It almost distracted me from how scared I was at that moment. Almost. What actually ruined the creepy vibes were some of </span><i><span>Routine’s </span></i><span>annoying puzzles.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Unfortunately, some of these threw me for a loop and led to a lot of random backtracking. The game’s total lack of UI is an immersive choice, but it did lead to some moments where I ran into a brick wall and struggled to move forward. If you play </span><i><span>Routine</span></i><span>, don’t feel bad if you have to look up a few puzzle solutions. Many of these just get in the way of a truly scary experience.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000649245" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649245"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649245">©Lunar Software</figcaption></figure> <p><span>At least I got to backtrack through some haunting photorealistic environments. These spaces and mundane objects in them provide a perfect backdrop for<em> Routine’s</em> horrific elements. It is genuinely unnerving to be in a hyper-realistic kitchen and turn around to spot an evil robot just a few feet away. And </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>loves to use its environments, which are filled with wonderful sound design as well, to build up tension and dread.&nbsp;</span><span>There were times when the simple act of moving from one doorway to another felt like the scariest thing I’ve done in a video game. I might not have even been in danger, but I was shook.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>was announced over a decade ago at this point. So was it worth the wait? Hard to say, as I wasn’t waiting for it, but I can confirm that a decade after it was first revealed, </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>is a damn fine horror game that stands toe to toe with other heavy hitters of the genre.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>We know Hideo Kojima, the creative lead behind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-review-is-it-good-ps5-playstation-5-1851784852"><i><span>Death Stranding</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-delta-remake-2000619269"><i><span>Metal Gear Solid</span></i></a><span>, loves movies. The guy even says in his Twitter bio that “70% of [his] body is made of movies.” However, Kojima doesn’t often get to play characters in movies. He’s only had a handful of acting credits over the years. But he’s <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1995746201720029486?s=20">adding one more to his filmography this year</a>: he’ll be playing a character in the Japanese dub of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/zootopia-2-nick-judy-relationship-romance-abortion-comic-2000649147"><i><span>Zootopia 2</span></i></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Paul Molebrandt only has a few lines in Disney’s sequel, but the IT guy in the Zootopia Police Department office does pave the way for some pretty good scenes. </span><i><span>Zootopia</span></i><span>, its sequel, and the </span><i><span>Zootopia+ </span></i><span>mini-series play around a lot with the titular city’s shared space between multiple, differently-sized animals.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000649594" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649594"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649594">© Disney</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As a mole, Paul is much smaller than most of Zootopia 2’s main cast, and his few scenes really play around with that juxtaposition, so even when he’s not speaking, he’s giving the movie a lot of humorous space to work in. Kojima may not say much in the movie, but his character makes an impact in just a few short scenes. The role began with Josh Gad in the English original, who is best known in the Disney space for playing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/frozen-olaf-character-roams-disney-parks-2026-2000647055"><span>Olaf in the </span><i><span>Frozen </span></i><span>series</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>is out here in the States, but the Japanese dub will enter theaters overseas on Friday, December 5. The sequel has already been a smash hit for Disney, having already passed half a billion at the box office in just one week, and the post-credits scene has big implications for a potential third movie that will probably come out sometime in the 2030s. So, hey, Kojima might reprise the role of Paul in the inevitable </span><i><span>Zootopia 3 </span></i><span>Japanese dub. Surely we’ll have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-od-trailer-horror-2000627883"><i><span>OD</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/physint-kojima-metal-gear-ps6-release-date-od-1851781247"><i><span>Physint</span></i></a><span> by then, right?</span></p>

"Their support inspires us to continue improving the game and delivering even better content to our players. With the mobile version coming soon, we can't wait for more players to join our growing community."</p><p>This free-to-play open-world title is set in 10th-century China during the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Discord’s adding a new commerce feature that will let users buy digital items for games they might not even play. Starting with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24113437/marvel-rivals-trailer-netease-pc-mcu-disney">Marvel Rivals,</a></em> users will be able to search, buy, wishlist, and gift cosmetics without ever leaving the platform.</p><p>It works like this. Starting today, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> will have a new store page accessible directly within the game’s official Discord server. There you can browse and buy offerings without launching the game client. Users can also create wishlists for specific items that will appear in their profile, where friends can also view and buy them. Discord cofounder and chief technology officer Stan Vishnevskiy tells <em>The Verge</em> that it’s the wishlist and gifting aspect of the new store that offers the most opportunity to both the platform and game developers.</p><p>“On any single day, 20 percent of purchases are gifts,” he said, talking about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23981434/discords-in-app-shop-is-now-available-to-everyone">Discord’s current shop</a> that sells cosmetics to zhuzh up user profiles. “And on holidays, it can spike to way over 30 percent.” With these new store features, the team saw an opportunity to let users extend that generosity beyond Discord-specific borders. Discord also has the opportunity to take a cut of the purchases but did not disclose the specifics of how that revenue will be split. Vishnevskiy said that the goal is to provide incremental revenue and value to developers. “We’re not ultimately just taking a cut for something,” he said.</p><p>That value comes in making the purchasing experience simple and seamless while adding the potential for new player acquisition. Vishnevskiy said that buying items for yourself within <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is fairly straightforward, but it can be tedious trying to buy for someone else and impossible, outside of gift cards, if you don’t already play the game. “We all have friends that play games that we don’t play, and they love things that we don’t always love,” Vishnevskiy said. “This gives an opportunity for a game developer to reach the friends of people that could now potentially be customers.”</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>A mockup of what the </em>Marvel Rivals <em>store will look like in Discord.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: Discord</cite></span></p></section><p>The shop is available in US currency and only on the desktop app, but Vishnevskiy said that bringing the offering to consoles and mobile is “top of mind” for the team. As for why the feature started with <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, Vishnevskiy says it was a natural fit. “They have the largest gaming server on Discord, with over 4 million people that they constantly run events with and make reasons [for players] to show up.”</p><p>But while <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is the only game that has this feature right now, it won’t only be the big AAA games and publishers able to take advantage of this program. Vishnevskiy spoke about Discord’s introduction of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/758146/discord-now-lets-developers-add-chat-and-social-features-right-into-their-games">social SDK earlier this year</a>, which lets developers of all sizes integrate chat and other social features into their games. He said Discord’s in-game shop plan will follow the same route. “We’re starting with more AAA games, but our intent is to make sure this is available long term beyond them,” Vishnevskiy said.</p><p>In the current media landscape, media and gaming platforms are experimenting with ways <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/794923/meta-facebook-tiktok-reels-friend-bubble">to keep people engaged</a> for longer to monopolize and thereby <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/711304/instagram-enshitification">monetize their attention to varying degrees of success and</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/791595/instagram-uploading-features-content">user irritation</a>. According to Vishnevskiy, this new feature isn’t designed to keep people on the Discord wheel, but something he says will enhance the already meaningful experiences players have on the platform. “Telling people, ‘Hey, your friend loves this game and they love this character, and if it’s their birthday, they would appreciate this.’ It’s something uniquely Discord can do,” he said.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/835385/discord-shop-marvel-rivals-gifting-wishlist]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>December is here and both Black Friday and Cyber Monday are in the rearview mirror. If you missed your shot at purchasing some holiday gifts during the biggest sales event of the year, you’re not out of luck just yet. Some deals are still active and attractive for late shoppers like us. One such deal is on the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, the true wireless Bluetooth earbuds. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/">Normally priced at $250, these earbuds are currently available for just $140—a whole $110 in savings, thanks to a 44% discount.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ultimate Comfort and Fit</h2>
<p>Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are designed to be the most comfortable in-ear headphones the brand has created yet, ideal for all-day wear. Each pair comes with a sleek charging case, a USB-C charging cable, and three sets of ear tips in various sizes to ensure the best possible fit. This thoughtful design ensures the earbuds stay in place, delivering crisp, clear sound every time you use them. Whether you’re running errands, working out, or just relaxing, these earbuds should stay securely in your ears.</p>
<h2>Advanced Noise Cancellation and Custom Sound</h2>
<p>With ANC support the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro 3 can automatically adjust the level of noise cancellation based on your environment. You can enjoy your music, podcasts, or audiobooks without being disturbed by the surrounding noise like the noisy chatter of a crowded office or the loud hum of an airplane engine.</p>
<p>Sound quality is exceptional, with the dual amplifier and enhanced two-way speaker working in harmony. The adaptive equalizer customizes the audio to your unique ear shape, delivering a personalized sound experience. If you decide to connect them to your TV, the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro offer an immersive 360-degree sound experience, providing a surround sound effect without the need for bulky speakers or expensive equipment.</p>
<p>With convenient touch controls, you can easily pause your music, skip tracks, answer calls, and more—all without needing to take your phone out of your pocket.</p>



<h2>Real-Time Translation with Galaxy AI</h2>
<p>One of the more unique new features of these earbuds this specific integration&nbsp; it has with Galaxy AI. The Galaxy Buds Pro 3 allow you to have real-time, face-to-face conversations in multiple languages—no translation app required. It’s a sci-fi wonder straight out of The <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. </em>When someone says “Hola” to you, the earbuds instantly translate it to “Hello” in your ear. This makes communicating while traveling a breeze. It does require being paired with a Samsung device to function. Sorry iPhone users.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro come in two stylish color choices: silver and white. Both have come down in price for Cyber Week. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/">They’re usually selling on Amazon for $250, but the 44% discount brings the price tag to just $150 for a limited time. You end up saving yourself $110.</a></p>
