			<p>When a new game from Suda51 drops, you know that it’s going to both ultraviolent and uniquely weird. Even so, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/romeo-is-a-dead-man">Romeo is a Dead Man</a> might still surprise you with just how strange it is. This is a game where the ‘Game Over’ screen is a melting head, where Romeo’s late grandpa is an animated picture on the back of his jacket, and Romeo himself wears the silliest helmet I think I’ve ever seen. It’s a game so surprising that being set in a multiverse with alternate versions of characters doesn’t even break the top ten of oddest things.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN - Launch Trailer /『ロミオ・イズ・ア・デッドマン』ローンチトレーラー" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CHcb7_MEDKQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At some point a singularity opened in a town in America and fractured the universe and the timeline. Now multiversal villains are wreaking havoc across time and space and the FBI are on the case, driving a motorcycle with a sidecar into singularities and destroying aberrations as they pop up in the hope that they might somehow manage to fix the universe. Romeo is also looking for his Juliet, a mysterious figure somehow related to the opening of the singularity that started this whole thing, but she’s lost somewhere in the multiverse. Naturally, after his grandpa appears, shoves a ridiculous helmet on him to save his life, and tells him to go fight a giant monster, Romeo joins the FBI to aid his search. Saving the universe would be a bonus.</p>


<p>Suffice to say the narrative running through Romeo is a Dead Man combines its many influences into something completely unique, and it’s wholly unpredictable beyond the fact that you’re fighting horrendous monsters. Through the course of the game you’ll fight a giant head that’s split into three, you’ll creep around a repeating asylum in liminal space, and you’ll regularly gallivant around a digital dimension called subspace that’s made mostly out of blocks and is accessed through a floating TV. It almost defies description in text, really, and it’s possible the most Suda51 game ever.</p>


<p>Between the ultraviolent third person combat and traipsing around digital dimensions, you’ll also be returning to your ship to upgrade gear and abilities. This ship is 2D, top down pixel art, and allows you to unlock and upgrade gear using resources found during combat. That’s about as normal as things on the ship get, though. You don’t level up in this game exactly, instead you use another resource as fuel for a little rocket ship that you guide around a Pac-Man-like minigame, picking up upgrades as you go. You can prioritise specific upgrades by just flying to them instead of other ones. It’s one of the weirder ideas in the game – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/03/interview-suda51-on-romeo-is-a-dead-man-and-the-past-present-and-future-of-grasshopper-manufacture/">&nbsp;one that Suda credits to his team</a> – and I think it’s ingenious.</p>
<p>You can also grow bastards on the ship. Bastards are basically homegrown, organic versions of enemies that grant you abilities in combat. You can grow a bastard by finding a seed whilst playing, whether dropped from an enemy or found in a level, taking it to your little sister who, for some reason, is in charge of bastard cultivation. She will identify it and then you can plant it into one of the plots on the ship, where it will grow until you pull it out of the ground to harvest. Then you can equip it to one of your bastard slots and use it in combat, which you definitely should do because they’re invaluable. They can be as simple as a suicider zombie that charges at the nearest enemy and explodes, connecting a laser between the bastard and Romeo that damages anything in the way, freezing enemies, or placing turrets. They can also be combined, though I was a bit disappointed that it doesn’t combine effects except in rare cases where they become other specific bastards, otherwise combining them just increases stats and keep the main effect.</p>

<p>I haven’t talked about combat that much so far, and it’s because I don’t really like it. The things necessary for a good experience are here, but it just doesn’t come together in a way that lets you tackle the game’s difficulty.</p>
<p>You have up to four melee weapons and four ranged weapons, but they feel a bit weak, even when you’ve upgraded them significantly. You’ll want to focus on using them to cover yourself in blood, which eventually earns you a blood charge, allowing you to use Bloody Summer – a special attack that is different for each weapon (guns included) and deals a lot of damage. This, combined with heavy use of bastards will hopefully see you through the combat…</p>
<p>But things don’t flow as smoothly as they should, so I was often left frustrated. I’ve found that pressing the button to activate Bloody Summer sometimes just didn’t do so, which is infuriating when that leads you to lose a lot of health. Switching between weapons is also too fiddly in the heat of combat, needing you to use the D-pad and stop moving while you do so (unless you have exceptionally long thumbs). The guns sound and feel weak and aiming feels so loose that your shotgun can be fired into a crowd of enemies and miss them all. It also deals so little damage that it’s nearly useless as its spread demands it be used close enough that you might as well just use melee. Some enemies have weak points that can speed up significantly, resulting in the strange situation where a rocket launcher can one hit kill a bigger enemy because it has a weak point, but can’t one hit kill a basic enemy because it doesn’t.</p>

<p>The bosses can be pretty excellent, but some also have issues. The one that could turn into a giant ball of spikes and charge at me in the time it took to make one of my own attacks, so I would start a combo just fine but get wiped out before I could finish it. This boss could also trigger a wide radius attack that damages your manoeuvrability with very little warning. If you have a blood charge, you can do a little minigame where you rapidly input buttons to get rid of it, but the UI was unresponsive enough that it was safer to just wait it out.</p>
<p>The combat just isn’t enjoyable or tight enough to be this difficult.&nbsp;What’s more annoying is that you can’t change the difficulty mid-game, so I was stuck on the normal difficulty, pushing on because I didn’t want to restart the entire game on a lower difficulty that might make the combat’s issues less prevalent.</p>

<p>It’s a shame because the rest of the game is a sort of delightful fever dream. Every detail is silly and unexpected, but it’s endearing and makes you want to know what happens next. There are plenty of touches that are not only unique or peculiar, but demonstrate a willingness to do things that you don’t find elsewhere. That ‘Game Over screen I mentioned? That’s a video of a model melting, and it reverses once you decide to continue. One of my favourite moments is Romeo’s sister telling a story about a shinigami. It’s on the ship, so it’s just pixels and 2D, her text scrolling across the bottom of the screen with little else moving, and the story is long enough that it stops twice to ensure you want to keep going before it’s done, but for some nebulous reason it worked for me. The game is full of moments and unique touches like this.</p>
<p>There are also a few presentation issues. It’s solid graphically, but it won’t really impress you outside of aesthetic choices. There’s also a strange thing before certain fights where you basically do a quick time event to draw your weapon, it’s probably supposed to be cool, but, to me at least, it comes across as awkward. Picking items up is also annoying, as it wants you to hold the button, and then also tap to confirm. If you’re grabbing multiple things in succession, it can end up feeling like hours of your life draining away.</p>

<p>Having never been any sort of tennis fan for my entire childhood — Wimbledon always seemed a bit posh to me — I fell completely and utterly in love with the sport in my teenage years through the medium of video games.</p>
<p>Yes. Video games. They're a whole thing! And just as has been the case with American football, basketball, and ice hockey, my initial interest in tennis was stoked by a game; in this case, the incredible <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_tennis">Super Tennis</a> on SNES.</p>
<p>It was the first time I <em>got it,</em> you see - the strategy behind this most magnificent of sports. Yes, it was but a sliver of the game's real-world depth, but getting a handle on little things like the placement of the ball, the drawing of your opponent into positions on the court where you can then take advantage, timing and picking your shots...it turned out a good game of tennis was every bit as exciting as all those action efforts I'd been playing. Yes, even you, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/street_fighter_ii_the_world_warrior">Street Fighter 2</a>.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario Tennis Fever Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161904/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Fast-forward the guts of a decade, and we got two epic tennis efforts arriving within two months of each other on consoles in the forms of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_tennis">Mario Tennis</a> on N64, and one of the true loves of my life, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/virtua_tennis">Virtua Tennis</a>, which at the time I was playing on a Dreamcast. (I'm so very sorry.)</p>
<p>I mention these two games because, for me, they marked the point where I chose my own tennis adventure through this particular video game life I'm currently living, such as it is. Instead of rolling with the chaotic fun of Mario and all the wacky stuff he brings to the tennis table, I decided I wanted to get down with 'real tennis' in a sim-style, as presented through Virtua Tennis' haunted celebrity tennis faces.</p>
<p>Whilst I have dabbled with all of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/mario_tennis_open">Mario Tennis</a> games — and tried really hard with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_tennis_aces">Mario Tennis Aces</a> — my main issue with the series has always been that, in giving us a new twist on a formula, the twist presented just didn't warrant shifting focus from something as pure and competitive as, well, normal tennis. I've also found over the years and through various iterations that the goofy mechanics introduced (such as Aces' trick shots) have always felt a little frustrating, they ruin the flow of a match for me, and honestly, it's all a bit too much to be bothered concentrating on for this particular Andy Murray.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario Tennis Fever Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161909/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So, I never really wanted to engage with souped-up powers or star shots or any of that guff as a result. Give me tennis, lads. Give me glorious tennis, pure and undiluted. Give me big, sweaty Tim Henman. Or! Give me a wacky alternative that feels good enough that I'm not immediately headed into the menus to turn all the special moves off.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, a game I expected to enjoy but put down fairly quickly in favour of getting back to <strong>Tennis Elbow 4</strong> (now there's a Switch 2 port I'd like to see). It seems this time out, though, Camelot has other ideas, as with this first serving of Switch 2 Mario Tennis action, we've finally got wacky Mushroom Kingdom mechanics that sing ever-so sweetly, and an arcade tennis effort that might be the first where I'd rather keep the special powers switched on, thanks very much. (Yes, they can also be switched off, mate - cool it.)</p>
<p>The key to this, firstly, is the introduction of the game's titular Fever rackets. There's a generous selection of powered-up sticks to choose from, and each one imbues your chosen character with a fun trick. Heck, you can even equip two of them at a time in certain modes. Now, I'm sure you've seen lots of these by now, and maybe it all seems a little old-hat when you first lay eyes on the usual array of elemental-based shenanigans. There's a simplicity here, though, that overcomes the overcomplicated and messy vibe that I felt keenly in Aces.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario Tennis Fever Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161900/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Each character on the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-tennis-fever-full-character-list-every-playable-character">lovely big colourful roster</a> of Nintendo faves has their own base stats, and you can then choose to use any racket you've unlocked (I won't spoil 'em) to avail of its special powers. So you've got a few layers of strategy and stats, but it's also immediately obvious how everything works, and we don't even need to worry about flicking sticks around for a variety of special moves or any of that tempo-ruining baloney.</p>
<p>The next crucial aspect is how powers are deployed. Choosing a fever racket — let's say I've got the game's Ice racket, and my opponent has the twister-producing Ty-Phoo racket — a match starts as normal, and as we play, we build our fever gauges. When full, we can then pull off a fever shot, which, once it touches the ground, will produce the fever effect intended. Keep it from hitting the ground (in what's often a very intense rally) and the window for its power to take effect will run out.</p>
<p>So, through skill, you can stop an opponent from using their power. What's more, you can ensure that you bring it crashing down on their side of the court to have them eat their own punishment.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario Tennis Fever Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161910/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In this simplicity, we are gifted a game that gives me the sort of feeling usually reserved for true multiplayer greats like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_kart_64">Mario Kart</a>. Each racket's ability is easy to comprehend; it's easy to read how a mud slick might affect a game, for example, and by keeping it simple in this way, players are free to focus on movement and proper tennis strategy at the same time.</p>
<p>That's not to say it doesn't get crazy with piranha plants and fire and all that stuff: it does. But it feels much more controlled and concise in what it wants from you, as a player.</p>
<p>So we get a balance that means I'm happy to play with these powers engaged at all times. A first! By allowing me to move around the court normally, to utilise the usual array of slices and spins, lobs, and net shots freely, and without making me do somersaults or slow-motion physical feats that ruin the flow of the ball smacking every 10 seconds, we're onto a winner.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario Tennis Fever Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161902/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In fact, in the midst of a tournament match, and against some surprisingly smart CPU players (even the doubles partners are good), the pairing of wild powers with more realistic movement parameters makes for a game that I cannot wait to jump into online. Indeed, it feels as though it may very well have that very special sort of Mario Kart online magic to it that I personally feel is currently missing from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">the latest iteration in that series.</a></p>
<p>Even in the ever-present star shots, things have been made to feel as though Camelot has considered everything much more carefully. Rather than launching me into the air and wasting my time, or any of that caper, getting onto these simply gives me a one-off, more powerful shot. Again, not messing so much with the core tennis that it's affected.</p>
<p>Now to the one actual problem. Modes! I was hoping the adventure campaign was going to have some special RPG magic for single players, but alas, it's three to four hours of basically learning how to play. We do get a few fun face-offs and it's always a laugh, but it's short and fairly basic in what it sets out to do, with a handful of boss fights that have you pick the right shot to do damage. You know the drill.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario Tennis Fever Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161899/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This continues in the game's tournament and trial tower offerings. They're good while they last, and surprisingly challenging on harder settings, but I want more! For a strictly solo player, there's not a lot to pick at over time here, even with the minigames of Mix It Up (shooting hoops for points, anyone?) and a rather lacklustre motion-control mode that I tried and turned off, as it's not 1:1 and feels like a faff.</p>
<p>With more than one player, there <em>are plenty of</em> ways to play locally with pals, and online lobbies feel like where I'll spend all of my time. Matches I played — which are split into Fever/non-Fever racket variants of single and doubles — were quick to find and lag-free in my (limited, review-period) experience.</p>
<p>You can also play tournaments and trials in co-op, which definitely gives these modes more legs, and the free play mode allows four players to mix up the rules, switch off Fever rackets, and play best-of-five-set stunners that'll have you all sweating buckets.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario Tennis Fever Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161911/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's lucky, given the disappointing adventure offering, that the tennis here is so sweet, and easily the sort of thing I reckon has a long online life ahead. It helps, too, that it looks superb, never dropping a notable frame in docked or handheld.</p>
<p>With 14 courts (replete with environmental gimmicks that can be switched off), 38 characters, 30 (!) racket types to dig into mastering, this is 100% my favourite Mario Tennis to date and one I can see being a hit online for some time to come.</p>
<p>Now, where did I put my pen? I've gotta go sign a load of giant novelty balls on my way out of here.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Mario Tennis Fever serves up my favourite game in the series thus far, by finding an addictive balance between Mario's madcap antics and real-world tennis fun. Streamlining superpowers into Fever rackets makes everything easier to parse, and keeping player movement <em>relatively</em> restrained makes for tennis matches that retain an exciting flow without constant slo-mo interruptions.</p>
<p>The adventure mode is a letdown, and solo players don't have a ton of options, but there's depth and strategy at the core here that should see this one ace things online for some time to come.</p></section>

					</p></div><div>

			<p><strong>Mario Tennis</strong> has become one of Nintendo's most predictable franchises, showing up relatively early in the lifespan of all of the company's recent platforms, and sure enough, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/mario-tennis-fever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Mario Tennis Fever</strong></a> is being served up within the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong></a>'s first year on the market. Promising more characters and modes than ever before, as well as a wide array of new gameplay-altering "Fever Rackets," this may well be the most feature-rich Mario Tennis to date.</p>



<p>Is Mario Tennis Fever a swinging good time or will it leave fans cold? Lace up your shoes and tighten your rackets; it's time to find out.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFmariotennisfever2.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>If you've played the last couple of entries in this series, particularly the Switch 1 game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-tennis-aces-a-fancy-racket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Tennis Aces</a>, you should be fairly familiar with the fundamentals here in Mario Tennis Fever. <strong>Players have a variety of basic shot types at their disposal, such as slices, flats, lobs, and drop shots, that offer some degree of control over where you direct the ball on the court</strong>. You can also charge up your shots or, in some cases, line up your avatar with star markers that appear on the court for a powerful Star Shot. Mario Tennis Fever's on-court action has a somewhat "canned" feel: in real tennis, carefully managing your position and the power of your shots in order to keep the ball in bounds is a constant concern, but faults essentially don't exist in Fever, and the ball generally reacts in a fairly predictable way. That said, there are enough different types of shots here to allow for a certain amount of strategy.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFmariotennisfever3.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Visually, <strong>Mario Tennis Fever looks alright, although not significantly better than Mario Tennis Aces and a step below what you expect from most Mario games in 2026</strong>. Characters animate rather stiffly compared to something like <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a>, or other recent Mario sports titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-strikers-battle-league/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Strikers: Battle League</a>, and I even noticed some odd framerate drops, particularly when serving the ball for whatever reason.</p>



<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a new Mario Tennis without some sort of fresh gimmick to spice up the action, and this time around, it's the addition of the aforementioned Fever Rackets. While each character in the game has their own inherent strengths and weaknesses, you can also choose one of approximately 30 Fever Rackets, most of which grant you some sort of special ability.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFmariotennisfever4.jpg"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Rallying with your opponent will build up your Fever Gauge, which you can spend to unleash a Fever Shot, which can be precisely aimed at specific sections of the court</strong>. While some Fever Rackets confer passive buffs, such as the Swerve Racket that gives your shots more curve, most Fever Rackets will spawn some sort of disruption on your opponent's side of the court upon the delivery of a Fever Shot – a scattering of banana peels, an erupting volcano, vision-obscuring mudholes, etc. Ah, but if you can return a Fever Shot before it hits the ground, you can turn its effect back on your opponent. You also have to keep a close eye on your HP bar -- yes, there is a life bar in this tennis game -- as most Fever attacks will do damage to you. If your life bar reaches zero, you'll be rendered particularly sluggish for a few seconds, or if you’re playing a doubles match, you'll have to sit out the match for a spell, leaving your partner on their own.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFmariotennisfever5.jpg"></a></figure>



<p><strong>The Fever Racket system is promising in theory, but in practice, it has some serious issues</strong>. The various disruptions inflicted by Fever Shots simply last <em>way</em> too long. The erupting volcano I mentioned in the previous paragraph will sit there in the middle of your court spurting lava over the course of <em>several</em> serves. And by the time the volcano finally disappears, your opponent has likely earned another Fever Shot and can immediately plant another damn volcano.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFmariotennisfever6.jpg"></a></figure>



<p><span>Given how quickly Fever Shots are earned, and the fact that all players carry their own Fever Rackets (in fact, you can choose to go into a match with&nbsp;<em>two</em>&nbsp;swappable rackets, for a total of&nbsp;<em>eight</em>&nbsp;possible different effects in a doubles match),</span> it all can quickly compound into an absolute shmozzle. In some cases, this can be fun and frantic, but the wrong combination of Fever Rackets and effects can result in a situation where it's almost impossible to even keep track of what's going on. <strong>Mario Tennis Fever developer Camelot needs to do some serious balancing on some of these Fever Rackets, plain and simple</strong>.</p>



<p>Mario Tennis Fever offers a fairly hearty selection of ways to play, including a single-player Adventure mode, Tournaments, fighting-game-style Trial Towers where you have to make your way through a series of sometimes-tricky challenges, a handful of novelty courts collected under the "Mix It Up" section, and, of course, Free Play, online modes, and the now-standard motion-controlled Swing Mode.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFmariotennisfever7.jpg"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Adventure is arguably the headliner of the bunch, but, unfortunately, it largely disappoints</strong>. It's no secret that the story modes in recent Camelot-developed Mario sports titles are basically just tutorials, but Mario Tennis Fever makes it painfully obvious. The game kicks off with Mario and pals going on a quest to acquire a Golden Fruit that will cure Daisy of a mysterious ailment. Said fruit is located on an unexplored island, but Wario and Waluigi's usual troublemaking leads to a confrontation with some shadowy, spidery monsters that somehow turn Mario, Luigi, Peach, Wario, and Waluigi into babies.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFmariotennisfever8.jpg"></a></figure>



<p><strong>What follows is at least a couple of hours of painfully dry tutorials</strong>, as Baby Mario and Luigi reacquire their skills (they aren't even able to return a ball over the net at first). These early hours of Adventure mode fall into a very predictable loop -- do a couple of Mario-Party-style minigames, which often have little to nothing to do with tennis, complete a couple of simple tests of your skills, do a literal quiz-style knowledge test, then play a quick tennis match before moving on to the next grade and doing it all again.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFmariotennisfever9.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Eventually, you do graduate from tennis school and things get a bit more interesting, with players facing some unique challenges and various boss battles, but this latter part of Adventure mode feels <em>very</em> compressed. It's bam, bam, bam, one enemy encounter or boss after another. There's a <em>single</em> dungeon that actually requires a small amount of navigational skill in the game, but then, nothing like that is ever done again. <strong>While Adventure mode offers a few memorable moments over its roughly 4-hour runtime, it is overall very uneven and haphazardly put together</strong>.</p>



<p>As for Fever's other modes, the Tournaments and Trial Towers are fine, yet fairly shallow options (there are only three levels of tournament to work through, for instance). The wacky Mix It Up modes, which challenge you to do things like play tennis in a giant pinball machine or on a court affected by Wonder Flower effects, just add more chaos to an already chaotic core experience.</p>

<p>Ultimately, <strong>Mario Tennis Fever suffers from the same problem this series has struggled with for generations now: it's at its most fun when you strip away the game’s unique "Mario" gimmicks</strong>. The game allows you to disable Fever Rackets, which I fairly quickly started doing when I could (they can't be escaped in a lot of the single-player content). Of course, this raises the key question -- if you're not going to embrace the new gimmick, how is Mario Tennis Fever really all that different than, say, Mario Tennis Aces, which is also playable on the Switch 2?</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Make no mistake, whether you ban Fever Rackets or choose to embrace the chaos, <strong>Mario Tennis Fever, like all games in the series, is still often a good time, particularly when playing against other human beings</strong>. And the game gives you a ton of options for doing that, including splitscreen on a single system, local multi-system multiplayer, online play, and even GameShare with those who don't own the game. It's these multiplayer options that are going to keep folks playing Super Mario Fever long term, so it's nice that Nintendo has made its tennis club so accessible.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Mario Tennis Fever still scores points for its core gameplay, particularly when playing against other people, but the game’s frustrating new Fever Racket gimmick and underwhelming single-player modes don’t bring all that much to the court. The result is a game that can be fun at times, but doesn’t stand out from other recent Mario Tennis games in a way that’s likely to raise Switch 2 owners’ temperatures.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Basic tennis action remains solid
</li><li>A wide array of different modes
</li><li>Many ways to play with others</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>Fever Rackets are kind of a hot mess
</li><li>Adventure mode isn't very engaging
</li><li>Presentation is only so-so</li>						</ul>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/planet-of-lana-2-children-of-the-leaf">Planet of Lana II</a>, Wishfully’s followup to their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/planet-of-lana-review">tremendous</a> puzzle-platformer original, punched our news mouths with a double hit of announcements last week. First, it’s got a <a href="https://x.com/Thunderfulgames/status/2019426200498683924">release date of March 5th 2026</a>, a mere three weeks from now, and second, there’s a Steam demo coming even sooner, on February 11th. An embargo lift means I’m now at liberty to share my thoughts on said demo, and can report that it’s <em>exactly the same</em> as the demo given to press last year, and as such, you can already read what I said about it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/batman-good-boys-and-space-whale-texting-all-the-other-gamescom-games-i-saw-but-didnt-have-time-to-write-about">here</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/james-most-anticipated-pc-games-for-2026">here</a>. Still, eh? Release date, eh?</p>

<p>In any event, I'd encourage playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2997230/Planet_of_Lana_II/">the Steam version</a> once it releases tomorrow (it'll stay available at least through the next Steam Next Fest, which runs between Feb 23rd and March 2nd). Skipping across multiple scenarios from five different points in the game, it’s a good demonstration of both how the sequel maintains <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/planet-of-lana">Planet of Lana</a>’s gorgeous, hand-painterly style, and how the scale of its puzzles has grown. You’re still controlling both Lana and friendly alien cat/monkey/<a href="https://www.makeship.com/products/mui-plushie">marketable plushie</a> Mui, except the latter is no longer afraid to venture beyond Lana’s immediate vicinity, opening up taller and wider opportunities for crate-pushing and button-prodding.</p>
<p>Mui’s power to hypnotise local wildlife has also been expanded to allow for direct control over thralls, something that’s crucial to the demo’s highlight: an underwater warren, patrolled by shark-life beasts, that Mui and a newly diving-trained Lana must navigate without getting chomped. This, on its own, is bigger than any individual puzzle I can recall from the original, while an especially vexing machine manipulation challenge at the demo’s end suggests that Planet of Lana II’s thinky tests will get tougher as well as larger.</p>
<p>I’ll still a little unsure of this, given just how well Planet of Lana judged its difficulty – rare is the puzzle game that can consistently put your brain to work without inflicting a potentially fatal case of getting stuck. I absolutely enjoyed the demo, though, both on the first go last summer and this past week. March 5th really ain’t a long wait for the whole thing, to boot.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[All Signs Point To A Resident Evil 5 Remake After New ESRB Listing]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-5-re5-remake-capcom-xbox-series-2000667258</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The Entertainment Software Ratings Board may have just inadvertently spoiled the reveal of Capcom’s next </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> remake, as an Xbox Series page for </span><i><span>Resident Evil 5</span></i><span> has just appeared on the ratings board’s website. While the listing on the ESRB’s website doesn’t mention a PlayStation 5 version, the timing is especially suspect, as Sony just announced a State of Play livestream for February 12. For context, </span><i><span>Resident Evil 4 Remake</span></i><span> was revealed during a State of Play in June 2022.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40376/resident-evil-5/"><span>ESRB page</span></a><span> for the Xbox Series version of </span><i><span>Resident Evil 5</span></i><span> is relatively sparse as far as new information is concerned, but there is one small piece of info that points to this being a full-blown remake: the “In-Game Purchases” tag.</span></p> <p><span>Capcom is a fan of dropping microtransaction-esque DLCs for their modern games at release, such as </span><i><span>Resident Evil 4 Remake’s</span></i><span> “Treasure Map: Expansion” DLC and </span><i><span>Dragon’s Dogma 2’s</span></i><span> much-maligned “Portcrystal” DLC. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One ports of </span><i><span>Resident Evil 5</span></i><span> contain all of its previously released DLC, and launched before Capcom’s obsession with MTX-style launch DLC. This alone implies that the version of </span><i><span>Resident Evil 5</span></i><span> on the ESRB’s website may indeed be a remake.</span></p>

 <p><span>The ESRB page also lines up with </span><a href="https://x.com/KarenShevaEva/status/2011868483194392926"><span>this post</span></a><span> from Eva La Dare, who voiced and mocapped Sheva Alomar in </span><i><span>Resident Evil 5</span></i><span>, on X last month. “Got a few fun things lined up for March. Stay tuned!❤️ #residentevil30thanniversary,” reads Dare’s post. Curiously, it also features the hashtags “#residentevil5,” “#shevaalomar” and “#RE5.”</span></p> <p><span>Funnily enough, the post was </span><a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2012597154825515449?s=20"><span>refuted</span></a><span> by leakers, who seem to be adamant that the next </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> project after </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem </span></i><span>will be a remake of </span><i><span>Resident Evil – Code: Veronica</span></i><span>. Hopefully, Thursday’s State of Play will help clarify things, as the likelihood of the ESRB’s listing being a mistake is relatively low.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Spending time with my mom inevitably means talking about work, and since she’s retired, this almost always means </span><i><span>my</span></i><span> work. During a recent conversation, I brought up being asked to review </span><i><span>Romeo Is a Dead Man</span></i><span>, the latest project from Grasshopper Manufacture and its chief auteur Goichi “Suda51” Suda. Or, putting it in terms she could appreciate, “a new video game from that guy I was </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/suda51-on-25-years-of-making-strange-masterpieces-at-grasshopper-manufacture"><span>super excited to interview</span></a><span> a few years ago.”</span></p> <p><span>Her follow-up question was a little more problematic: “What’s it about?”</span></p> <p><span>It felt as if time froze. I’d spent hours with </span><i><span>Romeo Is a Dead Man</span></i><span> by that point but didn’t have a good answer. Was it a doomed love story? A mind-bending, interdimensional adventure? An ode to human complexity? A fascinating example of Grasshopper excess? A lesson in self-actualization? A send-up of American exceptionalism? An indictment of the ironically isolating nature of social media? A vehicle for Suda to yet again pay homage to his favorite movies, television shows, music, and video games? A cheeky love letter to Grasshopper’s history, not to mention gaming as a whole?</span></p>

 <p><span>“It’s… complicated,” was all I could muster before changing the subject.</span></p> <p><i><span>Romeo Is a Dead Man</span></i><span> is, on paper, pretty much what I’ve come to expect from a modern-day Grasshopper Manufacture project. It’s everything above at once and yet not at all like what I described at the same time. Is it fun? Is it meaningful? Is it worth time and money? I think so—and will try to explain why in the forthcoming paragraphs—but the process of explaining how a piece of art made you feel involves more than just words.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-Box Quote: </p>                 <p>“I didn't understand anything and loved every second of it.”  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Grasshopper Manufacture  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of Game: </p>                 <p>Action-adventure, hack-and-slash.  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Maximalist aesthetics, peak storytelling</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Makes few innovations to a well-trod, albeit still fun, formula.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms: </p>                 <p>PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (Played on PlayStation 5).</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release Date: </p>                 <p>February 11, 2026</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played: </p>                 <p>40 hours; playthroughs on both Milk Chocolate (normal) and Couverture Chocolate (super hard) difficulties with some post-game secret exploring while maxing out stats on Romeo as well as his weapons and Bastards.  </p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>The late David Lynch, in his autobiography </span><i><span>Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity</span></i><span>, says people know more than they think when it comes to interpreting art.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Someone might say, ‘I don’t understand music,’ but most people experience music emotionally and would agree that music is an abstraction,” Lynch writes. “You don’t need to put music into words right away, you just listen. Cinema is a lot like music. It can be very abstract, but people have a yearning to make intellectual sense of it, to put it right into words. And when they can’t do that, it feels frustrating. But they can come up with an explanation from within, if they just allow it.”</span></p>

 <p><span>So while it’s easy to say things like, “</span><i><span>Romeo Is a Dead Man</span></i><span> is an evolution of the mechanically gratifying, hack-and-slash formula previously created with </span><i><span>No More Heroes</span></i><span>,” because it is, it’s another, more excruciating exercise altogether to define the game’s overall meaning. It’s this quality that makes Grasshopper Manufacture’s games so special, and something </span><i><span>Romeo</span></i><span> has in spades.</span></p> <h2><b>Slice, Dice, and Julienne</b></h2> <p><span>Let’s start by getting the easy stuff out of the way. </span><i><span>Romeo Is a Dead Man</span></i><span> is Grasshopper’s first original project since spending the last 10 years (</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/suda51-has-ideas-for-no-more-heroes-4-but-the-series-1847512628"><span>maybe</span></a><span>) wrapping up the </span><i><span>No More Heroes</span></i><span> series. It stars Romeo Stargazer, a young sheriff’s deputy who, after being munched on by a demon, is saved by his grandfather Benjamin, a Doc Brown- or Rick Sanchez-style scientist with almost limitless scientific knowledge, and turned into a half-dead superhero. Romeo trades his life in small-town Deadford, Pennsylvania for a gig with the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Space-Time Police, and the story kicks off </span><i><span>in media res</span></i><span> as he tries to figure out his situationship with the mysterious Juliet Dendrobium and hunt down nefarious criminals wreaking havoc on time and space.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Romeo Is a Dead Man</span></i><span>’s moment-to-moment gameplay is spent traveling through mostly linear levels broken up between sections set in the action-heavy “real” space and the more peaceful subspace, an area that makes up for its lack of combat with aesthetics based around distinctive, voxel-based mazes with walls that warp in and out of reality. Altering the environment in one dimension frequently affects the other, which gives the game a distinct—if not wholly unique—rhythm where moments of pure chaos flow into chill, puzzle-solving sections and vice versa.</span></p> <p><span>If you’ve played </span><i><span>No More Heroes 3</span></i><span>, you should already have a good idea of what’s on offer here as far as combat goes. Grasshopper is the king of fast-paced, frenetic melee combat, and </span><i><span>Romeo Is a Dead Man</span></i><span> lives up to that reputation. Romeo may be a more subdued protagonist than Travis Touchdown, but he still carves up foes like a hot chainsaw through zombie brains. And in eschewing its tendency to develop games for Nintendo platforms first, Grasshopper is able to take full advantage of the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC’s more powerful hardware to fill the screen with an almost obnoxious amount of visual flourishes. At times, the only way to keep track of Romeo through all of the button-mashing violence is through the lighting on his sword as it turns enemies into Miike-esque fountains of blood. The boss battles, on the other hand, feel as meticulously designed as anything you’d find in </span><i><span>Dark Souls</span></i><span>, and proved to be a compelling and formidable challenge even at the normal difficulty.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000667241" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667241"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667241">Grasshopper Manufacture</figcaption></figure> <p><span>But that’s not to say </span><i><span>Romeo Is a Dead Man</span></i><span> doesn’t add anything to the modern Grasshopper formula. Romeo is also capable of dishing out punishment from a distance with a suite of firearms ranging from a simple pistol to a grasshopper-shaped bazooka. The damage dealt by these weapons largely pales in comparison to what you can achieve with melee weapons, but they do come in handy when targeting weak points on tougher enemies and bosses, which present as beautiful, blue flowers and satisfyingly explode with consecutive attacks. As the game nears its conclusion and starts throwing groups of more powerful monsters at you, Romeo’s guns become invaluable assets, even if using them nets you less energy for his special, health-restoring Bloody Summer attacks.</span></p>

 <p><span>As you play through </span><i><span>Romeo Is a Dead Man</span></i><span>, enemies will sometimes drop seeds that you will then need to take back to the hub area—a spaceship used by the Space-Time Police where you can chat up your allies, upgrade Romeo’s stats and equipment, and bet on yourself against bosses in time-attack-style rematches—and plant in garden plots nurtured by Romeo’s half-sister, Luna. Over time, these pods become Bastards, helpful zombies who function like fighting game assists you can equip as back-up during missions. I built out my squad with variations capable of distracting enemies and trapping them in wormholes, but there are also Bastards who function to provide shields and restore your health.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Romeo</span></i><span> also includes a fusion system not unlike that in the </span><i><span>Megami Tensei</span></i><span> franchise, allowing you to improve your Bastards’ stats and even discover all-new Bastards with even wilder abilities. That said, the process of combining, planting, and harvesting Bastards can get a little tedious, and I was relieved to be done with it once I’d maxed out my favorites’ stats. Something so vital to defeating the game’s difficult bosses should probably have been cut back to just one or two steps, but maybe that’s the point: Good things take time.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Life is but a Dream</b></h2> <p><span>I’ve</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/no-more-heroes-3-the-kotaku-review-1847560250"> <span>long argued</span></a><span> that Grasshopper’s work shares a lot in common with the movies of legendary filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky. Both are so full of symbolism, you end up being swept away by a flood of allegory and left grasping for any meaning you can find. </span><i><span>Romeo Is a Dead Man</span></i><span> is no different, but as I indicated earlier in this review, I couldn’t help but also think of David Lynch over the course of the 20 hours or so it took me to first reach the game’s credits. Lynch mixed dream-like absurdity and heartfelt earnestness in the pursuit of stirring the viewer’s emotional intuition rather than adhering to a strict, traditional narrative structure. The beauty and frustration of his art, like Grasshopper’s, is in how it demands you participate in its interpretation, or as </span><i><span>Romeo</span></i><span>’s narrator suggests at one point between chapters, “The truth is rarely pure and never simple.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000667243" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667243"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667243">Grasshopper Manufacture</figcaption></figure> <p><span>One of my favorite parts of </span><i><span>Romeo Is a Dead Man</span></i><span> is completely divorced from its violent gameplay. Speaking with the Space-Time Police force’s resident nurse WorstPink and asking her to evaluate you will kick off what at first seems like a silly personality quiz before it shifts into a full-on dating sim parody. WorstPink asks Romeo a static series of questions and you’re given three possible responses from which to choose. The catch is that only one is correct, while the other two will immediately end the side quest and boot you back to the hub area, forced to start from the beginning again. I lost count of the number of times this happened to me, but finally, I managed to memorize the mini-game’s 99 questions and see the ending.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike the rest of the game, where you can develop the necessary skills and knowledge to defeat any challenge </span><i><span>Romeo Is a Dead Man</span></i><span> throws at you, WorstPink’s mini-game is based on a little luck and a whole lot of trial-and-error. It was probably the most stressed I’ve ever gotten playing a video game. I wasn’t exactly sure why until it finally dawned on me: The multiple-choice conversation, with its fine line between success and failure, reminded me of navigating social situations in real life. This part of the game essentially simulates what it’s like to be neuroatypical, or at least the gut-wrenching confusion that arises when you aren’t sure of the “right” thing to say and choosing the “wrong” thing feels like a catastrophe. In the end, all you can do is try to do a little better the next time around.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Romeo Is a Dead Man</span></i><span> is full of little moments like this, mixed media distractions from the bloodshed that seem pointless before eventually taking on a greater meaning. They aren’t specifically built to tickle consumers’ dopamine pathways. They won’t always hit you the same way—or at all—but allowing </span><i><span>Romeo</span></i><span> to wash over you rather than trying to package its complexities in a neat little box will let you walk away with at least one thing to appreciate. Suda51 and the team he’s gathered at Grasshopper Manufacture continues to put out games that function both as entertaining distractions from the pressures of reality and thought-provoking art installations. It’s almost like having your cake and eating it too.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/romeo-dead-man-review-suda51-grasshopper-manufacture-2000667232]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Josef Fares, founder of Hazelight Studios, has revealed that he and his team are at work at yet another video game. This should come as little surprise, given the success of Hazelight's last game: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>.</p>
<p>The reveal, which comes from Fares himself, comes in the form of a photo posted on his personal Twitter account. This photo shows Fares in a mocap studio, his arm blocking three actors in ball-covered mocap suits to keep their identities mysterious… This image comes with a sentence from Fares: "Next game in the making".</p>
<p>So what do we know about this next game? Well, precious little. We know Hazelight <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/split-fiction-and-it-takes-two-director-is-already-fully-focused-on-hazelights-next-game-which-the-studio-started-work-on-around-a-month-ago-its-quite-early/">started working on it in early 2025</a>, and that Fares was "super, super excited" about it. The only people who do know more about it, aside from Hazelight developers themselves, are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-players-invited-to-see-studios-next-game-after-beating-rock-hard-secret-level">those who first completed Split Fiction's incredibly hard secret level</a>.</p>

<p>Hazelight's last game Split Fiction proved exceptionally successful. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">The game sold 2m copies in just a week after its launch</a>, the first million of which being sold in the first 48 hours. Not too shabby. This proved so good a launch that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-praises-split-fiction-hugely-successful-launch-as-game-passes-another-sales-milestone">EA gave the game its flowers during a quarterly financial report</a>, stating the game was a key part of a strong Q4 in 2025 alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a>.</p><p>If you've not played Split Fiction yourself, maybe<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review"> Eurogamer's Split Fiction review is worth a read</a>! In it, Katherine Castle summarised the game as: "Fantastic from start to finish, Split Fiction is one of the most inventive and joyful co-op games to date, and a testament to the power of human imagination."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy has released its financial statement covering the 2025 fiscal year (which, unlike many other companies, actually spans January through December), and revenue is up just in time for the studio's new CEO to take the reins.</p><p>In its latest <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/?publicationId=e31c174f-9768-44d4-bf60-885d2a016ae3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">financial results summary</a>, Remedy says revenue has increased by 17.5% when compared to last year, although profit has fallen. It's a similar story for the final quarter of the year; revenue is up, but profit is down.</p><p>Interim CEO Markus Mäki says that Remedy's revenue jump in the fourth quarter can mainly be explained by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-profitable-sales-2m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="970912fc-80d4-4e9c-8bef-ae9633225b34" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a><em> </em>and <em>Control </em>sales, with the former also generating "meaningful royalties" throughout the year as a whole.</p><figure role="group">

<p><em>Control</em> has also done pretty well for itself; the game sold over a million copies in 2025 alone, likely driven at least in part by the announcement of sequel <em>Control Resonant </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-game-awards-2025-recap" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7f71e644-2289-45c0-a1c9-dc56c3797e8a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">at December's Game Awards</a>.</p><p>Of course, it hasn't been an entirely positive year for Remedy. In June, the studio released <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, its multiplayer shooter set in <em>Control</em>'s Oldest House, and in August, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-fbc-firebreak-launch-sales-financials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6847b7cf-34a2-4aec-ac18-8271f49e62c9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">admitted it was "unsatisfied"</a> with the game's sales to that point.</p><p>Indeed, in October, Mäki said Remedy was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-fbc-firebreak-financials-q3-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="89020d81-5dd2-41cc-bbd0-73fab64dcbd5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">moving development resources away</a> from <em>FBC: Firebreak </em>and towards other in-development titles, although he also said the studio would "respect [its] communicated roadmap" for the shooter.</p><p>Remedy's latest financial statement comes just a day or so after the studio <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/?publicationId=c86bbf74-7d56-4b1e-bc4d-56f406fc8258" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">announced</a> the appointment of its new CEO, Jean-Charles Gaudechon, who says he wants to both "protect what makes [Remedy] special" and "scale [the studio] in a way that builds lasting value".</p><figure role="group">

<p>With regard to the game's direction, Riot says its plans for the 2026 Competitive Series, at least, are "unchanged", and that it will continue to support "events and organizers that already power the FGC (fighting game community)".</p><p><em>2XKO </em>isn't shutting down or being canceled; rather, Riot says these layoffs will allow it to give the game "a more sustainable path forward", and that the studio intends to "continue communicating about how things are progressing".</p><p>As to the employees being laid off, Riot says it's provided "a minimum of six months of notice pay and severance" to employees for whom other positions within the organization couldn't be found.</p><p>Riot is far from the only studio to lay off employees in recent months. Others include the likes of <em>Ashes of Creation</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ashes-of-creation-layoffs-canceled-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1b59358e-2c0a-4543-a759-154075e27078" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Intrepid Studios</a>, <em>Tomb Raider </em>outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crystal-dynamics-layoffs-november-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9d6386f8-4642-4532-8c75-667f88869d6e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Crystal Dynamics</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-development-ending-amazon-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="96fc63cd-c591-42ec-8af0-59f8445fa07b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Amazon Games</a>, to name but a few.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Helldivers 2’s Machinery of Oppression update brings the Cyborg Legion back to the game today. </p>



<p>Through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-cyborg-legion-return/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous trailer</a>, we were informed that the Cyberog Legion will be returning to the game sometime soon. Now, the update details revealed how their return will be and what measures Helldivers can take to avoid casualties. Learn more about the Machinery of Oppression update below: </p>







<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-machinery-of-oppression-update-takes-players-to-cyberstan">Helldivers 2 Machinery of Oppression Update Takes Players to Cyberstan</h2>



<p>As the Automatons have seized the schematics for the Star of Peace, Helldivers have to take the fight to the streets of Cyberstan in the Machinery of Oppression <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/10/new-helldivers-2-update-out-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">update</a>. Players will have to step foot in this bot-infested world and breach their massive factory cities. The Factory Cities feature huge industrial complexes riddled with danger at every turn. </p>



<p>The update introduces a brand-new primary mission: halting the production of additional Cyborgs and compromising the Automaton Defenses. The way to do this is to destroy the factory buildings by building and tearing down statues of war criminals and terrorists. </p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-update-introduces-3-new-enemy-types">Helldivers 2 Update Introduces 3 New Enemy Types</h2>



<p>The latest Machinery of Oppression Update for Helldivers 2 will bring back an old, familiar threat, the Cyborgs. There are three new enemy types: Agitators who command the Automaton legion in the field and are heavily armoured; Cyborg Radicals that will rush you and fight up close and personal. The last one is the Vox Engine: the Voice of the Cyborg Legion, a war machine armed with dual laser cannons, rockets, laser gatlings, and more. </p>

</figure>



<h2 id="h-deaths-will-be-counted-in-the-battle-against-cyberstan">Deaths Will be Counted in the Battle Against Cyberstan </h2>



<p>What’s more, players have to stay alive for as long as possible after this update drops; you can’t go willy-nilly dying each second. A Galactic Reinforcement Counter will be used to count every death in the Battle for Cyberstan.

<p>KRAFTON and PUBG Mobile Esports have lifted the lid on the 2026 competitive roadmap, uncovering a year of high-stakes tournaments and huge prize pools. As one of the top-tier handheld esports titles, PUBG Mobile enjoys a prestigious roadmap every year, and 2026 promises to be no different.</p>



<p>It all begins with the inaugural season of the PUBG Mobile Global Open. Registration for this event starts this month, and by June, we’ll have the grand finals for this all-new global event. But there’s so much more on the way.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-pubg-mobile-esports-events-revealed-for-2026">All PUBG Mobile Esports Events Revealed for 2026</h2>



<p>In a new press release, the team at KRAFTON unveiled what’s coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pubg-mobile/" id="1716">PUBG Mobile’s</a> esports ecosystem this year.</p>



<p>The PUBG Mobile Global Open kicks off first, with the main event of that tournament circuit taking place in Indonesia. The second season of that circuit will culminate in a major LAN event in Pakistan, and <strong>both </strong>seasons will boast a monumental prize pool worth $500,000.</p>



<p>KRAFTON anticipates more than 200 countries will participate in the ‘Road to PMGO’, attempting to qualify for the new events.</p>



<p>Beyond that, the PUBG Mobile World Cup will land at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh, just as it did last year. This event will feature 32 of the world’s best PUBG Mobile teams, all competing for an enormous prize pool worth $3 million.</p>



<p>That’s not all, as towards the end of the year, the PUBG Mobile Global Championship will unfold, featuring 38 teams and <strong>another </strong>$3 million prize pool. These events and their combined prize pots make PUBG Mobile one of the most lucrative esports games in 2026. It’s a testament to the <strong>value </strong>of mobile esports.</p>



<p>Which PUBG Mobile esports event are you most looking forward to this year? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A brand new patch for ARC Raiders has arrived, introducing new features like Shared Watch along with content and bug fixes. </p>



<p>We have been hearing a lot about ARC Raiders leading up to the recent update, with the developers confirming that there will be no ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-wont-have-fortnite-skins-protect-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Skins</a>‘ to protect the game’s vision, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embark-studios/" id="1161">Embark</a> CEO has also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embark-responds-to-arc-raiders-players-unsatisfied-with-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a> to the players who are unsatisfied with the roadmap. Now, the latest update is live, and here’s what’s new about it. </p>







<h2 id="h-everything-new-in-arc-raiders-update-1-15-0">Everything New in ARC Raiders Update 1.15.0? </h2>



<p>Starting with all the new additions in ARC Raiders Update 1.15.0, which include Shared Watch, Cold Snap return, and new cosmetics. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-shared-watch-event-launches-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shared Watch</a> is a new event designed for players to team up against machines. The event begins today and runs live until February 24. Players will be rewarded for destroying, assisting, and damaging ARC, while no merits will be earned through PvP encounters. </p>



<p>The Cold Snap map condition is back in rotation of outdoor maps, arriving with Frostbite Damage and the ability to collect Candleberries and throw Snowballs. There are two new cosmetic sets to look forward to with RC Raiders Update 1.15.0: The Vulpine Set and The Slugger Set. Check out all the bug fixes in the patch notes below: </p>



<h2 id="h-all-arc-raiders-update-1-15-0-patch-notes">All ARC Raiders Update 1.15.0 Patch Notes</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Shared Watch</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is an opportunity to team up in the fight against the machines.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The Shared Watch Event starts today and ends on February 24. Players will earn merits from destroying, assisting and damaging ARC and earn rewards. No merits will be earned from PvP encounters. Bring a friend or bring a stranger, but above all, bring enough ammo to make sure the machines notice you first.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Cold Snap Map Condition</strong>
<ul>
<li>Winter is not quite done with the Rust Belt – We are bringing back Cold Snap!</li>



<li>The map condition is back in rotation on outdoor maps with the same mix of risk and reward. Frostbite damage will make your trip topside a short one if you don’t seek shelter, but for those who do brave the tundra – there’s increased loot value at stake!&nbsp;</li>



<li>You can still collect Candleberries, but they are no longer tied to any event. You can also collect, and throw, snowballs! Use them wisely, or don’t.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Cosmetics</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Vulpine set</li>



<li>The Slugger set</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-content-and-bug-fixes-nbsp">Content and Bug Fixes&nbsp;</h3>



<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>



<ul>
<li>Improved instances where players sometimes could not reconnect after disconnecting from a game.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where the match start tunnel scene sometimes wasn’t being shown.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where trials’ objective rewards could fail to grant at the end of a round due to a timeout, ensuring partial rewards are awarded when earned.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where the end of round screen would sometimes show incorrect merits, XP, and Live Event points.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where players’ platform icons would sometimes show incorrectly.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where crafting would sometimes get cancelled.</li>
</ul>



<h4>Utility</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Trailblazer Grenade</strong>
<ul>
<li>The explosions no longer deal damage through walls.</li>



<li>Deals more damage to small enemies but less damage to bigger enemies such as the Leaper and Bastion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h4>Weapons&nbsp;</h4>



<ul>
<li>Fixed inconsistent weapon cycling when bound to keys other than the mouse wheel; keybinds now swap weapons reliably.</li>
</ul>



<h4>Known Issues</h4>



<ul>
<li>One of the Marco set helmet variants may appear incorrectly in preview and in the menu but will appear correctly in game.</li>



<li>Players may occasionally not receive a skill point as indicated in the result screen. A reboot/playing another round fixes the issue.</li>



<li>‘Purchase Raider Tokens’ page may appear in front of the inbox and profile page when switching between them.</li>



<li>Player animations may appear broken when interrupting a search of the Baron Husk.</li>



<li>Certain containers may be unavailable to be interacted with.</li>



<li>Ziplines placed onto destroyed ARC parts will not appear correctly.</li>



<li>Scrappy “Batting Helmet” and the “Slugger” outfit might not appear correctly in the event preview.</li>



<li>The “Blindsided” achievement may not trigger as intended on the first attempt.</li>
</ul>

              <p>If you were expecting to see a second glimpse of Game Science’s follow-up to 2024’s break-out hit <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, this isn’t that. However, this brilliant short still promises much for what we can expect from <em>Black Myth: Zhong Kui</em>. This six-minute short film, created entirely in-engine, depicts the most extraordinary…cooking you’ve ever seen. It’s to celebrate Chinese New Year, and it’s truly special.</p> <p>Expecting to see new monsters being hit with giant sticks and swords, I really wasn’t prepared for this wild-ass cookery demonstration set in the game’s mythical ancient China. This clip shows a studio still in a position of peak confidence, not least because none of what’s shown here is even part of the forthcoming game, described as “non-canon” and “unrelated to the main storyline.” It’s just a work of stunning gorgeousness to celebrate the Year of the Horse.</p>

  <p>The demise of the blinking slab of meat was perhaps the most striking moment for me, in a film packed with extraordinary details and ruthless knife work. It’s there early on, dangling in the background, eyes just staring, unlikely to be noticed the first time you watch. It’s definitely worth watching at least twice.</p> <p>While this doesn’t show the game in any sense at all, it’s also the most remarkable tech demo. Just the squishiness of the fish, for goodness sakes. And while the particle effects of dust and chopped leaves are still the weakest aspect, they’re the best I’ve ever seen. And the liquids are <em>crazy&nbsp;</em>good. And that’s not even mentioning the creature design.</p>

 <p>This isn’t the first time Game Science has done this. In fact, it’s the sixth! The first was for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oyu1y9dN4Y">2021’s Year of the Ox</a>, and was far more of a game trailer for <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>than short film. 2022’s was a whole other kettle of cats, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPezz6HQm-I">a 12-minute mockumentary</a> about a fictional version of Game Science programming kittens into <em>Wukong</em> (completely with genuine motion capture footage!) to mark the Year of the Tiger. 2023’s Year of the Rabbit received <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERWqW7L9vU8">a stop-motion animation of a bunny</a> trying to get a PC version of a Game Science game working, while in 2024, for the Year of the Loong, the team put out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqe2pSjh7S4">a 13-minute live-action dramatic film</a> complete with song. 2025 was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_qVHZMo2ls">also a live-action short for the Year of the Snake</a>, but this time sneakily plugging a whole bunch of&nbsp;<em>Black Myth</em> merch to accompany its dramatic narrative rap.</p>

 <p>So if anything, this year’s sixth New Year release is perhaps one of the more normal entries, given it’s made using the engine for the forthcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-2-gamescom-teaser-trailer-zhong-kui-game-science-china-2000618534"><em>Black Myth: Zhong Kui</em></a>, and names the game itself. Although I must note a distinct lack of horses. If you want to see more of what that’s actually intended to look like, a teaser trailer was released last year:</p>

            <p>Hyper-realistic food was one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy XV</a>'s strengths, and many RPGs since then have really committed to perfecting the art of beautifully rendered cooking and dishes. Up next, it seems that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> studio Game Science is upping its food tech for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-black-myth-game-announced-by-game-science-following-wukong-success">Zhong Kui</a>, the sequel of sorts that was revealed last year.</p>
<p>Today, 10th February, the developer surprise-dropped a "Chinese New Year Special" video that contains over six minutes of in-game footage from Black Myth: Zhong Kui... unless it's not really about the game we'll get at some point in the future. Watch it here:</p> <figure>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZygQP-U3MtM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>Yes, that seems like an odd way to market a heavily hyped game, but since the action-RPG is still years away, there's no proper vertical slice ready to be shown. I guess it's neat to have a major studio putting something together for the fans, even if it's just a fancy tech showcase of food and demons casually hanging with chill humans... and sharing body parts with them to make the dishes special. I'll admit the blend of cozy and unsettling vibes works.</p>
<p>The very last scene teases someone who's about to be fed by their captors, but how are we supposed to be excited or theorize? We know nothing about the actual game yet. Even the final message underlines the video is a "Year of the Horse Special" that's unrelated to the main storyline and non-canon, so what do those seconds even mean?</p><p>In any case, there's plenty of symbolism and tradition to chew on here, especially if you're familiar with Chinese culture. Those in love with cutting-edge graphics will have plenty to admire too, and I personally always enjoy when developers go extra hard on food and assets most people don't pay much attention to.</p>

            <guid>1430881</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Discord has announced that it will start rolling out its age verification checks globally in March, getting ahead of the legislation that is being introduced by various regions around the world. All users will now have a “teen-appropriate” experience by default, with new settings, age-gated restrictions to more adult servers and spaces, and content filtering.</p>
<p>Building on the existing technology used for the UK, Australia, and other clamped down markets, Discord’s age verification will have two methods: facial age estimation scans and uploaded government IDs. In the former instance, they state that video selfies are processed on-device and will not be uploaded, while also stated that any uploaded IDs will be deleted “quickly”. Some users will be asked to provide multiple forms of age verification, and Discord is also using an age inference model to try and figure out if your account is adult from behaviours.</p>


<p>Without verifying, the following will be imposed:</p>
<ul role="list">
<li><strong>Content Filters:</strong> Discord users will need to be age-assured as adults in order to unblur sensitive content or turn off the setting.</li>
<li><strong>Age-gated Spaces</strong> – Only users who are age-assured as adults will be able to access age-restricted channels, servers, and app commands.</li>
<li><strong>Message Request Inbox:</strong> Direct messages from people a user may not know are routed to a separate inbox by default, and access to modify this setting is limited to age-assured adult users.</li>
<li><strong>Friend Request Alerts:</strong> People will receive warning prompts for friend requests from users they may not know.</li>
<li><strong>Stage Restrictions:</strong> Only age-assured adults may speak on stage in servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally there is a large amount of pushback from the communities and users of the prevalent chat platform. A lot of people do not like this kind of verification and feel it to be a gross invasion of privacy, even with assurances. After all, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/10/discord-data-breach-leaks-70000-government-ids-used-for-age-verification/">Discord was able to leak a reported 70,000 government IDs last year</a>, highlighting the main weakness in these kinds of systems: third party partners.</p>
<p>The vast majority of users should be able to get by without the addition verification, but there’s plenty reports of false positives and negatives from facial scans, especially within that tricky 16-20 year old age bracket. A lot of 17 year olds will get approved, a lot of 18 year olds won’t. This then brings the more troubling need for government ID to be uploaded, and if these IDs aren’t deleted quickly enough by Discord’s third party partners, that can be a weak point in security.</p>

<p>Discord has partnered with k-ID, which is also used by Meta and Snap, and Swiss company Privately for the facial scans. In a statement to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/discord-faces-backlash-over-age-checks-after-data-breach-exposed-70000-ids/">Ars Technica</a>, they state that&nbsp;“the Facial Age Estimation technology runs entirely on the user’s device in real time when they are performing the verification. That means there is no video or image transmitted, and the estimation happens locally. The only data to leave the device is a pass/fail of the age threshold which is what Discord receives (and some performance metrics that contain no personal data).”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The director of It Takes Two and Split Fiction has posted a behind-the-scenes picture of the next Hazelight title. </p>



<p>During the last interview, the director had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hazelight-is-already-working-on-its-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that a new Hazelight title was already in development; however, it was still in its early stages, with only 130 pages of ideas ready for the upcoming game’s story. Now, he’s given players another teaser that doesn’t offer any concrete information.</p>







<h2 id="h-hazelight-s-next-game-seems-to-be-progressing-well">Hazelight’s Next Game Seems to be Progressing Well</h2>



<p>The new teaser has informed players that the next Hazelight game has progressed in some way. The director of It Takes Two and Split Fiction, Josef Fares, has posted a new image on <a href="https://x.com/josef_fares/status/2021163743036486041" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that appears to show the game’s cast wearing full-motion capture outfits, with all their faces covered by Fares’ arm.</p>



<p>The director posted the caption “Next game in the making” with this picture, and Hazelight responded, stating the developers are “back in the kitchen, cookin’ up something really delicious”. They also poked fun at the image and Fares’ pose, stating that they now feature “Strategic Arm Placement Tech”. </p>



<p>Talking about Josef Fares, he also recently confirmed that the “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-movies-first-version-of-the-script-has-been-finalized/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first version of the script</a>” for Split Fiction’s movie adaptation had been shown to him. Fares has also spoken with Sydney Sweeney, who is reportedly playing one of the characters in the movie. The director stated, “She seems pretty chill” and “hyped for the movie.”</p>

		<p>Embark has released the latest update for ARC Raiders with patch 1.15 being named Shared Watch. The reason for the name is to encourage player to work together to take on the machines, with the Shared Watch event running until February 24th. That is not the only thing players need to be aware of as winter is back with the Cold Snap condition coming back into rotation with the danger of frostbite and better loot both in play. There are also two new cosmetic sets, Vulpine and Slugger, along with some additional fixes.</p>
