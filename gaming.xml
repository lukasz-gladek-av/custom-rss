			<p><strong>Atomic Arcade</strong>, the <strong>Hasbro</strong> and <strong>Wizards of the Coast</strong>-owned studio that was making a game based on the iconic <strong>G.I. Joe</strong> character <strong>Snake Eyes</strong>, has reportedly been <strong>shut down</strong>. The news broke from one of the former team members, gameplay programmer <strong>Dominic Braun</strong>, shared on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dominicbraun_opentowork-activity-7429184370877345793-37wz?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">personal LinkedIn account</a> that he had been laid off following "<em>Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast's decision to close Atomic Arcade</em>."</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, there's been no official word from Hasbro, Wizards of the Coast or Atomic Arcade confirming the closure or the fate of the Snake Eyes game. We've reached out to Hasbro for comment and will update this article if/when we hear back or if an official statement is delivered through other verified channels.</p>



<p>We first heard about the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hasbro-has-a-big-budget-g-i-joe-snake-eyes-game-in-the-works/1100-6506502/">back in 2022,</a> with Atomic Arcade seemingly being formed for the purpose of making this Snake Eyes game. While the studio was active in sharing notices that it was looking to grow its team between 2022 and 2025, with the last major update being a sneak peek at the Snake Eyes model from Atomic Arcade back in <a href="https://x.com/AtomicArcadeStu/status/1922305837042991257">May 2025.</a></p>



<p>It's the latest studio shutdown and mass layoff of the year, after <strong>Ubisoft</strong> kicked off 2026 by embarking on a "<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/"><em><strong>major reset</strong></em>"</a> that included multiple studio shutdowns. We've also seen layoffs from <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-shuts-down-deadpool-vr-twisted-pixel-games-asgards-wrath-sanzaru-games/"><strong>Meta</strong> that ended <strong>Camouflaj's</strong> award-winning run of developing VR games</a>, Riot Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-close-to-half-2xko-team/">cutting nearly half of the <strong>2XKO</strong> development team shortly</a> after the game's 1.0 release, and most notably, <strong>Highguard</strong> developer <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-weeks-after-launch-highguard-developer-wildlight-has-already-had-layoffs-reportedly-cutting-most-of-the-team/">cutting "<em>most</em>" of its team</a>, barely two weeks after Highguard launched.</p>



<p>But at least in all of those cases, the studios impacted had gotten a game across the finish line. Atomic Arcade, seemingly, did not get the same chance, and now it seems like G.I. Joe and Snake Eyes fans who have been waiting for a major release based on the iconic ninja will have to wait a while longer.</p>



<p>It's also one less game coming from Hasbro's IPs, as we know that there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-is-making-a-new-game-based-on-one-of-hasbros-tentpole-franchises/">currently several games from Hasbro-owned IPs on their way</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26</a> brings a new MyGM draft format, additional playable GMs, expanded match types, and more, as a deeper level of control takes center stage.</p>



<p>WWE 2K has released a new <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k26/ringside-report/mygm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ringside Report, </a>giving players an in-depth look at the changes coming to the popular game mode. Major changes include more match types for players to select, a longer season mode than ever before, and new choices for the authority figure on your show.</p>







<h2 id="h-default-seasons-are-now-50-weeks-in-wwe-2k26-mygm">Default Seasons Are Now 50 Weeks in WWE 2K26 MyGM</h2>



<p>WWE 2K26 features 50-week seasons by default in MyGM. Also, starting budgets have increased and now range from $3 million to $7 million. Everyone’s budget is $5 million by default. </p>



<p>It is expected that higher budgets will increase the average roster size per brand by up to 35 Superstars. There’s also a new difficulty setting, Immortal, for experienced players looking for a new challenge.</p>







<h2 id="h-players-can-choose-to-double-book-stars">Players Can Choose to Double-Book Stars</h2>



<p>Another new feature is the ability to double-book wrestlers in both promos and matches on a single show. This means players will need to manage their roster members’ stamina more closely and pay closer attention to the show’s format, but it adds more realism.</p>



<p>Speaking of promos, invasion promises are new to WWE 2K26. Players can now send a star to attack the opposing brand when playing against friends. A good promo will earn you fans; a bad promo will make your brand look bad and could cost you fans.</p>



<p>As for match types, players can now book wrestlers for a variety of options, including the new 3 Stages of Hell. There’s also now support for 5-way, 6-way, and 8-way matches.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-legendary-gms-are-added-in-this-year-s-game">New Legendary GMs Are Added in This Year’s Game</h2>



<p>This year, MyGM Mode added new playable general managers, including the legendary Bobby “The Brain” Heenan, Stacy Keibler, and the Anonymous General Manager from 2011. They join Eric Bischoff, Adam Pearce, Mick Foley, and Ava.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/story-about-ai-being-mean-gets-pulled-because-journalist-used-ai-that-made-mistakes/</link>
            <guid>1437676</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>On Friday the website Ars Technica published a story about Scott Shambaugh, a coder who made headlines in the tech world last week <a href="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>with his story</u></a> about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_agent?ref=aftermath.site"><u>AI agents</u></a>, and in particular one that he claims had written what he called <a href="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-gatekeeping-in-open-source-the-scott-shambaugh-story.html?ref=404media.co"><u>a 'hit piece'</u></a> on him and published it for the world to see.</p><p>Shambaugh’s story is as interesting as it was horrifying. Agents are just the latest front in tech's war on our collective sanity, a type of AI that's essentially a glorified autocorrect that in this case has been given a uniform and sent onto the internet to try to do human things like propose code changes and then, when humans like Shambaugh decline them, writing pissy blogs complaining about it.</p><p>Among <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91492228/matplotlib-scott-shambaugh-opencla-ai-agent?ref=aftermath.site"><u>other sites</u></a>, Ars Technica covered this last week with a news story that remarkably appeared to have some AI-created filler of its own, citing quotes from Shambaugh that never appeared in the very blog Ars was linking.</p><p>Not long after readers--<a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/journalistic-standards.1511650/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>including Ars' own community</u></a>--began noticing this, the story was pulled (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260213194851/https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/"><u>though you can still read the archived original here</u></a>). It's general journalistic practice that published stories which contain inaccuracies are edited and updated, not deleted entirely.</p><p>Ars has since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2026/02/editors-note-retraction-of-article-containing-fabricated-quotations/?ref=404media.co"><u>published</u></a> an editorial statement, bylined by EiC Ken Fisher, addressing the story, its deletion and the outlet's policies on AI:</p><blockquote>On Friday afternoon, Ars Technica published&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/?ref=aftermath.site">an article</a>&nbsp;containing fabricated quotations generated by an AI tool and attributed to a source who did not say them. That is a serious failure of our standards. Direct quotations must always reflect what a source actually said.</blockquote><blockquote>That this happened at Ars is especially distressing. We have covered the risks of overreliance on AI tools for years, and our written policy reflects those concerns. In this case, fabricated quotations were published in a manner inconsistent with that policy. We have reviewed recent work and have not identified additional issues. At this time, this appears to be an isolated incident.</blockquote><blockquote>Ars Technica does not permit the publication of AI-generated material unless it is clearly labeled and presented for demonstration purposes. That rule is not optional, and it was not followed here.</blockquote><p>By citing Ars' clear rules, Fisher's statement points the finger for this disaster at the two authors bylined in the piece, with one (Benj Edwards) having since posted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benjedwards.com/post/3mewgow6ch22p?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a statement of his own</u></a>, assuming full responsibility for the incident and saying the other (Kyle Orland) had 'no role in this error':</p><blockquote>I have been sick with COVID all week and missed Mon and Tues due to this. On Friday, while working from bed with a fever and very little sleep, I unintentionally made a serious journalistic error in an article about Scott Shambaugh.<p>Here’s what happened: I was incorporating information from Shambaugh’s new blog post into an existing draft from Thursday.</p><p>During the process, I decided to try an experimental Claude Code-based AI tool to help me extract relevant verbatim source material. Not to generate the article but to help list structured references I could put in my outline.</p><p>When the tool refused to process the post due to content policy restrictions (Shambaugh’s post described harassment). I pasted the text into ChatGPT to understand why.</p><p>I should have taken a sick day because in the course of that interaction, I inadvertently ended up with a paraphrased version of Shambaugh’s words rather than his actual words.</p><p>Being sick and rushing to finish, I failed to verify the quotes in my outline notes against the original blog source before including them in my draft. </p><p>Kyle Orland had no role in this error. He trusted me to provide accurate quotes, and I failed him.</p><p>The text of the article was human-written by us, and this incident was isolated and is not representative of Ars Technica’s editorial standards. None of our articles are AI-generated, it is against company policy and we have always respected that.</p><p>I sincerely apologize to Scott Shambaugh for misrepresenting his words. I take full responsibility. The irony of an AI reporter being tripped up by AI hallucination is not lost on me. I take accuracy in my work very seriously and this is a painful failure on my part.</p><p>When I realized what had happened, I asked my boss to pull the piece because I was too sick to fix it on Friday. There was nothing nefarious at work, just a terrible judgement call which was no one’s fault but my own.</p></blockquote><p>Look, I understand mistakes can happen when you're sick, but Edwards--who it should be noted is Ars' '<a href="https://arstechnica.com/author/benjedwards/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Senior AI Reporter</a>'--has used AI not once but <em>twice </em>here, and in doing so has caused a huge amount of reputational damage for himself and his employer in the process. And it's not like he used it to comb through 800 pages of impenetrable legal documents, either; Shambaugh's original blog was only a couple of pages long (<a href="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me-part-2/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">he's since written a follow-up</a>), and written in plain English, making the AI's hallucinations (and Edwards' use of it) even more damning.</p><p>It's disappointing someone working in this space felt the need to have to use this garbage, particularly when it violates their employer's own policies. As this whole mess has shown, the tech simply cannot do the most basic things the people selling it keep claiming it can. Citing quotes from a blog for your own story is bread-and-butter stuff for a journalist, it's what the job <em>is</em>, and seeing this busted tech worming its way into a profession that should be its sworn enemy– and fucking the whole thing up in the process--is just a huge bummer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Generative AI (GenAI)</strong> has been one of the most controversial topics in the video game industry in recent years, and will likely continue to hold that spot for the foreseeable future. Whether you think GenAI <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-doesnt-think-digital-game-stores-should-have-generative-ai-tags/">has a place</a> in game development <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-actor-jennifer-english-using-generative-ai-in-games-dont/">or not</a>, what's clear from game engine makers like <strong>Unity</strong> is that users who want to use it in the process of making their games will have that option.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/unity-says-its-ai-tech-will-soon-be-able-to-prompt-full-casual-games-into-existence-">GameDeveloper</a>, in Unity's <a href="https://investors.unity.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx">recent earnings call</a> for its fourth quarter financial report, not only does Unity claim that <strong>"<em>AI-driven authoring</em></strong>" is a "<em>major area of focus</em>" for the company, but it sees the potential of the technology being its ability to "<em>enable developers to <strong>prompt full casual games into existence</strong> with natural language only</em>."</p>



<p>The statement comes from Unity's chief executive officer, <strong>Matt Bromberg</strong>, who has been at the head of the company since taking over for the interim chief executive officer <strong>James M. Whitehurst</strong>, who took over from <a href="https://wccftech.com/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-steps-down-following-runtime-fee-fiasco/"><strong>John Riccitiello</strong> after the company's abysmal runtime fee fiasco in 2023.</a></p>



<p>"<em>AI-driven authoring is our second major area of focus for 2026,</em>" says Bromberg. "<em>At the Game Developer Conference in March, we'll be unveiling a beta of the new upgraded Unity AI, which will enable developers to prompt full casual games into existence with natural language only, native to our platform - so it's simple to move from prototype to finished product</em>."</p>



<p>Bromberg continues, "<em>This assistant will be powered by our unique understanding of the project context and our runtime, while leveraging the best frontier models that exist. We believe together this combination will provide more efficient, more effective results to game developers than general-purpose models alone.</em>" </p>



<p>Bromberg would add that he believes the technology will go further in efforts to "<em>democratize</em>" game development, and "<em>remove as much friction from the creative process as possible, becoming the universal bridge between the first spark of creativity and a successful, scalable, and enduring digital experience</em>."</p>



<p>Unity isn't the only company claiming it has GenAI technology that can make games through prompts. <a href="https://wccftech.com/google-project-genie-causes-video-game-stocks-crash/"><strong>Google's Project Genie</strong></a> (despite being a self-admitted experiment) was enough to send the share prices of major game companies plummeting. While that may have more to do with investors not understanding how video games are made and <a href="https://wccftech.com/googles-project-genie-shows-meaningful-progress-in-content-generation-but-it-cant-replace-creative-vision-says-analyst/">what technology like Project Genie lacks</a>, the idea of games being prompted into existence is already out there.</p>



<p>For it to now come from the company behind one of the most popular game-making engines carries far more weight than it did coming from Google, and it'll be interesting, to say the least, to see how markets react when the new beta branch is revealed at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gdc-awards-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dominates/">GDC 2026</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Still, regardless of the stock market's reaction, it's unlikely consumers will react positively to a game that a developer admits was made entirely through prompts. Even executives pushing for GenAI technology can <a href="https://wccftech.com/razer-ceo-speaks-for-gamers-says-we-dont-want-genai-slop-we-want-ai-tools-that-help-game-devs/">admit that no one wants "<em>GenAI slop</em>."</a> It's difficult to believe that the ability to prompt games into being would lead to anything but more AI-slop on gaming platforms.</p>



<p>There's also the fact that, while some executives in the industry might see GenAI as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reveals-teammates-playable-genai-experience-ceo-says-gen-ai-transform-industry-3d/">next-best thing that'll forever change the industry</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gen-ai-had-zero-part-building-grand-theft-auto-6/">biggest video games in the industry are differentiated from the rest of the pack</a> because they are handcrafted experiences. And that's without getting into recent reports that show just how much <a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-is-theft-i-have-to-use-it-otherwise-ill-get-fired-gdc-reports-one-third-of-game-workers-are-using-genai-for-daily-tasks/">disdain developers who are being forced to use GenAI have for the technology</a>. </p>

That's a significant 37% drop from the list price of $143.99, and one of the best deals we've ever seen on the booster set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That includes 24 Packs with 12 cards in each, so that's a total of 288 cards, with each pack guaranteeing at least six common and three uncommon cards, alongside two cards of rare, super rare, or legendary rarity, and finally 1 randomly selected foil card amongst these.</p><div id="235577"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235577" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Disney Lorcana TCG: Azurite Sea Booster Pack Display (24 Packs)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But, it's also worth noting that this is a limited-time lightning deal at Amazon, and once it's gone, it's gone.

		<p>CyberConnect2 is celebrating its 30th anniversary in style by announcing the reveal of .hack//Z.E.R.O., the first original .hack console game in over a decade. There is not too much detail about what to expect with .hack//Z.E.R.O., but CyberConnect 2 is taking full control of the development of the game including publishing. Bandai Namco has been the main publisher of the series previously.</p>

<p>On the official website CyberConnect2 wrote, <em>“The&nbsp;.hack&nbsp;series has always been developed by CyberConnect2 and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment, but for&nbsp;.hack//Z.E.R.O., Bandai Namco Entertainment has given CyberConnect2 permission to manage the entirety of the project from planning and development to release. It will be a title that is fully self-published by CyberConnect2. World-renowned violinist Taro Hakase has penned the music, kick-starting the project to the dexterous tune of his violin.&nbsp;.hack//Z.E.R.O.&nbsp;will be a novel RPG experience that blends the series’ trademark duality of fantasy (game world) and reality (real world) with modern expectations, infused with 100% pure CyberConnect2 spirit. The game will&nbsp;be enjoyable for both veteran fans and new players alike. Please look forward to this newest iteration of&nbsp;.hack.”</em></p>
<p>Platforms and release dates are yet to be confirmed as .hack//Z.E.R.O. has only just entered development, so it may be a couple of years away from release.</p>

			<p>There's been a lot of talk lately about <strong>Sony</strong>'s formally unannounced (as of yet) <strong>PlayStation 6</strong> <strong>console</strong>. The most recent report from earlier today <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-delay-2028-2029-nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Sony is even considering <strong>delaying the PS6's tentative 2027 launch</strong> window to <strong>2028</strong> or even <strong>2029</strong>, largely due to the <strong>ongoing RAM and storage crisis</strong> that has driven component prices literally through the roof.</p>



<p>The report came from MST Financial Senior Research Analyst <strong>David Gibson</strong>, who had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-likely-to-be-delayed-longer-than-many-expected-leaving-prices-the-only-things-that-will-keep-evolving-and-not-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> last month that the PlayStation 6 could be delayed beyond previous estimates, thus also <strong>extending the lifecycle of the current PlayStation console, the PS5</strong>.</p>



<p>But the PS6 discussion also includes the early rumors on the console's specs. Those started in earnest a few months ago, when YouTuber <strong>Moore's Law Is Dead</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> estimates from leaked internal AMD presentation slides, revealing that the PlayStation 6 was targeting <strong>34 to 40 teraflops</strong> and a <strong>massive (6x-12x) ray tracing performance uplift</strong>.</p>



<p>A month earlier, AMD leaker <strong>KeplerL2</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-performance-9070-xt-xbox-next-rtx-5080-rdna5-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had compared</a> the upcoming PS6 console with the existing <strong>AMD Radeon 9070XT</strong> graphics card, the current flagship of the so-called Red Team, with one key difference: the 9070XT is powered by <strong>RDNA 4</strong> architecture, while the PS6 would be powered by the upcoming <strong>RDNA 5</strong> architecture, which the leaker said would be <strong>even more feature-rich than NVIDIA's current Blackwell</strong> GPU architecture. </p>



<p>Now, though, KeplerL2 has clarified <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-xbox-magnus-rdna-5-finalized.1693408/post-271268469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a post</a> submitted on the NeoGAF board that the PlayStation 6 <strong>won't actually include the full RDNA 5 feature set</strong>, likely in a bid to keep costs down. KeplerL2 had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-next-gen-rdna-5-gaming-gpus-might-launch-after-nvidia-rtx-60-series-in-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> AMD <strong>is planning to launch the first RDNA 5 graphics cards in 2027</strong> after NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 60 Series. Up until a few months ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-launching-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-amd-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he was also confident</a> that the next PlayStation console would launch in 2027, though he added, "<strong>unless unexpected delays happen</strong>."  </p>



<p>The PS6 is already considered to be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-and-xbox-magnus-specs-finalized-xbox-performance-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less powerful than the next Xbox console</a></strong>, which <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-gen-might-launch-2027-but-its-best-case-scenario/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might very well launch next year</a></strong>. If the PlayStation 6 specs remain the same, without even the full RDNA 5 feature set, and the console gets delayed to 2029, <strong>it could force hardcore users eager for next-gen gaming to switch to Xbox,</strong> and also <strong>require Sony to be very aggressive with pricing</strong> if it really comes in that late to the market. If nothing else, it would throw a little spice in a console war that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-console-wars-over-halo-on-ps-white-house-trump-ai-spartan-armor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seemed already done and dusted</a> in favor of Sony</strong>. On the other hand, the specs are only one component of a console war, and <strong>the PS5 also did not include all of the features from the RDNA 2 architecture</strong>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, here's what we do know will probably be in the PlayStation 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-amd-mark-cerny-jack-huynh-project-amethyst-ps6-playstation-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after Mark Cerny's tease</a>:</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/crimson-desert-mtx-microtransactions-deluxe-price-2000669462</link>
            <guid>1437577</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Pearl Abyss has confirmed that its highly anticipated open-world single-player game </span><i><span>Crimson Desert</span></i><span> will “definitively” not feature any kind of microtransaction-laden cash shop or in-game storefront at launch. The MMO maker says the single-player game’s $70 price tag reflects the all inclusive “premium experience” players should expect.</span></p> <p><span>The promise comes from an interview with Pearl Abyss’ PR and Marketing Director Will Powers on the </span><a href="https://youtu.be/MR9QMXJuGx4?si=lGwFcuz26j_cWZIJ&amp;t=1468"><i><span>Dropped Frames</span></i></a><span> podcast. Powers was asked if the game would feature a similar monetization model to Pearl Abyss’ MMO </span><i><span>Black Desert Online</span></i><span>. “This is a premium game you buy one time,” replied Powers. “I don’t wanna say there’s zero MTX, because there are pre-order bonuses that we have, but anything that’s announced and that’s coming at launch is strictly cosmetic.”</span></p>

 <p><span>When asked if there was a chance that </span><i><span>Crimson Desert</span></i><span> might launch with any sort of “cash shop” feature, Powers doubled down. “No. I can say that definitively,” he continued. “There is not a cosmetic cash shop. This is made to be a premium experience that you buy, and you enjoy the world, and not something for microtransactions…This is a premium experience. That’s the transaction. Full stop.”</span></p> <p><span>The “transaction” Powers is referring to in this context is </span><i><span>Crimson Desert’s </span></i><span>$70 launch price, in contrast to </span><i><span>Black Desert Online’s </span></i><span>“buy-to-play” model, which consists of a one-off $10 purchase, which can be combined with separate cosmetic microtransactions and one-time DLC purchases that range from $30 to $50. It’s also become more common even for single-player RPGs like <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> and <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em> to include microtransaction shops full of content that can’t be earned just by playing the game.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>While the need to clarify this may come across as odd to some, it likely stemmed from the announcement of </span><i><span>Crimson Desert’s</span></i><span> $80 “Deluxe Edition” pre-order option, which features several cosmetic items, such as the Kairos armor set and the Exclaire horse armor. There’s also a $280 “Collectors Edition,” but I’d wager you’re probably not bothered about microtransactions if you’re shelling out for that anyway. </span></p>

 <p><span>Powers’ wording also doesn’t rule out the possibility of other, non-cosmetic forms of DLC in the future, which wouldn’t come as a surprise considering that, as of February 1st, more than two million people have already wishlisted </span><i><span>Crimson Desert</span></i><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The talk of the Pokémon&nbsp;world has been the elusive Pikachu Illustrator card in Logan Paul’s possession, or should that be rectified, formerly, in his possession. The world’s most expensive Pokémon&nbsp;card is now even more valuable, and the identity behind the buyer is fascinating.</p>



<p>Logan Paul once sported his outrageously expensive Pikachu Illustrator card around his neck as he walked down the ramp for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wwe/" id="1631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wrestlemania</a>. Dubbed ‘The most coveted card in the world,” the PSA Grade 10 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Illustrator card is as rare as a Pokémon card gets, and it changed hands for an extraordinary sum in 2026.</p>

<figure><figcaption>A once-in-a-lifetime purchase. Credit to Logan Paul</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>AJ Scaramucci is now the owner of the world’s most expensive Pokémon card after buying the Pikachu Illustrator card from Logan Paul for $16.492 million in an auction.</strong></p>



<p>Monday, February 16, 2026, will go down in history as one of the most extraordinary auctions ever.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokopia Hands-On Preview: Pokémon Has Another Mega Hit On Its Hands</a></li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://goldin.co/item/logan-paul-personally-owned-1998-pokemon-japanese-corocoro-promo-raretua0w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goldin</a> has recognized that Paul’s Pikachu Illustrator PSA 10 card (with gold chain and all!) was sold for exactly <strong>$16,492,000</strong>—including Buyer’s Premium. </p>



<p>AJ Scaramucci is the lucky bidder who has claimed this incredible collector’s item, and Guinness World Records has said it’s the most expensive trading card ever sold at any auction.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>AJ Scaramucci reveals he’s starting a “planetary treasure hunt” after spending $16.49M on the Pikachu Illustrator</p><p>“My ambition for the card is just a small story. The real story is that I’m on a planetary treasure hunt.

<h2 id="h-who-is-aj-scaramucci">Who Is AJ Scaramucci?</h2>



<p><strong>AJ Scaramucci is a wealthy venture capitalist, and you might know the name as he is the son of former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci.</strong></p>



<p>After winning the card, Scaramucci told Paul he wanted to collect even more unique items:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’m on a quest to buy a T-Rex dinosaur fossil, I’m going to buy the Declaration of Independence, and I’m not stopping there. This was only the beginning.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>You can’t knock the man’s ambitions! It remains to be seen if Scaramucci manages to obtain any of his other targets. The guarantee is that he now owns the only PSA 10-graded Pikachu Illustrator card in the world—the only one of the 39 to 41 cards printed.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-did-logan-paul-buy-his-pokemon-card-for">How Much Did Logan Paul Buy His Pokémon Card For?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A record broken. Credit to Logan Paul</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It seems like peanuts now, but Logan Paul had originally set the record for the most expensive Pokémon card trading purchase when he bought the Pikachu Illustrator card for $5.275 million in 2021.</strong></p>



<p>Not bad profit, all things considered. Paul has made about $10 million profit from selling the card, and the Guinness World Record you can see above now goes to AJ Scaramucci.</p>

</ul>



<p>If Scaramucci is true to his word about collecting, then this record is likely to be broken again, and no one else will ever get to own this particular Pikachu Illustrator. If you have other ideas, you’d better get saving.</p>



<p>Is any collector’s card worth this much money? Or has AJ Scaramucci got himself an item that anyone would do anything for?

The only content missing from this portable version was the Claws of Awaji expansion — which had landed on other systems back in September — for which Ubisoft provided a vague 'coming later in 2026' release window. Well, the big Ubi has today been a bit more specific.</p>
<p>As revealed in the new <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/5DtVYhhrhh2Oe2JXEjxpSU/ac-shadows-parkour-challenge-and-tu-118-get-ready-for-manual-jumps">Shadows Winter Roadmap</a>, the expansion will launch on Switch 2 on <strong>10th March</strong>. This paid DLC includes a whole new area to explore and storyline to follow, as Naoe and Yasuke head to the island of Awaji to track down a lost treasure. There are also new weapons and skins to unlock in the DLC, all of which can be carried back over to the main game to use as you please.</p><div><figure data-videoid="yv59MOA4ebw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytyv59MOA4ebw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed773c0ejhngvs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Before this expansion comes our way, however, Ubisoft has another title update for Shadows, which it'll be dropping tomorrow (17th February). The ver. 1.1.8 update includes new detailed stat pages, a fresh visual feedback for critical hits, and marks the addition of a manual jump option in parkour.</p>

<p>The only other thing on the roadmap as it stands is the game's one-year anniversary celebration, which Ubisoft has said will kick off on 20th March with livestreams and giveaways.</p>
<p>We had a great time with Shadows when it arrived on Switch 2 last year, calling it "a colossal achievement and one of the best-looking games on Nintendo’s console" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">our 8/10 review</a>. Our friends over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/">Push Square</a> weren't quite as hot on the Claws of Awaji expansion following its PS5 release, claiming that "it never really elevates itself beyond the base game" in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji">their 6/10 review</a>. We'll have to wait and see what we make of it on Switch 2 next month!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pim-neill-girl-scout-cookie-record-thin-mint-2000669457</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s that time of year when millions of young girls learn what it takes to be an entrepreneur—Girl Scout cookie season! Selling cookies can be challenging, but for one 6-year-old, reaching record-breaking sales is a piece of cookie cake. All it took was some clever social media buildcrafting and algorithm exploits.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Pim Neill is a Daisy Scout in Pittsburgh. On Sunday, she finally made it to a whopping 100,000 cookie box sales in just a single season, blowing past the national record. </span><span>A modern girl in a modern world, Pim and her family made social media posts to promote her cookies to wild success.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Hi, my name is Pim. Do you wanna buy some Girl Scout cookies?” Pim asks in a TikTok, holding a box of Thin Mints. Her blue glasses match her Girl Scout vest, and she ends the video with a gracious, “Thank you.” The TikTok has over five million views.</span></p>   <p><span>While her astronomical success may be attributed to the internet, that isn’t stopping Pim from also putting in the work the traditional way: going door-to-door in her neighborhood.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Pim wanted to join the Girl Scouts because when she was 3, she saw the girls selling cookies,” Luke Anorak-Neill, Pim’s dad, </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/pim-neill-girl-scout-cookies-record/"><span>told</span></a><span> CBS Pittsburgh. “This whole thing started by her observing girls performing what most people think is the only thing Girl Scouts do, and that’s sell Girl Scout cookies.”</span></p>

 <p><span>At first, Anorak-Neill had trouble finding a troop for Pim to join. “Our first troop, unfortunately, when we tried to join and ask questions about joining, the lady said that Pim’s disabilities would hold back the troop, and they didn’t want her to join,” he said. “And that was really disappointing, but I decided she must not speak for all Girl Scouts as a whole.”</span></p> <p><span>Pim was turned away from another troop for being too young. But finally, her family eventually found a match: a kindergarten-only troop where she is now a Daisy Scout with 10 other girls. </span><span>She began her history-making cookie campaign at the start of January. “We’ve had so much support from Girl Scouts navigating it,” said Anorak-Neill. “We’ve had a lot of support, and we’re just excited that we’re inspiring so many more girls.”</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One of the most well-received games of 2025 could be heading to Xbox Game Pass. A post on social media on Monday talked about the future of additions to Xbox Game Pass this year, with a not-so-subtle tease of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.</p>



<p><strong>“We’ve got quite the release slate lined up for Xbox Game Pass so far, this is going to be a huge year,”</strong> <a href="https://x.com/XboxGamePass/status/2023442179625259508?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the “email” reads.</a> <strong>“Oh, and speaking of upcoming releases… well, I shouldn’t say too much, but if you’re getting quite hungry for a fun adventure, all I can say is that something big is about to be deliverance’d to Xbox Game Pass…”</strong></p>







<p>While not specifically naming the game, using the term “deliverance’d” is a dead giveaway for what’s to come. Xbox is getting ready to announce the next wave of games for the service, which could see it come sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>The original Kingdom Come: Deliverance is already available on the subscription service for those with an Ultimate, PC, or Premium membership.</p>







<p>Are you excited about the idea of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 coming to game pass? Leave your thoughts down in the comments and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

            <guid>1437544</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="a5d0fca22c7d9"><a title="Horses!" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a5d0fca22c7d9/horses.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Kate Gray</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>In the magazine business, the back page is where you'd find all the weird goofs that we couldn't fit in anywhere else. Some may call it "filler"; we prefer "a whole page to make terrible jokes that are tangentially related to the content of the mag".</em></p>
<p><em>We don't have pages on the internet, but we still love terrible jokes — so welcome to our semi-regular feature, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/back-page">Back Page</a>.</em> <em>Today, Kate celebrates the approaching Chinese New Year with a look at the finest equines in video games...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It's almost the Year of the Horse, y'all! The Chinese Zodiac calendar has rolled around once more to this majestic four-legged muscle-beast, after 12 years of horseless behaviour. In fact, the last time it was The Year of the Horse, it was <em>also</em> the tail-end of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/03/feature_looking_back_on_the_year_of_luigi">The Year of Luigi</a>. Remember that? Remember how beautiful life was in 2014? Life can be beautiful again, with the help of horse.</p>
<p>Now, you might be wondering what makes me qualified to write about horses, when I am neither a horse nor a horse expert. But I've written lists of the Best Cows in Games before, and horses are actually a lot like cows in many ways, if you really think about it (four legs, lives on farm, could very easily kill you). Also, if that's not enough, I've enlisted the help of Actual Horse Expert, <strong>Alice Ruppert</strong>, who runs <a href="https://www.themanequest.com/">The Mane Quest</a>, the internet's premier Horse Game Website, to agree with my horse opinions.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/related-articles:161473,117581,183995/kates-ever-growing-list-of-animal-related-back-pages @ 1771275900 -->
<p>So, now that you know that I am 100% very knowledgeable about horses, here are the <strong>Best Horses on the Nintendo Switch</strong>, in no particular order, because I don't want to upset the horses and have them kick me in the skull.</p>
<h2><del>Kate's</del> Nintendo Life's Official List Of Best Horses</h2>
<h3>Epona</h3>
<figure data-uuid="ec89a9de90d18"><a title="Zelda honse" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ec89a9de90d18/zelda-honse.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>She waited seven years for us! What a good horse — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Kate, Amateur Enjoyer Of Horses:</strong> We'll start off basic with everyone's favourite video game horse: Epona. Link's steady companion from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">Ocarina of Time</a> onwards, this chestnut mare was raised by Malon and is iconic enough to earn her own song <em>and</em> appear on the title screen.</p>
<p>Yes, in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>, Link can obtain some very cool horses — the Giant Horse and the Royal White Stallion — but it's always Epona that has our heart. She's a good, good horse.</p>
<p><strong>Alice Ruppert, Horse Expert:</strong> My special shoutout goes to <a href="https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2019/9/17/horses-in-games-companions-and-collectibles">Twilight Princess’ Epona</a>, where she even gets her own rescue subplot, and unlocking her as a mount is made infinitely more satisfying by virtue of having to fight to get her back. Acquiring in-game mounts through story missions like that is so underrated, and I want more of it!</p>
<h3>Roach</h3>
<figure data-uuid="99c5cdb252316"><a title="Roach" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/99c5cdb252316/roach.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Now kiss — <em><span></span> Image: CD Projekt Red / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: Geralt's faithful steed in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher</a>, Roach, is actually a <em>bunch</em> of horses, because it turns out that Geralt goes through horses like he goes through girlfriends. But he always has a Roach, and that Roach always patiently listens to him as he talks about stuff, as detailed in this quote from Blood and Wine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Many a witcher has talked over the nuts and bolts of his current contract with his horse while staring at the stars shining above the lonely road, though few would ever admit to this."</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the same journal entry also lightly ribs Roach for her tendency to act in an un-horse-like manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"In truth, though, he was very attached to her and would never trade her for any other horse. Not even one which, when summoned, would never stand helpless in front of a seemingly easily surmountable obstacle, such as a low fence or stray piece of timber. Nor even one which would sometimes, in some incomprehensible fashion, wind up dancing on some peasant's roof. 'Well,' Geralt would say with a shrug. 'A witcher's horse isn't a normal animal. Constant contact with magic beverages and Signs must have left a mark.'"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Geralt doesn't really have a lot of friends, but Roach is definitely one of them. Isn't that just lovely?</p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> Roach is love, Roach is life. Though, I gotta say: massive missed opportunity in The Witcher 3 that they didn’t just recolour Roach while Geralt is on Skellige without any further comment on it! Like, we see in the cutscenes that Geralt arrives by shipwreck, no way he brought a horse along! It would have been so funny for Roach to just be a visibly different horse while he’s on the island, and to switch back whenever you fast-travel back to the mainland.</p>
<p>I am SO excited to see what CDPR ends up doing with Kelpie in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/witcher_4">The Witcher 4</a>… Because that <a href="https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2025/6/4/welcome-kelpie-an-unreal-tech-showcase-gives-us-a-first-look-at-ciris-horse-in-the-witcher-4">tech demo they showed</a> was immensely promising, not just in terms of animation and anatomy, but also in treating the horse like a <a href="https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2026/1/9/living-creatures-vs-meat-motorcycles-how-to-make-horses-in-games-feel-alive">character, rather than a vehicle</a>!</p>
<h3>Skyrim Horses</h3>
<figure data-uuid="a2bbfc5b70212"><a title="Skyrim horse" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a2bbfc5b70212/skyrim-horse.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Iconic.</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: Yes, you can walk across <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim">Skyrim</a>. Yes, you can hire horsecarts to fast-travel you to places. But there's a reason that navigating sheer cliffs via horse is referred to as 'Skyrimming' your way up a mountain (at least, in my household).</p>
<p>Horses in Skyrim allow you to cheese your way up previously insurmountable obstacles, with their powerful and probably magic legs that can apparently handle the craggiest of terrain with no problems. We can learn a lesson or two from Skyrim's horses. Mostly about rock climbing.</p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> I have to say, for all the silly rock climbing antics people make fun of when it comes to Skyrim horses, the models themselves actually manage to look quite good even when being vertically plastered to cliffs! Say what you will about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F5b39bjcgfyzd1.jpeg">t</a>he above image, but that still looks a lot better to me than many alternatives, where the inverse kinematics lead to horribly broken-looking bent forelegs!</p>

<h3>The Horse From A Wonderful Life</h3>
<figure data-uuid="f979f6bf4e207"><a title="AWL horse" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f979f6bf4e207/awl-horse.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>This is Not How Horses Work — <em><span></span> Image: Marvelous / XSEED</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: So far, many of our best horses have had some specific boon — friendship, mountain climbing, cool songs — but the horse from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/story_of_seasons_a_wonderful_life">Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life</a> is just a Very Nice Horse. The Harvest Moon games are beloved for their extremely likeable cows, which means that this lovely horse gets overlooked.</p>
<p>But look at it! Such a gloriously long face! Even for a horse! Regard its little hooves! Witness its voluminous tail! And it comes in <em>three colours!</em> This horse is a nice horse.</p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> This one loses points for its beady eyes, weirdly placed foreleg joints, and flesh-colored ears, even if it <em>does</em> have a nicely voluminous tail.</p>
<h3>Pokémon Horses</h3>
<figure data-uuid="221d6b8e17d3c"><a title="Spectrier but big" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/221d6b8e17d3c/spectrier-but-big.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>My steed is too big — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Game Freak</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: Forgive me for grouping all these fine fillies and stellar stallions together, but we'd be here all day if I did them all separately.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_legends_z-a_mega_dimension">Pokémon</a> has a lot of good horses, you see.</p>
<p>There's the dual legendaries, <strong>Spectrier</strong> and <strong>Glastrier</strong> – the former, a gloriously goth horse that would have been my absolute favourite as an emo tween, and the latter a stately ice-horse with the ability Chilling Neigh, which is immediately cool as heck.</p>
<p>There's <strong>Ponyta</strong> and <strong>Rapidash</strong>, the beloved horses from the OG 150, with their adorable candy floss Galarian forms, and their (very appropriate for the Year of the Fire Horse) flaming manes.</p>
<p>There's <strong>Mudsdale</strong>, the shire-horse-like lad who evolves, somehow, from a donkey, with big, beefy legs that can carry you across the plains of Alola <em>or</em> stomp your opponents into submission.</p>
<p>Then there's <strong>Keldeo</strong>, the mythical Colt Pokémon, with the alternate form of "what if really big horn", which functions as a sword. Very neat! Very dangerous! I'm glad real-life horses don't have face-knives!</p>
<figure data-uuid="21ce64a074f46"><a title="Arceus" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/21ce64a074f46/arceus.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Horse-god. Or god-horse. Either way, definitely a horse — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Game Freak</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, we've got <strong>Arceus</strong> — the literal god of the Pokémon world — who is less obviously 'horse' than the others, thanks to its pointy feet and deer-like grace, but we're calling it a horse.</p>
<p>With two legendary horses, one mythical horse, and an actual god horse, we have the suspicion that there's someone on the Game Freak team who really, <em>really</em> likes horses. And who can blame them?</p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> I love Mudsdale for being rare draft horse representation, but Ponyta and Rapidash are the <em>clear</em> winners of ‘best horse Pokémon’, if you ask me. You know how people sometimes complain that all Pokémon designs are getting rounder and don’t have sharp lines anymore? That applies to almost all cartoon horses, too, but actually having some sharp lines and edges are what makes cartoon horses more horse-y! Ponyta and Rapidash had some <em>edge</em>, and that’s wonderful. Also, they’re literally on fire. What else can you ask for?</p>
<h3>The Stardew Horse</h3>
<figure data-uuid="2faf14a46c69a"><a title="hathorse" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2faf14a46c69a/hathorse.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Wooooaaaaahhhh that horse is so COOL — <em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/ak8whr/i_found_out_that_horses_can_in_fact_wear_hats/">ConcernedApe / deleted Reddit user</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: This horse can wear hats. It's an expensive investment, but well worth it. Because it can WEAR HATS.</p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> I love <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a>, but I will never not be salty that of all animals in the game, this is the only one you cannot build a relationship with, and you cannot do <em>anything</em> that would count as ‘taking care of it’. No filling a water bowl, like you can for your dog or cat, no feeding or giving treats, no hearts to fill up, no stable upgrades. The Punished Backlog said it best: <a href="https://punishedbacklog.com/the-horse-in-stardew-valley-deserves-better/">The Horse in Stardew Valley Deserves Better</a>.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Creative Assembly have just detailed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>’s first character pack, these being “smaller, focused content drops built around a single character with their own unique feature, supported by a handful of exciting new units”, priced (in this case) at £3.99, $4.99 or €4.99 apiece. 
</p>
<p>
Yes, it’s Creative Assembly once again nosing at the shards of your smashed piggy bank, but the developers have, in theory, pre-empted any rancour over DLC nickel-and-diming by making the character pack cat-themed. Everybody loves cats! Even when they cost as much as a medium oatmilk latte. Especially cats like Bhashiva – an entirely new Warhammer character - and her company of Tiger Warriors. Look at her ickle grumpy face! Look at her ickle flaming twin katara! ARGH get it off me get it off me get it off me, etcetera.
</p>
<p>
Bhashiva and her feline gangsters will form part of the Grand Cathay faction, though sadly not, it seems, because some Creative Assembly designer spotted an obvious pun and was immediately assigned £100,000. The pack’s paid contents are one Legendary Lord, one Lord, three regular units, and a “Unique Campaign Feature, Final Battle, Quest Battle etc”.
</p>
<p>
What manner of combatant is Bhashiva, then? She’s a stealthy wrecking ball, equipped with incendiary weapons and a Heaven’s Gate blink-style ability. “Each strike not only scorches her victims but weakens their resistance to flame, letting her plough through fights the moment she commits,” enthuses <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/94">a blog post on CA’s site</a>. “Her agility is at the core of her playstyle; she darts between threats, repositions effortlessly, and uses her mastery of stealth to pick the perfect moment to appear.” 
</p>
<p>
Battle designer Josh King adds that “she’s the quiet dread in the back of your mind”. How very unlike my family’s own moggy, best summarised as “the quiet shitter in the back of the bedroom cupboard”.
</p>
<p>
As for the Tiger Warriors, they’re a gang of nippy ambushers and so, relatively exotic among the boxy formations of regular Grand Cathay. Their Clawspeaker spellcasters are vanguard units equipped with a mix of healing, beast and shadow lore, making them an “incredibly versatile force multiplier.” 
</p><p>
 If you don’t already own the Grand Cathay DLC, buying the Tiger Warrior character pack includes access to “the core Grand Cathay roster to ensure you get a complete experience”. We can expect more details down the line. Also down the line: the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 3’s Lords of the End Times expansion, which is chock full of necromancers. And sometime after that, the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-40000">Total War: Warhammer 40,000</a> - one of Julian's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/julians-most-anticipated-games-for-2026">most anticipated games of 2026</a>. And sometime after that, a long time probably, the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creative-assembly-reveal-total-war-medieval-3-while-teasing-a-huge-game-reveal-to-follow">Total War: Medieval 3</a>.

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<figure data-uuid="c15f0e18dd225"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c15f0e18dd225/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We are getting ever closer to the release of <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> on <strong>1st April</strong>, and over the weekend, Nintendo revealed its official roster of character posters for the film's main players.</p>
<p>We took a look at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/marios-joined-by-some-familiar-foes-in-new-galaxy-movie-poster">foe-filled Mario one</a> last week, but an additional six posters have since been released, each showing a different character in a unique locale. These have been shared across the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/supermariomovie/">Galaxy Movie social accounts</a> and as a daily upload on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a>, but we thought it would be a good idea to gather them all together for you check out in one place.</p>
<p>Below, we've done just that! You'll find each of the seven posters in the order they were revealed, accompanied by a write-up of some smaller details you might have missed. Let's-a go!</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>

<h2 id="the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters</h2>
<h3 id="mario">Mario</h3>
<figure data-uuid="2033ad3ec6889"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2033ad3ec6889/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Same hero, new adventure."</p>
<p>You might have already spotted this one in our coverage from last week, but it's too good not to mention again. Aside from Mario pulling his iconic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Galaxy</a> 'spin' pose, we'll also give a shoutout to the range of enemies on display here. <em>Sledge Bro</em>? That's a deeper cut than we expected.</p>
<h3 id="luigi">Luigi</h3>
<figure data-uuid="cf1ecf62abd60"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cf1ecf62abd60/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Conquering his fears, no bones about it."</p>
<p>Luigi's spotlight is expectedly fear-filled, <em>but</em> we do get a closer look at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a> Tostarena setting that we first saw in the film's initial reveal trailer and its skeletal inhabitants. It looks... well, like Tostarena.</p>
<h3 id="bowser">Bowser</h3>
<figure data-uuid="39ee7a3fa8d61"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/39ee7a3fa8d61/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"He's got an ax (or two) to grind."</p>
<p>Aside from looking really rather threatening with those two axes held aloft, Bowser's poster crams a lot into the background. The big wheel and Bullet Bill merry-go-round have a whiff of World Bowser from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/super_mario_3d_world">Super Mario 3D World</a>, and what's with that giant UFO in the sky? Huh, looks like the King of the Koopas will be getting big again after all.</p>
<h3 id="peach-andamp-toad">Peach &amp; Toad</h3>
<figure data-uuid="40287951410dc"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/40287951410dc/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Always looking out for the little guy."</p>
<p>Wow, there are <em>a lot</em> of cameos in this one. The penguins make a return from the first movie, but we've also got the Galaxy Star Bunnies, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a>'s Pianta, a Conkdor, and even some Whittles from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>. And what's with all of those rockets blasting off to a nearby galaxy? Hmm, a lot to digest here.</p>
<h3 id="rosalina">Rosalina</h3>
<figure data-uuid="de4cce9f161ca"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/de4cce9f161ca/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"The stars of a new story."</p>
<p>Yep, we're fans of this Rosalina design. There's a particularly cute Baby Luma on the left, and our first proper look at the Comet Observatory in the background on the right.</p>
<h3 id="bowser-jr">Bowser Jr.</h3>
<figure data-uuid="5464d43f9f1e2"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5464d43f9f1e2/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"No wonder he's a menace."</p>
<p>A Bowser Jr-shaped planet, battleships, and a magic paintbrush that spits Piranha Plant ink? It's no wonder those Koopas down the bottom look scared.</p>
<h3 id="yoshi-baby-mario-andamp-baby-luigi">Yoshi, Baby Mario &amp; Baby Luigi</h3>
<figure data-uuid="0b37fe21a2978"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0b37fe21a2978/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The realistic T. rex model and waterfall-covered planet in the background have us wondering whether the Cascade Kingdom is joining Tostarena as another Odyssey cameo. It seems likely, no?</p>
