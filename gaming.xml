<p>Sigils and Medals and Scrolls, oh my!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We are rapidly approaching the <strong>30th October</strong> release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>, and to drum up the hype in the remaining weeks, Square Enix has released yet another new trailer.</p>
<p>Unlike the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake-gets-seven-minute-gameplay-overview-trailer">gameplay-focused</a> affair that arrived earlier this month, the fresh trailer is all about highlighting the games' new features. The four-minute trailer provides a pretty comprehensive breakdown of everything we can expect, from bonus characters and story content to additional gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p>We'd recommend watching the above trailer for the full rundown, but, in short, here are the highlights. DQ2's Sigils now crop up in both games and are "vital to the story" of each, with Scrolls and Mini Medals also making an appearance. We get a closer look at the second game's new 'Ocean Floor' expansion, with its fresh wave of enemies, storylines, and 'Memories of the World' collectibles. There's also a rundown of the game's new character, the Princess of Cannock, and bonus Tombola minigame — maybe not the big addition <em>we</em> would have ended the trailer on, but what can you do?</p>
<p>All in all, it's still looking rather wonderful. The absence of a Switch 2 upgrade path sours the package somewhat, but if the end result can match last year's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> in terms of sheer joy, then we'll be very happy indeed.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-expansion-december-release-ubisoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-debuts-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-%E2%80%93-from-the-ashes-expansion-arriving-december-2025.1305615/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Ubisoft announced that Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is getting an expansion titled From the Ashes, arriving on all platforms on December 19, 2025. The expansion brings players back to Pandora to a section of its western front and places them in a new story that is arriving the same day as the release of the next film in James Cameron's cinematic series, Avatar: Fire and Ash.</p>



<p>You can tell by the trailer that the tone of this expansion is darker than the story of the base game, and according to Ubisoft it'll even take advantage of features soon to be implemented in the game, namely the <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-third-person-new-game-plus/">third-person mode due to arrive on December 5, 2025</a>, two weeks ahead of the expansion's release.</p>



<p>From the Ashes follows So'lek on a revenge mission after the Ash clan teamed up with the RDA, ambushing him and his fellow Sarentu Na'vi. When he wakes up after the attack, his rage takes him on a destructive path to try to save his family and deliver justice to his enemies.</p>



<p>"<em>With From the Ashes, we wanted to push the boundaries of what players can experience on Pandora</em>," said Omar Bouali, Massive Entertainment's creative director, in a press release. "<em>This expansion delivers a darker, more personal story, enhanced immersion via both the first and third-person gameplay</em>, <em>and intense new combat mechanics that deepen the emotional and tactical stakes. We wanted to offer fans a thrilling new perspective on the Western Frontier, with deeper storytelling and more visceral gameplay</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – From the Ashes: EXPANSION REVEAL TEASER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/24Lc7E-Vt80?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Executive vice president of franchise development at Lightstorm Entertainment (the production company founded by James Cameron), Josua Izzo, added, "<em>Our partnership with Massive Entertainment has allowed us to expand this universe in bold new ways with Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. This new expansion, From the Ashes, will release at the same day as the theatrical release for Avatar: Fire and Ash - a film that explores darker corners of Pandora and introduces the formidable Ash People - we're equally excited for Avatar fans to experience untold stories through new interactive adventures</em>."</p>



<p>So basically, you can head to your local cinema to watch Avatar: Fire and Ash when it premieres, and then jump into the From the Ashes expansion for Frontiers of Pandora on your PC or console when you get home.</p>



<p>"<em>We can't wait for fans to experience this new chapter in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora,</em>" continued Luigi Priore, vice president and general manager of Disney and Pixar Games. "<em>From the Ashes continues the journey of Na'vi resistance warrior So'lek and demonstrates how Disney and Pixar Games works with our collaborators to craft wholly original stories grounded in the worlds they love</em>."</p>



<p>The expansion will be available for $24.99 USD, though if you don't already own Frontiers of Pandora, you'll be able to grab the expansion and the base game in a bundled 'From the Ashes' edition for $39.99.</p>

  <div>
      <div><p>The <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter campaign is live now. This official card game set in the dystopian metropolis of Night City, developed by Night Crew Games, is packed with cards and characters that fans know and love. So much so, the project was funded in under an hour.</p>

<h2>The <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>The official <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cyberpunklegends/cyberpunk-legends-into-the-night/description" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a> for the <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter is light on text, but packed with detail. As mentioned before, during its initial <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/talsorian-games-announces-cyberpunk-legends-rpg-lite-card-game-set-in-night-city" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement in June</a>, the game is a co-op experience for 1-4 players. Each player chooses one of four roles: Netrunner, Solo, Nomad, or Rocker, and works together doing jobs, getting paid, chippin' in with cyberware, and improving themselves via RPG-lite mechanics.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-legends-kickstarter-add-on-promo-image.jpg?itok=XD2DGJbi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-legends-kickstarter-add-on-promo-image.jpg?itok=qRO7Fw38 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For fans of the Cyberpunk TTRPG setting, the game takes place in 2020, the era home to the biggest names of Night City like Morgan Blackhand, Rache Bartmoss, and Johnny Silverhand. The game will allow players to live out history in this dark sci-fi future. A history that leads to the Time of the Red in the TTRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/cyberpunk-red-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk Red</em></a>, followed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-officially-confirmed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk Edgerunners</em></a> anime and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/cyberpunk-2077" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a> video game.</p>

<p>Because of this potent setting, the <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter is packed with campaign-exclusive add-ons and stretch goals. These include story cards featuring the Bozos Gang, card sleeves, themed deck boxes, and playable versions of Night City legends before they became legends like Santiago and Kerry Eurodyne.</p>

<p>In addition, certain add-ons will let you create your own scenarios and custom character art. If you have especially deep pockets, you can even immortalize your own <em>Cyberpunk</em> character by having a drink at the Kernal Bar named after them.</p>

<p>The different pledge tiers of the <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Base Runner for $50:</strong> The base version of the game with all unlocked physical stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Legendary Edition for $130:</strong> The Legendary Edition of the game (which includes all add-on cards and playable Santiago, Bartmoss, Santiago, and Blackhand character decks) and all physical stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Guns and Clowns for $75:</strong> The base game and the Weapons, Bozos, and Cyberware card add-ons</li>
	<li><strong>Silverhand Special for $210:</strong> Everything in the Legendary Edition tier, the Hard Mon add-on, four sets of card sleeves, two deck boxes, and a play mat</li>
	<li><strong>Fixer's Edition for $350:</strong> Everything in the Silverhand Special tier, and the ability to play the first scenario of the game with the design team through Tabletop Simulator.</li>
	<li><strong>Burning Chrome for $500:</strong> Everything from the Silverhand Special tier, plus all cards in the game get a foil treatment</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$201,420, which is almost three times its initial funding goal of $75,000. The campaign concludes on October 23.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baby-steps-hits-on-the-hell-and-hilarity-of-hiking.1305609/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There are only two things that Nate really wants to do: use the toilet (one that, he emphasizes, comes with three walls and a door) and go home. He also walks with a strange gait, with one tiny foot raised awkwardly in front of the other, before landing with a gentle plop. At times, he teeters to one side, nearly off balance, as he strives to hike up a very tall, steep, and seemingly belligerent mountain. Nate’s a ragdoll barely held together by a severely compromised musculoskeletal system, powered by a deep-seated urge to trudge toward an outhouse.</p><p>Nate is also you. The incongruity of the tedium of hiking, an activity he perennially curses, and the earnestness of hiking culture makes the comedy of <em>Baby Steps</em> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/638179/baby-steps-preview-ps5-steam">an open-world exploration game from a trio of indie developers, including <em>QWOP</em> designer Bennett Foddy</a> — surprisingly cathartic. Its hilarity is drawn from the harrowing experiences of a reluctant, athletically challenged hiker. Every step has to be micromanaged. Walk too quickly and you can lose your balance; miscalculate the size of your stride and you will probably tumble off a cliff. Then there are the fellow hikers you meet along the way, and the contrast between Nate’s awkward, morose outlook versus their unbridled enthusiasm for clambering over dirt and rocks is sublime.</p><p>Thus, there’s a nearly perverse dimension to hiking that <em>Baby Steps</em> instinctively understands: it’s really exhausting for the innately clumsy.</p><p>Even walking in <em>Baby Steps</em> is laborious. This involves pressing a button to gradually lift up one leg, another button to hoist the other leg up, and directional keys that will see Nate putting his weight — or leaning toward — a specific point. It will take you a while to get used to this cadence, and making this even more hilariously frustrating is that Nate possesses none of the upper body strength that most people have. Forget using your hands to break your fall or scramble over small boulders; Nate’s floppy arms will do no work and carry no weight. It’s all part of what <em>Baby Steps</em> proudly presents as “fully-simulated physics based walking,” geared toward encouraging sheer buffoonery.</p><p>Beyond just walking, <em>Baby Steps</em> doesn’t give you any sort of goals, aside from heading to the next campsite. This means you can saunter to wherever takes your fancy, be it strutting toward a crumbling tower or climbing a small hill just to see what’s at its peak. Unlike the goal-driven structure of traditional games, <em>Baby Steps</em> offers neither quests nor rewards for your trek. The game also eschews the staples of open-world games with massive maps, such as fast travel, mini maps, and upgradeable gear — features that will ease your traversal from one point to the next.</p><p>You can, of course, make your way toward the end with minimal detours, but this approach will make <em>Baby Steps</em> feel very banal, very quickly. To enjoy what <em>Baby Steps</em> has to offer, then, is to find a point in its hike even when there’s no discernible point at all. In a way, it’s a game that offers one of the purest expressions of hiking. Any hiking enthusiast will talk your ears off about how the process <em>is </em>the point: you’re here to take in the sights of the trail, to marinate in the beauty of the wilderness, and to dirty your feet trudging across some of the muddiest terrains in existence.</p><p>Even as an avowed hiking skeptic, I can’t help but grudgingly agree with this perspective; <em>Baby Steps</em> does have many sights worth slogging for. Littered across its landscapes are several trees bearing glowing fruits, which you can pick — and noisily devour — if you can reach them. There are several non-collectible hats to discover, which you can plonk on your head gingerly. Unfortunately, these can easily go missing if you fall from a great height; I’ve lost many precious hats in my own perilous journey. Then there are the items you can find and return to their owners. Chancing upon these make up some of the most memorable events of my hike.</p><p>In my first playthrough, I found a set of keys while breaking into a seemingly abandoned hut (just another regular hiking activity), but Nate’s less-than-stellar grip strength means that he has a tendency to drop the item whenever he trips over his own feet. This led me on an extensive wild goose chase as I sought to retrieve the keys: painstakingly search through a grassy field, scramble around the rocky chasm of a pit, and waddle after the offending item as it floats down a river. I did lose the keys in the end, but all the scouting led me to discover several landmarks and other delectable secrets. I won’t spoil what they are for you.</p><p>Beneath the absurd slapstick of <em>Baby Steps</em>, however, lies an axiom that many hiking detractors have known for ages: hiking is hell. The more Nate walks, the more soiled his onesie gets. The soles of his bare feet are stained with an indelible brown, and he sometimes lays on his back with a defeated sigh after suffering a spectacular fall. It’s how the game stands out from the burgeoning genre of hiking simulators like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/690468/death-stranding-2-review-ps5">Death Stranding</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/18/20804152/a-short-hike-review-animal-crossing-zelda-steam-itchio">A Short Hike</a>,</em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/8/10922560/firewatch-review-ps4-pc">Firewatch</a> </em>— titles that depict the activity as a meditative, serene experience.</p><p>But in <em>Baby Steps</em>, you aren’t just traversing treacherous environments, but also getting around with your own ramshackle body. Your legs betray your exhaustion; your head screams as you make another agonizing misstep. It’s a hiking experience that reflects the reality of folks who lose their motor skills when faced with the prospect of climbing up yet another craggy hill.</p><p><sub>Baby Steps <em>launches on September 23rd on the PS5 and Steam.</em></sub></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/783549/baby-steps-review-ps5-steam#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTI4Mg=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Khee Hoon Chan</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/783549/baby-steps-review-ps5-steam]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>The era of Google's Play's unrivaled dominance may be coming to an end in the wake of the company's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/google-loses-app-store-antitrust-appeal-must-make-sweeping-changes-to-play-store/">antitrust loss</a>, but Google's app store isn't going anywhere. In fact, the Play Store experience is getting a massive update with more personalization, content, and yes, AI. This is Google, after all.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-play/curation-update-september-2025/">revamped Google Play Games</a> is a key part of this update. Gamer profiles will now have a public face, allowing you to interact with other players if you choose. Play Games will track your activity for daily streaks, which will be shown on your profile and unlock new Play Points rewards. Your profile will also display your in-game achievements.</p>
<p>Your gaming exploits can also span multiple platforms. Google Play Games for PC is officially leaving beta. Google says there are now 200,000 games that work across mobile and PC, and even more PC-friendly titles, like <em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em>, are on the way. Your stats and streaks will apply across both mobile and PC as long as the title comes from the Play Store.</p>
<p>At the core of Google's app store revamp is the You Tab, which will soon take its place in the main navigation bar of the Play Store. This page will show your rewards, subscriptions, game, stats, and more—and it goes beyond gaming. The You Tab will recommend a variety of content on Google Play, including books and podcasts.</p>

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate, which <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-splintered-fate/radical-repetition">finally made the leap from Apple Arcade to consoles last year</a>, takes several cues from Hades, but wraps it in the shells of Eastman and Laird's iconic Turtles. Earlier this year, the mask-wearing Casey Jones joined the playable roster of characters in the isometric roguelike, and now, it's Metalhead's turn.</p><p>A robotic turtle built by Donatello, Metalhead is the sixth playable character and delivers an all-new playstyle to the game. He operates as the longest-range character on the roster to date, with a laser gun, explosive landmines, and tactical skills designed to keep enemies at a distance. The story introduces Metalhead by having him accidentally open a rift under a pizzeria, and it's up to the team to stop the chaos that spills out of the rift. Additionally, the paid DLC adds five new artifacts to let you further experiment with your builds.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iXGD8H4X0KI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iXGD8H4X0KI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In addition to the paid Metalhead DLC, all players will have access to a free title update that adds an Arcade mode, new levels, a new storyline, additional powers, enemies, visual upgrades, and tuning. Arcade mode offers a fast-paced way to experience the content alone or with friends, complete with a new Hex and Flex system, which adds new variables to account for during a run; some combos you unlock will weaken you (Hexes), while others will make you stronger (Flexes). The update also adds three new biomes – the Spectral Sewers, Astral Ship, and Manic Metropolis – a new Wraith enemy set, and Enemy Invasion mechanics that unlock new encounter combinations. These updates stack with more than 100 gameplay and quality-of-life improvements, including visual polish and balancing adjustments.</p><p>Both the Metalhead paid DLC and the free update hit all versions on September 30.

			<p>According to the <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/dying-light-the-beast-hades-and-so?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email#media-82268893-9e3f-41e4-9121-2afef3744476" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest Alinea Analytics newsletter</a>, Dying Light: The Beast has sold over a million units on Steam and over a million and a half overall. </p>



<p>You might recall that Polish developer Techland had <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-moved-up-one-day-techland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boasted</a> of having received a million pre-orders even before launch. However, that figure included Dying Light 2 Ultimate Edition users; since Dying Light: The Beast started its life as the second Dying Light 2 DLC, Ultimate Edition users are still entitled to it as originally promised by the studio. Now, though, Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics tells me the game has actually sold one million new copies on Valve's platform. The newsletter also says that, as you would expect, 82% of the players played the original Dying Light, and 77% played the sequel. That is to say, especially early on, dedicated fans have returned.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast topped Steam's weekly sales, but the other big titles released earlier this month continued to do well. Borderlands 4 added 337K units to <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-sold-2-million-units-earned-150-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its previous two million units</a>. Hollow Knight: Silksong sold another 255K on top of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-5-million-audience-overlaps-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">existing five million units</a>, and other indie games like Peak and Shape of Dreams also continued to do very well. </p>



<p>No, I’m Not Human, a freshly released first-person horror visual novel from Trioskaz, sold over 200K copies on its debut week. Jump Space, <a href="https://wccftech.com/jump-space-gamescom-2025-qa-little-bit-hazelight-magic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the sci-fi cooperative space adventure game from Keepsake</a>, also had a great early access launch week, topping even EA Sports FC 26 (at least on Steam).</p>



<p>Another game that did well last week was Hades, which sold over 150K units (crossing the nine million units milestone) thanks to a 75% discount. Supergiant timed it right in advance of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-2-will-be-a-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-console-exclusive-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.0 launch of Hades 2</a>, and Alinea Analytics reckons this will be the next big hit on Steam. The game has already sold over two million copies in early access, so there's a solid chance it will land around two million daily active users when it launches in two days.</p>



<p>As a side note, according to Alinea's estimates, Palworld has surpassed 25 million copies across all platforms. Incidentally, PocketPair has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-palfarm-farming-game-spin-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the spin-off farming game Palworld: Palfarm.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/painkiller-revival-slightly-delayed-new-rougelike-mode-gameplay-trailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/painkiller-revival-gets-slightly-delayed-deeper-into-october-new-rougelike-mode-gameplay-trailer-revealed.1305579/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After initially <a href="https://wccftech.com/painkiller-remake-officially-set-for-october-9-launch/">announcing</a> that the Painkiller revival from publisher 3D Realms and developer Anshar Studios would arrive on October 9, the game's arrival has been slightly pushed back a little more than a week into October to now launch on October 21, 2025. Alongside the reveal, we also got another action-packed trailer for the classic FPS game's comeback that makes it seem like it'll be worth the extra wait.</p>



<p>The Rogue Angel trailer features a look at a new roguelike mode that'll be included in the game when it arrives on October 21, adding more for players to do on top of the game's campaign mode, which will be playable solo or for the first time with the arrival of this new title, in a three-player co-op mode. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new mode takes players into a new realm of Purgatory, with procedurally generated arenas, new upgrades to make you and your teammates even stronger, and seemingly endless hordes of demons to shoot.</p>



<p>Initially announced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/painkiller-returns-in-fall-2025-reimagined-with-co-op-support/">March of this year</a>, this Painkiller revival brings the original 2004 shooter from Outriders and Bulletstorm developer People Can Fly back to the forefront, asking players to jump back into the boots of those condemned to Purgatory to try and escape your prison and redeem yourself for your own salvation.</p>



<p>Which is all just a backdrop to go shoot hordes and hordes of demons in some fast-paced FPS fun. Now with a roguelike mode to boot.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ananta">Ananta</a> is a bit of an alarming game to look at. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> game is so clearly an anime-esque riff on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA</a>, with some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-spider-man-2">Spider-Man</a> style web swinging thrown in for reasons I'm not entirely sure of. All of that's been obviously more or less since its announcement. But the game just received its first gameplay trailer at Tokyo Game Show, and it looks scarily… expensive.
</p>
<p>
Through the roughly seven minutes of gameplay, set to a song I can only describe as "song you let play on the radio while driving just because you want to fill the silence," more and more Things just kept happening. One minute the main character is driving a motorbike, the next they're taking a selfie through different scenes, one of which shows a mostly naked man escaping police on a robotic, walking toilet, and then the next they're fighting goons Yakuza-style in the street.
</p>

</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYejjuRrLzw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
And more things keep happening after that! There's the aforementioned Spider-Man swinging, a giant city-destroying robot, and just so many fictitious shops with such well realised branding you could convince me I could actually visit them. 
</p>
<p>
This isn't even mentioning the fact that Ananta just wholesale rips off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>'s character transition, letting you hop into another, presumably gacha rolled, character's body, continuing on whatever they're doing. There's even quite an interesting use of this where you can do so while you're being held at gunpoint, with the switch to another character allowing you to snipe enemies from afar.
</p><p>
It really has that GTA ethos of "you can do everything," an ethos I don't necessarily feel great about considering the amount of labour likely required to achieve it, which raises questions of how ethical that labour was achieved. There's a chance it's teetering on the edge of having too much to do the do, to the point it becomes overwhelming.
</p>
<p>
Ananta isn't just alarming because of how much of an "everything" game it presents itself as, but because I have some reservations about its narrative framing. The main character is the new captain of a special task force, essentially what seems to be the police. There's even a moment about halfway through where, as a different character, you can just handcuff and arrest an NPC.
</p>
<p>
Of course you can have games where you play as the police, there are good and interesting stories about police too, but I can't help but feel a bit concerned by such a, potentially small, gameplay feature. There's no amount of cute half-animal anime women that can make it easy to breeze past such a thing.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps a game to be curious but cautious about, whenever it comes out.

              <p><span>Do you guys think </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/surprise-press-conference-reveals-trump-still-not-dead-2000622401"><span>Donald Trump</span></a><span> might have some kind of humiliation kink? Is someone with such a myopic view of the world, enabled by all the yes-men in his corner and the cult-like following of his supporters, even capable of perceiving embarrassment? Well, if the last 79 years of the businessman-and-reality-star-turned-U.S.-president’s life weren’t embarrassing enough, his press conference yesterday, September 22, in which he </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/22/health/trump-autism-announcement-cause-tylenol"><span>tried to link autism to taking Tylenol during pregnancy</span></a><span>, with zero scientific evidence or backing, would be enough to haunt the average self-aware person for the rest of their days. But for those of us who watched the president dribble out this absolute nonsense, it was a tremendous day to post.</span></p>  <p><span>If you want to watch the hour-long press conference in which </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881"><span>Trump</span></a><span> attributes a condition first recognized in 1912 to a pain medication that was introduced in 1955, it’s right here, but you will likely find the most interesting bits clipped on social media. Some highlights include Trump saying nonsense like “Nothing bad can happen, it can only good happen,” and his being unable to pronounce acetaminophen. But to summarize, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/south-park-trump-episode-satan-white-house-response-1851786980"><span>Trump</span></a><span> and his merry band of misfits allege that if someone takes Tylenol while pregnant, their baby could pop out with the uncanny ability to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900"><span>remember the names of all 1000+ Pokémon</span></a><span>. He says that pregnant people should avoid Tylenol at all costs “unless medically necessary.” You know, “if you can’t tough it out.” Notably, the conference constantly name-drops Tylenol, which is Kenvue’s brand name for over-the-counter acetaminophen, rather than more widely attributing this fake science to acetaminophen itself. So we’ll see if Tylenol itself decides to pursue any sort of legal action.</span></p> <p><span>The entire thing was so nonsensical that the internet had a field day with the insinuation that Tylenol could be the cause of something that pre-dates it by several decades, and the jokes about having babies with special interests came aflowing.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">so ur telling me my mum had a headache and now im stuck like this forever</p> <p>— Aoife 🐝 Bee 🏳️‍⚧️ (@Aoife_Bee_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Aoife_Bee_/status/1970250170999693678?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">if we take acetaminophen instead of a name brand while pregnant will the autism be generic or nah? i’m trying to have a savant</p> <p>— Sydney Battle (@SydneyBattle) <a href="https://twitter.com/SydneyBattle/status/1970248358209167865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Forget the Tylenol.

Indeed it was one of the tougher areas to navigate, especially in the months after the game launched and before Larian issued various updates, mainly due to the sheer number of NPCs who mill about on-screen and everything the game has to consider as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/511843343389426278" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>, Larian said the native Steam Deck build means Baldur’s Gate 3 has a more stable framerate, lower loading times, and smoother gameplay on Valve’s handheld. But the work done for this build benefits all players by improving the way the game's models are streamed across all platforms.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Hotfix #34 addresses “some rather annoying” instances of crashing on Xbox, Larian said. And as is Larian’s way, it sprinkled the patch notes, below, with some trademark flair. For example:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed the audio levels for a rat in the Lower City that you, tragically, couldn't hear squeak when it squoke.</li><li>Reminded Halsin to actually yell when he gains barbarian Rage instead of silently miming it.</li><li>Told one of the imps on the nautiloid to stop looking in the wrong direction.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-baldurs-gate-3-turns-2-larian-boss-swen-vincke-talks-about-the-studios-next-game-and-asks-fans-for-their-patience-well-need-a-bit-of-time-to-make-it-all-work">Baldur’s Gate 3 celebrated its two-year anniversary last month</a>, with Larian boss Swen Vincke discussing how its enormous success paved the way for the studio to work on its hotly-anticipated next game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN 10 of 2023</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPG was a breakout hit in 2023, dominating online conversation and setting sales records.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The HOTTEST (heh) new content for Ubisoft's first-person shooter.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft and developer Massive Entertainment have announced From the Ashes, a new story expansion for Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, the 2023 first-person shooter set in James Cameron's Avatar universe. From the Ashes will be available on December 19 – the same day as Cameron's upcoming Avatar: Fire and Ash film – for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Ubisoft+, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and Ubisoft Connect. It will be priced at $24.99 for players who already own the base game. Alternatively, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – From the Ashes Edition will include the full game and this story expansion and be available on the same platforms for $39.99. Watch the announcement trailer above and check out the first screenshots from the expansion in the gallery below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"From the Ashes takes place a few weeks after the events of the upcoming film Fire and Ash and roughly six months after Frontiers of Pandora and both story packs," Omar Bouali, the creative director on the project, told IGN. "From the Ashes is set in a ravaged and occupied version of the Kinglor Forest which includes a new sub-region, The Ravines. It mirrors the themes of the film as it sees the RDA ally with the Ash Clan, fierce Na’vi warriors who thrive on chaos and pain as they intensify their efforts to eliminate threats to their regime. So, whilst the film and expansion are set in different regions of Pandora, there is some shared DNA and we’ve worked closely with Lightstorm to ensure both pieces of Avatar media are complementary."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – From the Ashes DLC Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft described From the Ashes' plot as such: "From the Ashes sees players embark on the journey of So’lek, a battle-hardened Na’vi warrior from the Trr’ong clan. Ambushed and left for dead by the RDA and their new allies—the ruthless Ash clan—So’lek awakens to a world in flames and his Sarentu family scattered. Driven by grief and vengeance, he sets out to reunite with and protect his loved ones."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As to what we might see in both this story expansion and the upcoming movie, Bouali said, "We have been able to share some elements across both pieces of media – the most obvious being the Mangkawn, otherwise known as the Ash Clan, but also the Wind Traders who appeared first in our game but will also appear in Fire and Ash. There’s also one very special creature that will appear in both our game and Fire and Ash that we’re very excited for fans to discover. So yes, without revealing too much, it is a process of strong collaboration and we each have been able to share and contribute in an organic, complementary way to ensure fans get an authentic and consistent experience across both the expansion and film."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN called Frontiers of Pandora "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-review">good</a>" when it released almost two years ago.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Creative director Omar Bouali told IGN that From the Ashes takes place "a few weeks" after the upcoming Fire and Ash film and "roughly six months" after the events of Frontiers of Pandora and its two previous story expansions (The Sky Breaker and Secrets of the Spires).</p><p>"From the Ashes is set in a ravaged and occupied version of the Kinglor Forest which includes a new sub-region, The Ravines," Bouali said. "It mirrors the themes of the film as it sees the RDA ally with the Ash Clan, fierce Na’vi warriors who thrive on chaos and pain as they intensify their efforts to eliminate threats to their regime. So, whilst the film and expansion are set in different regions of Pandora, there is some shared DNA and we've worked closely with Lightstorm to ensure both pieces of Avatar media are [complementary]."</p><p>Keeping his cards close to his chest and choosing his words carefully, Bouali gave a brief hint of what to expect when From the Ashes comes out this December. Apparently, there's a connection between this upcoming story expansion and the upcoming theatrical release.</p><p>"We have been able to share some elements across both pieces of media--the most obvious being the Mangkawn, otherwise known as the Ash Clan, but also the Wind Traders who appeared first in our game but will also appear in Fire and Ash," Bouali said. "There’s also one very special creature that will appear in both our game and Fire and Ash that we’re very excited for fans to discover. So yes, without revealing too much, it is a process of strong collaboration and we each have been able to share and contribute in an organic, complementary way to ensure fans get an authentic and consistent experience across both the expansion and film."</p><p>This isn't the only thing coming to Frontiers of Pandora. On December 5, two weeks before From the Ashes and Fire and Ash come out, Ubisoft Massive will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-getting-third-person-update-just-ahead-of-avatar-3/1100-6533311/" data-ref-id="1100-6533311">release an update for the open-world action-adventure game</a> that introduces New Game Plus, as well as a third-person camera for a different perspective.</p><p>From the Ashes will be available for $20 USD on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Ubisoft+, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and Ubisoft Connect. There's also a $40 USD From the Ashes Edition, which includes the base Frontiers of Pandora game and this story DLC.</p><p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is available now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <p>A video has been released by the US Department of Homeland Security promoting ICE, set to the Pokémon theme from the '90s anime.</p>
<p>The video, posted to social media yesterday, includes disturbing footage of people being arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) alongside imagery from the Pokémon anime and its theme song, as if protagonist Ash Ketchum is involved.</p>
<p>Shared with the caption "Gotta Catch 'Em All", the video ends with Pokémon card-style graphics featuring criminals arrested for crimes such as murder, pedophilia, and human smuggling. Each has a weakness to ice.</p> <div>

<p>ICE has received increased funding as part of President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed into law back in July. It's intended to conduct criminal investigations, enforce immigration laws, and preserve national security, but has been criticised for using excessive force.</p>
<p>The post has been rapidly responded to with calls for Nintendo to sue for copyright infringement.</p>
<p>The Japanese games company is known for being particularly litigious, but is yet to comment on the video.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted both The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for a response.</p>

<p>Say hello to the newest fighter</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After a cheeky little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-splintered-fate-teases-new-playable-character">tease</a> last week, Super Evil Megacorp has today lifted the lid on the next wave of content heading to the TMNT roguelike <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_splintered_fate">Splintered Fate</a> — and, brace yourselves, there's quite a lot.</p>
<p>The game will be landing a beefy free content update on <strong>30th September</strong>, with a new game mode, fresh levels, a bonus storyline, visual upgrades, and more all arriving as standard. What's more, a new batch of paid DLC will be cropping up on the same day, adding a fresh-faced playable character: Metalhead.</p>
<p>Let's start with those paid extras. Metalhead is Splintered Fate's first full-range fighter, bringing a laser gun and landmines to the game's usual hack-and-slash play style. Aside from the metallic menace, the DLC also includes five new artefacts to beef up your boost options mid-run.</p>
<p>But the real meat comes in the free update. The biggest addition for <em>all</em> players is the new Arcade Mode, which offers a fast-paced way to play through some combat with pals. There are new enemies and locales to get to grips with in this mode, and a new 'Hex and Flex' system that promises to mix up each run for the better (or worse).</p>
<p>The free update also includes a host of fun features like a new artefact, Drone Tools for passive ranged support, a 'Robotics Turtle Power Tree', and the bonus 'Pizza in Peril' storyline, which spins off from the new game mode.</p>

<p>And this is an <em>update</em>, so the dev also promises a bunch of fixes, quality-of-life improvements, balancing adjustments and more. The update notes on the <a href="https://superevilmegacorp.com/news/tmnt-splintered-fate-brings-its-biggest-ever-update/">Super Evil Megacorp website</a> even claim that there are some visual improvements to boot. <em>Totally tubular!</em></p>
<p>All in all, it feels like it might be a good time to give Splintered Fate another go. We had a good time with this radical roguelike when it first arrived on Switch last year, but felt that the natural comparisons to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a> were never going to work in its favour.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-expansion-revealed-for-december.1305501/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft and developer Massive Entertainment have announced&nbsp;<em>From the Ashes</em>, a brand new story expansion for&nbsp;<em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>that's set to launch alongside the third movie this December.</p>

<p>As revealed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-dlc-announced-release-timed-with-fire-and-ash-movie" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">by IGN</a>, the new DLC will arrive on December 19th, which is the same day on which James Cameron's&nbsp;<em>Avatar: Fire and Ash&nbsp;</em>arrives in cinemas. Presumably, it will once again sell absolutely shedloads of tickets, although I cannot for the life of me fathom why.</p>

<p><em>From the Ashes&nbsp;</em>will, according to creative director Omar Bouali, take place "a few weeks" after the events of&nbsp;<em>Fire and Ash</em>, and around six months after the events of&nbsp;<em>Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>and its existing story packs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-dlc-base-game-bow.jpg?itok=j6eQ9psr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-dlc-base-game-bow.jpg?itok=Lhw5Hxon 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>is getting another big story DLC pack.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Bouali, the new&nbsp;<em>From the Ashes&nbsp;</em>expansion will be set in "a ravaged and occupied version of the Kinglor Forest", and it'll give you a new sub-region to explore in the form of The Ravines.</p>

<p>Watching&nbsp;<em>Fire and Ash&nbsp;</em>may well give you a better experience in&nbsp;<em>From the Ashes</em>, too; while Bouali says the two "are set in different reigons of Pandora", there's still some "shared DNA" between the two, with Ubisoft working alongside Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment to make both stories "complimentary".</p>

<p>It's likely that we'll learn more about&nbsp;<em>Fire and Ash&nbsp;</em>over the next few months, but you can at least expect to encounter the Ash Clan that partially lend their name to the DLC, as well as "one very special creature", about which Ubisoft is remaining tight-lipped for now.</p>

<p><em>From the Ashes&nbsp;</em>will arrive in the same month as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-update-new-game-plus" rel="nofollow">a major update</a> for&nbsp;<em>Frontiers of Pandora</em>, which is scheduled to add a New Game Plus mode to the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry</em>-esque FPS, as well as a third-person view mode and more.</p>

            <p>This week, a streamer attempting to raise money for their own cancer treatment instead lost $32,000 to malware added to a new Steam game after release. The Steam game, BlockBlasters, has now been yanked from sale, and the malware distributors reportedly identified and confronted by free-roaming cybersecurity nerds. The streamer in question, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rastalandtv">RastalandTV</a>, has also been compensated for the theft. It's a happier ending than you often get from malware infection stories, and a reminder to be wary of random free games on Steam.</p><!--more-->
<p>Created by first-time Steam developer Genesis Interactive and published on 31st July, BlockBlasters is/was a free-to-play 2D action platformer about beating up crab monsters. As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/streaming/another-malware-masquerading-as-a-steam-game-took-tens-of-thousands-from-streamers-cancer-recovery-donations/">PCGamer</a> and shared in this week's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-tokyo-game-show-silent-hill-babel-city-building-and-an-rpg-about-a-fugitive-king">Maw</a> by MiniMatt, RastalandTV downloaded the game after being prompted to do so in his stream chat. RastalandTV <a href="https://x.com/rastalandTV/status/1969629808788181258">noticed the scam</a> right in the middle of his fund-raising stream - be warned that the saved clip is very distressing.</p>
<p>As reported by cybersecurity site <a href="https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2025/09/38265-steam-blockblasters-game-downloads-malware">G Data</a>, BlockBlasters appears to have been updated with malware after launch. It was patched on August 30th with a batch file whose functions include gathering Steam login details together with IP and location info, and searching for installed anti-virus products. </p>
<p>Having carried out these functions, G Data report, the batch script then executes scripts from password-protected archives (whose contents can't, apparently, be detected during download) which record the user's browser extensions and crypto wallet information, amongst other things. I suspect I've made a hash of summarising G Data's analysis, so maybe read the rest on there.</p><p>Cryptocurrency investor Alex Becker has donated $30,000 to RastalandTV, so he's at least recovered the bulk of the money for his cancer treatment. Meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1970170201736933604">vxunderground</a> and other "open source intelligence" peeps claim they have used Telegram credentials inside the malware to track down the scammers and investigate their social media feeds. They say they've contacted one of the malware distributors, who initially promised to return the money, then "nuked everything" instead. </p>
<p>A few of the internet sleuths have put together a <a href="https://vx-underground.org/Malware%20Analysis/2025/2025-09-21%20-%20Block%20Blasters%20-%20Forensic%20Report/Paper">report</a> that accuses Valve of "appalling levels of vetting". The report also suggests that the game may have been deliberately developed to serve as a Trojan horse for the malware, given that one of the alleged scammers was at one point "looking for a video game programmer to make a basic 2D game".</p>
<p>Another streamer has reported <a href="https://x.com/GEOFFCOINCRYPTO/status/1969393116529770720">losing $15,000 to the BlockBlasters malware</a>. A third <a href="https://x.com/TeddyxROO/status/1969341835077448125">says the scammers have been approaching various people in chat</a>, trying to get them to download the game. Thousands of Steam users own BlockBlasters, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3872350/charts/">a SteamDB.info estimate</a>, and G Data say that hundreds may have downloaded the malware update. The site also claims that there has been "a rise in malware infections" from Steam games this year, citing another free-to-play title, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1inniw1/a_game_called_piratefi_released_on_steam_last/">PirateFi</a>, and early access game <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-sneaks-infostealer-malware-into-early-access-steam-game/">Chemia</a>.</p>
<p>Other than removing the game from Steam, Valve have yet to acknowledge or comment on the BlockBlasters story. I'll ask them if they have anything to share right now about Steam security procedures.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Hello everyone. I’ve got a lovely spread of stories below for you to enjoy on this fine Tuesday. Sure, the world is on fire and everything is horrible, but at least you have Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and stuff you might care about. That’s something to be happy about, right? Today we have news about a lawsuit against Sega, the reveal of a new <em>Palworld</em> game, bad news for Xbox fans, and some friends bonding over the fun of skateboarding.</p> <h2><strong>Costco seemingly done selling Xbox consoles and games</strong></h2> <p>If you try to buy an Xbox console or video game on Costco’s website, you’ll discover that the company no longer sells Xbox-related gear or software. <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/costco-removes-xbox-consoles-games-series-x-s-from-us-uk-websites/">As reported by <em>TheGamer</em></a> and spotted by others online, Costco has quietly stopped selling Xbox consoles and games on its online shop with no warning in both the UK and the United States. If you try to search for Xbox on Costco’s website, you’ll be greeted with a message saying nothing was found. Interestingly, the retail giant still sells PlayStation and Nintendo games and devices as well as VR-related gear. Some have recently <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1mxs76a/xbox_items_at_costco/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reported that physical stores</a> are stocking fewer Xbox consoles, controllers, and games, too.</p> <p>What’s going on? Well, it’s possible that Xbox consoles and games just haven’t sold well at Costco over the years, and the retailer is cutting its losses and moving on. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-physical-game-low-sales-digital-1851218453">In 2024, it was reported</a> that some retailers weren’t sure if they would keep selling Xbox games in the future due to poor sales. It likely doesn’t help that the price of an Xbox in some places keeps going up and up. Just last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-price-hike-raise-trump-tariff-microsoft-2000627228">Xbox raised prices again on all Xbox Series X/S consoles</a>.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Palworld</em> farming spin-off announced two weeks after <em>Pokémon</em> revealed a similar game</strong></h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨Palfarm – A Palworld Spin-off!🚨</p> <p>Create your own amazing farm with your favourite Pals!🌱<br>Till fields, grow crops, and enjoy a carefree, slow-paced life in this Palworld spin-off game!</p> <p>Currently in development by a new team! <a href="https://t.co/ldwQyLmd9W">pic.twitter.com/ldwQyLmd9W</a></p> <p>— Palworld (@Palworld_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Palworld_EN/status/1970292031139217701?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-devs-announce-farming-sim-spin-off-palworld-palfarm">On September 22, <em>Palworld</em> developers PocketPair announced a new game, </a><em>Palworld: Palfarm.&nbsp;</em>As the name might suggest, this is a spin-off of the company’s incredibly popular <em>Palworld</em>, aka “Pokémon with guns” aka <a href="https://kotaku.com/palworld-pokemon-company-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-1851652124">that game Nintendo is suing</a>. The new spin-off looks to be a cozy farming sim in the spirit of <em>Stardew Valley</em> and<em> Animal Crossing.</em> There is no release date for <em>Palfarm</em>, and at the moment, it appears to only be in development for PC.</p>

 <p>Interestingly, less than two weeks ago, The Pokémon Company announced its own cozy farm life spin-off, too. There’s no way that PocketPair created this trailer and game in two weeks, but the timing of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-animal-crossing-switch-2-nintendo-direct-2000625331"><em>Pokémon Pokopia</em>‘s announcement</a> being closely followed by <em>Palfarm</em>‘s reveal is funny considering the whole situation between the companies involved.</p>

 <h2><strong>One of <em>Sonic</em>‘s most famous songs is still in legal limbo</strong></h2> <p>Late last year,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-adventure-2-hedgehog-live-learn-crush-40-lawsuit-1851724753">Crush 40 musician Johnny Gioeli sued Sega</a> over ownership of “Live and Learn,” a song closely associated with the hedgehog since appearing in<em> Sonic Adventure 2.</em> Gioeli argued he fully owned the master recording of the song and that Sega had used it in multiple games, and in the live-action film<em> Sonic 3</em>, without proper permission. Now, as reported by <em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lawsuit-over-ownership-of-sonic-theme-live-and-learn-dismissed-but-fortnite-collab-proves-song-remains-in-limbo-says-songwriter">Eurogamer</a></em>, the case has been dismissed without a judgment given, leaving the famous song in legal “limbo.”</p>

 <p>“Everyone- the news is out that the case against SEGA was dismissed,”<a href="https://x.com/Crush40Johnny/status/1970123862810525733/photo/1"> said Gioeli in a statement posted online.</a>&nbsp; “I want you to understand that the reason for the dismissal was based on time, not on ownership. The song remains in ‘limbo’. Just 2 weeks ago, I was contacted by Epic Games to potentially use ‘Live &amp; Learn’… and the amazing part is SEGA had them call <em>me</em> for the rights to use the song. So there you have it. The most epic song remains in the ‘abyss of ownership’.”</p>

 <p>Gioeli ended his statement saying that the beloved track is his and not Sega’s, adding: “I wrote it with Jun, I sing it, I created the melody, I recorded the vocals in my studio.”</p> <h2><strong><em>Arc Raiders</em> is doing one final and very large open beta</strong></h2> <p>There have been a lot of playtests and betas for the upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/arc-raiders">sci-fi extraction shooter<em> Arc Raiders</em></a><em>,</em> and there’s going to be one more. But this time, everyone is invited in an effort to test the highly anticipated shooter’s servers before it launches next month. On September 22, the devs behind <em>Arc Raiders</em> announced one final open beta. The idea behind this multi-platform open beta, which starts on October 17 and ends on October 19, is to slam the game’s servers ahead of its October 30 release date.</p> <p>“Please invite your friends and give those servers a challenge,” <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/server-slam-pre-orders/">asked the devs in a post announcing the final beta test</a> as well as revealing some pre-order bonuses.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Stardew Valley</em> creator warns people not to get too hyped (yet) for the 1.7 update</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-concerenedape-haunted-chocolatier-update-1851778392">In April,</a> <em>Stardew Valley</em> creator Eric Barone, known online as ConcernedApe, explained that after<em> Stardew Valley</em>‘s massive 1.6 update, he was going to focus on finishing up and launching <em>Haunted Chocolatier.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1n49ht4/ca_confirms_therell_be_a_stardew_valley_17_update/">And then in August</a>, he announced a 1.7 update was in the works for <em>Stardew Valley</em>. Since then, he’s been mostly radio silent about the update.</p> <p>That changed on September 21 when a fan reshared his old 1.7 tease with a sad face. Barone asked why they were sad, and they admitted they just hated waiting. When another fan asked Barone to give people a tease for 1.7, he promised that information about the update would arrive in the future. For now, though, he doesn’t want people to get too hyped because there’s still a long wait.</p> <p>“More will come,” <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1970002493901000833">posted the <em>Stardew Valley</em> creator on Twitter</a>.&nbsp; “I just don’t want too much hype at this point. It’s going to be a while before the update is ready.” Will Barone ever stop updating <em>Stardew Valley</em>? Time will tell, but I know what I’d bet on.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4s-super-jump-bug-cricket-jumping-legendary-gun-gearbox-patch-pc-2000627659">People are using a bug to fly in <em>Borderlands 4</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/tiktok-grinch-christmas-ornament-disney-belle-mickey-2000627636">AI-generated Christmas ornament slop is flooding TikTok</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/mandalorian-grogu-trailer-disney-boycott-2000627542">Disney released the first trailer for the <em>Star Wars Mandalorian</em> movie</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

                <p>Earlier in September, Nintendo revealed that Pokemon is getting a cozy game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-pokopia/" data-ref-id="5000-694776">Pokemon Pokopia</a>. Apparently the developers of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/" data-ref-id="5000-532768">Palworld</a> had similar ideas, because Pocketpair has now unveiled a spin-off cozy game of its own called Palworld: Palfarm.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmurGwwjvGM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AmurGwwjvGM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Much like Pokemon Pokopia, Palfarm lets players gather pals to help them live a quiet life as a farmer while handling the harvest, the cooking, and even the business of selling the food. The chosen pals also lend their special abilities to the player to make things easier on the farm.</p><p>However, it does appear that this game has a dark side. Pocketpair has confirmed that some pals will attack the communities you create in Palfarm. The trailer also has an unnerving sequence of a gunshop owner playing with a weapon that's much darker than the Pokemon games are willing to go.</p><p>Palworld: Palfarm is available to wish list on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4031890/Palworld_Palfarm/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, but it hasn't been confirmed for any of the consoles yet. The game's release date is currently unannounced. </p><p>In the interim, Nintendo has stepped up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-suing-palworld-devs/1100-6526569/" data-ref-id="1100-6526569">its legal battle against Pocketpair</a> over Palworld's similarities to Pokemon. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-update-adds-big-change-to-avoid-disruptions-amid-nintendo-patent-lawsuit/1100-6531394/" data-ref-id="1100-6531394">Pocketpair has removed some of the features</a> that Nintendo objected to, but now the latter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-nintendo-patent-could-reshape-the-future-of-pokemon-inspired-games/1100-6534611/" data-ref-id="1100-6534611">has cited a patent</a> that “covers the fundamental gameplay mechanic of summoning a character and letting it fight another” in a video game.</p><p>As part of the same case, Nintendo recently argued that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-argues-game-mods-arent-prior-art-in-palworld-lawsuit/1100-6534882/" data-ref-id="1100-6534882">mods don't count</a> as either games or "prior art."

            <link>https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-introduces-a-payday-2-subscription-that-lets-you-access-almost-every-dlc-for-5-month/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starbreeze-introduces-a-payday-2-subscription-that-lets-you-access-almost-every-dlc-for-5-month.1305456/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Two years ago, on September 21, 2023, Starbreeze Entertainment released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/payday-3-bringing-the-big-buck/">Payday 3</a>, a game that might've pushed the series forward in terms of its approach to stealth gameplay and its visuals, but was an abysmal mess with <a href="https://wccftech.com/payday-3-peaked-at-1-3-million-daily-users-starbreeze-apologizes-for-server-issues/">server issues</a>, no offline mode, and a massive lack of content compared to Payday 2. </p>



<p>Two years later, Starbreeze is <a href="https://x.com/PAYDAYGame/status/1970046991779434606">celebrating the 14th anniversary of the Payday series</a>, though it's a muted celebration, as it's most recent release is far less popular than the game it made before. Looking at Steam concurrent numbers alone, Payday 2 <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/charts/">still has thousands of players</a> going on heists and enjoying the wealth of content available with its many DLCs. Payday 3, on the other hand, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/">struggles to hit 1k players</a> with any kind of consistency.</p>



<p>That's probably why, as part of today's anniversary celebrations, Starbreeze has introduced two noteworthy bits of news for Payday fans. Firstly, Payday 3 is getting an <a href="https://www.paydaythegame.com/news/payday3/2025/09/new-skill-system-preview/">overhauled skill system</a> as Starbreeze continues to try to shape Payday 3 into a game that Payday fans want to play more than Payday 2.</p>



<p>Second, while everyone who still wants to play a Payday game is playing Payday 2, Starbreeze has introduced a new subscription for (almost) all the 65+ DLCs available for the heist shooter. It's not every DLC that's been released for Payday 2, because it doesn't include any DLC content that's been retired or removed.</p>



<p>It's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3847540/PAYDAY_2_Subscription/">$5/month subscription</a> to access the many DLCs available for Payday 2, which Starbreeze says it has introduced because, "<em>Payday 2 has had a lot of DLCs released, and for many players, especially new ones, it can be difficult to know what DLC content you may be interested in. So we’ve introduced the Subscription to give an easy way to access all DLC content at a low monthly price.</em>"</p>



<p>That might seem sensible and like a good deal on face value, even when considering that you will need to buy Payday 2 separately to access any of the content in the subscription. But that's before you realize that Payday 2's DLCs routinely go on sale, with the <a href="https://steamdb.info/bundle/3756/">Legacy Collection</a> and the <a href="https://steamdb.info/bundle/34119/#prices">Infamous Collection</a>, the latter of which includes every DLC ever released for Payday 2, going on sale a few times a year for anywhere between 20% and 30% off.</p>



<p>In fairness to Starbreeze, it's not the only studio trying something like this. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/">Cities: Skylines</a> offers a similar service, as do <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1538960/Crusader_Kings_II__Expansion_Subscription/">Crusader Kings II</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/24010/Train_Simulator_Classic_2024/">Train Simulator</a>, to name a few. But whether it'll actually help Starbreeze keep the lights on while it tries to fix Payday 3 is another question, and so far it doesn't seem to have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/1nnssb4/wait_what_payday_2_subscription/">gone over too well with the Payday community</a>. </p>



<p>Not everything has to be a subscription you pay for monthly, and if you're really someone who wants to get into Payday, then you're much better off doing a bit of research as to which DLCs you'd maybe want to try, and waiting for everything to go on sale, because it will go on sale and ultimately be cheaper than having $5 chipped off your bank account for months on end.</p>
