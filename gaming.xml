            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Life is a series of battles, and I just lost my last one against four gyoza on a skewer. It was an unexpected blow, because honestly, who could have expected me — a springy, respectably proportioned hot dog — to lose against a seemingly inflexible spear of small, unassuming dumplings? This is my struggle in <em>Sausage Legend: Arena</em>, a mobile game with a very simple premise: duel with other players’ sausages and win.</p><p>On the surface, it looks like a garden-variety mobile game riddled with bugs (it is). But the difference between <em>Sausage Legend</em> and a fleeting idea you had after overdoing it on edibles is that 3.5 million people have played <em>Sausage Legend</em>, it has been on Japanese national television, and it is shockingly fun. And with an upcoming release on Steam, it’s poised to get even bigger.</p><p>As befits combat that demands swatting two wieners at each other, <em>Sausage Legend</em> is a heavily physics-based game. Each sausage is thrust onto the battlefield by a fork; players flop their sausages around to bludgeon each other to death. As someone with the vestigial sensibilities of a 13-year-old shitposter, I love this ballet of well-timed jabs and opportunistic ripostes, all while I admire the resilience and elasticity of my humble meat sword.</p><p>I fight lightning-infused cocktail sausages and weisswurst. There are brats and goteborgs, as well as pickled cucumber and a slice of pepperoni pizza (which, I guess technically contains sausage). There are more than 50 different sausages and other food items, each with different advantages — length, strength, special powers, and so on. My health bar smugly refuses to replenish between rounds. I learn that at some point, I will encounter a chrome-covered metal sausage that looks like something out of the deepest pit of T-1000 <em>Terminator</em> fanfic. There are barely any instructions, there are tedious ads, and when I reopen the game, it has not saved my meager progress. And yet, I crave more sausage.</p><p>For developer Tadaki Tani, the inspiration behind <em>Sausage Legend</em> didn’t come from playing with his food. “In the beginning, we found <a href="https://thekidshouldseethis.com/post/the-etiquette-of-a-giraffe-fight">giraffes fighting</a> on YouTube and the giraffes were ‘hanging’ their heads around and round, and that’s how we got the first idea [for the game],” he explains through a translator. The first prototype of the game used giraffes, but the fighting scenes didn’t quite work out. Why not try sausages? And <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/krishrach/theres-a-new-game-where-you-fight-with-sasusages-and-its-act">so, in 2016, <em>Sausage Legend</em> was born</a>.</p><p>Tani is the CEO of MilkCorp, a studio he founded in 2009 that offers meme-y mobile games like <em>My Grizzly Bear</em>, <em>Sleep In Office</em>, and <em>Pollen Heaven</em>. <em>My Grizzly Bear</em> is exactly what it sounds like — a free grizzly bear care simulator whose <a href="https://milkcorp.com/app/my-grizzly-bear/?lang=en">official page (correctly) reads</a>, “The only people who would think of doing something like that are Youtubers desperate for views.” <em>Pollen Heaven</em> is a self-described “<a href="https://milkcorp.com/app/pollen_heave/?lang=en">silly game</a>” based on Tani’s own hay fever. <em>Sausage Legend: Arena 2</em>, its Japan-only sequel, features a medieval story world where slaves must sausage-duel for their freedom. The development team consists of Tani, and one other person.</p><div><p>“There are a lot of people playing because of her.”</p></div><p>The biggest boost to <em>Sausage Legend</em> came from a niche corner of the internet: a Hololive vtuber named Oozora Subaru, who became besotted with the original game and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVHLS_2Ai2w">plays it obsessively</a> to the delight (or chagrin, in some cases) of her fans. (We did reach out to Hololive’s parent company Cover for comment, but it did not respond.) In 2021, Subaru <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0zw-fplbc0">got her own legendary sausage</a> in <em>Sausage Legend 2</em>, styled like a duck, which is her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=cmUnxqcY-zE">informal mascot</a>. Her fellow vtuber Hakui Koyori also got a special sausage: the “Koyori Skin of the Large Intestine” sausage which sported a fluffy pink tail. “There are a lot of people playing because of her,” Tani says, noting that it took around 10 of her streams to see a noticeable uptick in players.</p><p>Later this year, Tani is going to release an expanded version of <em>Sausage Legend: Arena</em> on Steam — essentially a more filled-out <em>Sausage Legend 2</em> story mode with added features. Slaves must take up arms (sausages) to fight for their freedom in a spectacular pastime favored by nobles: the sausage duel. There will be a deckbuilding mechanic to help you strategize the duels a little better — “the character doesn’t heal itself, but the cards will help you do that,” Tani says — as well as a few new modes and moves.</p><p>“We want to expand the game, and we want [more] people to know about it,” Tani says earnestly, before presenting me with a little acrylic standee of a hot dog. <em>Sausage Legend</em>’s upcoming release on Steam is poised to bring the game to a wider audience, one that I fervently hope will include avid modders. Half of the playerbase is Japanese, while the rest are overseas in the US and Taiwan, with France coming in fourth. Tani and I are both surprised that Germany isn’t in the top five; his favorite sausage type is weisswurst, which seems appropriate in the canon of <a href="https://gabrielknight.fandom.com/wiki/Wurst_Lady">significant video game sausages</a>.</p><p>After the successful collaborations he’s had — crossovers with the 2016 movie <em>Sausage Party</em>, Morinaga Pino ice-cream, and Hololive — I ask if he would consider working with Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest, perhaps even the Olympics of sausages. “If there is a chance, we would love to,” he says with a smile. “Just eating a hot dog is the best way to eat a sausage.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIxNzQ="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Alexis Ong</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/791353/sausage-legend-steam-launch-interview]]></content:encoded>

<p>You didn't think we'd let Zion go without one last chat, did you?</p>
<p>Nah, he's not getting away that easily. So before our beloved video producer departs, we thought it would be nice to have one last chinwag and go over some of our happiest memories with Mr. Grassl.</p>
<p>So yes, the chaps reminisce over some key memories together over the last six years, including their first in-person meeting in London, the response to some of Zion's most ambitious videos, and their work on what might be their very best April Fools joke.</p>
<p>So if you have about 40 minutes to spare, do give it a watch. It's a lovely little sendoff for Zion, and as we mentioned in our previous article, we're very sad to see him go (but also very happy for his new, currently very secret role!).</p>
<p>So once again, from all of us at Nintendo Life, good luck on your next venture Zion, and don't be a stranger!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-fire-tv-sticks-amazon-is-blowing-out-roku-devices-at-their-cheapest-price-ever.1316863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cutting the cord on cable TV has never been easier, but choosing the right streaming device can feel overwhelming with so many options flooding the market. Amazon launched its Fire TV Stick lineup years ago to compete directly with established players like Roku and Google’s Chromecast, and the battle for your living room has been fierce ever since.</p>
<p>Here’s the twist: while Amazon’s own <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-just-launched-new-gadgets-yet-the-fire-tv-stick-4k-is-practically-free-at-50-off-2000630324">Fire TV Sticks are hitting record low prices</a> during Prime Big Deal Days, <strong>the retail giant is pushing Roku devices even lower</strong> to clear out remaining inventory from its biggest rival. The Roku Streaming Stick HD has dropped from $29 down to $17, the Streaming Stick 4K fell from $49 to $29, and the Streaming Stick Plus landed at $24 instead of $39.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4492/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See Roku Streaming Stick 4K at Amazon</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3957/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See Roku Streaming Stick Plus at Amazon</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4493/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See Roku Streaming Stick HD at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Understanding the Differences in Roku’s Lineup of Streaming Sticks</h2>
<p>The <strong>entry-level Roku Streaming Stick HD</strong> is the least costly model at $17, ideal if <strong>you’re working with an older TV that tops off at 1080p resolution</strong> or just don’t worry about 4K content. It streams high-definition content effortlessly on all major platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max and thousands of other channels. Its included Roku Voice Remote allows you to search for shows by speaking instead of painstakingly entering using an on-screen keyboard, averting frustration when you’re trying to locate that one film whose name you just couldn’t quite manage to recall. It hooks up via HDMI and is powered from your TV’s USB port or from the included adapter.</p>



<p>Upgrading from the base model to the <strong>Roku Streaming Stick 4K</strong> for $29 unlocks significant visual gains if you own a 4K TV. This model is HDR (High Dynamic Range) and Dolby Vision capable, two technologies that achieve massive picture quality improvements beyond resolution bumps. HDR provides greater dynamic range between blacks and whites which results in more realistic pictures with higher-contrast levels. Dolby Vision does one better and adjusts brightness and colour dynamically on a scene- or even frame-by-frame basis, and it looks fantastic in supported content from services like Apple TV Plus, Netflix, and Disney Plus. Long-range Wi-Fi in the specs means that this stick should maintain stable connections even if your router is in another room or on another floor, reducing infuriating buffering that ruins key narrative points.</p>
<p>The <strong>Streaming Stick Plus</strong> at $24 is a tempting compromise with 4K and HDR support but no support for Dolby Vision, so it is relatively less capable in its ultimate picture quality compared to the Streaming Stick 4K, but importantly still much more capable compared to the HD-only base model. There is only real-world practical differentiation in the non-Dolby Vision versus HDR pictures largely on high-end TVs with excellent panel technology, so if your 4K TV is an economy or mid-range model from several years ago, you’re unlikely to see much differentiation in the pictures versus the Plus model and the full 4K model. The Plus model does, however, come with the Voice Remote and has the same massive library of streaming services, free live TV services in the form of the Roku Channel, and private listening in the form of the Roku smartphone app.</p>
<p>Each of these three models gives you access to the Roku platform which is still one of the best streaming interfaces. Installation takes just a minute or two: <strong>stick the stick in your TV’s HDMI port, connect it to your network and start viewing</strong>. compact size makes these sticks disappear completely behind your television with no apparent clutter.</p>
<p>With these aggressive discounts and the fact that non-Prime members have access to these deals, now is truly the perfect time to upgrade your streaming setup.</p>

Not disappointed, definitely excited, but concerned all the same.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mario_kart_8">Mario Kart 8</a>, you see, has become such an all-encompassing thing over the years, a sprawling collection of tracks and characters all brought together in a package that stands out for its no-nonsense focus on excellent karting action. And so it's hard, or it was hard, to see how on earth Nintendo would or could elevate it in any meaningful way.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067mlnqgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, the big gamble to attempt this necessary evolution is the open-world aspect. However, this addition breaks with the straightforward approach I so admire about past entries. I want to race first and foremost when I turn these games on. I want into a solo or multiplayer race as quickly as possible, in fact, and Mario Kart has always given me this, with Battle modes and side stuff out of the way, and the racing front and centre.</p>
<p>With the introduction of an open world, I feel like the series has been infiltrated to some extent by modern nonsense that it shouldn't feel the need to kowtow to. The slick and precise aspects that I enjoy most have been sunk in a mire of clutter and noise that I don't care for at all, that degrades and confuses the experience unnecessarily.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I'm not hating on Mario Kart World, let's be clear. On the track, it's an incredibly beautiful thing...But it's a game I've stopped playing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I'm not hating on Mario Kart World, let's be clear. On the track, it's an incredibly beautiful thing, with racing that undoubtedly puts it up top as the best-feeling of the entire franchise. That's worth your time, and then some. Of course it is, and I still rate it highly.</p>
<p>But it's a game I've stopped playing. I stopped playing fairly quickly, in fact, because the busy-ness of the open world — the feeling of having unfinished business and things to be done and checked off which an open world brings — puts me off. It wears me down, and it makes me feel like I'm...not playing the game properly? I probably need to chill out, but I can't; I'm a box-ticker and there are too many boxes needing wearily ticking.</p>
<p>Now, in this moment of very personal inner turmoil, as my worldview suddenly and irreversibly collapses under the weight of the knowledge that "maybe the new Mario Kart isn't really my cup of tea", who should present themselves as an unlikely hero? It could only be that wee guy. The wee blue hedgehog guy. From the movies. What's his name? Ah, yes, Sanic. Sanic the Hedgehogs.</p>
<h2>Skew-Whiffs Sonically Sorted</h2>
<p>Not for one second — and as much as I love me some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/sonic_and_all-stars_racing_transformed">Sonic Racing Transformed</a> — did I ever think that Team Sonic could bring it this good. But bring it this good is exactly what they've done.</p>

<p>If you're like me, a connoisseur who appreciates the handling of a car in ways in which most humans simply cannot, you may have an issue with previous Sonic karting efforts. There's always been something slightly off, something skew-whiff (like yer Eggman's moustache), about the handling of the vehicles. It's very slight — not game-ruining at all — but I've always felt a tankiness, a <em>heaviness</em> in the rear of the various karts that makes drifting, and switching directions whilst drifting, come off as a little undercooked and clunky compared to Mario's perfect handling. It was an issue that meant this series could never top the Italian smart-arse in my mind. Until now.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, you see, Team Sonic has finally resolved its handling woes. I can't find fault with the mechanics or handling here at all. Furthermore, as you play, you begin to realise that what at first can seem like messy chaos when transferring from the measured, 'opulent' vibe of Mario's races, is actually massively addictive, rewarding, and competitive karting that has Mario Kart World beaten all day long, thanks to those handling tweaks and a bunch of other things that make for races with bigger hooks to keep me engaged.</p>
<p>Now, before I dig in here, and for full transparency, as you'll be aware, the Switch 1 version of Sonic Racing Crossworlds is the only available version at the moment, with the Switch 2 port due to drop around "Holiday 2025". As a result, I purchased the PS5 version first off, and that's where I've spent most of my time with the game, so it's hardly surprising that I'm being dazzled a little by the fancy graphics, which Mario Kart World can't really compete with. I'm taking this factor into account, be sure of it.</p>

<p>I've also picked the game up on Switch, where it doesn't look quite as nice (still looks fair enough, mind) and targets 30fps, which, for me personally, is perfectly fine. Even with these concessions, though, it's still beating MKW (and should do even more so when the Switch 2 edition drops) because it gives me races and an overall setup that keep me way more involved and interested.</p>
<h2>Mini Motivations Make Motoring Magic</h2>
<p>I've mentioned the open world not being my cup of tea, and that's an obvious sort of criticism to make - it's also a part of the game that's very easy to ignore, so MKW can survive that impact, but there's more to it than this. The real surprise has been that, on the track, Sonic is also doing more for me this time out, too.</p>
<p>Sonic Racing Crossworlds presents races which are split into an opening and final lap raced on the currently chosen course, with the middle lap seeing racers teleported to another track entirely. The racer in first position at the end of lap one gets to choose from either a random Crossworlds portal to any of the game's circuits or one that's been selected by the CPU in advance.</p>
<figure data-uuid="ad416a712da10"><a title="Sonic Racing Crossworlds vs MKW" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ad416a712da10/sonic-racing-crossworlds-vs-mkw.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / SEGA</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, immediately on starting a race, you've got this well-observed gameplay loop where you focus on getting a nice boost start, just like Mario Kart, and then you careen around corners, drifting and shooting off the game's fun assortment of items, with designs on being numero uno, so you get to choose where lap two occurs.</p>
<p>It creates a nice drive (no pun intended, I would never), a focus for the opening lap, which is then replaced by the fun of navigating whatever is thrown at you for lap two. It helps, as well, that the teleporting crossovers between worlds just look and feel cool to drive into, and they even managed to get all this tastiness looking and running okay on Switch. I've got high hopes for the Switch 2 upgrade.</p>
<p>There's an excitement created by the switching of venues, then, and it's enhanced further by excellent track design that cleverly digs down deep into Sega's unique, arcade-heavy vibe. These are the sorts of circuits I expect to race on when I'm inside a huge moving arcade unit, pumping my coins in for another shot. You know the sort of thing, great big dinosaurs running into the screen one moment and jets taking off the next.</p>
<p>All of this is offset by the exact kind of cheesy arcade announcer I could listen to all day. It feels urgent and exciting, retro and modern all at once. Oh, and the soundtrack! I don't have time or space here, but it's a perfect accompaniment to that '90s SEGA arcade vibe I'm harping on about. It just screams "VIDEO GAMES!!!" very loudly from every pore.</p>
<figure data-uuid="754afe2764a6e"><a title="Sonic Racing Crossworlds vs MKW" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/754afe2764a6e/sonic-racing-crossworlds-vs-mkw.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Drivin' In A Tweaker's Paradise</h2>
<p>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds then goes on to dominate when it comes to customisation and strategising. You have licence cards that upgrade and unlock to give you a total of six slots, and these slots can be filled with unlockable boons and boosts. Kickstart your race in Monster Truck mode to crush everyone at the starting line, give yourself a trio of boosts to get going, or spend the spaces tweaking your speed, acceleration, power, and handling to give yourself an edge. There are loads of options.</p>
<p>These four categories are also how the myriad car parts, which can be freely mixed and matched, are organised to browse through. Sonic, as an example, starts the game with his signature fast blue car, firmly in the speed category. As you play, you earn tickets to spend on front and back parts that can be combined to mix up traits and create cool-looking vehicles. There are also custom jobs, paint sets, and a surprising variety of decals.</p>
<p>As a result of all of this, and only a few days after having picked the game up, I've already cleared every single stage and cup, and grabbed every red coin along the way. I haven't even tried all the cups in Mario Kart World yet, and this is all the concrete proof that I need. I'm enjoying Crossworlds way, way more than World.</p>
<figure data-uuid="18b3732c2b292"><a title="Sonic Racing Crossworlds vs MKW" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/18b3732c2b292/sonic-racing-crossworlds-vs-mkw.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oh, and I must mention, in Crossworlds' cups, if I screw up in a race, I can pay a small fee to restart that race, rather than painfully replay the whole cup again. This is big news for angry people and/or anyone short on time. (I believe there is an overlap between these two groups of people.) More seriously, though, I can make actual progress thanks to this, which again keeps me committed to playing. I haven't mentioned the online stuff, or the play park where you can do battle modes and races that tweak the rules, and that's because I haven't really touched that yet - certainly not enough to comment on.</p>
<p>But that's the thing, even without comparing and contrasting every facet of these two games in-depth as we could do, Crossworlds easily wins out for me. There are no big, long, straight tracks to get bored on here, no being pulled out of the parts that excite and make you sweat to go complete a puzzle. I'll take speedy and slick Crossworlds portal action over the rallies' weirdly bland transitional phases and open world of Mario's latest all day.</p>
<h2>This Ain't No Roster Imposter</h2>

<p>In the interests of being fair, I will currently give Mario Kart World a win in its character roster. It's very hard to beat Mario and co. However, this is something which may also change, as Crossworlds has a whole bunch of very silly DLC characters en route, each with their own vehicle parts to add to the mix.</p>
<p>So, you see, there is a future to look forward to for Sega racers. A future in which Ichiban Kasuga speeds around Kronos Island in SpongeBob SquarePants' burger car. If that doesn't get your pulse racing, you may well be dead.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Of course, everyone's gonna have their favourite between these two, and we'll see plenty more debate when the Switch 2 version eventually shows up, I'm sure. But what's your favourite between the pair so far? Are you veering on the side of Mario and his open-world fanciness, or Sonic and his portals to other dimensions?</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-gaming-laptop-40gb-ddr5-ram-ryzen-5-1tb-is-62-off-amazon-is-cleaning-house-like-never-before-2000631818</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo-gaming-laptop-40gb-ddr5-ram-ryzen-5-1tb-is-62-off-amazon-is-cleaning-house-like-never-before.1316851/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming laptops usually come at high prices, and for anything decent in the market below $1,500, it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack. These systems have powerful hardware to support demanding games and creative tasks and that’s why they’re normally that costly. But if you need the best of everything without wasting your savings, Amazon’s <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> is the place to make it happen.</p>
<p>This Lenovo gaming laptop that is equipped with an <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4489/">AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor, 40GB DDR5 RAM, and 1TB PCIe SSD is literally amazing today: It was lowered from its regular price of $1,699 to only $649</a>, translating to a <strong>massive 62% off</strong> and setting an all-time low for the configuration.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4489/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Gaming That Challenges Higher-End Machines in Performance</h2>
<p>The AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor is the power behind this laptop’s fantasstic performance. With <strong>6 cores and 12 threads running at 3.3GHz base clocks that turbo up to 4.55GHz</strong>, this chip edges ahead of Intel’s i7-11800H in several use cases. What does it mean for you? High-definition video editing becomes doable instead of infuriating, programming development environments launch and respond quickly even with multiple programs launched at once and tasks such as rendering in interior design or 3D modeling become doable. The 3MB L2 cache and 16MB L3 cache enable the processor to quickly call up frequently used data and minimize lag when you’re in the middle of intense multitasking sessions.</p>



<p>Complementing this processor is <strong>40GB of DDR5 SDRAM</strong> which is a huge improvement from previous DDR4 technology. DDR5 is faster for data transfer and more efficient with power so your laptop stays cooler and more quickly processes information. With 40GB readily available, you can use memory-intensive programs such as <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/adobe-premiere-pro">Adobe Premiere</a>, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/adobe-photoshop">Photoshop</a>, or several virtual machines and never see slowdowns. <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/google-chrome">Chrome</a> users who have dozens of tabs up will love never again confronting that nasty “page unresponsive” message. The <strong>1TB PCIe NVMe SSD is storage that is blazingly fast</strong>, boots Windows in seconds, loads games near-instantly, and leaves you plenty of space for your entire game library.</p>



<p>The 15.3-inch display provides 1920×1200 resolution for a little more vertical screen real estate compared to typical Full HD displays. This additional vertical screen real estate is priceless when editing documents. Color accuracy is ensured from wide viewing angles with the IPS panel and you work just fine in brightly lit rooms or in front of windows due to the 300 nits brightness rating. Eye strain is lessened during long gaming sessions or working marathons with the anti-glare finish. With 45% NTSC color gamut coverage and a refresh rate of 60Hz, the display navigates daily gaming effortlessly. C<strong>asual to intense gaming, esports games, and creative programs are taken in their stride by the built-in AMD Radeon 660M processor</strong>.</p>
<p>Port selection accounts for all contingencies: two USB-A ports functioning at USB 3.2 Gen 1 levels (5Gbps) for the traditional accessories, one USB-C that doubles for both USB Power Delivery 3.0 for fast charging and DisplayPort 1.2 for attaching high-resolution external displays, an HDMI 1.4 for more display connections, a headphone jack for audio equipment and an SD card slot for speedy file imports from cameras.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Professional is backed up by enterprise-grade features such as BitLocker encryption and remote desktop, while the built-in Copilot AI PC feature is your intelligent aide available from its dedicated keyboard shortcut. There is even a 720p HD camera that has a privacy shutter for users who value their security.</p>
<p>With this Prime Day deal on Amazon, you’re getting gaming-level performance at a cost below that of the majority of business budget laptops.</p>

<figure data-uuid="44f933b646f40"><a title="Teleroboxer - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/44f933b646f40/teleroboxer-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello folks, and welcome back to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-laytons-mystery-journey-katrielle-and-the-millionaires-conspiracy-switch">Last week</a>, we looked at the ridiculously titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/laytons_mystery_journey_katrielle_and_the_millionaires_conspiracy_-_deluxe_edition">Layton's Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires' Conspiracy - Deluxe Edition</a> for the Nintendo Switch, and it was the Japanese box art design that won the day with 68% of the vote. Well done!</p>
<p>Now, we're going back to the Virtual Boy to check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/teleroboxer">Teleroboxer</a>, one of the titles confirmed to be making a comeback when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/virtual-boy-is-being-added-to-nintendo-switch-online">the console is added to NSO in the new year</a>. Released in 1995, it was director Yoshio Sakamoto's next game following the critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> in 1994. Sadly, Teleroboxer didn't enjoy much acclaim by comparison, but it certainly has its fans.</p>
<p>No European art for this one, naturally, so it's a heated duel between North America and Japan – let's get to it!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:3891,47822 @ 1759669464 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="2a547d3099f01"><a title="Teleroboxer - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2a547d3099f01/teleroboxer-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14254-teleroboxer">Nintendo/LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whether you opt for the North American design or the Japanese design probably hinges on one question: do you like colour? If the answer is "yes", then you'll probably like what we've got here. The blues, the yellows, the reds, it all just comes together wonderfully to create one of the most eye-catching designs we've ever seen.</p>
<p>Even if the game itself isn't a masterpiece, this artwork goes <em>hard</em>.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="84b7334b1d8c4"><a title="Teleroboxer - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/84b7334b1d8c4/teleroboxer-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14254-teleroboxer">Nintendo/LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Japan's approach, meanwhile, is a lot more subdued. The characters are still striking pretty cool poses, and there's definitely a bit of symmetry going on with the Western design as a result. Nevertheless, while we've still got a bit of red and yellow going on, the blue has been almost eliminated completely for a much darker, moodier piece.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-might-go-full-third-party-leaving-hardware-for-good-rumor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-might-be-going-full-third-party-and-leaving-hardware-for-good-%E2%80%93-rumor.1316827/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft already garnered headlines last week <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when it announced a 50% increase in the pricing of Xbox Game Pass</a>. According to a new rumor, though, the company's strategy may be shifting to an even greater degree than people imagined.</p>



<p>The rumor comes from leaker SneakersSO, who previously leaked Xbox's initial plans to start porting its games to other consoles. <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/microsoft-revamps-xbox-game-pass-plans-and-hikes-ultimate-to-29-99-a-month-ultimate-gets-ubisoft-classics-and-more.1688694/post-270866538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a post on the NeoGAF board</a>, the leaker wrote that the plans to actually produce the next Xbox hardware went from being 'really concrete' to 'up in the air', which was confusing to say the least, because the time to pull the trigger on the manufacturing for the new console isn't that far. The goal was to begin in 2026 (likely for a 2027 launch), but the leaker makes it sound like Microsoft is not so sure about going through with that any longer. </p>



<p>The reason is that <em>'the future of Xbox is software publishing, with a significantly honed-in focus on profitable IPs (CoD, WoW, Minecraft, Candy Crush, Forza Horizon), Cloud gaming being the home of the 'Xbox platform', transitioning GamePass into basically becoming the point of entry subscription for xCloud access (which will continue to drive its price tag higher by the way, they aren't done there just yet either), and releasing their software on any device that has a marketplace and users willing to buy their titles.'</em></p>



<p>Essentially, Microsoft would be pulling a SEGA, exiting the console market for good. While that makes sense in a number of ways (Xbox hardware sales <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-boosts-microsot-q3-gaming-revenue-xbox-consoles-sales-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been declining</a> for years now), Microsoft has absolutely promised its fans a new console generation and a powerful one at that, with Xbox president claiming it would bring the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest technical leap ever seen from generation to generation</a>. </p>



<p>Moreover, less than four months ago, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-announces-multi-year-deal-with-amd-to-power-next-gen-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed a multi-year partnership with AMD</a> to make next-generation devices, including consoles, handhelds, and cloud. Now, they could probably renegotiate the agreement with AMD if need be and exclude the console part, but Xbox fans would not take it well to suddenly hear that there will be no more consoles produced by their favorite brand, especially as it could also mean them losing access to all the games in their libraries, spanning entire generations through backward compatibility.</p>



<p>Now, this rumor is still to be taken with a grain of salt. That said, The Verge's Tom Warren was just featured <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/QbDEtYux6fE?t=4867s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the Xbox Era podcast</a> claiming that SneakersSO actually does know about Microsoft's gaming plans:</p>



<p><em>I will say he knows a lot of what goes on internally, I don't think he's a bad source. I think he knows a lot.</em></p>

<p>Galaxy 2 has already topped the eShop charts</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> released for the Switch this week, and we've now got some eShop chart data, revealing which entry is the most popular so far.</p>
<p>Perhaps, unsurprisingly, it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> – which is currently at the very top of Nintendo's digital store chart in the US, with the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> game placing third on the chart in this same region, behind the recent release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a>. If you go back to Switch purchases, in general, on the same storefront, it seems the Galaxy pack is still the most popular option.</p>
<p>In the UK and Japan, it's currently the same situation when it comes to the standalone releases – with Super Mario Galaxy 2 in top spot and the original outing in third place.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, this is just three regions, and the positions of each of these titles and the bundle may be different in other locations around the globe. The original Super Mario Galaxy game was also previously featured in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a>, so many Switch players already revisited it in 2020.</p>
<p>All of this has got us wondering – did you end up buying a physical copy, or did you go the download route or mix it up? So vote in our poll and let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>And if you haven't already read (or watched) our Nintendo Life review, be sure to check it out. This new entry also contains some enhancements and extras on the Switch 2, such as a resolution boost and amiibo support.</p>

It doesn't feature an auto document feeder like more expensive products, and print speeds are on the slower side of things (10 pages per minute black, 7 pages per minute color), but its ability to print, scan, and copy should make it a versatile choice for most home offices.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT8ZJ7ZC?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CT8ZJ7ZC?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT8ZJ7ZC?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">HP Officejet Pro 8125e Wireless Printer (Color)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT8ZJ7ZC?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CT8ZJ7ZC?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT8ZJ7ZC?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">$110 (was $222)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The HP Office Jet Pro 8125e is a bit more robust than the 6155e.

            <p>
Remember how the upcoming extraction shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-is-a-co-op-sci-fi-robot-shooter-arriving-next-year">meant to launch in 2022</a>? Good times! And quite different times, because back then the game was PvE, seeing you and a few friends take on some nasty bots. Three years on, the game has shifted into a PvPvE experience, and the reason for 1. such a lengthy delay, and 2. a complete change in what players actually do is a simple one: the game was "not fun."
</p>
<p>
This isn't me being snarkily mean or anything, these are the words of Embark Studios' CEO Peter Soderlund himself. Speaking to Edge (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/the-5th-most-wishlisted-game-on-steam-ex-battlefield-devs-extraction-shooter-arc-raiders-was-delayed-3-years-because-they-realized-it-sucked-this-game-is-not-fun/">GamesRadar</a>), Sonderlund spoke of what it took to get the game to where it is now, explaining, "We loved every aspect of what we were trying to design. But we came to the conclusion, after quite a long time: 'Guys, this game is not fun.'"
</p>
<p>
To be specific, it apparently was more a case of not being fun enough than outright bad or boring. This then led to the team going back to figure out what the game's fundamentals were only six months before its supposed launch, and lo and behold, the PvPvE gameplay it now has was born.
</p>
<p>
Embark devs features an array of PvP pedigree, including some that have worked on both Battlefield and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-battlefront">Star Wars: Battlefront</a> (shame there's not a third Battle game to list here), but many apparently felt ready to move on from PvP as a format. So the 'vE' element really helped to mix things up, especially because the game also took some cues from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> with its massive enemies to take down, although in this case they're big ole robots instead.
</p><p>
And now, all this time later, there's less than a month to go until we find out whether it ultimately works for the masses or not. I'm not big on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a>, but I'll admit the vibes have piqued my curiosity at the very least. My biggest concern, and perhaps the game's too, is it being an extraction shooter. Those that love 'em, love 'em, but they're truly only really for the sickos right now. Let's see if Arc Raiders can take the genre to the mainstream!
</p>
<p>
Arc Raiders launches October 30th.

I could probably quite safely bet some money that many of you are still happily ticking away at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, but for those of you that would like newer pastures to get your TTRPG fix in video game form, there's some good news. The board game-esque tactical RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demeo-x-dungeons-and-dragons-battlemarked">Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</a> at long last has a release date!
</p>
<p>
You won't be waiting long for it, as it's slated for release this coming November 20th. No pound sterling or euro pricing for the game yet, but in USD it'll set you back $30 - it's also cross-platform and cross-device compatible, so no biggie if your friends aren't on PC! And if it being more Dungeons &amp; Dragons something or other, relatively affordable, and cross-everything isn't enough for you, when Steam Next Fest kicks off next October 13th you'll be able to try out a demo for yourself.

<p>
This demo lets you try out a couple of encounters, with four heroes to choose from, including Jessix, a "human ranger seeking retribution" that is apparently a new reveal alongside this release date announcement! Plus, playing the demo will unlock an exclusive cosmetic for your d20s in the full game. Free stuff! Nobody hates free stuff!
</p><p>
If you haven't even heard of Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked before, well, it's a crossover between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demeo">Demeo</a>, which is also a fantasy, board game-esque tactical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, albeit set in its own world, with (you guessed it) D&amp;D! You move little figures around a board while going through different campaigns, a big selling point being that it has online multiplayer, something Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked will also have. And you'll be able to play it in VR too if that takes your fancy!
</p>
<p>
Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked is out November 20th, later this year.

            <p>
There's a strong chance a good few of you out there saw that initial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingmakers">Kingmakers</a> trailer from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingmakers-mashes-the-medieval-era-with-modern-weapons-and-its-trailer-is-a-viral-sensation">last year</a> and thought "I'll take a piece of that pie." You came pretty close to getting your slice too, as it was due out next week on October 8th… except the devs have announced that it's been delayed. Indefinitely.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2109770/view/543369627969783348?l=english">Steam news post</a>, Redemption Road apologised for not meeting the release date before explaining why the delay is taking place. "In short: it's an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game, and we don't want to cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out the door earlier." The post notes how the team is 80% engineers, and that they set out to make the game with a goal of making sure the game runs at a true 60 frames per second even on midrange PCs, "without the need for fake frames."
</p>
<p>
Redemption Road further explained all the things that supposedly makes the game so complicated, with battles featuring "tens of thousands of soldiers," and there being "giant 6 story castles where every room can be entered and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed… Every mission takes place in a massive map that each player on the server is free to explore - with or without their own personal army of thousands. We set out to do all of this, with full drop-in/drop-out 4 player multiplayer support, and we have. We just need a bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it."
</p>
<p>
As mentioned, this is an indefinite delay, there was no suggestion from Redemption Road as to when it could possibly come out. Still, a delay less than a week from release is pretty surprising just because of how close it actually is. Looking at the game itself, I do feel less surprised.
</p><p>
There really are just a metric tonne of NPCs on screen at any one time, there's anachronistic guns, tanks, and cars, you can build stuff, a lot of moving parts are clearly at play here! Good look to the devs.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> has been out for - hang on, let me just check my calendar… crikey, that long? - four years now, and despite being a behemoth of a game that I could never imagine seeing absolutely all of, I imagine there are some of you out there that have and crave new ways to go about that. So how about a mod! One which doesn't exactly turn you into Geralt of Rivia, but does at least let you fight like everybody's favourite witcher.
</p>
<p>
This particular mod comes from therealsqueam (as opposed to the fake squeam you've been hearing about), and is quite simply titled "<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/8707">Witcher - Moveset Mod</a>" (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fight-like-a-witcher-in-elden-ring-thanks-to-this-ingenious-moveset-mod/">PCGamer</a>). There's even a little video showcasing the mod from therealsqueam that you can check out below, but I'll tell you the important bits here too. The mod has three main bits, essentially. You get two swords, one steel for dealing with a majority of enemies, the other silver for handling the undead, and for the third part there's signs, those witchery spells Geralt uses.
</p>

<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Witcher Moveset Showcase - Elden Ring" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vUTwY8X3u_M?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTwY8X3u_M" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
Both swords play the same, though they do come with different Ashes of War. The sword combat does admittedly move quite similarly to how Geralt does, there's a nice flow to it and almost a dancer-like quality as well.
</p>
<p>
Now, the signs. For Aard, using a little FP sends out a small shockwave, and charging it up results in a greater area of effect for more damage. Then there's Axii. When you're in range of an enemy, casting it on them will bring them to your side, though it does have a wind-up meaning you should exercise caution.
</p><p>
While you can typically be quite defensive in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>, that's not the case in The Witcher 3, so for that there's Quen. Using this one briefly raises poise and reduces damage, and light attacks won't affect you. After you've been hit five times, it explodes for some added damage too. 
</p>
<p>
Igni is the steel sword's Ash of War and is pretty simple, you just shoot out fire! But you can also add a flame buff to your sword. Switching to the silver sword lets you use the final sign, Yrden, which does a couple different things too. One is placing a sign on the ground that heals you, which also lures in enemies, dealing lethal damage to revenants and wraiths. You can also cast a holy buff on your sword to prevent undead reviving.
</p>
<p>
It's a very neat mod overall! Clearly well thought out and put together, and seems worth a punt if you like the idea of a more witchery take on Elden Ring.

              <p>We’re sure you’re already aware of this, but the next three months are basically one huge shopageddon. Halloween candy, costumes, and decorations lead straight into the biggest food shopping week of the year before Thanksgiving, following immediately by Black Friday and Cyber Week. Normally that would mean either a long, grueling trek of in-person shopping, or online shopping with so many tabs open your laptop cries uncle.</p>
<p>Or, you could do it all in one location, either online or in any of over 600 location nationwide, when you get a Sam’s Club membership. Getting access to the all-in-one warehouse giant should come at a premium cost just for the convenience and amazing prices, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4484/">right now at StackSocial you can get a one-year Club membership for just $15.</a> That even less than the usual discounted price offered by StackSocial, and you’ll easily recoup that $15 just in the gas you’d burn through hitting all those shopping stops if you weren’t a Sam’s Club member.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4484/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

Everything on your Black Friday and Cyber Week lists — the latest tech gear, home goods, clothes, toys, even the tree and decorations? Again, check. All you need is a membership to have in-person or online access to it all, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4484/">that’s just $15 right now at StackSocial</a>.</p>

Sam’s Club has amazing services like auto tire replacement, pharmacy, vision and hearing services, travel, custom cakes and cupcakes, even home installations and warranties, and all at amazing members-only prices.</p>



<h2>Rewards Await</h2>
<p>Sam’s Club pricing and utterly incredible inventory and range of goods and services create the ultimate one-stop shopping destination, and the more you use your membership, the more you get back in the form of Sam’s Cash. Each Sam’s Club purchase earns you 2% back in Sam’s Cash, which adds up quickly to cut down on your next shopping excursion or membership renewal in a big way.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4484/">This $15 offer for a year of Club membership at Sam’s Club</a> is good for new members and anyone who has joined within the past 6 months, and there is a 1 membership purchase limit per person.
