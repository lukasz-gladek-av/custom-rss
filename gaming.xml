			<p>A new God of War Ragnarok patch is now live for the PC version of the game, improving AMD FSR 3 frame generation and fixing a variety of issues.</p>
<p>Patch 4 focuses on fixing several issues, including crashes, authentication flow, and texture issues, which will no longer unload while looking at the menu for a set amount of time and won't be shown loading in while using fast travel through the Realm Between Realms.</p>
<p>The new God of War Ragnarok patch also fixes an NVIDIA memory leak issue caused by switching between different Frame Generation settings. The patch, as mentioned above, also brings some AMD FSR 3 frame generation improvements, fixing flickering in the pause menu, performance and frame pacing issues, and a small memory leak caused by turning it on and off. Rounding up the changes brought by the patch, which can be found detailed in full<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2322010/view/4681018807420990578?l=english"> here</a>, are Steam Deck offline mode and DualSense controller fixes.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarok finally launched on PC last month after almost two years since its console release, and the port is definitely a solid one, although it has some <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-worse-playstation-5/">issues</a> that make it not look as good as the PlayStation 5 version. The port also doesn't offer many options to scale beyond the PS5 version's Quality Mode.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarok is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4 worldwide. You can learn more about the latest entry in the series by checking out our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/"> review.</a></p>

            <p>
Epic Games is now "financially sound" after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-is-reportedly-laying-off-900-employees">shedding around 830 staff during last year's mass layoff</a>, founder Tim Sweeney has said. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking last night during a stage presentation at Unreal Fest, Sweeney briefly acknowledged the job losses as the show opened, before going on to mention last year's high watermark of engagement with the hugely-lucrative <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, that featured a massively successful throwback "OG" season. 
</p>
<p>
"Last year's Unreal Fest began with some sad news," Sweeney said. "The company had to get its finances in order, and we just had some major layoffs. We spent the last year rebuilding and also really executing solidly on all fronts.

<p>
"I'm happy to tell you now that the company is financially sound, and that Fortnite and the Epic Games Store have hit new records in concurrency and success. Fortnite hit 110 million monthly active users last holiday, an all-time peak."
</p>
<p>
It's worth noting that Fortnite player numbers have dropped back down since then, and the launch of last year's new modes have had mixed success, though <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a> in particular remains popular.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games remains hugely busy, with ongoing work across the ubiquitous Unreal Engine and its UEFN toolset for building and launching games in Fortnite, the growth of Epic Game Store, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-launches-major-new-lawsuit-in-app-store-fight-this-time-against-samsung-and-google">fresh legal battle announced this week with Google and Samsung</a>.
</p>
<p>
On UEFN, new modes developed by Epic Games using the technology for Fortnite were mentioned - an all-new experience set to arrive in the game this year, and a new version of the popular Fortnite Reload mode, due in the next few weeks.
</p>
<p>
And on the Epic Game Store, a new "Launch Everywhere with Epic" offer will trim Epic's existing royalty from five to 3.5 percent from 1st January 2025, to incentivise launching on its storefront. This will apply to games available on Epic's platform first or at the same time as other platforms such as Steam.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/palworld-is-coming-to-mobile-with-pubg-publisher-krafton-securing-global-license-for-the-title/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Krafton is best known for publishing PUBG Battlegrounds, the game that transformed the battle Royale genre and paved the way for its popularity. South Korea continues to expand and invest in new technologies and platforms. Now, the gaming giant has announced that it will partner up with Pocketpair to bring its popular survival crafting game Palworld to mobile devices and has secured licensing agreements for the extension of the game to mobile platforms.</p>
<h2>Krafton has announced today about signing a licensing agreement with Pocketpair to bring Palword to mobile devices</h2>
<p>Pocketpair is increasingly focusing on expanding its Palworld, a highly anticipated open-world survival game, to Xbox, PC, and PS5. It is now taking the leap in the mobile gaming industry with the help of Krafton, a South Korean game publisher that gained massive popularity for its PUBG Battlegrounds.</p>
<p>In a<a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-%ed%8c%b0%ec%9b%94%eb%93%9c-%eb%aa%a8%eb%b0%94%ec%9d%bc-%ea%b2%8c%ec%9e%84-%ea%b8%80%eb%a1%9c%eb%b2%8c-%eb%9d%bc%ec%9d%b4%ec%84%a0%ec%8a%a4/"> press release</a>, Krafton announced that it would secure a licensing agreement for Palworld's intellectual property (IP) to bring the game to mobile platforms. The game would be developed by PUBG STUDIOS under Krafton, who would mimic the game's main elements and make it suitable for the mobile environment. In the press release, the company explains:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It plans to faithfully reinterpret and implement the original’s main fun elements to fit the mobile environment. The project will be handled by the development team of ‘PUBG STUDIOS,’ a creative studio under Krafton.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Palworld's <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-is-now-the-most-popular-game-on-xbox-game-pass/">expansion</a> to Xbox and PC has already helped the company gain 25 million players and sell over 15 million copies, and the game even has secured the third-highest number of concurrent users on Steam. It further extended its platforms by making its debut on PS5 this September. The game owes its popularity to the enticing gameplay that keeps the players hooked and the monster-breeding mechanics incorporated into a charming world.</p>
<p>Krafton and Pocketpair partnering up to bring Palworld to mobile devices would help gain a wider player base and can also aid the company with its leading position in the survival crafting category.&nbsp; Although Pocketpair has managed to gain massive popularity, especially after its continuous expansion, it is not entirely a breeze as Nintendo has recently sued the company for patent infringement.</p>
<p>Palworld is currently available on PC, Xbox Series XIS consoles, and PlayStation 5 and can be accessed through Xbox Game Pass. Soon, players will be able to enjoy unique gaming on their mobile devices.</p>

No release window was mentioned.</p><p>PUBG Studios is the development arm behind the phenomenally successful battle royale as well as its equally successful mobile versions. Indeed, PUBG Mobile has had over one billion players since launching in March 2018.</p><p>The announcement of Palworld mobile comes hot on the heels of Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s joint lawsuit against Pocketpair for alleged patent infringement, and the subsequent launch of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-ps5-release-postponed-in-japan-amid-nintendo-pokmon-patent-lawsuit">Palworld on PlayStation 5 everywhere except Japan</a>, where the lawsuit was filed.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-developer-pocketpair-responds-to-nintendo-pokmon-lawsuit-says-its-unaware-of-the-patents-its-accused-of-infringing"><u>Pocketpair has</u> insisted</a> it has no idea which patents it’s accused of infringing, but experts have pointed to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-vs-palworld-killer-patent-may-be-about-the-mechanic-of-catching-pokmon"><u>“killer patent” that revolves around the mechanic of catching Pokémon itself</u></a>. Last week, one patent expert said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-lawsuit-shows-just-how-seriously-nintendo-views-the-threat-of-palworld-patent-expert-says">the lawsuit shows “just how seriously Nintendo views the threat of Palworld.”</a></p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Palworld vs. Pokémon Comparison</h3></div></output><p>After Palworld’s huge launch earlier this year on PC and Xbox, comparisons were made between Palworld’s Pals and Pokémon, with some accusing Pocketpair of "ripping off" Pokémon designs. But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have gone down the patent route.</p><p>It is worth noting that Palworld <em>does</em> include a mechanic that involves throwing a ball-like object (called a Pal Sphere) at monsters out in a field to capture them, similar to the mechanic seen in the 2022 Nintendo Switch exclusive <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus"><u>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</u></a>, and this may prove the key to the lawsuit.</p><p>Palworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC earlier this year, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-massive-profits-are-too-big-for-a-studio-with-our-size-to-handle"><u>couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated</u></a>.</p><p>Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip"><u>signing a deal with Sony</u></a> to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket Images</h3></div></output><p>While the Pokémon games are mostly at home on consoles, Nintendo has launched a number of spin-offs aimed at other devices, including mobile. <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon GO</a> has seen enormous success since launching in 2016, generating billions of dollars in revenue. There’s also <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-unite">Pokémon Unite</a>, a MOBA released for mobile and Nintendo Switch, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-sleep">Pokémon Sleep</a>, a sleep-tracking game that rewards the user with Pokémon depending on the quality of their sleep.</p><p>Indeed, a new Pokémon mobile game is right around the corner: <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a>, a mobile version of the Pokemon TCG, launches October 30, 2024.</p><p>Pocketpair has said it will begrudgingly investigate the patent infringement claims while continuing to update Palworld despite the lawsuit, and apologized to players left concerned about the future of the game.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Two F-Zero games are headed to Nintendo's Switch Online subscription, including a previously Japan-only release.</p>
<p>Both games launched on the Game Boy Advance and will be available on Switch from 11th October.</p>
<p>The first is F-Zero: GP Legend, which followed GBA launch game F-Zero: Maximum Velocity and was released in Europe in 2004. It plays similarly to the SNES original, but includes a Story mode based on the anime of the same name.</p>

<p>The second is F-Zero Climax, a sequel to GP Legend that was previously only available in Japan, also released in 2004. It's more of an expansion than a full sequel, but is notable for its Course Editor that allows players to create their own tracks using specific pieces.</p>
<p>F-Zero Climax was the last release in the series for 19 years, until F-Zero 99 arrived on Switch Online last year.</p>
<p>Speaking of, F-Zero 99 has received a new update with additional content that's available today.</p>
<p>There's a new Grand Prix Ace League, five new tracks (including some from the Satellaview), new machine decals, and an expanded Practice Mode. Additionally, some balance tweaks have been made to the Wild Goose and Fire Stingray machines.</p>
<p>Nintendo is also holding a one-year anniversary event, where players can earn 12 anniversary badges, backdrops, borders, and emotes.</p> <div>

<p>I enjoyed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/f-zero-99-feels-like-a-battle-royale-in-a-pinball-machine">F-Zero 99 when it was released last September</a>, describing it as "a battle royale in a pinball machine".</p>
<p>It's great to see Nintendo updating the game further and including more games from the series in its Switch Online offering. Now all we need is a proper brand new game - wishful thinking?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ghost of Yōtei, the newly revealed follow-up to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, will have a less repetitive open world.</p>
<p>Sucker Punch's Nate Fox and Jason Connell, creative directors on Ghost of Tsushima, were interviewed by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/arts/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sequel-playstation.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes">The NY Times</a> to discuss the sequel, due out next year on PS5.</p>
<p>"One challenge that comes with making an open-world game is the repetitive nature of doing the same thing over again," said Connell. "We wanted to balance against that and find unique experiences."</p>

<p>Indeed, the first game was criticised for its repetitive activities used to fill out its open world. With Yotei, new protagonist Atsu will be able to master firearms in addition to melee weapons, and players will have greater control over her story.</p>
<p>Ghost of Yōtei will be a story of "underdog vengeance", as Atsu travels across grasslands and tundras.</p>
<p>That setting was inspired by two research trips by Sucker Punch to northern Japan, with the view of Mount Yōtei across Lake Toya inspiring awe. "I sat there for two hours just staring at the mountain," said Connell. "It was stunning."</p>
<p>The Shiretoko National Park, in the northeast of Hokkaido, also proved inspirational. "Inside the park, you have to watch a video telling you about the dangers of bears," said Fox. "Being in this incredibly beautiful park with jagged cliffs and water, yet all the time being aware there were dangerous bears, was electrifying.</p>
<p>"We strive to bring that into the video game - that feeling of danger."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reveals-ghost-of-yotei-the-follow-up-to-ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Yōtei was unveiled at Sony's recent PlayStation State of Play</a>. The trailer introduced Atsu and has something of a Western vibe to it, set a few hundred years after Ghost of Tsushima.</p>
<p>"To create something fresh but familiar, we looked beyond Jin Sakai’s story and the island of Tsushima, and shifted our focus to the idea of the Ghost instead," wrote Sucker Punch communications manager Andrew Goldfarb on the PlayStation Blog.</p>
<p>"At Sucker Punch we love origin stories, and we wanted to explore what it could mean to have a new hero wearing a Ghost mask, and uncovering a new legend. This led us to Ghost of Yōtei: a new protagonist, a new story to unfold, and a new region of Japan to explore."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Look. Having basically sold both of my best standing legs to buy more <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/55690/kingdom-death-monster">Kingdom Death Monster</a> expansions, I can’t bemoan anyone spending silly amounts of money on whatever plastic tat makes them happy. But I love<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii"> Baldur’s Gate 3</a>, and it makes me sad to see all the wonderful art, writing, and acting that went into its characters reduced to $6 miniatures that look like their limbs would melt if I rubbed them between my thumb and forefinger.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/official-baldur-s-gate-3-miniatures-are-coming-but-the-origin-characters-will-set-you-back-50/">As spotted by PC Gamer</a>, WizKids have recently opened pre-orders for a set of greasy pre-painted fetishes based on Larian’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>. WizKids, of course, being the maker of supermarket-discount-aisle-ass toys but, ah, they’ve got a base on them so we can pretend they’re proper models and charge you accordingly. Moaning about toys now, are we Nic? Is this what the profession has been reduced to? And to that I say: videogames are toys anyway, they’re just slightly better at hiding it. Also, several of them are worth owning.</p>

<p>Look how they plas-acred my boy:</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>WizKids/Wotc</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Okay, sure. The sculpts aren’t totally terrible in terms of silhouettes and detail, but at $25 for four randomised figures, I expect something a bit more, uh, good. Astarion above is from the <a href="https://shop.wizkids.com/collections/pre-order-collection/products/d-d-icons-of-the-realms-baldurs-gate-3-character-boxed-set">bigger box set</a>, which features all six origin characters, plus withers, for $50, or about £38. You’d have to go to a third party retailer, admittedly, but you could buy an entire 40K Kill Team for that. Don’t like Warhammer? Fine. You know who’d look much, much better on your D&amp;D table, and also comes with four miniatures for about the same price? This guy:</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/boris.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Goblin King Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is Boris The Bunny Summoner from <a href="https://www.moonstonethegame.com/">Moonstone</a>, and he is but one of many beautiful miniatures they sell. Don’t like Boris? That’s fine. For the same price, you could get six halfling shieldmaidens riding walruses from <a href="https://ttcombat.com/collections/half-tilt">TT COMBAT</a>. You cannot tell me this wouldn't be a more fun dungeon encounter than Karlach's evil, waxy twin busting through a wall.</p>

</figure>
<p>Okay, one more. Check out this Owlbear <a href="https://zealotminiatures.com/product/owlbear/">from Zealot Miniatures</a>.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Zealot_Miniatures_Owlbear.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Zealot Miniatures</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now look at this actual bear from Wizkids:</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/wizkids-bear.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>WizKids/Wotc</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Yes, yes. Paint and glue. I know. Point still stands. This bear looks like it came from a bucket on the counter of a museum gift shop. If anyone from WizKids reads this then... 1. It’s satire. I’m writing about your stupid, defective products satirically, and 2. Do NOT send me any bears to try and prove their worth. I know where they've been.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Three hours of gameplay of the Until Dawn remake has leaked online ahead of the game’s official release on October 4, 2024.</p>



<p>Twitch streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2265248394" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nikolai7PT</a> leaked the three hours of Until Dawn Remake gameplay during a live stream on October 1, with the VOD still available to watch on his channel. </p>



<p>As expected, the VOD was soon posted to the /r/GamingLeaksAndRumours subreddit, where the game was criticized for being full-priced. User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BARD3NGUNN/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">/u/BARD3NGUNN</a> said, “I mean if Horizon can redo all it’s graphics, add in Duelsense features, and rerecord over 10hrs of motion capture to bring cutscenes upto modern standards and charge $10 to existing players, then realistically Until Dawn should have done the same.”</p>



<p>He continued, “It’s a great game, but there’s nothing this remaster can really do to improve the gameplay considering the limitations of the genre, and they’ve not expanded the story, so you’re basically left with a remaster of an interactive movie that’s releasing alongside the likes of Silent Hill, Dragon Ball, and Metaphor (all around a similar price physical) – it’s really a hard sell.”</p>



<p>In September, Until Dawn Remake developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ballistic-moon-layoffs/">Ballistic Moon announced </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ballistic-moon-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">t</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ballistic-moon-layoffs/">hat the studio had faced layoffs</a>, affecting an undisclosed number of developers. </p>



<p>Until Dawn currently has a film adaption in the works from PlayStation Productions and Sony’s Screen Gems, which is believed to be in early production.</p>



<p>In our guide here, you can see all <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-trophy-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">29 trophies coming to Until Dawn</a>.</p>

			<p>Sometimes, video games are complicated pieces of art. They have multiple layers of intertwining mechanics and themes and inspirations that are almost impossible to summarize unless you open with “okay so, this is a lot but basically…” and pray the person you’re talking to is a really good listener. Other times, though, video games aren’t like that at all. They’re like <em>Kill Knight. </em>You’re a knight. You kill. Done. I didn’t realise how long it’s been since I’ve had a simple, smooth, endless action game to sink my teeth into, but <em>Kill Knight </em>quickly reminded me<em>. </em>Combining the addictive “one more run” mentality of <em>Downwell </em>and <em>Devil Daggers </em>with <em>Hades-style </em>lightning-reflex combat and a sleek yet violent aesthetic has resulted in one of the most electrifying games of the year.</p>
<p><iframe title="KILL KNIGHT |  RELEASE DATE ANNOUNCEMENT" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6IXLFc0L4z0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s an obscure RPG-inspired artbook series I’m in love with called <em>Vermis. </em>Sold as a lost player guide to a forgotten roleplaying game, it’s full of haunting medieval-fantasy art where something is just always kind of… <em>off. </em>I’ve never seen that uncomfortable yet alluring aesthetic replicated anywhere else until I started playing <em>Kill Knight. </em>Menus and UI are sharp, yet the art and visual accompanying them give off a violent, zine-style setting where you have no idea where you are or what you’re doing but you still can’t help but love it. It’s a game full of barely comprehensible monster designs, equipment covered in spikes and blades, and menu backgrounds lifted straight from screen-printed sludge metal band shirts. I see a lot of new games come out where the mechanics are sharply defined or uniquely inventive, but they lack any sort of visual identity that matches that creativity. <em>Kill Knight </em>delivers on both.</p>


<p>Your goal is simple – survive wave-based combat in a constantly evolving arena, and if you do, you’ll unlock another arena with new visuals, enemies, and hazards to tackle. You’ve got a pretty simple set of abilities to use in order to achieve that, but they all feed into each other in a circular loop that keeps your brain firing on all cylinders as you play. You’ve got a standard gun attack, and when you need to reload you can tap three different buttons to activate three different Overdrive abilities.</p>


<p>Tap the fire button to Overdrive your primary weapon and activate a bonus ability, tap the melee button to activate a buffed melee attack, or tap the Absorb button to instantly suck up every dropped gem on the field. You can melee whenever you want, too, and melee kills earn you ammo for your heavy weapon. Absorbing can be done at any time at a slower rate, and when you absorb enough, you can unleash a special Heavy attack that will drop health pickups from anything it hits. Add on a quick-dash and a melee parry, and you’ve got a combat system that’s simple on paper, but complicated in execution.</p>
<p>My first few runs were rough. I’d focus too much on one attack type, or get so caught up watching enemy behaviour I wouldn’t even realize they had me overwhelmed until it was too late. When you’re on your toes and racking up kills, the combo meter isn’t just for flair – it feeds into a system that buffs all of your abilities the higher your racked-up combo gets. Systems like that where your score and combo are directly tied into beneficial gameplay systems, rather than just being for glory and bragging rights, are one of my favourite things to see in games. I rarely care how high my score is or how sick my combo gets, but when that stuff directly helps me survive more waves, you bet I’m paying attention.</p>

<p>If you fail a run, you’ll still earn some points and a spot on the leaderboard. Points can be hoarded to spend on unlocking new equipment, but you’ll be able to unlock all those tools even quicker if you successfully achieve their per-requisite missions during any run. It’s a really solid combination of parallel goals that always gave me something to focus on in each run. By the time I got comfortable with one combination of equipment and one stage, I was already ready to tackle another stage, or try out some new equipment, or both. I was kept on a consistent and constantly engaging pattern of unlocks through all five stages of the game, and I couldn’t get enough of it.</p>
<p><em>Kill Knight </em>is just a blast. Runs are quick, hectic, and satisfying even in defeat. It’s a lot to learn at first, but the second I overcame that learning curve I couldn’t put the game down until I saw it through to the end.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-patch-1-15-improves-performance-and-fixes-bugs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>FromSoftware has <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-115?utm_source=SM_Official&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_campaign=ER-PatchNotes115" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new Elden Ring patch today, updating the game to version 1.15. This is a small patch, but it contains a number of performance improvements and several bug fixes, as listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where the cutscene that plays when entering the Shadow Keep Church District would play again when re-entering the area.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where some of the Golem Fist weapon attacks would not deal damage when the player was affected by certain special effects.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Golem Fist weapon one-handed heavy attack power was lower than expected.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the Aspects of the Crucible: Thorns incantation from being cast when used in quick succession.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Smithing Talisman effect did not apply to some weapons’ throwing attacks.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the use of ashes in some areas of the Scadutree Avatar battle arena.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Rellana, Twin Moon Knight would sometimes perform unexpected actions when interacting with objects in the battle area.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that allowed Skills to be used in incorrect combinations with Weapons under certain circumstances.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused unexpected rendering and behavior of some enemies under certain circumstances.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where some sound effects did not play correctly.</li>
<li>Several performance improvements and other bug fixes.</li>
<li>Further fixes were added to the game’s end credits.</li>
</ul>
<p>The changelog of the Elden Ring patch also includes some tips on improving performance in case you're experiencing issues. According to the developers, the PlayStation 5 version of the game might improve frame rate stability by using the Rebuild Database option from the console's safe mode. PC players should check whether ray tracing has been automatically enabled; if so, they can disable it. Third-party apps that handle mouse behavior may also negatively impact the performance of Elden Ring. Lastly, FromSoftware says that the message 'inappropriate activity detected' may appear even mistakenly. In that case, PC users should verify the integrity of the files.</p>
<p>Elden Ring won't get any more expansions after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, but the studio will likely update it with minor patches for a while.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/smite-2">Smite 2</a> developers Hi-Rez Studios have laid off an unspecified number of workers, as part of what they call a "internal reorganization and reprioritization". The layoffs would ultimately benefit Smite 2, claimed the company's boss, who added that the cuts "disproportionally affect" those working on cosmetic skins and game "system features", as well as people in marketing and publishing roles.  </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Today, we’re making difficult but necessary changes to ensure Hi-Rez's long-term success, with a specific focus on positioning Smite 2 for a long and sustainable future," said CEO Stewart Chisham in <a href="https://x.com/schisam/status/1841072179028324382">a Xitter post</a> yesterday. </p>
<p>"This move follows a comprehensive review of our strategy and operations. In the game division, we have decided to concentrate our efforts entirely on Smite 2, outside of small teams supporting light updates for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paladins">Paladins</a> and Smite 1.</p>
<p>"While these changes are difficult, we believe they are necessary and we will emerge stronger from them."</p>
<p>The executive called the measures a "heartbreaking decision" reflecting "a failure in my leadership, and one for which I take personal accountability." It's not clear whether he means the act of "reprioritization" has affected himself somehow, or whether these are simply the usual words of empty sympathy from management often spoken in such times. </p>
<p>Hi-Rez also had a round of layoffs last year, with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/layoffs-expected-as-hi-rez-studios-restructures">30 people losing their jobs</a> as part of a larger restructuring that saw the company's uberstructure split into several different chunks, all overseen by a new corporate entity known as Hi-Rez Ventures. </p>
<p> As for the studio's focus shifting heavily towards Smite 2, that's sort of expected, and likely would have happened whether or not people lost their jobs. The game itself is grand enough, as MOBAs go, at least according to Matt Cox when he wrote our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/smite-2-early-access-review">Smite 2 early access review</a>. Although he did mention <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a> as an obvious and superior competitor, calling it "Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane". </p>
<p>The layoffs, meanwhile, happen amid a wider trend of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-iv-support-studio-hit-by-layoffs-putting-139-people-out-of-work-proving-that-embracers-restructuring-is-not-over">"restructuring"</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publishers-take-two-cancel-games-and-lay-off-hundreds-to-rationalize-their-pipeline">"rationalizing"</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-toss-another-650-jobs-onto-the-layoff-pyre-in-the-name-of-sustainable-future-growth">"aligning"</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ceo-andrew-wilson-tells-ea-staff-5-of-them-will-be-laid-off-via-empty-and-infuriating-email">"sunsetting"</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">"integrating"</a>. If this keeps up, the games industry may soon run out of hollow synonyms for cutting jobs. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Krafton has singed an agreement with Palworld developers Pockerpair to bring Palworld to mobile.</p>



<p>The announcement comes from a <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-%ed%8c%b0%ec%9b%94%eb%93%9c-%eb%aa%a8%eb%b0%94%ec%9d%bc-%ea%b2%8c%ec%9e%84-%ea%b8%80%eb%a1%9c%eb%b2%8c-%eb%9d%bc%ec%9d%b4%ec%84%a0%ec%8a%a4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Krafton Press Release</a>, which reveals that the company has signed a licensing agreement for the intellectual property (IP) of ‘Palworld.’</p>



<p>The announcement reads that, “Through this contract, Krafton will expand the Palworld IP to the mobile platform. It plans to faithfully reinterpret and implement the original’s main fun elements to fit the mobile environment. The project will be handled by the development team of ‘PUBG STUDIOS,’ a creative studio under Krafton.”</p>



<p><span>Palworld’s release on PC and Xbox attracted 25 million players and reached the third-</span>highest number of concurrent users on Steam of all time. The game made its debut on the PlayStation 5 in September.</p>



<p>Last month, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-suing-palworld-developer-pocketpair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo will be pursuing legal action over Palworld</a> for patent infringement, to which Pocketpair replied that, “we will do our utmost for our fans, and to ensure that indie game developers are not hindered or discouraged from pursuing their creative ideas.”</p>



<p><span>Despite its success, the game received some community backlash upon its release due to its&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/did-palworld-really-plagiarize-pokemon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelming similarities to Pokemon.</a>&nbsp;Many fans of </span>Pokemon compared the images and assets online accusing Pocketpair of plagiarism and the conversation around the issue has seemingly never been squashed. </p>

			<p>Ryujinx, the sole remaining Nintendo Switch emulator for PC after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closure of Yuzu</a>, has also been taken down by Nintendo. The news came a few hours ago from one of the main collaborators on the open source project, which was the first emulator to boot commercial Switch games.</p>
<p>Here's the Discord message shared with the community:</p>
<p><em>Yesterday, gdkchan (the author) was contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement to stop working on the project, remove the organization and all related assets he's in control of. While awaiting confirmation on whether he would take this agreement, the organization has been removed, so I think it's safe to say what the outcome is. Rather than leave you with only panic and speculation, I decided to write this short message to give some closure. These words are my own. I don't want to speak for anyone else here, so just remember that while reading.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you to everyone who has contributed code, documentation, or issue reports to the project. Thank you all for following us throughout the development. I was able to learn a lot of really neat things about games that I love, enjoy them with renewed qualities and in unique circumstances, and I'm sure you all have experiences that are similarly special. I'm extending my own massive thanks to our moderation team, who have been here through some rough circumstances and always found ways to make light of it.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, Ryujinx can no longer be downloaded via GitHub or the official website, where the <a href="https://ryujinx.org/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download page</a> is now entirely blank. It may have taken them years, but Nintendo finally decided to completely crack down on the Switch emulator and pirate scenes.</p>
<p>Recently, they also <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a lawsuit against Palworld, alleging that Pocketpair infringed multiple patents with their game. Whereas with the emulators, the companies likely had no choice but to fold even merely due to lack of funds for the legal expenses, the same appears unlikely with Palworld, which is one of the best-selling games released in 2024 so far.</p>

With the included stand and Bowser's tail, the build has a depth of 11 inches.</p><p>While you could call The Mighty Bowser a statue, it's also a giant action figure. His tail, arms, and legs are posable, so you can display Bowser in a variety of different poses. In addition to articulated joints, Bowser's jaw snaps and buttons beneath it turn his head. He can also shoot fireballs to (try to) stop Mario from thwarting his plans once again. When on his stand, Bowser is flanked on each side by fiery towers.</p><p>There's also a hidden POW Block, which was implemented specifically for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Adventures-Interactive-Playset-Nintendo/dp/B0CV2G23D8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Mario</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CV27VY6L?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Luigi</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Adventures-Interactive-Princess-Nintendo/dp/B0CV2CNDYZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Peach</a> figures to step on. While The Mighty Bowser isn't considered a playset--it's one of the five Lego Mario sets geared primarily toward adults--it does interact with the figures included in the starter courses. If you press Lego Mario against Bowser's shell, he will react to Bowser's presence.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4377482-legosupermarioadventureswithmario.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4377482" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4377482-legosupermarioadventureswithmario.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4377482"></a><figcaption>Adventures with Mario Starter Set</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4377482-legosupermarioadventureswithmario.jpg"></figure><p>The Mighty Bowser isn't the only set in the Lego Mario series focused on King Koopa.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/halo-battle-royale-details-video-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a video dubbed an exclusive report, one creator and reporter has broken down a series of claimed details about Project Tatanka – later known as Project Ekhert – the famed and failed Halo battle royale title. It was claimed that Tatanka (or Ekhert) was cancelled in 2023 because of a desire to focus on the next main Halo game and because the battle royale genre was wavering.</p>



<p>Read on to check out the full array of claims about the cancelled Halo battle royale project.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-might-have-been">What Might Have Been</h2>



<p>Many fans were excited about the prospect of a Halo battle royale title, including some prolific streamers with a penchant for first-person shooters. Unfortunately, all signs point to 343 Industries having cancelled the project, capping it to work on bigger and better things for the series. </p>



<p>In January, it was claimed that 343 Industries was heading in an entirely different way for the next Halo title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-unreal-engine/">‘starting from scratch’</a> and utilising a new engine. Shortly after, Project Tatanka (Project Ekhert) was shut down, as the claim goes.</p>



<p>In a post on social media that accompanied an ‘exclusive’ YouTube report, creator ‘Rebs Gaming’, who has spotted key Halo-related details in the past, listed a bunch of details tied to the cancelled Halo battle royale game.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Project Tatanka: Halo Infinite’s Canceled Battle Royale Mode (Exclusive Report)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MEUh_vS4b5w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>He stressed it was being playtested ‘weekly’ by 343 Industries, which is where many of these details came from. Players would drop into a map on the Zeta Halo ring made up of multiple fragments, and they’d get there through an ODST-style drop-pod system. As players explored the map, they’d pick up power items, equipment, and shields, all while completing ‘mini objectives’.</p>



<p>As the game unravelled, Pelicans would fly over and drop off vehicles — Warthogs, Mongooses, Falcons, and the like.</p>



<p>These details are yet to be corroborated, but whether they’re accurate or not, the fact remains — there is no Halo battle royale game on the horizon and it was once heavily rumoured that one would materialise. In the absence of such a game, some savvy creators have started piecing together their own Halo battle royale mode, which shows how there’s an appetite for the game.</p>



<p>Do you think a Halo battle royale would have done something to save the series? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/project-rene-leaks-mobile-mechanics/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/project-rene-leaks-reveal-%E2%80%98disappointing%E2%80%99-mobile-gaming-mechanics.998259/</guid>

<p>In recent days, new shots from a test build of Project Rene have allegedly leaked online, showcasing several changes that have left The Sims community disappointed. At first blush, it appears that Electronic Arts has changed the conceptual style revealed so many months ago and pivoted to a more mobile-friendly design complete with ‘grindy’ tasks and microtransactions.</p>



<p>On September 17, the team revealed that there were no plans to release The Sims 5, and instead, it would keep pushing updates into The Sims 4, the decade-old title.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-mobile">Going Mobile</h2>



<p>Project Rene has been in development for the longest time, and the team at Electronic Arts hasn’t exactly been forthcoming with updates. From leaks concerning an open-world map to a developer diary that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-sims-5-new-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exposed some prototype art</a> for the game, details have been drip-fed into the community over the last few years.</p>



<p>In the last few days, some leaked images have surfaced online revealing what’s claimed to be a more updated test build of Project Rene. These images have caused fans to lash out against the developers for creating what appears to be a typical and rather generic mobile game:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">i can’t believe my eyes that Project Rene has switched its course from being a promising successor of the Sims 4 to some ugly ass mobile game that will be another cash grab full of ads <a href="https://t.co/55zBbi4vJI">pic.twitter.com/55zBbi4vJI</a></p>— tom (@simshive) <a href="https://twitter.com/simshive/status/1840433234867359749?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>What’s ironic is that in January 2024, it was revealed that The Sims Mobile would receive no further updates. It’s almost written in stone that Project Rene will be a replacement of sorts for the mobile title that was online for so many years, but some fans aren’t happy with that revelation.</p>



<p>In the leaked screenshots, we see a microtransaction tab powered by ‘Simoleons’ and some examples of quests that users will grind to earn XP and in-game currency. It’s assumed that they’ll use that currency to unlock clothing, furniture, and other items, making this as typical a mobile game as you could ever hope to play.</p>



<p>In addition to these images, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1frtd5c/new_project_rene_formerly_the_sims_5_screenshots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post surfaced on Reddit</a> from a user taking part in an ongoing playtest. They explained that it’s a game based on a ‘collaborative multiplayer experience’ that’ll see players form relationships with other, real players. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation Japan Has a Playtime Plan To Foil PS5 Pro Scalpers]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ps-japan-plan-ps5-pro-scalpers/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-japan-has-a-playtime-plan-to-foil-ps5-pro-scalpers.998244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ps-japan-plan-ps5-pro-scalpers/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Almost as soon as the PlayStation 5 Pro 30th Anniversary Edition was unveiled, scalpers set to spoil legitimate consumers’ fun by selling their pre-orders online for thousands of dollars. In some territories, pre-orders for this sumptuous Sony console sold out in minutes, many of which were claimed by malicious scalpers.</p>



<p>PlayStation Japan isn’t taking that sitting down, though. If you want to pre-order a PlayStation 5 Pro 30th Anniversary Edition over there, you’ll need to meet some critical criteria.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-beat-back-the-scalpers">Beat Back the Scalpers</h2>



<p>Whenever something desirable is revealed in the gaming world, scalpers rush to power up their bots and join queues on every platform possible to secure pre-orders. They’ll then turn those pre-orders – or outright purchases – into money-making machines on platforms like eBay, charging two, three, or four times the price and trapping desperate, legitimate users.</p>



<p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/to-battle-ps5-pro-30th-anniversary-edition-scalpers-sony-imposes-conditions-for-ordering-the-console-but-only-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton recently spotted</a> that the PlayStation Japan team has implemented a few base requirements for users looking to pre-order the PS5 Pro 30th Anniversary Edition.</p>



<p>Firstly, you’ll need to have a PSN account <strong>registered in Japan</strong>, and that account will need to have at least 30 hours of playtime recorded on any PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 game <strong>between </strong>February 2014 and September 2024. </p>



<p>It’s a minor blocker, but it should be enough to prevent many of the run-of-the-mill scalpers with absolutely no interest in what they’re buying. It means that pre-orders for the PS5 Pro 30th Anniversary Edition in Japan are more likely to be reserved for legitimate gamers interested in securing the console <strong>because they’re fans</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s almost moot now, given how rapidly the PS5 Pro 30th Anniversary Edition sold out worldwide, but it’s good to see that at least one region is aware of the threat presented by scalpers.</p>



<p>Did you manage to secure a pre-order for this gorgeous console? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Following its release, the F-Zero series remained dormant for more than 19 years until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f-zero-99/" data-ref-id="5000-603158">F-Zero 99</a> arrived in 2023.</p><p>As mentioned, both games will be available through Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pack plan, a premium tier that grants subscribers additional benefits, including access to classic Nintendo 64 games and select DLC expansions for some Switch titles. An individual membership costs $50 USD a year, while a family plan costs $80 USD and covers up to eight Nintendo Accounts.</p><p>That's not the only news for F-Zero fans. The aforementioned F-Zero 99 is also receiving a free 1.5 update, which introduces a new Grand Prix league, five additional tracks, and new machine decals. F-Zero 99 is free to download for all Nintendo Switch Online members.</p>

Woot! (owned by Amazon) is offering <a href="https://zdcs.link/9ZdBrP?object_uuid=ff65639c-06fb-4f42-b627-2331365fb9ab&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> for Nintendo Switch for only $51.99. This is a good deal only if you're an Amazon Prime member because you get free shipping. Otherwise, you'll have to pay an additional $6 for shipping, which makes it just a few dollars cheaper than buying it elsewhere.</p><p>This is a physical copy and includes a 90-day Woot! warranty. Woot! mentions that copies may or may not be imported, but all Nintendo Switch games are region-free so you'll be able to play the game regardless. Also, you won't have to worry about language either, since that setting is determined by your Switch console.</p><h2>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</h2><div catalogid="007d5bf9-dc92-4652-8ad4-bf06bd9bfbbb" id="207939"><div id="207939" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom (Switch)</h3></p><div><p>Free Shipping for Amazon Prime members</p></div></div><p>Check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom review</a> and see why this game earned an "Amazing" 9/10 score. In it, writer Tom Marks states "The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is far greater than a gimmicky spinoff led by Zelda instead of Link. Its echo summoning is a clever concept used to combine the expertly crafted dungeons, puzzle rooms, and item progression you’d expect from a classic-style 2D Zelda with the borderline unhinged freedom provided by Tears of the Kingdom. This experiment doesn’t produce an entirely perfect result, with a little bit of clunky menu management and combat that simply isn’t quite as compelling, but it’s an impressively successful one all the same. Echoes of Wisdom is also a glowing proof of concept for how a modern 3D Zelda could recapture some of what fans like me miss about the series before Breath of the Wild without sacrificing the intoxicating creativity it introduced. Creating echoes aside, if this is the future of Zelda, I can’t wait to see more."</p><p>For more discounts on games, check out the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">best Nintendo Switch deals today</a>.</p><p><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

One was that Tropic Haze had not been smart about how they had gone about development, and many people pointed to competing Switch emulator Ryujinx as a model example. But today it was announced via Discord that the developer of Ryujinx had been contacted by Nintendo, reaching an agreement to stop working on the project and take the assets down from Github. The <a href="https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">github repo for Ryujinx</a> is now offline. Ryujinx is no more, at least in its current form, but what did anyone expect? Nintendo was never going to stop with Yuzu, and I doubt this will be the last time they do this.</p><figure><figcaption><span>An update from the Ryujinx Discord. Credit: Ryujinx.</span></figcaption></figure><p>“Yesterday, gdkchan was contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement to stop working on the project, remove the organization and all related assets he's in control of,” user rip in peri peri <a href="https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1841188744126480428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in the Ryujinx Discord server. “While awaiting confirmation on whether he would take this agreement, the organization has been removed, so I think it's safe to say what the outcome is. Rather than leave you with only panic and speculation, I decided to write this short message to give some closure.”</p><p>“Thank you to @everyone who has contributed code, documentation or issue reports to the project,” they continued. “Thank you all for following us throughout the development. I was able to learn a lot of really neat things about games that I love, enjoy them with renewed qualities and in unique circumstances, and I'm sure you all have experiences that are similarly special”</p><p>In addition to that, rip in peii peri <a href="https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1841188894357745700" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted</a> several in the additions to the emulator that were not public: a remarkably stable version of the emulator that ran on iOS that unfortunately would remain a novelty due to UI limitations, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2KuTFZ-efQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WIP android version of the emulator</a>, improved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEVre_0ZVUg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">metal support</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz6k7wURlPo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more</a>. Developers Ac_K and Berry also chimed in, expressing their gratitude for the community and the project.</p><p>Though I am quite curious what the exact nature of the deal between gdkchan and Nintendo was, the practical reality is it does not matter. Ryujinx was the main Switch emulator that was not an active fork of Yuzu. Since Nintendo reached its settlement with Tropic Haze, other emulators have forked Yuzu’s code and continued development, Suyu and Sudachi being the primary ones. (3Ds emulator Citra has also found a stable fork.)&nbsp; But the process has not been smooth sailing: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24108191/gitlab-suyu-nintendo-switch-emulator-takedown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gitlab removed Suyu</a>, citing a DMCA claim. Discord nuked the accounts of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/11/24127545/discord-suyu-sudachi-server-shutdown-account-ban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suyu and Sudachi</a> developers, also citing a DMCA claim.&nbsp; Development can still happen, although Nintendo is making it as difficult as possible to do this above board, in public, without <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yuzu/comments/1bkjwsc/suyu_was_dmcad_off_gitlab_now_they_are_self/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">self-hosting</a>. On top of this, YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/retrogamecorps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Retro Gaming Corps </a>claimed they were served a <a href="https://x.com/RetroGameCorps/status/1840077263598915978" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DMCA takedown from Nintendo</a> this week for showing off Wii U.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>An update from the Ryujinx Discord. Credit: Ryujinx.</figcaption></figure><p>I understand why Nintendo is doing this, in the same way I understand a boa constrictor strangling a small animal to death. It is within Nintendo’s nature and character to act this way, to throw its weight around and to make open source development difficult, particularly as the Switch’s successor creeps into view.&nbsp;</p><p>The reality is that emulation itself is not criminal, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment,_Inc._v._Connectix_Corp." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there is precedent for this</a> and it is telling that most of the time they have settled out of court. Another reality is that the games Nintendo was releasing on its ancient hardware have run like shit for years; just ask anyone playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhHFABnLfVg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> (I am, it does). These are not the actions of a compassionate or reasonable company; this is throwing your weight around because you can. Year after year they somehow manage to find the most maximally suspect way to go about these things. <a href="https://aftermath.site/palworld-nintendo-lawyer-sue-pocketpair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I should not find myself siding with <em>Palworld</em></a>, and yet here we are!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom - Brilliant, But What About Performance?

If only there was a way to play it on better hardware.</figcaption></figure></div><p>We have been living in a golden age of emulation, from the MiSTer to countless other projects. But Nintendo has not only shown itself to constantly be a bad steward of its history, but also a viciously litigious one. If emulation is driven underground again because of moves like this, it will be categorically bad for the history of gaming. We cannot return to living that way, because there is too much at stake.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Bungie's efforts to build enthusiasm for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s future amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">significant layoffs</a> at the studio and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-acknowledges-uncertainty-surrounding-the-future-of-destiny-following-layoffs">fan concerns</a> continue with yet more teases for next year's Codename: Apollo expansion - which is now confirmed to be whisking players to a "Metroidvania-inspired destination", as seen in new concept art, and arriving alongside "next generation" armour.
</p>
<p>
Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-announces-major-changes-for-destiny-2-two-medium-expansions-coming-a-year">announced Codename: Apollo back in September</a> as part of "major changes" that'll see the studio launch two "medium" Destiny 2 expansions every year, instead of a single major release. At the time, Apollo was described as a "non-linear character-driven adventure", with the word "Metroidvania" floated but not confirmed.
</p>
<p>
Now though, as part of its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKgp_Ivy4ds">latest developer stream</a>, Bungie has shared a little more detail on what's to come. Codename: Apollo, as previously confirmed, arrives next summer as the first of Bungie's twice-yearly "medium-sized" releases, which, for context, are said to be approximately the same size as Destiny 1's Rise of Iron expansion.

<p>
Each will have its own unique campaign and post-game content that players can "dive really deep into" beyond the initial experience - Apollo kicking off Destiny 2's new Frontiers saga with a journey to a "Metroidvania-inspired destination" featuring a "non-linear campaign that puts [players] in the drivers seat of exploring its world and its story".
</p>
<p>
Bungie says players will have freedom to explore multiple destinations from the off, with some areas only becoming accessible once a specific item has been found elsewhere. Along the way, there'll be characters to meet and choices to make, with Apollo set to feature between 25 and 30 "different threads" of stories players can tease out as they complete different activities - the idea being to keep them in the world and always exploring.
</p>

<p>
The studio remains evasive when it comes to specifics, but concept art (above) for the new expansion shows "people [players] haven't met yet" in Destiny, and inspirations for Apollo are said to range from early 60s prog rock like King Crimson and Jefferson Airplane, to Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five and the TV show Scavengers Reign.
</p>
<p>
Whatever Bungie ultimately has in store, it's being described as an "exotic world" that's "tailor-built around the joy of discovery", where players will acquire powerful abilities to uncover secrets and carve a path to the great mystery at the heart of the planet.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
Also coming next year as part of efforts to revitalise Destiny 2 is a system Bungie is calling "next generation armour". This, it explains in a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/next_gen_armor">lengthy blog post</a>, is intended to make armour "exciting again" by giving it unique properties and more manageable stats. Essentially, this will mean a "smaller number of unique stats on any piece of armour, with larger contributions to these stats, and every stat point providing a benefit." There's a lot more detail in Bungie's post, though, so it's worth checking out the whole thing.
</p>
<p>
Before all that, however, Destiny 2 is poised to embark on its latest season, Revenant: Act 1, which gets underway next week. Top of its additions is the new Onslaught: Salvation mode, featuring three maps (Widow's Court was demoed during the livestream), new enemies, and new defensive abilities. There's a turret, for instance, plus improved Stasis Slow tripwires, and an airstrike that sends a devastating blast from above when enemies stray into its radius. Expect all that (and more!) when Revenant begins on 8th October.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/epic-games-unreal-fest-showcases-new-features-for-unreal-engine-5/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Epic Games Unreal Fest opener has concluded, and it was used as a large celebration of the developer and creator ecosystem that has been utilized by those who can access the Unreal Engine and Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN). The Fest was used to show off many new features surrounding Epic Games, but most importantly, some of the new features coming to Unreal Engine 5 in the Unreal Engine 5.5 update.</p>
<p>During the opening session, a huge announcement was made, saying there are now new Unreal Engine royalty rate savings when shipping eligible titles on the Epic Games Store before or on the same time as on other platforms. Developers can now reduce the royalty they must pay Epic from 5% to 3.5%. This is due to the terms of the standard Unreal Engine EULA saying that those who ship a game are generally obligated to pay Epic 5% of worldwide gross revenue.</p>
<p>However, effective January 1, 2025, the royalty rate will decrease from 5% to 3.5% for earnings above $1 million. Again, this pertains to the royalty fee when the Unreal Engine game is published in other stores, like Steam; Epic already completely waived the fee for UE games shipping on its own store. The&nbsp;<span>terms and conditions of the 'Launch Everywhere with Epic' scheme are nuanced, and for those who plan to do that, it's worth<a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/release" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> looking into</a> exactly what this means for them</span>.</p>
<p>In addition, Unreal Engine 5.5 Preview 1 has been released for those interested in the developer tool. During the opening session of Epic Games Unreal Fest, guests got to see the new technology that they have been working on within Unreal Engine 5. This includes a live demonstration of a new experimental feature in the software called MegaLights. This enables those using the software to create movable, dynamic, and realistic area shadows with the ability to light volumetric fog. The demonstration was shown in real time running on PlayStation 5, where a scene navigated an area with over 1,000 shadow-casting lights.</p>

<p>UE 5.5 also includes new rendering improvements, with Nanite now able to render Skeletal Meshes much faster and Path Tracer being Production-Ready. This feature has already been used in major movies, including Piece by Piece, the Unreal Engine animated biography of Pharrell Williams.</p>

<p>Millions of gamers worldwide <strong>love </strong>a good zombie game. They represent some of the best examples of freedom, violence, and survival out of any gaming genre, and despite being <strong>morbid</strong>, there’s something so compelling about an end-of-the-world story. To answer the demand for these titles, we’ve assembled a list of the best zombie games to play in 2024.</p>



<p>If you’ve been hungering for a solid zombie-focused adventure, or to explore a dank, unforgiving wasteland, look no further than this guide. We’ve taken the 10 best zombie games you can play right now across a mix of platforms, so you don’t need to look far to fulfil that desire.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-zombie-games-you-can-play-right-now">Best Zombie Games You Can Play Right Now</h2>



<p>This is a mix of games across different genres and platforms and with varying price points. It’s a fine collection, and every one of these games is certainly worthy of being on our list of the best zombie games, but if you’ve got a different recommendation, feel free to leave it in the comments – we might add it!</p>



<h3 id="h-1-dying-light-and-dying-light-2">1. Dying Light (And Dying Light 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dying Light is one of the greatest open-world zombie games ever made, emerging in 2015 as a fast-paced, high-octane slasher from Techland. It boasted remarkable parkour mechanics and some of the best zombie combat we’ve ever seen.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-dying-light-2-had-so-much-cut-content"><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-2-cut-content/">Dying Light 2 Had So Much Cut Content</a></strong></h6>



<h3 id="h-2-state-of-decay-and-state-of-decay-2">2. State of Decay (And State of Decay 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The State of Decay games are exclusive to Xbox and PC, and they’re fantastic representations of the people management needed to survive in a tense zombie apocalypse. In State of Decay, players must build a community, manage a base of operations, and scavenge for resources.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-project-zomboid">3. Project Zomboid</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Project Zomboid is a punishing title and probably the hardest zombie game on this list. It’s one of the best zombie games out there because it’s so granular, and despite the lack of flashy graphics, Project Zomboid will have you sitting on the edge of your seat wondering where the next attack will come from.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-dead-island-and-dead-island-2">4. Dead Island (And Dead Island 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dead Island is a strange franchise – there was a ten-year gap between Dead Island and Dead Island 2, but when that gap had reached its end, one of the best zombie games ever was delivered. Dead Island 2 is a monumental slayer of a title that will have you engaged for hours.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-dead-island-2-hit-1-million-sales-in-three-days"><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-island-2-1m-sales-zombies/">Dead Island 2 Hit 1 Million Sales in Three Days</a></strong></h6>



<h3 id="h-5-left-4-dead-and-left-4-dead-2">5. Left 4 Dead (And Left 4 Dead 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Left 4 Dead was Valve’s stab at a zombie apocalypse title – and what a successful one it was. This four-player bullet-spraying epic took survivors through a series of stages bursting at the seams with zombies – and some well-crafted mutated zombies, too. </p>







<h3 id="h-6-the-last-of-us-and-the-last-of-us-part-2">6. The Last of Us (And The Last of Us Part 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Technically they’re not <strong>zombies</strong>, but the infected in The Last of Us give off those undead vibes for sure. In 2013, The Last of Us was released on PlayStation 3 and it quickly became regarded as one of the best games of all time – and it’s certainly one of the best zombie games to make this list.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-call-of-duty-zombies-any-of-them">7. Call of Duty Zombies (Any of Them)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>COD Zombies is a legendary side mode that has been present in more than half a dozen Call of Duty games over the years. It is a staple for Treyarch’s creations, and over the years, it has gone from a simple wave-based survival mode to a full, open-world adventure.</p>







<h3 id="h-8-dead-rising-1-4">8. Dead Rising (1 – 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dead Rising is one of the most iconic zombie franchises in gaming, and since the first game was released way back in 2006, it has worked to establish itself as a founding father of all modern zombie games. It typically features a race against a clock, crowds of thousands of zombies, and extreme ingenuity when it comes to crafting weapons.</p>







<h3 id="h-9-days-gone">9. Days Gone</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Days Gone was a one-shot PlayStation exclusive that featured a zombie-slaying bounty hunter on a bike, Deacon St. John. It was an open-world epic that boasted an engine capable of producing swarms of zombies that numbered in the hundreds, and it never failed to terrify players who weren’t expecting the masses to charge at them.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-the-walking-dead-the-telltale-series">10. The Walking Dead (The Telltale Series)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Walking Dead hasn’t had a great track record in gaming – except for when it comes to the Telltale series. This collection of games – which are episodic by nature – offers up a phenomenal experience in The Walking Dead’s universe, bringing a choice and consequence model to the table in some of the best zombie games we’ve ever seen. </p>
