		<p>“Stop right there, criminal scum!” Before it was a meme – in a time before memes – this famous quote yelled by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/oblivion">Oblivion’s</a> patrolling lawmen once filled me with dread. Probably because my Argonian rogue could often be found skulking Cyrodiil’s cities by night, my inventory chock full of stolen goods I’d later fence to a dodgy bloke in Bruma.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered - Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFJ3PZuAjK4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now, almost 20 years later those same words conjure a grin of familiarity, being just as comically melodramatic as I remembered. There’s no denying the colossal influence The Elder Scrolls IV had on the action roleplaying genre these past two decades yet, at its core, it’s a beautifully weird fantasy pantomime.</p>


<p>With its successor, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/skyrim">Skryim</a>, being playable on almost every household device, when people hear “The Elder Scrolls” they often think of battling dragons on snow swept battlefields, but there’s so much more to Bethesda’s long-running series. Returning to those older games, though, can trigger headaches, technically and gameplay-wise, despite their rich stories, settings, and characters boasting a timeless allure.</p>


<p>Developed by Virtuos in collaboration with Bethesda, what Oblivion Remastered offers is a more accessible way of playing The Elder Scrolls IV. Not only does it bring the game to modern systems, it features a slew of smart improvements that round off some of those rough mid 2000s edges. Thankfully, this isn’t just a top-to-bottom Skyrimification; sure, certain elements have been retrofitted, but they do little to diminish Oblivion’s unique identity. For example, character progression differs from Bethesda’s newer RPGs, giving players attribute points to tailor their playstyle, the level-up screen only activating once you’ve found somewhere in-game to sleep.</p>
<p>It’s clear to see that Virtuos has been careful not to alter core aspects of the Oblivion experience while trying their hardest to reduce friction and busywork. Inventory management has been streamlined with quickslots allowing players to seamlessly access weapons, spells, and other items without digging into menus. Oblivion Remastered even has a sprint button which purists may balk at, but it sure comes in handy when backtracking through dungeons or getting from A to B in Cyrodiil’s vast open world.</p>

<p>As for presentation, Oblivion has received a full makeover using Unreal Engine 5 and the results are mostly magnificent. Character models are bursting with life thanks to improved facial animations, lighting, lip sync, and textures, with Cyrodiil’s myriad landmarks and vistas given the same treatment.</p>
<p>For better or worse, one area of the game that hasn’t changed much is the core combat. Quality of life improvements have made Oblivion more tolerable for mages and rogues, though melee duels often result in mindless button-bashing, waiting to see whose health bar depletes fastest. In an age where almost every video game has a parry action, Oblivion’s combat feels stiff with little scope to pull off skill-based feats. Then again, if this was something Virtuos had changed, it may have been a bridge too far, fundamentally altering that core moment-to-moment gameplay.</p>

<p>This kind of restraint creates a game that floats between being a remaster and a remake, though the end result is still the same. Oblivion Remastered is the perfect nostalgia hit for fans of The Elder Scrolls eagerly awaiting the series’ eventual sixth instalment. It’s a revival that respects those gamers who loved the original, while sprucing it up enough to entice a new generation of players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-surpasses-500k-copies-sold-at-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-stability-performance-improvements-mods/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> unsurprisingly shadow-dropped earlier this week, plenty of RPG fans began to feel concerned for <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-mod-removes-30-fps-cutscene-cap-fixes-ultrawide-resolutions-fov-issues-and-more/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, a brand-new RPG, from new studio Sandfall Interactive.</p>
<p>Those concerns ended up being unnecessary, as Sandfall Interactive <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1915777375834452273">announced today</a>, after Clair Obscur launched yesterday, that the game had already surpassed <strong>500,000 copies sold</strong>. A feat made even more impressive by the fact that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 also launched directly into Xbox Game Pass, and hundreds of thousands of players still chose to spend the money to grab a copy of their own.</p>
<p>It's terrific news for Sandfall, with Clair Obscur being the studio's debut title. Along with the commercial success, Clair Obscur has found great critical success, joining <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-plus-extra-premium-april-2025-lineup-includes-hogwarts-legacy-blue-prince-battlefield-1-and-more/">Blue Prince</a> as one of the two games currently sitting at a 92 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/">Metacritic</a>. At this point, instead of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 getting overshadowed by Oblivion, you might even be able to say that the opposite is true, with Oblivion being the return of a beloved but also old RPG that millions of people have already played.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a new series from a new studio, offering a new experience to players that resonates with RPG fans. Of course by the end of the year it'll be interesting to see where Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 lands in conversations about what's the best game of the year, but already it seems like Clair Obscur could be 2025's version of a game like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, in that it's a new RPG on the scene that has people talking about it all year long.</p>
<p>It's also, like Metaphor, competing against a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/">legacy RPG series</a> and showing how far RPGs have come over the years.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakenings-first-20-hours-are-damn-impressive-despite-loads-of-bugs-closed-beta-impressions</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dune-awakening%E2%80%99s-first-20-hours-are-damn-impressive-despite-loads-of-bugs-closed-beta-impressions.1173855/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakenings-first-20-hours-are-damn-impressive-despite-loads-of-bugs-closed-beta-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I first saw a demo of Dune: Awakening over a year ago, I went from being skeptical that a survival game on the famously barren world of Arrakis could even work, to being absolutely hyped to get my hands on it. Now, after enduring the unforgiving conditions and hostile lifeforms of a desert planet for nearly 20 hours in the closed beta, I’m confident developer Funcom has the foundations of an absolutely stellar MMO that makes fantastic use of one of the greatest science fiction worlds ever created. Harvesting raw materials from the brutal wasteland, constructing bases, upgrading your character and loadout, and then bringing all of that to bear against raiders and rival houses is just about as good as I’d hoped for. That said, I still feel like I only got a small taste of the larger game, as all of the major social spaces, most of the PvP, and especially any of the all-important endgame areas were kept out of reach. And it’s also no wonder the release date for Dune: Awakening was pushed back a month while I was in the beta, as the build I played was absolutely rife with bugs and performance issues that will definitely need ironing out. Even so, I was quite impressed by the vast majority of what I saw, and am more optimistic than ever that they might just be able to pull this thing off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you only just recently got spat back up by a Shai Hulud, Dune: Awakening is an upcoming massively multiplayer survival game from the team of developers who gave us the quite underrated Conan Exiles. The premise is simple: you find yourself on Arrakis and have to find a way to not die there, and if you know even a little about the setting, then you should understand just how tall of an order that is. In typical survival game fashion, you’ll start off with almost nothing, and turn piles of rocks and scraps of metal harvested from the wilds into tools to help you survive, building shelter along the way to protect yourself from the harsh environment. While you might (and frankly, wouldn’t be blamed) for wondering how the heck jogging around a massive, featureless desert could possibly be fun, Funcom has actually done a great job of filling each region with shipwrecks to plunder, hidden caves and fortresses to blast your way through, and mountain ranges to climb. And while there’s plenty of empty space with nothing but unremarkable piles of sand to greet you, these spaces are actually used to great effect as obstacles keeping you from the next area, which must be navigated across quickly, lest you find yourself on the business end of a giant sand worm.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dune: Awakening - January 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, early on you’ll be limited to a very small area that’s cut off from higher level areas that contain better loot and materials you need to craft better equipment. But crossing the massive distance of sand that stands between you on foot is a death sentence, as you’ll undoubtedly draw the attention of an angry worm in the process. To get to the other side, you’ll have to go through the steps of constructing your first vehicle, a small motorbike, then race across the gap as quickly as you can. This clever use of empty space brilliantly turns what I thought would be a weakness in the setting into a strength, and finding ways to cross a completely barren area with a Shai Hulud hot on your tail actually made up some of my favorite moments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, the oppressive nature of the sun, which forces you to dart from shaded area to shaded area, turns the entire planet into a high stakes game of “the floor is lava” that can make otherwise uneventful jaunts from one place to another into an entertaining minigame. Refusing to take sun exposure seriously will drain you of ever-valuable water, wipe out your health, and kill you in pretty short order, which kept me on high alert, and since each region increases the heat level, you’re constantly having to invent new equipment back at your base to give yourself the best odds at survival. Sure, it can be a bit of a pain now and again when you hit the head and come back to find the sun’s shifted position and you’re now frying to death in the merciless heat, but hey, that’s just the price you pay for living on Arrakis, my friend, and I mostly enjoyed this little minigame that just made survival that much more tricky.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, in addition to crossing arid deserts and dodging sunlight, you’ll be fighting off bands of bloodthirsty raiders and exploring forgotten places with a gun or sword in hand. The third-person gunplay isn’t groundbreaking by any means, as you’ll duck behind cover, toss grenades, and and return fire in pretty by-the-numbers encounters, but for an MMO with a massive number of players on the server, it’s still quite admirable that they managed to pull off gunplay that feels this snappy. And with a whole bunch of skill trees to pick from and build into – like the tricky and stealthy Mentats or expert survivalist Planetologists – there’s tons of ways to differentiate your character from the rest of your guild. As for myself, I focused most of my skill points into the tried-and-true soldier, which I expected might be a tad boring, but was pleasantly surprised to find myself very happy to be grapple-hooking around and tossing deadly gadgets to and fro. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Running and gunning with friends at your side is especially entertaining, and there were moments, like when my co-op partner used her Bene Gesserit skills to force an enemy to walk out into the open, then I threw a grenade to take them out, where combat really shines. There was also just the tiniest sampling of PvP in the beta build, focused on a couple crash sites that allowed for player-on-player violence, but due to server populations being fairly low in the closed beta, it was hard to get a sense for how this aspect will shake out. In any case, the vast majority of PvP hot zones are in the endgame areas I wasn’t allowed to progress to, so it seems we’ll probably have to wait for the full game to get a good feel on PvP anyway.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a longtime fan of Dune, it also just feels so good to explore and learn more about a world that I’m quite fond of, and Funcom has clearly put a ton of effort into worldbuilding and lore, even despite taking quite a bit of creative liberty by placing Awakening within a parallel reality and canon than the books/movies. There are little details that have a massive impact on gameplay, like how incredibly valuable water is treated as the ultimate resource – you’ll drain blood from every fallen enemy, turn your own bodily fluids into water with a stillsuit, and take down bases just to pillage every drop of liquid gold they’ve got hidden away. And since water is required to make advanced materials used for crafting more higher level equipment, you’ll need to harvest and stockpile as much as you can, in addition to drinking it just to keep yourself alive. I won’t go into spoilers, but this kind of attention to detail touches just about every aspect of the world, including the factions and characters you meet along the way, which should be a treat for any fan of the setting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If there’s anything to be concerned about with this otherwise thoroughly engaging beta, it’s the fact that I encountered a whole heap of bugs and performance issues during my time with it, which included everything from crashes to framerate dips, characters and objects getting stretched out bizarrely, and more. With the final version set to debut very soon, I was then pretty relieved when, in the middle of the beta, Funcom announced a month-long delay, presumably to address these issues. As always, it’s tough to gauge how much of this is cause for concern when betas are sorta designed to help highlight and patch these sorts of issues, but the sheer number of problems me and my friends encountered while playing was definitely cause for alarm with the launch date so near.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Outside the core plot, there's a wonderful silliness - and self-deprecation - to Clair Obscur that, together with its outstanding art direction and unique battle mechanics, ensure the game is distinct," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Eurogamer's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a>. "It's an ambitious yet impressive debut from the studio that, despite a somewhat fanciful narrative, is a pensive examination of grief and the power of art."</p>

		<p>A brand new trailer has been released for DOOM: The Dark Ages, and it introduces a brand new area called the Cosmic Realm. It represents a new type of location for the DOOM franchise, one the developers have wanted to explore for a while. At its core, the Cosmic Realm is a Lovecraftian dimension and in the DOOM universe it has formed an alliance with Hell.</p>
<p><iframe title="DOOM: The Dark Ages - Cosmic Realm First Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DVBI55DbNQI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Cosmic Realm is more than just a new location for players to rip and tear through, as it is home to a host of new enemies. One of those new enemies is the Cosmic Baron who is a twin bladed brute that attacks quickly to put players under pressure. You won’t be safe if you get some distance from the Cosmic Baron either as he has psionic attacks which are able to block your attacks too. The Cacodemon is another enemy which floats and is able to immobilise you with shield attacks from range which can be followed up be tentacle attacks when it gets close.</p>
<p>Of course, it isn’t all gloom in the Cosmic Realm because within it is a brand new weapon. That weapon is the Reaver Chainshot. The Reaver Chainshot fires a ballistic mace. You can use it as a quick attack to take on a single enemy, or charge it up to unleash the Chaos Sphere. According to the development team, the Reaver Chainshot is unlike any other weapon found in the DOOM games.</p>

			<p>A new DOOM: The Dark Ages trailer was shared today, providing a new look at the game running on PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p>The new trailer, presented by game director Hugo Martin, introduces the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/25/revealing-cosmic-realm-gameplay-from-doom-the-dark-ages-out-may-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cosmic Realm</a>, a world the developer wanted to incorporate into the DOOM universe for a while. This Lovecraftian dimension, which looks quite haunting, is home to fearful enemies like the twin-bladed Cosmic Baron, the powerful Cacodemon, and more. You can take a look at how the Cosmic Realm runs on PlayStation 5 Pro below.</p>
<p><iframe title="DOOM: The Dark Ages - Cosmic Realm First Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DVBI55DbNQI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages promises to be not only yet another engaging entry in the series, but also an amazing showcase of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-id-tech-8-ray-tracing-vitualized-geometry/">id Tech 8 engine</a>, which delivers a world rendered using virtualized geometry, robust physics simulation, and ray-traced lighting at high performance. You can learn more about how the game spices up the modern DOOM series formula by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/">preview</a>.</p>
<p><em>That will be until you explore some of the newer things in DOOM: The Dark Ages. So, to put it quite simply, I could play parts of, not all, two different levels. You are essentially riding a DOOM Guy Gundam in the first of these two. The second, you get to fly a dragon with mecha wings and guns. Now, DOOMdam, as I will now call it, feels similar enough to other levels. It's just that you're now a big machine. You get to punch the hell out of Titans, sometimes shoot them, and there is a sense of scale due to the surrounding combat. I don't know how impactful it will feel over time, but it offered something different while still feeling like the DOOM we know.</em></p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages launches on May 15th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

Can I just load up <em>Morrowind</em> and play that too? The answer is: sort of. But there’s another option that’s so much better.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196452" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="149" data-playlist="196452,196805,195905" data-current="196452"><div><p>Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22004.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The truth is, yes, remarkably you can buy <em>Morrowind</em> on Steam or GOG, click play, and run the game. It’s just, it’s not a brilliant experience. With <em>Oblivion</em>, I swear the vanilla, unmodded released version is absolutely fine. (OK, I’m not delusional, I recognize that it’s vastly improved by an array of mods which can not only fix its abysmal UI but also address all manner of significant bugs before you even get started on the asset packs, extra quests, better dialogue, and so on—but I maintain, you don’t <em>have</em> to use them.)</p><p>However, when I ran <em>Morrowind</em> straight from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/22320/The_Elder_Scrolls_III_Morrowind_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/22320/The_Elder_Scrolls_III_Morrowind_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span>, I had the game in a 4:3 aspect ratio, stuck to the far left of my 21:9 monitor in an immovable window, and things were obviously low-res. This is a game that was originally released 24 years ago, and unlike <em>Oblivion</em>, it was just on the wrong side of a big step forward in gaming fidelity. Yet you can absolutely play the game like this, and honestly, after a few minutes I was just happy to keep going.</p><p>Things are even better if you play it via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_elder_scrolls_iii_morrowind_goty_edition&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_elder_scrolls_iii_morrowind_goty_edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOG</a></span>. GOG has the game in its Preservation Program, meaning there’s a commitment to keep the version sold in a form that runs straight away. It helps that GOG’s version also has the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42196&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Construction Set</a></span>—the modding software created by Bethesda, which is missing from the Steam version—pre-installed. However, both will only load the game in a 4:3 aspect ratio, and will really require some hefty modding before you get going.</p><figure id="" data-id="bb658777e2aff482ca7e3fb965fef64d" data-recommend-id="image://bb658777e2aff482ca7e3fb965fef64d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two soldiers standing in front of a building and trees, with a river." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two soldiers standing in front of a building and trees, with a river." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bb658777e2aff482ca7e3fb965fef64d" data-recommend-id="image://bb658777e2aff482ca7e3fb965fef64d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two soldiers standing in front of a building and trees, with a river." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For many, modding an older game is second nature. For those unfamiliar, however, understanding modding is about as fun as trying to build Ikea furniture underwater, with half the pieces missing and no instructions. Modders come from the same philosophical school as Linux developers, who believe all guides must be written exclusively for people who already know how to do the described task. Everything is assumed, download links are hidden amidst pages of indecipherable update notes, and the correct build you need is listed in such a way as to ensure anyone who isn’t intimately familiar with their operating system just has to guess. Woo.</p><p>If that’s the path you want to go down, I recommend getting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vortex</a></span>, Nexus Mods’ equivalent of an app, which will go some way to helping you manage your mods found on Nexus—the simplest of a very un-simple selection of options. It’s still colossally annoying, unable to run a web browser within itself, meaning it endlessly throws you out to your browser when you’re trying to use it. But hey-ho, it’s progress toward accessibility. And in there, it automatically detected all games it can manage that are installed on my PC, and is able to show me which <em>Morrowind</em> mods I have installed in one neat place. That doesn’t mean I can necessarily figure out how to make them work, but it’s a start.</p><figure id="" data-id="ee52bc55b12631e6ca6d066b1c1f5c80" data-recommend-id="image://ee52bc55b12631e6ca6d066b1c1f5c80" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="804" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The character creation section, with an elderly man on the left asking me questions." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The character creation section, with an elderly man on the left asking me questions." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->OpenMW / Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ee52bc55b12631e6ca6d066b1c1f5c80" data-recommend-id="image://ee52bc55b12631e6ca6d066b1c1f5c80" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="804" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The character creation section, with an elderly man on the left asking me questions." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, there’s a far better and easier option! It’s called OpenMW, and it’s by far the best way to play <em>Morrowind </em>in 2025. OpenMW is an open source engine that reinterprets the original <em>Morrowind</em> code. It’s not a mod in any sense, but rather a new housing in which to run the game, and as such, to use it you’ll need a legitimate installed copy of <em>Morrowind</em> on your PC. And unlike mods, getting it set up is a cinch.</p><p>Downloading it is still the usual bullshit, as you need to get it via GitHub. (People familiar with GitHub and the like will balk at this very suggestion, sneering indignantly at the utter ignorance on display, but as someone who has managed to keep a leg in both camps, I can assure them it’s not intuitive to newcomers in any way.) So let’s make that simple: to get it, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://github.com/OpenMW/openmw/releases/tag/openmw-49-rc6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://github.com/OpenMW/openmw/releases/tag/openmw-49-rc6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click this link</a></span>, and look at the bottom under “Assets.” In there you’ll see “<strong>OpenMW-0.49.0-RC6-win64.exe</strong>,” which is the version you’ll need to run the engine on any modern Windows PC. (The version ending “.tar.gz” is for Linux, while .dmg is for Mac.)</p><p> Left-click on it, and it’ll pop up a save window. Download it, then run the .exe, which will bring up a window that asks you to point it toward your current <em>Morrowind </em>install. So now find where you installed that. For Steam, a useful tip is to right-click the game’s name in your Steam library, choose “Manage” and then “Browse local files.” This will open a file explorer window that will show you where the “Morrowind.exe” file is located—you want to point the OpenMW installer to that.</p><figure id="" data-id="34b3103b79219dddb784f6ada4717080" data-recommend-id="image://34b3103b79219dddb784f6ada4717080" data-format="jpg" data-width="3440" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Morrowind running in ultrawide, a soldier stood in front of a house, surrounded by trees." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Morrowind running in ultrawide, a soldier stood in front of a house, surrounded by trees." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->OpenMW / Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="34b3103b79219dddb784f6ada4717080" data-recommend-id="image://34b3103b79219dddb784f6ada4717080" data-format="jpg" data-width="3440" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Morrowind running in ultrawide, a soldier stood in front of a house, surrounded by trees." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After that, everything’s so much simpler! Just load the game and then the in-game options are replete with everything you could hope for. I’ve got it running in 3440:1440 and it’s looking glorious. The in-game menus are easily rescaled and the game looks fantastic with its original 2002 assets and art. You can just play the classic game for the next seven billion hours with no issues at all.</p><p>One quick tip that caught me out in this modern era: The game defaults to having Jump on E, Activate on Space, and Use on Mouse 1. That’s bonkers, and you’ll likely want to rearrange them. But take note that “Activate” is the option that opens doors and the like, not “Use.” Use is in fact mostly “Attack,” so leave that on Mouse 1!</p><p>So, you enjoy that, I’m going to work out how easily I can play <em>Daggerfall</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

An evil emperor threatens the land and seeks to become an all-powerful god. It had a mix of old-school sprites and 3D environments combined with a decent soundtrack. The turn-based RPG formula did little to change things up, though there was a neat combo system. Mostly it nailed the basics, which isn’t something you could say for every Japanese RPG flooding the PS1. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gog.com/en/game/breath_of_fire_iv&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/breath_of_fire_iv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The GOG version</a></span> includes improved controller support, restores a bunch of missing environmental sounds, fixes other known crashes and bugs, and generally makes the game play nice with modern PC setups.

Its been 20+ years. This series is nowadays almost forgotten. Hell, people were not even born when this released!

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The <em>Breath of Fire</em> series began on the SNES in 1993 and was followed a year later by a very bold but uneven sequel. Both games were later ported to Game Boy Advance while <em>Breath of Fire III</em> and <em>IV</em> took the series into 3D on PlayStation. Capcom finally broke with the series’ beloved but increasingly stale conventional formula for <em>Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter</em> on PS2 which traded medieval fantasy for science fiction, changed the isometric view to third-person, and introduced hybrid real-time action elements and a story that unfolded over multiple playthroughs like a roguelite.</p><p>It was new, exciting, and sold terribly, and the<em> Breath of Fire</em> franchise has been all but dead since. Capcom briefly brought it back with a free-to-play mobile MMORPG called<em> Breath of Fire VI</em>. It was never localized outside of Japan and ceased operation within a year. The older games have been increasingly hard to play on modern platforms as well. <em>Breath of Fire I</em> and <em>II</em> are only available through Switch Online. <em>Breath of Fire III </em>and <em>IV</em> can only be purchased on PS3 and Vita. <em>Dragon’s Quarter</em> has never been brought back as part of Sony’s PS2 classics program. </p><p>Could that finally change? The Capcom of today is very different from the one of even a decade ago. Flying high on the success of <em>Resident Evil </em>and <em>Monster Hunter</em>, it’s recently dived into its back catalog to revive both <em>Okami</em> and <em>Onimusha</em> with full-fledged sequels. Last year’s <em>Metaphor: Refantazio </em>and this week’s<em> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em>have proven there’s still an appetite for classic turn-based RPGs with modern visuals and high-quality storytelling. Maybe it’s time Capcom returned to the <em>Breath of Fire</em> well. The franchise has<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/salesdata.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/salesdata.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> sold 3.3 million copies</a></span>, just 1 million less than <em>Okami</em>, which benefited from an HD remaster that’s currently available everywhere but mobile. </p><p>Capcom could start the <em>Breath of Fire </em>renaissance with remasters similar to what we just got with 2025's decent collections for  <em>Lunar: Silver Star Story</em>/<em>Lunar: Eternal Blue </em>and<em> Suikoden I/Suikoden II</em>. I mean, if Square Enix can give us an HD version of the infamously esoteric <em>SaGa Frontier 2</em>, <em>Breath of Fire</em> should be a slam dunk. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Earlier this year, Capcom revealed that the 2023 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/" data-ref-id="1900-6418047">Resident Evil 4 remake</a> hit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-4-remake-reaches-big-new-sales-milestone/1100-6528655/" data-ref-id="1100-6528655">9 million in sales</a> by the end of 2024. Now, Capcom has released a new video celebrating the game reaching the 10 million milestone.

		<p>Developer Full Circle has launched a brand new blog series in relation to the development of Skate, and that blog is called The Grind. In the debut post, Full Circle has released details about the playtests that have taken place for the game, stats from those playtests, how the game will function, and details about microtransactions.</p>
<p><iframe title="skate. Insider Playtest Highlights: February 2025 | skate." width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WesoA7BEZbo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It was previously confirmed that Skate will be a free to play title, and now on the back of that Full Circle has stated that there will be no offline mode for the game. In its The Grind blog post, the development team said, <em>“The game and city are designed to be a living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox that is always online and always evolving. You’ll see bigger things evolve, like changes to the city over time, as well as smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities. In order to deliver on our vision of a skateboarding world, the game will always require a live connection. That is probably not much of a surprise if you’ve been in our playtest.”</em></p>
<p>Speaking of the Skate playtest, Full Circle has confirmed that over 200,000 players have been invited to take part and provide feedback. Another thing about the playtest is that it has had microtransactions active within it. The reason given is so Full Circle can figure out the pricing models that will seem fair to players. Full Circle has also stated that anyone who has spent money in the playtest so far will get the value of that money back in the form of Skate’s premium in game currency San Van Bucks. The game will feature earnable currency called Rip Chips, and there will be no loot boxes. Full Circle has also reiterated that any new areas that get added to the game will be available to all players for free. In terms of some playtest stats, Full Circle has released how many times certain tricks have been performed.</p>

<ul>
<li>More than 16 million kickflips including nollie and varials.</li>
<li>More than 4.8 million 50-50 Grinds landed – nothin’ but bolts!</li>
<li>The Longest Grind (so far) – more than 200 meters! That’s about 15 school buses!</li>
<li>More than 40 million Total Wipeouts – Ouch!</li>
<li>More than 6.5 million Challenges completed</li>
</ul>
<p>Skate will feature cross play and cross progression. Full Circle has also stated the game is still scheduled to release into Early Access this year, but a release date is yet to be set.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-version-5-6-takes-you-back-to-mondstadt-in-may.1173753/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-56<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.6, and the main story chapter in this update will take you back to the land of Mondstadt for an "interlude chapter".</p>

<p>After the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-5-5-release-date" rel="nofollow">last update</a> took you to a lava-filled volcano and introduced you to the last tribe of Natlan, Version 5.6, also known as "Paralogism", takes things in a more nostalgic direction. It's launching across all platforms on May 7th.</p>

<p>In the new Archon Quest Interlude chapter, you'll travel back to Mondstadt in order to take part in an "unexpected trial" involving Albedo. You'll be investigating the crime associated with the trial, meeting figures from your past like Venti and the Knights of Favonius.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.6-release-date-escoffier.jpg?itok=EjgsvBwf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.6-release-date-escoffier.jpg?itok=ytNa1910 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As ever,&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.6 will introduce new characters for your team.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only that, but you'll be defending Mondstadt from monsters (or perhaps that should be mondsters), as well as taking part in a "magical trial" to secure the support of powerful mage Lady Alice in the defense of the city.</p>

<p>Two new characters will also be joining&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>in Version 5.6. The first, Escoffier, is a spear-wielding Cryo user who "blends culinary flair with elemental power". She can deal pretty heavy damage and heal allies thanks to her Cooking Mek.</p>

<p>Joining Escoffier in this update is Ifa, a 4-star Anemo catalyst wielder who hails from Natlan. He can automatically heal active characters when their HP drops below a certain point, making him ideal for players who prefer to get stuck into the action.</p>

<p>Escoffier and Ifa will be available during Version 5.6's first half, along with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-celebrates-version-43s-release-with-navias-graceful-gunbrella-gameplay" rel="nofollow">Navia</a>. Following that, reruns of Kinich and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/genshin-impact-raiden-shogun-baal-build-guide" rel="nofollow">Raiden Shogun</a> will be available in the second half, and the Chronicled Wish is also coming back, this time with characters from Inazuma up for grabs.</p>




<p>As always, three codes are also available for you to grab some free stuff in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, and here they are.</p>

<ul><li>GI56Paralogism - 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>
	<li>ChefEscoffier0507 - 100 Primogems, 5 Hero's Wit</li>
	<li>IfaCacucu0507 - 100 Primogems, 50,000 Mora</li>
</ul><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>is available to <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">play for free right now</a> on PC, PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices. Version 5.6, "Paralogism", launches on May 7th.</p>

But sometimes, the choices make perfect sense. The next life-sized <em>Pokémon </em>plush won’t be just <em>one</em> of these critters; it will be nine—all nine Eevee evolutions, to be exact.</p><p>Eevee is one of the most popular Pokémon in the series. Part of what makes the little fox-like creature so beloved is that it can evolve into one of eight (for now) forms, based on different energies. Everyone has a different favorite “Eeveelution” and there are a lot of fans who love the whole line so much that they’ll buy all of their merchandise in a set. Well those sickos better be ready to pay a pretty penny for the life-sized Eevee evolution plushies. At the moment, the nine plushies have only been announced for sale on the Japanese Pokémon Center website, but these do tend to make their way overseas shortly after. According to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pokeshopper.net/news&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pokeshopper.net/news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PokéShopper</em></a></span>, the Japanese sale for Eevee, Jolteon, Flareon, and Vaporeon runs until May 19. The Eevee plush, which is much smaller than its evolutions, costs 3,850 yen (roughly $27), while the larger fully-evolved plushies are 44,000 yen (around $306). That means collecting the whole range would cost you almost $2,500.

            <p>Gabriel Luna - who plays Joel's brother Tommy in the TV adaptation of The Last of Us - has spoken more about the second season's latest episode, specifically a key change made to Joel's story.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of spoilers for The Last of Us, both the game and the show, below. </strong></p>

<p>The most recent episode of The Last of Us takes place in the frozen and snow-covered wilderness of Jackson County, Wyoming. During the course of the episode, the residential settlement of Jackson is assaulted by a horde of infected, while Joel and Dina - played in the show by Pedro Pascal and Isebela Merced respectively - are on patrol in the surrounding area.</p>
<p>This is a change from The Last of Us Part 2 game, where Joel is on patrol with his brother Tommy, while Dina is on patrol with Ellie. Additionally, the show gives Tommy his own standalone hero moment not seen in the game, as he remains in Jackson and has a rather tense confrontation with a Bloater (among many, <em>many</em> other infected).</p>
<p>While all this is happening in the show, Dina and Joel come across Kaitlyn Dever's Abby, who convinces them to come back to the chalet she and her group are holding up in rather than heading back to Jackson.</p>
<p>In both the game and the show, it is this decision that marks the beginning of the end for Joel, as once his identity is revealed (in the show by Dina calling out to get the attention of her patrol partner, in the game by Tommy introducing them both), Abby kills him in revenge for her father's death at his hands.</p>

<p>Now, reflecting on the tweaks to the source material, Luna says he is glad the show changed Tommy's part in 'outing' Joel to Abby, adding he didn't believe the character would have been "that careless" in reality.</p>
<p>"The truth is, back when we were doing the first season, I talked to [showrunner] Craig [Mazin] and [game creator] Neil [Druckmann] about it. Would Tommy be that careless to reveal Joel's identity? As a seasoned veteran, somebody who had to protect this city and keep it safe, would he be so trusting of strangers? And then to walk into this ambush and be knocked out for that moment, unable to use any of his strength and skills to protect his brother, it always pinged in my mind - I wouldn't say false, but I don't know if Tommy would have been that trusting to walk into that trap," Luna said in conversation with <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a64523873/gabriel-luna-the-last-of-us-season-2-interview/">Esquire</a>.</p>
<p>The actor revealed Mazin, however, already had an idea in mind for the show. "Before the strike, he was starting to break the stories," Luna shared. "He sent me this Bible-long text about where Tommy is and what he's doing instead. And it floored me. I was so excited. I'm getting goose bumps now thinking about it."</p>
<p>Luna added that having Dina present when Joel was killed rather than Tommy serves her story arc in The Last of Us  as well. Dina is "somebody who still loves Joel and sees him as family, and would be devastated when this all goes down", the actor reasoned.</p>

			<p>Today, Funcom announced that a large scale beta weekend (with no NDA) for Dune: Awakening will take place between Friday, May 9 and Monday, May 12, allowing a significant number of players to try the game ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-has-been-delayed-to-june-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new launch date of June 10</a>. Fans can attempt to get in by requesting access via the game's Steam page. However, those who aren't lucky enough to be automatically invited may still obtain a code by watching the Global LAN Party Broadcast, which will be broadcast live from both London and PAX East. Funcom said tens of thousands of beta codes will be given away during the stream.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed by the article's headline, Funcom provided select press outlets, including ourselves, with advanced access to this beta build. Content-wise, this is the same thing you'll be playing in the upcoming public weekend: there are around twenty to twenty-five hours of gameplay, featuring the Hagga Basin South Region, the Eastern and Western Vermilius Gap Region, and parts of the story's first Act.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dune-Awakening-Screenshot-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>These first few hours are, perhaps unsurprisingly, almost entirely devoted to the survival and building aspects of Dune: Awakening. After character creation, where the player is given the choice of their starting skill tree, home planet, and background (noble or working class, for example), the Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit tasks you with a not-so-simple objective: head to Arrakis and find the surviving Fremen, who have been reportedly slaughtered by the Sardaukar, the Emperor's elite military force. The journey immediately starts to get complicated when the airship is shot down by a rocket launcher, leaving your character stranded in the desert with practically nothing on them. Thankfully, a mysterious character provides help and guidance through the very first part of the journey.</p>
<p>At this stage, it's all about surviving. First and foremost, there's the need to keep hydrated. This is Arrakis, after all, and water is the second most precious commodity after spice. Initially, you must gather dew from the few plants you'll encounter, though that kind of hydration can only fill you up a little. You also have to collect other resources, such as copper and metal, to create a variety of tools that can help you craft new items for your character and your base. To establish your property, you must first place a subfief console, which in turn lets you start building the base's foundation, walls, doors, roof, etc. Of course, some areas are off limits, but even the initial map is quite large and offers many places where building is allowed.</p>
<p>Eventually, you'll build a weak version of the iconic stillsuit, which helps greatly with water management. You'll also get access to a blood extractor that can be used to exsanguinate defeated foes. Blood can be consumed as is if you're desperately out of liquids, but that can make you sick. The ideal process is to bring it back to base and process it through a water purifier first.</p>
<p>You'll also need to pay a lot of care to sunlight exposure. When the sun is up and you're out in the open, a meter will quickly fill to urge you to the shadows. If the meter is filled, water starts depleting even faster. The game has a dynamic day and night cycle, so you'll only have to worry about this factor during daytime; however, the desert is patrolled by Sardaukar drones at nighttime. You'll want to avoid them at all costs.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dune-Awakening-Screenshot-3-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The last big environmental challenge is, of course, the sandworm. This is arguably the biggest threat early on in Dune: Awakening; whenever you cross the open sands, and depending on your current speed, there's a risk of alerting the deadly creature. Whenever that happens, players must rush to the nearest rocky ground - being swallowed by the sandworm also means irrevocably losing whatever was in your inventory (on the other hand, in PvE maps, dying by other means lets you rush back to your corpse to retrieve the dropped items).</p>
<p>Admittedly, I died a couple of times because of the sandworm, but it eventually became less of a bother, especially after I built my first sandbike. This is a fairly involved process of assembling various components, but it is well worth it. It's a massive improvement in your ability to travel the hostile game world that also offers no fast travel options, at least at this stage. Exploration feels good, at any rate, also thanks to the free-climbing (you can attempt to climb any surface, provided you've got enough stamina to make it to the top) feature, the shigawire claw (essentially a grappling hook), and the suspensor belt that lets you glide down without taking any fall damage.</p>
<p>Of course, Dune: Awakening also features a lot of combat. Melee is a big part of fights in this game, and there's a full gamut of actions available here, from blocking to dodging, from regular attacks to charged attacks. You can also equip three active abilities and three passive techniques from your skill trees.</p>
<p>At least in this beta, though, enemy variety was practically nonexistent. They're all ruthless (and nameless) killers and scavengers, hiding in the nooks and crannies of the desert or inside proper bases. In my explorations of the Hagga Basin map (which, interestingly, also resets its points of interest every once in a while due to Coriolis sandstorms <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-shows-off-its-ever-shifting-deep-desert-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like the Deep Desert PvP map</a>), I also found the botanical testing stations that Funcom previously discussed. Based on their description, I thought they'd be group dungeons, but at least the first one was just a regular soloable base without any boss-like encounters. They do have great loot and a few audio recordings for lore aficionados.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dune-Awakening-Screenshot-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Eventually, you'll run into the first outposts with NPCs that can provide you with contracts or even ask you to join their faction (for now, just Atreides or Harkonnen). There are a few missions here and there, but Dune: Awakening is not a game you'll play for the story. At its core, it is instead a survival sandbox crafting game like many others, albeit well-tailored to the Dune setting. What could truly set it apart from the veritable sea of such games is the MMO-like endgame part, where players form clans and join either Atreides and Harkonnen in a cyclic war for control of Arrakis and its spice, with potentially hundreds of players participating in large scale battles featuring combined arms warfare with ornithopters, buggies, and the ever-present threat of the sandworm to all parties. However, this was not in the beta, so we'll have to wait until launch before properly assessing the game.</p>

<p>Lastly, a few words about performance. The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and can look pretty at times, even though its Lumen global illumination is not accelerated with hardware ray tracing. The announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS Multi Frame Generation</a> is not yet available in the game, but the really worrying aspect is that even on a high-end PC (RTX 5090, Ryzen 7 9800X3D), stuttering was a constant presence during my play sessions.</p>
<p>I didn't measure it with software because Funcom may still be in the middle of optimizing the game. In fact, it could be the major reason behind the small delay from May 20 to June 10. Having said that, you can clearly see all the stutters in the gameplay video embedded above. Let's hope they can significantly improve optimization in these last few weeks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/review/la-quimera-short-but-not-sweet/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

						
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/sci-fi-co-op-shooter-la-quimera-arrives-on-pc-later-this-month/">La Quimera</a> is a new story-driven, linear FPS from Reburn, the studio formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine. While 4A Games was initially founded and entirely located in Ukraine, as Reburn chief executive officer Dmytro Lymar explained to Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-developer-qa-powered-by-unreal-engine-4-main-story-to-last-5-hours/">previously</a>, when the Russian Federation invaded Ukraine in 2014, the studio split between a Ukraine-based team and another based in Malta.</p>
<p>But Reburn didn't start developing La Quimera over a decade ago. Development began in 2020, after work on Metro Exodus was complete, and the studio took a new name shortly after Embracer Group acquired 4A Games.</p>
<p>Suppose you're like me, and you like a good story-driven, linear game, particularly a good story-driven FPS game, which feels like a rarity in the modern video game landscape. In that case, as I was, you'd probably be very excited by the pitch of 'developers who worked on the Metro games making a new sci-fi story-driven FPS that can also be played entirely in co-op.'</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/La-Quimera-Review-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Unfortunately, my excitement was quickly diminished when I sat down to play La Quimera. I'm sorry to say that my favorite thing about it is that it's a short game, and I was able to finish it in a little less than 5 hours.</p>
<p>I'm sympathetic to the fact that I absolutely cannot imagine what it was like for the Reburn team making this game over the last five years. I also appreciate that it's not asking for a full $70 with its much more budget-friendly $30 price tag. But a bad game is a rip-off at any price, and not only is La Quimera not worth your time, but in its current state, I wouldn't even say it is ready to be released.</p>
<p>I'll admit that I don't have the hardware to display La Quimera in its best graphical light. I grew up a console player and built my first PC, the same one I currently play games and what I used to play La Quimera five years ago, aiming for what I felt was mid-range and, more realistically, what I could afford at the time. It's got a Ryzen 5 3600, 16GB of RAM, and an RTX 2060 in it that have always been up to the task for whatever I've thrown at it, which has honestly mostly been indie games I got for cheap on Steam and whatever else I couldn't play on my PS5 or Xbox Series X.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/La-Quimera-Review-3-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I'm not trying to play at 4K/120fps with my 1440p monitor that caps out at 60fps. I built my PC the way I did because I needed a new computer at the time, so why not make it something that could decently play games as well? I'm giving all that context so that you understand when I say La Quimera is a bad game, I'm not talking about performance issues that a beefier PC would likely be able to push through.</p>
<p>I'm talking about bad audio that was either delayed or simply not there, and poor audio mixing that made loud crash scenes sound quiet. I'm talking about bugs like being unable to move my reticle up or down when aiming down sight on a controller, an issue that doesn't exist when I play with my keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>Enemies that are not fun to fight, whether humans or robots, the latter being half the combat encounters you'll face, should you play this game. Weapons that don't sound or feel like they have any weight to them, or feel like they're making an impact despite their admittedly cool designs.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/La-Quimera-Review-5-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Writing and voice acting that made me wonder whether the lines from the human characters were meant to sound as stilted as the lines from your AI companion or any other voice that came from a machine. A story that set up threads which go nowhere, as if to set up a sequel that I can tell you now I have no interest in playing.</p>
<p>Nothing about La Quimera feels finished. Every part feels like a disjointed piece of the project that the team at Reburn stitched together without actually creating a singular image. Even the gameplay sits at the top of the list of positive takeaways from La Quimera by virtue of not being entirely bad.</p>
<p>The futuristic setting and the exosuit you wear after the opening mission, which is one of three, provide you with more options to make each combat encounter a little more interesting to get through. The scanner you get paired with a weapon that can shoot through walls helps to give you time to breathe in La Quimera's more explosive firefights without actually taking yourself out of the fight.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/La-Quimera-Review-7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Being able to call up your own defensive drones to even the odds against the ones thrown at you, or taking a few moments to catch an enemy by surprise by entering a cloaked mode, are features I appreciate in a futuristic shooter. Not that there's any real stealth gameplay to go along with that latter feature, mind you, since enemies are quickly aware of your position once you've taken one of them out with a sneaky attack.</p>
<p>Regarding its setting, once again, I was intrigued by the idea of a futuristic dystopia set in Latin America, but what La Quimera's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/">Steam page</a> describes as a "<em>lush jungle</em>" and&nbsp;"<em>breathtaking megalopolis</em>" boils down to uninspiring levels with more grey than green on display and a story that throws in the odd Spanish word or phrase while everything else is in English.</p>
<p>I will say that it's clear a lot of work went into trying to make La Quimera look very sleek. I'm sure it would look more than fine if I had top-of-the-line hardware, but that proves that La Quimera is all sizzle and no steak. And while I'm not complaining that I didn't have to spend too long with it before the game ended, the short runtime doesn't give La Quimera any room to go anywhere.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/La-Quimera-Review-6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I could replay the missions to earn more of the in-game currency and upgrade my exosuit, but I can't say what I would get out of it. Maybe a fun video game, after I've played it enough times to get the rest of the upgrades, but why would the 'real' fun arrive so late in the experience?</p>
<p>Also, I will note that playing this ahead of release, I didn't get the chance to play it in co-op, which is an aspect of La Quimera that is consistently highlighted in its marketing. I could see it being more fun with friends at my side, jokingly mimicking the flat dialogue and running through the whole game in the same time it would take us to play a few rounds of whatever multiplayer game we could have been playing instead.</p>
<p>But that's not a winning argument for why you and your friends should download La Quimera and spend time with it over other games. And, as someone who was playing solo, the fact that La Quimera requires you to always be online, whether you're playing with other people or not, is absolutely a point against it. If I'm not playing with anyone, and it's a single-player experience, an offline mode should be available that lets me pause the game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/La-Quimera-screenshot-13-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I really wanted to like La Quimera. The idea of a quick, intense FPS that tells a good story that I could play through again with my friends is one I can get behind. Besides, it's not like there haven't been <a href="http://wccftech.com/titanfall-2-4-players-co-op-revealed-new-trailer-released/">excellent FPS games</a> with a short campaign that are incredibly fun to go back to again and again.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, La Quimera isn't one of them. While that could be a result of not enough development time, it's difficult to see this game improving tenfold if only its bugs were fixed. A lot more needs to be changed and reworked to bring La Quimera up to par to compete in today's overcrowded FPS market, even if it is one of the few offering a single-player focus over a multiplayer one.</p>

						<section>
				<p>La Quimera is an incomplete game, a mixture of stitched together parts that don't come together to make a full image. The amount of bugs are clear indicators that this game needed more time in development, but so is the underwhelming story and gameplay that aren't given enough time to go anywhere. If La Quimera was communicated as an Early Access release, then I'd be more hopeful for what's to come, but if this is meant to be the full game, it's not one that's worth your time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/breath-of-fire-iv-gog<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has announced a re-release of the classic PS1-era JRPG&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire IV</em>, which is now available via PC a quarter-century after its initial release on the PlayStation.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1915692579011649567" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, over 22,000 people voted for <i>Breath of Fire IV</i>'s inclusion as part of GOG's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">Preservation Program</a>, which aims to support games long after their publishers or developers cease doing so.</p>

<p>According to GOG, the new PC release of&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire IV</em>, which appears to be based on the original 2003 PC version rather than the PS1 version, is "fully optimized" for modern machines, sporting Windows 10 and 11 support, English and Japanese localizations, and various new options.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/breath-of-fire-iv-gog-planks.jpg?itok=qe_nIIan 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/breath-of-fire-iv-gog-planks.jpg?itok=lhmfTILX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Breath of Fire IV&nbsp;</em>is now available on PC thanks to the folks at GOG.</figcaption></figure><p>Other than those improvements, though, this remains very much the same&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire IV&nbsp;</em>you may already know and love from 2000, and if you don't (and you're a JRPG fan), then I'd recommend checking it out tout de suite.</p>

<p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire IV</em>, either. Other games joining the GOG Preservation Program today include the likes of&nbsp;<em>Worms Armageddon</em>,&nbsp;<em>Realms of the Haunting</em>, and three&nbsp;<em>Ultima&nbsp;</em>games, thus "completing the&nbsp;<em>Ultima&nbsp;</em>series in the Program", according to GOG.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire IV</em>, it is, as the name suggests, the fourth game in Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire&nbsp;</em>series. Like previous games, this one also has you playing as Ryu, although it's not the same Ryu in each game.</p>

<p>This time around, your perspective is split between Ryu, who's found naked in a sand ditch by allies Nina and Cray, and Fou-Lu, a recently-reawoken emperor looking to regain the throne he lost hundreds of years ago.</p>

<p><em>Breath of Fire IV&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/breath_of_fire_iv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via GOG</a>. Here's hoping for a&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire III&nbsp;</em>release sometime soon, as unlikely as that might be.</p>
