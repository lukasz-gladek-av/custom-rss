			<p>Cult of the Lamb was easily one of my favourite games of 2022, being a truly unique take on the cult simulator and roguelike battler.&nbsp;It’s a game that has stayed with me over the years, but while it has had a few DLCs over the years, there hasn’t been anything big enough to pull me back into the game. Time moved on and I had other things to play. That is, until we got Woolhaven.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cult of the Lamb | Woolhaven Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7FoRUNf8xns?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven is a spectacular expansion. In a way, it follows in the spiritual footsteps of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/04/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-review/">Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</a> in that it’s released a few years after after the base game and it’s almost the same size…</p>


<p>A DLC of this magnitude is certainly enough for us to dip our cloven hooves back in the water and see what’s going on. However, I immediately regretted not playing Cult of the Lamb game in three years, because I had no idea what state my cult was in. There were new systems and previous updates I had also completely missed, and I had a bit of catching up to do.</p>
<p>Tempting as it might have been to just start from scratch, you can only start Woolhaven after completing the base game. If you have time to start New Game+ (i.e. you aren’t working through a stack of other games to review), it might be better to start fresh and enjoy it all over again. Fortunately, the game is still relatively easy to pick back up, so I forged ahead on.</p>


<p>To reach Woolhaven, you need to have defeated the base game end boss, at which point a new totem appears in your base camp. Donate a few items to it and a new path opens up, taking our intrepid hero to the ruined mountain village, the ancestral home of your species.</p>
<p>As the last living lamb, you have caught the attention of the almost dead Yngya, Goddess of Winter and the forgotten deity of lambs. She was also slain by the Bishops and left to rot, so you have that in common. After resurrecting what little is left of her,&nbsp;she tasks you with not only making your collective killers pay, but returning the lost souls of your brethren to her.</p>
<p>In doing so, you not only restore her powers but raise the ghosts of her disciples. As they repopulate Woolhaven, you unlock a bevy of new features, like a ranch for livestock and a variation of Rock Paper Scissors. Some of these are cool, others a little woolly. You also get to pretty much double the size of your camp, which is nice.</p>

<p>What’s less nice is that as the Goddess of Winter grows, so does your to-do list. It starts out fairly manageable, with the weather turning a little cold, and people being a little chilly, but happily frolicking in the snow. However, once winter sets in, you quickly realise you have a life-threatening problem to contend with. The ground is frozen, you can’t grow crops and your followers will literally freeze to death.</p>
<p>You have to build a new furnace, unlock a ritual to lock in warmth and even build an onsen to thaw the cultists close to frozen death. Winter will quickly wreck you if you’re low on resources. If you thought you were in for an easy time, you’re sorely mistaken. This DLC is tough to bleat.</p>
<p>But that’s just the cult management side of things — there’s also the bit where the lamb brings the slaughter. The DLC adds two new procedurally generated dungeons. The first, Ewehaven, is where Yngya reigned before death. It’s all snowy cliffs with frozen fish in giant icicles poking out of the ground. After Yngya was slain, the evil Marchosias and his wolves moved in — your mission is to clear them out.</p>

<p>The second map is The Rot, which is exactly what you’d expect and forms the caves inside the mountain. There’s fewer wolves in here, and more demonic enemies alongside some returning characters.</p>
<p>As you might expect, both biomes bring new enemies, weapons, tarot cards and so on. There’s even a new Rotten follower type, which comes with its own pros and cons. Namely, they have no soul, so they don’t need to sleep. However, they always die in 10 days, no matter what happens. They’re a surprisingly useful addition to the team, even if they die annoyingly fast.</p>

<p>In all, there’s not much to complain about here, other than the occasional slowdown — I had a few rooms where it took 20 seconds of running around to force the enemies to spawn. Beyond that, the instructions aren’t always clear in terms of what you need to do, more so if you’ve been away for a long period of time.</p>

<p>Marathon is shaping up for a March release after a tumultuous 2025 that uncovered controversies, scepticism, and doubt. The game’s launch was delayed, and Bungie had to right a few wrongs before preparing to push out what could be the next generation of extraction shooters, challenging the paradigm set by the likes of Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>One sizeable piece of news to emerge in recent weeks was the departure of Joseph Cross, the game’s art director. After more than a decade at Bungie, the developer departed the project, mere months ahead of the game’s launch, and in a new interview, he has opened up on the situation.</p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-s-future-is-a-tentative-one">Marathon’s Future is a Tentative One</h2>



<p>Nobody can accurately predict how Marathon will perform when it launches on March 5th. It’s a tentative time for Bungie, as they’ve put a lot of eggs (and hope) in this basket, and should it fail, it could spell the beginning of a downward spiral for the studio.</p>



<p>Marathon is an extraction shooter, emerging into a genre popularized by the likes of Escape from Tarkov and ARC Raiders. It takes players and plants them into a unique, fictional world populated with AI enemies, other players, and environmental threats. Players must load into a game, loot, shoot, resolve quests, and get out again without succumbing to the violence within.</p>



<p>That’s the core gameplay loop, and it’s hopefully going to be enough to give Marathon a strong start out of the gate.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/exit-interview-joseph-cross-marathon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent interview</a>, Joseph Cross, the former art director working on Marathon, spoke about his contributions to the project. He said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I believe in what we’ve done. I think we did something really cool, and I think it will pan out. I can’t control the way the game plays. I’m not a designer. I’m not the game director. I can only control what I can control, and what I could control, I feel really good about. </p>



<p>And you can’t take that away from me, as much as the haters try online or wherever, and whether someone doesn’t happen to like the art direction personally, whether they don’t agree with some political thing Bungie did, or whatever the animosity du jour is, you can’t take the thing I care about the most away.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(<em>Thanks to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/former-marathon-art-director-says-what-i-could-control-i-feel-really-good-about-in-the-face-of-pre-release-animosity-you-cant-take-that-away-from-me/">PCGamer</a> for the spot</em>)</p>



<p>He explained that he feels ‘bummed’ about the debate regarding Marathon’s art style and whether it makes sense in the extraction shooter space, which typically focuses on realism (except for the likes of Escape from Duckov).</p>



<p>Marathon will be released on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on March 5th, and it’s hard to tell right now how much of a success it will be.</p>

<p>Behaviour Interactive recently invited Dead by Daylight fans to help shape the game’s future by voting on the next survivor and killer character models. Right now, you can head to the Dead by Daylight website and piece together your votes on the next major characters to appear in the game.</p>



<p>There are four options for the survivors, and three for the killers, and while the survivors are mostly run-of-the-mill characters, the killers are much more intriguing. You can see all the options below.</p>







<h2 id="h-who-will-you-choose-in-dbd">Who Will You Choose in DBD?</h2>



<p>Dead by Daylight remains a popular survival title, even a decade after launch. If you venture into the game now, you’ll still see fresh collaborations, content updates, and a strong community backing the game as it approaches its ten-year anniversary.</p>



<p>For instance, in January, a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-devs-announce-second-collab-with-stranger-things/">Stranger Things crossover</a> surfaced, introducing fresh characters to the game based on the most recent season of the hit television show.</p>



<p>When you head to the <a href="https://thegrimoire.deadbydaylight.com/?utm_campaign=grimoire-voting-page&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dead by Daylight website</a>, you’ll find that you’re presented with ‘The Grimoire’, a book that allows you to vote and shape the game’s future.</p>



<p>It starts with four options for the game’s next survivor:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Once you’ve voted, you’re presented with three options for the killer’s ‘silhouette’:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s difficult to tell what the resulting killer will look like, but the silhouettes are imposing enough, so that’s nice.</p>



<p>Based on the Stranger Things collaboration, the most recent killer added to Dead by Daylight is <strong>Vecna</strong>, otherwise known as The First. He was added recently after The Krasue, a Southeast Asian spirit with a gory appearance.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Creator Claims They Were Paid ‘A Sandwich’ For Attending Highguard Event]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-event-creator-paid-a-sandwich/</link>
            <guid>1415803</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Highguard is being released today after several weeks of near radio silence following a sudden unveiling at The Game Awards. It has proven to be a troublesome period for Wildlight, the game’s developer, owing to <strong>many </strong>doubting the validity of the game itself. It has received almost <strong>zero </strong>marketing beyond the initial trailer drop.</p>



<p>Recently, an invite-only event was held in Los Angeles for creators and industry personalities to get hands-on with the title. Naturally, doubters have pushed the rhetoric that they’re only hyping the game up because they were invited to this all-expenses-paid event and handed a bag of cash.</p>



<p>It seems that wasn’t the case, at least for some.</p>







<h2 id="h-were-creators-paid-to-play-highguard">Were Creators Paid to Play Highguard?</h2>



<p>It might not be the case for <strong>every creator</strong>, but in a post on social media, TheMacroShow revealed that they weren’t paid a dime to attend the Highguard event in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>Further, Macro stated they were <strong>offered money </strong>to make a video on the game, but ‘refused because I wanted my audience to have my real opinion on the game.’</p>



<p>It was then claimed that Wildlight didn’t provide a flight, hotel, or ‘even an Uber’ for the event, and that the only ‘compensation’ received was a ‘sandwich during the lunch break.’</p>



<p>Macro wrapped up his statement by stressing that he ‘genuinely had fun playing this game.’</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Unfortunately, his comment was mostly lost in a gargantuan sea of messages from creators far and wide, all pledging their allegiance to Highguard and declaring it a phenomenal game. It echoes Geoff Keighley, who has been a one-man marketing team for Highguard since he hosted the game’s first trailer at The Game Awards.</p>



<p>Wildlight has chosen to take one of the more controversial, inorganic approaches to marketing Highguard. It’s something that’s fast becoming despised by gamers worldwide, and it’s focused entirely on hosting <strong>creator-backed events </strong>and campaigns to promote a game at launch.</p>



<p>In one comment, user ‘KingdumbHD’ wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>All the random online influencers and game journalists suddenly praising and trying to hype up <strong>Highguard</strong> really does feel like the most unnatural, fake ass marketing Ive seen in a long while. Like why would I trust any of their opinions when you’ve obviously <strong>paid</strong> them to say it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In another, a response to a creator hyping the game, Vurkkz wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>dude is absolutely being <strong>paid</strong> to promote the game. there’s also a few content creators out there that are “super excited for <strong>highguard</strong>” I truly hate how bought modern multiplayer games are. Absolutely no organic growth at all anymore.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Highguard will be released later today.</p>

<p>The head of Xbox Games Studio, Craig Duncan, has commented on the current state of development for State of Decay 3.</p>



<p>State of Decay 3 was first announced back in July 2020. The last time any public movement indicating development was in 2024, when a trailer dropped with brief gameplay clips. Now, Craig Duncan is confirming that he’s played the game and that Xbox Games Studio remains optimistic about the franchise.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/xbox-game-studios-lead-cant-say-when-state-of-decay-3-will-rear-its-head-again-but-he-will-certainly-see-a-lot-more-of-it-in-the-coming-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">During a recent interview with GamesRadar+ </a>following the Xbox Developer Direct, Duncan was asked whether fans of the open-world zombie series could expect new information or gameplay footage this year. He did not give a straightforward answer, but he noted that he’s visited the studio several times in the past year and remains excited about the potential of the next State of Decay.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Here’s what I’ll say: I have done a number of visits to that studio in the last six to eight months. I have sat and played the game with the team a bunch of times. It’s coming on really well.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Following the Xbox Developer Direct, Craig Duncan was much more focused on the Fable reboot and the immediate future of Xbox in 2026. </p>







<p>He stated that he knows they have been inconsistent about which of their games head to other platforms as they continue to move forward with their new marketing strategy that encourages players to play Xbox games on all platforms.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The head of Sonic Team has commented on potentially adding “deep-cut” Sonic characters to the game’s roster in future Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds DLC.</p>



<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds was released in 2025 to critical acclaim. As part of the game’s hook, several crossover characters from other universes were added to the roster and the possibilities. These characters include SpongeBob, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Minecraft characters, and more.</p>



<p>However, there is a catalog of Sonic characters lost to time that could also have their moment in the new racing game.</p>







<h2 id="h-sonic-racing-crossworlds-should-represent-all-eras-of-sonic">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Should Represent All Eras of Sonic</h2>



<p>Takashi Iizuka was recently interviewed by <a href="https://mcvuk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MCV Magazine </a>(<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sonic-boss-says-hes-open-to-adding-deep-cut-sonic-characters-as-crossworlds-dlc/">h/t: Video Games Chronicle</a>). In the interview, he was asked about seeing deeper cuts from Sonic lore coming to the game as possible downloadable content, specifically characters from the ’90s animated TV series or the IDW comics.</p>



<p>Takashi Iizuka noted that he sees the passion around the extended universe and wants all eras of Sonic represented, so anything’s possible with the opportunity feels right.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“There’s a lot of passion around the extended Sonic universe, and we’re open to including the ‘deep cut’ characters if the opportunity feels right,” Iizuka replied. “We want Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds to represent all eras of Sonic.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While this doesn’t confirm the return of fan-favorite characters like Sally Acorn, it does leave the door open for that level of surprising additions in the future.</p>







<p>Speaking of Sonic’s deep history, the franchise is currently celebrating its 35th anniversary. As part of that celebration, a new audio drama is coming to podcast platforms based around the Chaotix.

<p>Can an MMO developer deliver a kick-ass open world action/adventure game with RPG elements? That's the unspoken question behind <strong>Crimson Desert</strong>. South Korean developer <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> achieved incredible success with their debut game, 2014's MMORPG <strong>Black Desert Online</strong> (known simply as Black Desert on consoles). In February 2024, almost ten years after the game's original PC launch, the studio could boast a player base of <strong>over 55 million users</strong> across all platforms (including mobile) and a lifetime revenue of <strong>more than $2 billion</strong>.</p>



<p>With all this money, Pearl Abyss <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-to-acquire-eve-onlines-ccp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired CCP Online</a></strong>, the maker of <strong>EVE Online</strong>, and conceived several new projects, three of which <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-showcases-stunning-debut-trailers-for-crimson-desert-plan-8-and-dokev-mmo-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were announced at G-Star 2019</a>: the shooter <strong>Plan 8</strong>, which hasn't been mentioned in a long time; the creature-collecting game <strong>DokeV</strong>, still in development; and Crimson Desert, which had its own lengthy development phase but is now very close to being available.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="release-date-platforms-pricing">Release Date, Platforms, and Pricing</h2>



<p id="h-release-date-platforms-and-pricing">The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally meant to launch in <strong>Winter 2021</strong></a>, but Pearl Abyss <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opted for an indefinite delay</a> as it reworked several aspects of the game. The developers went silent for a couple of years and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-at-gamescom-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resurfaced at Gamescom 2023</a> with an awesome new trailer. From that point, Crimson Desert communication became more regular, eventually leading to an official <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Fall 2025</strong> launch window</a>. The team needed a little more time, though, and delayed it to Q1 2026, which was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-has-release-date-recommended-requirements-reduced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">formalized as the final release date of <strong>March 19, 2026</strong></a>. We can now add that <strong>further delays are unlikely</strong>, as Pearl Abyss confirmed a few days ago that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-release-date-gone-gold-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game has reached gold status</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Crimson Desert will be available on <strong>PC</strong>, <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, and <strong>Xbox Series S and X</strong>. There are three editions available for pre-order: </p>



<ul>
<li>Standard Edition: <strong>$70</strong> (base game only)</li>



<li>Deluxe Edition: <strong>$90</strong> physical / <strong>$80</strong> digital. The physical one includes a steelbook case, developer letter, Greymane brooch pin, three character photo cards, three patches, fabric map, and in-game DLC: Kairos Plate Set armor, Balgran Shield, Exclaire Horse Tack Set. The digital one, as you'd expect, only includes the in-game DLC. </li>



<li>Collector's Edition: <strong>$499.99</strong> (all the above, as well as a 17-inch diorama of Kliff versus the <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gameplay-shows-off-boss-fight-against-mechanical-dragon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Golden Star mechanical dragon</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>All pre-orders of the game will receive the <strong>Khaled Shield</strong> in-game item.</p>

<h2 id="genre-setting-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Crimson Desert can be best described as a <strong>single player open world action/adventure game with RPG elements</strong>. It is set in a medieval fantasy world, specifically the large continent of <strong>Pywel</strong>, where multiple factions fight for control of the land. </p>



<p>The protagonist, <strong>Kliff Macduff</strong>, is a seasoned mercenary of the <strong>Greymanes</strong>, a kinship-bound fighting order. <strong>The Greymanes are, however, struck down at the very beginning of the narrative</strong>, when the <strong>Black Bears faction</strong> ambushes and decimates them, scattering survivors across Pywel. From there onward, <strong>Kliff's mission is to reunite his scattered order</strong>, including Oongka, Yann, and Naira, and exact revenge on the enemy leader <strong>Myurdin</strong>, but there's more at play in the political landscape amid a broader collapse of centralized authority. <strong>The King of Demeniss has fallen into a mysterious coma</strong>, creating a power vacuum that various factions, including the aforementioned Black Bears, other warlords, and even ancient forces, are seeking to exploit to gain control.</p>



<p>Kliff, an unlikely political player, <strong>is tasked with protecting an artefact of unclear significance</strong> while rebuilding his mercenary company. Based on what Pearl Abyss has shared so far, the narrative will emphasize themes of <strong>leadership under duress</strong>, <strong>the cost of survival</strong>, and <strong>redemption</strong>.</p>

<p>As briefly touched upon earlier in this roundup, Crimson Desert had to be massively reworked before it could be released. That's because <strong>it was initially unveiled as an MMO-like game</strong> in the vein of Black Desert. The story of Macduff and his crew was already there, but so were many MMO features, which were eventually removed until <strong>it became a single-player-only game</strong>.</p>



<p>The developers have instead doubled down on creating a massive and immersive open world game. The studio recently confirmed that size estimates put the continent of Pywel at <strong>twice the size of Skyrim</strong> in The Elder Scrolls V, and it's also <strong>larger than the already big playable map of Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption 2</strong>. The game world is completely seamless (there will be little to no loading screens), and traversal options include horseback riding, <strong>dragonback flight</strong>, mechanical mech with jet propulsion, and climbing/parkour mechanics. </p>



<p>There will be plenty of side content, including <strong>non-combat activities like fishing, cooking, hunting, arm wrestling, sheep wrangling, and horse taming</strong>. However, <strong>the fighting is central to Crimson Desert</strong> and features incredible complexity. Pearl Abyss took inspiration from retro arcade fighting games, such as Samurai Showdown, Final Fight, and King of Fighters, rather than contemporary Soulslikes. The combat system includes multi-button combinations, linked attacks, and more. It'll require more time to master than the average action/adventure game, that's for sure, but it could also be the game's defining feature when it's all said and done.</p>



<p>Kliff's combat toolkit lets players choose between <strong>swords, spears, bows, spells, grapples, wrestling throws, Taekwondo kicks (which were motion-captured from martial artists), and punches</strong>. Defensive mechanics feature stamina-draining blocks, precise parries that enable counterattacks, and dodge rolls with perfect dodge windows restoring the stamina resource. Furthermore, interaction with the environment can also be exploited by throwing enemies into hazards, igniting fire traps, toppling structures, detonating magical spells mid-air, and exploiting weakpoints.</p>



<p><strong>There is, of course, equipment customization</strong>. Various armor sets (helm, chest, gloves, boots, cloaks, rings, amulets) offer different stat modifiers, like defense (physical/magical mitigation), health/stamina pools, resistance to specific damage types (fire, ice, elemental), skill cooldown reductions, and damage boosts for weapon types. </p>



<h2 id="tech-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>Crimson Desert runs on the proprietary <strong>Black Space Engine</strong>, which the South Korean studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-blackspace-engine-showcase-demonstrates-big-tech-advancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed in depth during a GDC 2025 presentation attended by Wccftech</a>. Black Space was <strong>designed to render vast, fully seamless open worlds without sacrificing details</strong>. It is <strong>powered by several simulation systems</strong>, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Dynamic weather</li>



<li>Cloth, hair, trees, and grass behave believably and are affected by wind movement</li>



<li>Environments that support real-time destructibility</li>



<li>Highly realistic waves, currents, and ripples thanks to the engine's FFT Ocean simulation and Shallow Water simulation</li>



<li>Volumetric fog and detailed atmospheric scattering effects, and dynamic weather</li>



<li>Ray tracing</li>
</ul>



<p id="h-tech-and-specs">On PC, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-little-nightmares-iii-and-crimson-desert-all-launching-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been confirmed to support <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</strong></a> for GeForce RTX users. AMD users can also look forward to <strong>three FSR RedStone</strong> features: <strong>Upscaling</strong>, <strong>Frame Generation</strong>, and <strong>Ray Regeneration</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Kota Furushima, the game director of Beast of Reincarnation, has commented on Game Freak’s history of criticism for how its 3D open-world games look and run.</p>



<p>Game Freak is best known for its work on the Pokémon franchise. Pokémon, while a beloved IP, does not feature 3D games that fully maximize hardware potential in 2026. Sometimes, recent Pokémon games have struggled to function properly. However, Beast of Reincarnation, the new game from Game Freak, looks to be a game on par with most.</p>







<h2 id="h-game-freak-prioritizes-creating-experiences">Game Freak Prioritizes Creating Experiences</h2>



<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beast-of-reincarnation-game-director-answers-all-our-burning-questions-about-the-pokemon-developers-upcoming-action-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Kota Furushima addressed these criticisms. He noted that, overall, they’re always striving to create a unique experience rather than hyper-fixating on reaching a certain quality Benchmark.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our focus is on that gameplay experience. Part of that, of course, is making sure that it performs really well, but our attention is more on getting the experience over to you and making sure that our vision can get to your hands and your hearts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, he spoke about the game being centered on natural environments and very rooted in Japanese inspiration. He also noted that the video game’s score was rooted in themes of loneliness and isolation, while also emphasizing the importance of learning to rely on others.</p>







<p>Beast of Reincarnation is slated to release this summer.

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero will be receiving some new DLC in the near future.</p>



<p>The Dragon Ball team has announced that the latest console game in the Dragon Ball franchise, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, will receive a major DLC release this summer. The DLC was released as part of the franchise’s 40th anniversary celebration. As part of the celebration, a trailer revealed that Super Android 17 would be coming to the game. </p>



<p>As well as the ‘Great Demon King’ Piccolo, the villainous version of Piccolo from the original Dragon Ball series. Super Saiyan Bardock is also on his way to the franchise. More names are also planned to join the lineup.</p>



<p>Additionally, there will be new cosmetics and other skill customizations. The trailer also teases a new single-player game mode. More is expected to be announced in the coming months.</p>

<h2 id="h-there-s-also-a-new-dragon-ball-game-coming-in-2027">There’s Also A New Dragon Ball Game Coming in 2027</h2>



<p>Additionally, the celebration revealed that a new game project is in the works. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-age-1000-fans-dragon-ball-online/">Known as “Age 1000,</a>” it was accompanied by a brief trailer. Work on Age 1000 began more than 5 years ago, and Akira Toriyama, the franchise’s creator, worked on the game’s world-building and even on some brand-new characters. Great news for longtime fans of the series who thought that Toriyama’s passing in 2024 might have meant that the last of his work had already been seen.</p>







<p>More information about the forthcoming game will be revealed during Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026 in April.</p>



<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is currently available for purchase on all Xbox consoles, PlayStation 5, Steam, and the Nintendo Switch family of consoles.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Exploration:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lv.?: First Aid Spray: uses a healing medical spray on a single ally, recovering HP equal to ?% of Rebecca's Attack.</li>
<li>Lv.?: Molotov Cocktail: Every 20 seconds, lobs a Molotov cocktail. When the Molotov cocktail lands, it sets the area on fire for 10 seconds, dealing damage equal to ?% of Attach per second to any enemies within the area. Enemies affected by the flames are burned, taking damage equal to ?% of Attack per second for five seconds.</li>
<li>Lv.?: Herbal Mix: Every 12 seconds, Rebecca mixes herbs, recovering HP equal to ?% of Rebecca's Attack for all allies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Field:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lv.?: Combat Medical Expertise: Increases the attack of the deployed squad by ?% and Defense by ?%.</li>
<li>Lv.?: Stimulant: When deployed Allied squad attacks, there is a 25% chance to deal ?% increased damage.</li>
<li>Lv.?: Anesthetic: When deployed Allied squad attacks, there is a 40% chance to take ?% reduced damage.</li>

<p>The team did not confirm specifically when Chambers would be reporting for duty, but she's apparently "headed your way soon".</p>
<p>Capcom reckons Resident Evil: Survival Unit offers "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-survival-unit-stars-a-bunch-of-your-favourites-including-leon-jill-claire-and-the-real-mvp-barry-burton">a fresh, mobile-first gameplay experience</a> that diverges from the traditional survival horror format of the main series". It has already been downloaded over a million times.</p>

Don't expect news from us too soon, but rest assured, Rayman is in good hands."</p>
<p>To mark the 30th anniversary of Rayman, Gounon also announced Ubisoft will be sharing behind-the-scenes anecdotes, interviews, concept art, and more.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has wiped over a third off its share price after announcing a "reset" would close down two studios and cancel six games.</p>
<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/22/ubisoft-shares-plummet-after-assassins-creed-maker-cancels-six-games.html">CNBC</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/ubisoft-shares-plummet-to-lowest-price-in-over-14-years-amid-its-recently-announced-restructuring-centered-on-cancellations-layoffs-and-generative-ai/">PC Gamer</a>), the stock price had progressively declined since the pandemic, but on Thursday - the day after its announcement - it plummeted another 34 percent. It's the lowest share price the company has had since 2011, when it reported losses in the multi-millions, and closed at just €4.06. Just seven days prior, the share price was €6.89.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">Ubisoft closed two studios and cancelled six projects</a> - including its much-delayed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake - last week as part of a major restructuring effort that will also see delays for seven games. Described as a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset", the publisher/developer said the cuts come as it struggles to compete in a "persistently more selective AAA market and an increasingly competitive shooter landscape".</p>
<p>As well as the six cancellations, Ubisoft has also confirmed it is delaying seven unspecified games "to ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met" and to "maximise long-term value creation". Though not confirmed, it's widely believed that this includes the unannounced but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">much-rumoured Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake</a>.</p>
<p>All this has led Ubisoft to revise its guidance for the full financial year, saying it now expects net bookings of around €1.5bn - a reduction of €330m.</p>
<p>As Matt reported for us at the time, the restructuring will now see the publisher split its efforts across five "creative houses", respectively focused on "scaling and extending" its biggest properties (including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six); on competitive and cooperative shooter experiences (The Division, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell); on live experiences (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/for-honor">For Honor</a>, The Crew, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/riders-republic">Riders Republic</a>, Brawlhalla, Skull &amp; Bones); on immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes (Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia, Beyond Good &amp; Evil), and on casual and family games.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft">Former Assassin's Creed leader Marc-Alexis Côté is reportedly suing Ubisoft following a surprise and suspicious departure from the company last year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="59e46ca28b147"><a title="Robert Burns Night AC" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/59e46ca28b147/robert-burns-night-ac.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>"Aloha!" as we say here in Scotland, and welcome to an impromptu Nintendo Life Burns Night celebration, with me, an Irish fella.</p>
<p>Now, for those unaware, and to get things off in a high-brow sort of way through the illusion of learning, Robert Burns was a Scottish poet, now the country's national poet no less, who lived from 1759 until 1796. Just 37 years. However! In this tragically short lifespan, he managed to imprint himself permanently on the Scottish psyche through his powerful works which contributed greatly to the Romantic movement, don't you know.</p><div><figure data-videoid="CiNQNWrXoic" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CiNQNWrXoic?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytCiNQNWrXoic" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CiNQNWrXoic?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CiNQNWrXoic?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed82b568jsynkt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>The fact that Burns wrote in a Scots dialect (although he did use a watered-down version, making his verses and lyrics much easier to parse for non-native speakers) made him incredibly popular and personal to the Scots, and in death he's become a figure of inspiration for socialist and liberal movements, in particular.</p>
<p>Of course, we probably all know <strong>Auld Lang Syne</strong>, his poem which became lyrics sung on New Year's Eve to "ring in the bells" as folk say up here in Scotland (they kidnapped me in 2007 and made me live here, please help). But other works — and we're getting to the end of the learning bit now, class, so stay strong — include very well-known stuff like <strong>A Red, Red Rose</strong> and <strong>Tam o' Shanter</strong>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b9ab63965a8a5"><a title="Robert Burns Night AC" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b9ab63965a8a5/robert-burns-night-ac.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, Tam o' Shanter. That's right. If this rings a bell, gamers, it's because back in 2010 Nintendo helped celebrate Burns Night with a special Animal Crossing item. Burns Night — which happens every 25th January (Burns' birthday) and which I'm currently enjoying immensely, thank you — sees some folk in Scotland read and/or perform from a selection of the poets' works, eat lots of haggis, neeps and tatties (that's turnip and potatoes to you), and, well, some people may even like to have small thimble of whiskey, too. Then straight to bed!</p>
<p>If you happened to have been playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/animal_crossing_city_folk">Animal Crossing: City Folk</a>, or <strong>Animal Crossing: Let's Go To The City</strong> as it was known o'er here — sorry, went all Burns there — back in 2010, you'll have got to celebrate your very own Burn's Night by nabbing a very exciting (mild sarcasm detected) "Tam o' Shanter" hat. Aye, a wee Scottish tartan bonnet for putting oan the in-game heid eh a bonnie wee lad/and or lassie. (Apologies to all my Scottish friends for that sentence.)</p>
<p>The coolest thing about this particular hat, as you'll no doubt already know, was that it gave your character a shaggy new Scottish hairdo as an extra to boot, and this celebration of Scotland's national bard has also gone on to feature in both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">Animal Crossing: New Leaf</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> (hey, that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">just got an update!</a>).</p>
<p>So, seeing as it's Burns Night and all that, and seeing how I'm currently in Glasgow, the unofficial capital of Scotland, why not join me, in...well...it's not exactly the same as raising a glass to the great man, but why not hop into your copy of Animal Crossing: New Horizons (or New Leaf), stick yer hat oan, and join me in some deep breathing exercises as we consider Robert Burns, and his many, many excellent poems. But most especially Tam o' Shanter, as it's the one holding this vaguely game-related article together.</p>
<p>With me? Right! Can't find your Tam o' Shanter? To nab the headgear in New Horizons, you need to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/animal-crossing-new-horizons-gulliver-souvenir-list-how-to-wake-up-where-to-find-communicator-parts">get it from Gulliver as a reward for helping him find his communicator parts</a>. No worries, you can just jump into the game's custom designs portal to look for (or design!) some Scottish and tartan-themed gear. If you're wondering, you got the hat from Pelly or Phyllis at the Post Office in New Leaf.</p>

<p>Once you've got your hat on, and have your plate of haggis (that's sheep liver, lungs, heart, etcetera, all mixed up with delicious oatmeal, or there's a veggie option available!), grab yourself a thimble of something delicious and we'll offer up a toast to Rabbie Burns, and to Animal Crossing, I guess, on this latest Burns Night.</p>
<p>And to close out, here's a little excerpt from Tam o' Shanter, in which we contemplate the transient nature of joy, man's inability to control time, and the nature of mortality. Annnnnnnd relax:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>But pleasures are like poppies spread,<br>
You seize the flow'r, its bloom is shed;<br>
Or like the snow-falls in the river,<br>
A moment white–then melts forever . . .<br>
. . .<br>
Or like the rainbow's lovely form<br>
Evanishing amid the storm.–<br>
Nae man can tether time or tide;<br>
The hour approaches Tam maun ride;<br>
That hour o' night's black arch the key-stane,<br>
That dreary hour Tam mounts his beast in;<br>
And sic a night he taks the road in,<br>
As ne'er poor sinner was abroad in.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I'm off over to Wikipedia to get this Animal Crossing malarkey added to the site's official list of cultural references for Robert Burns.</p>
<p>Gabh cùram!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>As a retro gaming fan, I was thrilled when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122341/apple-app-store-game-emulators-super-apps">Apple opened its App Store to emulators in 2024</a>, but I’ve yet to find a controller that makes me want to fully embrace retro gaming on my phone.</p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/661382/the-new-backbone-pro-could-be-the-one-controller-for-all-your-gaming">Clamp-on controllers like the Backbone Pro</a> are a bit too bulky, and I don’t want to prop my phone up somewhere to use a standalone gamepad. The Abxylute M4 seemed exactly what I was looking for when it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/809274/abxylute-m4-snap-on-mobile-wireless-smartphone-controller-magnetic-magsafe">debuted a few months ago</a>. It’s a compact wireless gamepad that uses a magnetic mount to attach to my iPhone. It’s a clever design, but one that’s let down by stiff thumbsticks and a magnetic mount that doesn’t always feel like it’s securely supporting my phone.</p><p>There are two components to the Abxylute M4: a retro-looking rectangular gamepad that connects to your smartphone over Bluetooth, and a Q-shaped mount that attaches the controller to your phone so it feels like you’re playing a handheld console. The mount is compatible with MagSafe iPhone models and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762426/google-qi2-wireless-charger-pixelsnap-pixel-10-series">Google Pixel 10 Series</a>. I primarily tested it with an iPhone 16 Pro, but Abxylute includes an adhesive metal ring you can stick to the back of any phone to make it compatible.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The M4’s magnetic mount can double as a smartphone stand using a ring-shaped kickstand.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The ring of magnets on the M4’s mount stuck to the back of my iPhone as securely as any MagSafe accessory or Qi2 charger I’ve ever used. It’s not going to come off until you want it to. It also features a smooth finish, allowing you to rotate the mount and attach the gamepad so that it completely hides behind your phone instead of hanging off the side. But the whole thing ends up being too bulky and thick to slip into a pocket, so I’ve been removing it entirely when not playing.</p><div id=":R1j2r6eqb96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The M4 controller doesn’t protrude far enough from the bottom of a phone to play games in a portrait orientation.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The M4 can be attached so it completely hides behind your phone. But you’ll need giant pockets to carry it around like this.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>One limitation of the M4’s design is that when attached, it can only be used to play games in a landscape orientation. In a vertical mode, the controller doesn’t protrude far enough for all its controls to be accessible. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but as a decades-old Game Boy fan, I tend to prefer playing games vertically. Recently announced mobile controllers like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860093/pocket-taco-pocket-taco-pocket-taco">GameSir Pocket Taco</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860160/8bitdo-flippad-hands-on">8BitDo FlipPad</a> support that.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The mount attaches to the M4 controller using one of two magnetic connectors.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>A far bigger issue with the M4’s design, and a potential deal-breaker, is the connection between the mount and the controller. It also relies on a strong magnet that makes the controller snap into place when attached to the mount. But the connection doesn’t feel strong enough to always keep the mount securely connected to the controller while your phone’s attached.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The mount’s connection to the M4 controller feels strong, but it doesn’t take a lot of force for it to accidentally disconnect.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The connection between the mount and controller feels secure enough when I’m holding the M4 and my phone up in front of me while playing a game. But at some angles, or when I accidentally bump my phone, the mount can separate from the gamepad. The two will also consistently disconnect if you absentmindedly turn the whole thing upside down, sending the phone and the attached mount falling. Thankfully, all my testing was done on a soft sofa.</p><p>I’m not the only one to experience this behavior. <a href="https://retrododo.com/abxylute-m4-controller-review/"><em>Retro Dodo</em>’s Brandon Saltalamacchia</a> did, too. The connection might fare better with a lighter phone, like the iPhone Air, but given smartphones are now a significant investment (my iPhone 16 Pro cost just shy of CA$1,500 here in Canada, or around $1,100 US), I’m not comfortable using the M4 as it’s designed.</p><p>The M4 isn’t entirely dependent on its magnetic mount. It can be used as a standalone controller with phones, consoles, or any device that supports Bluetooth gamepads. I was surprised at how comfortable it was to use with my gigantic hands. Its square-shaped design lets me reach the M4’s shoulder buttons without contorting my index fingers, and the build quality feels solid.</p><div id=":R1n2r6eqb96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The M4 controller’s action buttons are small, but the D-pad feels comfortably sized, even for my large thumbs.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>There’s two pairs of shoulder buttons atop the M4 controller, which I found easy to reach without having to overstretch my fingers.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>The controller’s four action buttons are small but have a satisfying amount of resistance. They’re paired with a large D-pad that’s a bit mushy and prone to registering inputs from multiple directions, but adequate for pick-up-and-play gaming sessions. Choose a different controller if you’re chasing high scores.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The M4’s analog joysticks feature a sliding disc design similar to what the Nintendo 3DS offered. But on the M4 they’re stiff and uncomfortable to use.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Abxylute includes two analog joysticks, a feature rarely found on controllers this size. They use a sliding disc design similar to what Nintendo used on the 3DS — but less effective. The sliding joysticks on the M4 are stiff and uncomfortable, making subtle movements nearly impossible. My thumb ached after just a handful of races in <em>Mario Kart World</em>, and I can’t see myself using either of the joysticks again.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>For $49 the Abxylute M4 is one of the more affordable ways to turn your smartphone into a handheld console, but the risks don’t feel worth it.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>As compact controllers go, the $49 Abxylute M4 is good, but far from great. But that’s not why people are going to buy it. Its promise of turning a smartphone into a handheld console helped the company raise over $300,000 from nearly 6,000 backers on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1932181238/m4-snap-on-magnetic-phone-controller-for-anytime-pocket-play">Kickstarter</a> — a lot of whom I think will be frustrated or disappointed if they’re not extra cautious while using it. Trusting your $1,000 mobile device to the M4 requires a leap of faith that’s a bit too far for me.</p><p><em>Photos by Andrew Liszewski / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/864821/abxylute-m4-snap-on-mobile-controller-magsafe-magnetic-bluetooth]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Dataminers believe they've found evidence that Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has changed the ending to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3</a> in the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> 3.</p>
<p>Though the game isn't even out yet, some dataminers claim to have discovered the full script hidden in the playable demo, suggesting the ending has been revised.</p>
<p><strong>The report that follows contains HUGE spoilers for Yakuza 3, so only proceed if you're happy to be spoiled!</strong></p>

<p>At the end of the original Yakuza 3, the game's main antagonist, Yoshitaka Mine, plummets to his death, taking fellow bad guy Andre Richardson with him, and setting up the events of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-4">Yakuza 4</a>. Now, however, if the claims are true, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1qk5rws/yakuza_3_kiwami_script_leak/">Mine miraculously survives the fall</a> and joins the Daidoji, with a considerable knock-on effect on the rest of the franchise. Dark Ties, a spin-off game bundled in with Yakuza Kiwami 3, is a prequel starring Mine (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-ending-leaked/">TheGamer</a>).</p><p>"The ending for Dark Ties has been leaked and has massively retconed the end of the game to the point where it rectons something in Yakuza 4," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1qm2kzp/comment/o1ivapa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> one player. Another said they had "definite proof" regarding the amended conclusion, writing: "I was sceptic first, but after having datamined the demo myself with a datamining tool and exploring the auth file (for anyone trying themselves -&gt; par decomp. -&gt; data and db.bis.en-&gt; Auth file), I found the proof for the new end."</p>
<p>Back in September, though, the studio said there "won't be any major changes to the story", but did suggest we'd get to learn more about the motivations behind why certain characters behave the way that they do.</p>
<p>The silver lining, I guess, is that we don't have long to wait to find out if this is just a troll kicking up trouble or that the game's conclusion really has changed: Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties is set to release for PC, PS5, Xbox Series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and last-gen consoles on 12th February, 2026.</p>
<p>This latest furore comes on top of pressure from fans to remove Teruyuki Kagawa, who portrays Goh Hamazaki, from the cast after he <a href="https://kbizoom.com/roppongi-class-teruyuki-kagawa-admits-sexual-harassment-of-a-female-club-employee/">admitted</a> to sexual misconduct and forcibly touched a woman without consent in 2019.</p>
<p>Last weekend, we learned<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-3-remastered-will-not-be-available-to-buy-as-a-standalone-game-after-yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-releases-next-month"> Yakuza 3 Remastered will no longer be available as a standalone purchase after Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties releases next month</a>. While people who already own the game will "still be able to continue playing it", "those new to the series who wish to experience the original version" will only be able to play it if they buy the whole Yakua Complete Series bundle.</p>
