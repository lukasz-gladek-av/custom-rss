                <p>Just over three decades ago, Midway's NBA Jam was a monster hit in arcades that rivaled Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter II. Arcades have largely fallen by the wayside since the days of NBA Jam's dominance. However, the spirit of the game is being revisited in NBA Superstars, a new arcade game from Raw Thrills and Play Mechanix that recreates the over-the-top style of NBA Jam. And to further connect the two games, NBA Jam announcer Tim Kitzrow is lending his voice to NBA Superstars as well.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4r22l5Zl90" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p4r22l5Zl90" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>All 30 NBA teams are represented in NBA Superstars, which features modern players including LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and more. One of the updated changes for this title is that NBA Superstars will feature three-on-three games as opposed to NBA Jam's two-on-two contests.</p><p>The arcade cabinet for NBA Superstars also represents a significant step up from the NBA Jam era. It features a 75-inch screen, marquee lights that simulate camera flashes, and team-specific color-coordinated RGB LEDs. Additionally, players will be able to create their own online accounts that can keep track of their records and statistics via QR codes that can be scanned by the game.</p><p>NBA Superstars will be released in arcades this summer. But if you'd rather bring the arcade action to your living room, Arcade1Up's NBA Jam home arcade cabinet features multiple versions of the classic basketball game.

            <p>
Even without the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">whole PSN debacle</a>, Helldivers 2 has had hectic few months, with developer Arrowhead pumping out wild, game-changing updates at a furious pace. But it looks like the studio is finally ready to ease off a bit, and has said it feels a "slightly lower [update] cadence... will benefit both us, you, and the game."
</p>
<p>
Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-balancing-has-sometimes-gone-too-far-ceo-admits">hinted at some adjustments</a> to the studio's current development strategy at the start of May, when he said he would be talking to the team about in-game balancing, agreeing that changes had perhaps "gone too far" in recent months. And another strategy shift has now been confirmed by Helldivers 2 community manager Twinbeard on Discord (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-studio-wants-to-slow-down-the-pace-of-updates-we-feel-a-slightly-lower-cadence-overall-will-benefit-both-us-you-and-the-game/">PC Gamer</a>) when discussing an ETA on the game's next update.
</p>
<p>
"We want to take some more time for this one and potentially between future patches," Twinbeard explained, "since we feel cadence has probably been a bit too high to be able to maintain the quality standard we want and you deserve."

<p>
"Patching a lot can easily disrupt work flow and takes more resources than you might think," he added. "It needs planning, implementing, monitoring, possible tweaking in hotfixes etc. For this one we prefer to stretch it out a little, hopefully with a good result."
</p>
<p>
As to how this slower schedule might look compared to the studio's previous release strategy, Twinbeard says that's still undecided. "I'd say it's something we have to try out and get a feel for," he told fans. "[Right now] we feel a slightly lower cadence overall will benefit both us, you, and the game."
</p>
<p>
There's obviously risk to messing with a winning formula so soon after launch - particularly one that's helped propel Helldivers 2 into becoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever</a>, to the tune of 12m copies on PS5 and PC - but it's unlikely fans will begrudge the team their hard-earned rest too much after such a chaotic and largely successful first few months.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hunt-showdown-finally-gets-its-ps5-xsx-update-drops-last-gen-console-support-in-august.877899/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-ps5-xbox-series-x-update-release-date-support-xbox-one-ps4-ending/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S launched, it took some live service games a while to release official next-gen updates, with some games relying on backward compatibility for a while. Crytek’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/hunt-showdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hunt: Showdown</a> has held out longer than most, as the game is still technically only playable via backward compatibility on current-gen consoles, but that’s finally going to change this summer.</p>
<p>According to Crytek, they’re going to be upgrading Hunt: Showdown to Cryengine 5.11 and releasing official PS5 and Xbox Series X/S updates in August. The flip side, is that support for Xbox One and PS4 is coming to an end, so console players will need upgrade if they want to keep playing. That said, the upgrade to XSX/PS5 will be free, and your player account, progress, and purchased DLC will carry over. You can get more details on the upgrade and transfer in the Crytek dev video, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Developer Update | Date Reveal | Hunt: Showdown" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M0lAW63LTYo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The update that ushers in current-gen console and Cryengine 5.11 support will also introduce a new map, which Crytek claims will be designed to show off the capabilities of the new engine…</p>
<p><em>“Crytek is pleased to announce the long-awaited upgrade for Hunt: Showdown will be launching this coming August. The update will bring with it a new map, Cryengine version 5.11, and performance improvements for PC &amp; console versions of the game, as well as new UI/UX design and much more.”</em></p>
<p>Between now and the big update in August, Crytek is promising a further look at Hunt: Showdown’s tech and performance improvements, UI redesign, progression and prestige systems changes, new anti-cheat initiatives, and more. It seems Crytek is essentially treating this update as a relaunch of the game.</p>
<p>Hunt: Showdown can be played on PC, Xbox One, and PS4, as well as Xbox Series X/S and PS5 via backward compatibility. The native Xbox Series X/S and PS5 versions of the game launch August 15, at which point Xbox One and PS4 support ends.</p>

Hunt: Showdown, the acclaimed PvEvP bounty hunting horror shooter from developer Crytek, is waving goodbye to Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on 15th August - but owners will be able to upgrade to the current-gen versions for free.
</p>
<p>
Crytek's David Fifield confirmed an August end date for PS4 and Xbox One support in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0lAW63LTYo">new video</a> laying the groundwork for Hunt: Showdown's next major update, which is being described as a "significant relaunch of [the game] at a whole new level".
</p>
<p>
"After this is live and running natively on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles," Fifield explained in the video, "you will no longer be able to play at all on the older generations of consoles and will need to upgrade."

<p>
Affected Hunt: Showdown players are being offered a free upgrade to the PS5 or Xbox Series X/S version from 15th August. Fifield notes player accounts and entitlements, alongside all related DLCs, will carry over when players are ready to make the transition.
</p>
<p>
Hunt: Showdown's August update also promises a CryEngine 5.11 upgrade, a new event, new map, new biome, and more. Fifield says Crytek is "very committed" to sharing more about the update ahead of its launch, and the studio is set to air a series of videos over the coming months to do just that.
</p>
<p>
Hunt: Showdown got its full launch back in 2021 after a few years in early access. Eurogamer contributor  Edwin Evans-Thirlwell liked it a lot on release, calling it a "stealth survival game like few others" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hunt-showdown-review">his Recommended review</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-acr-6-8-loadout-and-class-setup-in-xdefiant.877866/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-acr-6-8-loadout-and-class-setup-in-xdefiant/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-best-acr-6-8-loadout-and-class-setup-in-xdefiant<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="278" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With players racing to find the best weapons in <em>XDefiant</em>, the ACR 6.8 is a good place to start. The well-balanced AR shreds through enemies and is easy enough for any beginner to equip without much of a learning curve. Here is the best set of attachments to use on the ACR 6.8. </p> <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false">It will take a few days for the <em>XDefiant</em> meta to settle in, but all signs point toward the ACR 6.8 being at the top of popularity lists. Ubisoft hosted the All-Star Series, a tournament featuring first-person shooter legends, ahead of <em>XDefiant’s</em> launch. Most AR players in the tournament used an ACR 6.8, alluding to it being the best option in the class. </p> <p data-characters="123" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">After getting hands-on experience, it’s easy to see why so many players have fallen head over heels for the ACR 6.8. </p>
 <h2 id="h-best-acr-6-8-loadout-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">Best ACR 6.8 loadout in <em>XDefiant </em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Lightweight </li> <li><strong>Front Rail:</strong> Leather Wrapped </li> <li><strong>Optic:</strong> Reflex </li> <li><strong>Rear Grip: </strong>Quick Draw </li> <li><strong>Stock:</strong> Lightweight </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="444" data-current-count="444" data-injectable="true">The ACR is a versatile AR with no earth-shattering stats but is well-balanced across the board. You won’t have to worry about recoil control, as the ACR is an accurate laser beam from most ranges. This is the perfect starter weapon and a good introductory choice for anyone trying out&nbsp;<em>XDefiant</em>&nbsp;for the first time. Our loadout focuses on improving the weapon’s mobility, as ADS times felt a tad slow during the server test session.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Best Faction to use for the ACR 6.8</h2> <p data-characters="762" data-current-count="762" data-injectable="true">The Libertad faction works with every weapon, as it’s always helpful to have abilities that heal you and your teammates throughout a match. But we wouldn’t recommend using the Echelon Faction, as the stealthy skills are more useful while using an SMG. Since the ACR 6.8 thrives in long-range engagements, using the Phantoms or Cleaners Faction makes the most sense. As a Cleaner, the ACR 6.8 deals more damage and kills from further away thanks to the incendiary rounds passive ability. Additionally, the Incinerator Drone is great for drawing enemies out from behind cover and the Firebomb is one of the best grenade options in the game. For the cherry on top, the Purifier Ultra ability is a flamethrower that melts players almost instantaneously. </p>
 <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">Meanwhile, if you are more of a defensive AR, the Phantoms Faction suits that play style. With 25 extra health points, you will win more gunfights, and the Mag Barrier shield makes it easy to sit deep and pick enemies off with the ACR 6.8. Then once its time to get up close and personal, the AEGIS Ultra ability supplies a plasma shield and scattergun for close-range engagements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pokemon-tcg-summer-2024-collector-chest-coming-this-july<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has begun rolling out its annual Back-To-School product line for the <em>Pokemon TCG</em>. This product line aptly provides merchandise and exclusive cards alongside school aids. Their Pokemon TCG Summer 2024 Collector Chest is the latest in the line, and it is coming to retail in a few short weeks.</p>

<h2>The Pokemon TCG Summer 2024 Collector Chest release date</h2>

<p>The Pokemon TCG Summer 2024 Collector Chest was announced as part of the initial Back-To-School product line. This product line was originally covered by dedicated Pokemon fansite <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2024/04/2024-pokemon-tcg-back-to-school-products-revealed-eraser-blister-pencil-case-collector-chest" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pokebeach</a>, and features Pokemon-themed aids like erasers and pencil cases.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-summer-2024-collector-chest-card-layout.jpg?itok=sqAyAp00 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-summer-2024-collector-chest-card-layout.jpg?itok=zLtK6_XM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>All of this inside a functioning lunch box.</figcaption></figure><p>But the biggest draw is the titular chest. The chest is a sturdy metal case with a handle. That case contains six <em>Pokemon TCG</em> booster packs, four sticker sheets, a mini portfolio, and a code card for <em>Pokemon TCG Live</em>. Lastly, the chest contains two exclusive foil cards featuring Scream Tail and Iron Valiant alongside two promo coins.</p>

<p>The metal case can easily double as a storage and lunch box for the upcoming school year. Given that this chest contains two exclusive foil cards, this versatility can be appreciated by avid collectors and the target demographic of children.</p>

<p>The <em>Pokemon TCG</em> Summer 2024 Collector Chest will be released simultaneously with three other boxes as part of the product line. The first promo box contains either Gengar or Bellibolt erasers with two booster packs. The second is a pencil case containing two booster packs sporting artwork of Charizard and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-temporal-forces-brings-back-older-card-type"><em>Scarlet &amp; Violet's</em></a> legendary Koraidon and Miraidon.</p>

<p>All of these products will be available on July 5th 2024. That is several crucial months before the start of the school year. The eraser boxes will be sold at an MSRP of $9.99. The pencil case will be sold at $10.99. And the Collector Chest will be sold at an MSRP of $29.99.</p>

GameSpot staffers who live in Midwest see the game as available to pick up today (May 21) or delivered today/tomorrow. This is almost certainly incorrect due to the game not launching until Thursday. But hey, you could order and see what happens. Meanwhile, GameSpot staffers on the West Coast can't order it for delivery, and pick up windows range from late May into early June.</p><p>Anyway, back to the game itself.

"The Switch version of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is the definitive way to play the best turn-based RPG starring Mario. More of an enhanced HD remaster than a full-fledged remake, The Thousand-Year Door has small yet meaningful quality-of-life features that ease some of the bloat from the original GameCube version. The catchy remixed soundtrack wonderfully complements the thoroughly entertaining and dynamic turn-based battle system. Throw in a stellar cast of characters and consistently playful writing, and The Thousand-Year Door has all the ingredients of an incredible turn-based RPG. Well, it always had them, but now they are blended a bit better."</p><p>For more Mario RPG fun, check out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8VKNJ1B?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this great deal on Super Mario RPG for Switch at Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSuper-Mario-RPG-Nintendo-Switch-U-S-Edition%2F1349013407%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fpaper-mario-thousand-year-door-nintendo-switch-preorder-guide%2F1100-6521751%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a>.

Nintendo World Championships, for instance, isn't available to preorder at Amazon (and never has been), or Walmart for that matter. Speaking of Walmart, the retailer sold out of Paper Mario preorders last week, but a fresh restock is available now.</p></div>                      </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-series-x/1100-6523506/">Walmart Has An Exclusive Edition For EA Sports College Football 25</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-nintendo-switch-preorder-guide/1100-6521751/">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Preorders - Release-Day Delivery Still Available</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-over-60-on-12-months-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-with-targets-limited-time-deal/1100-6523230/">Save Over $60 On 12 Months Of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate With Target's Limited-Time Deal</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-preorder-guide-nintendo-switch/1100-6523267/">Nintendo World Championships Deluxe Set Preorders Are Only Available At Select Retailers</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-restock-guide/1100-6520876/">PlayStation Portal Is Back In Stock At Multiple Major Retailers</a></li>   </ul> </div>

Some of them are also using Microsoft’s AI upscaling to reach that frame rate and resolution target, though the website keeps track of that, too. </p><p>In a Build session, Microsoft and Qualcomm showed us how <em>Borderlands 3</em> runs about 60 percent faster with Auto Super Resolution versus native 1440p by tapping into the Qualcomm chip’s NPU, for example:</p><p>Though Auto Super Res could maintain the same frame rate at a higher effective resolution instead:</p><p>Anyhow, 747 games are currently listed as running at a “perfect” 1080p and 60fps, including <em>Control Ultimate Edition</em>, and it should be easy to check against Linaro’s findings when final devices come out.</p><p>Here’s the whole list of 19 “unplayable” games so far, like <em>Fortnite, Roblox, </em>and <em>PUBG</em>, many of which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23999300/fortnite-on-steam-deck-sweeney-says-valve-needs-tens-of-millions-of-users-to-justify-it">famously don’t run on the Steam Deck</a> due to their anti-cheat measures:</p><p>Microsoft says that the BattlEye anti-cheat system does support Arm, though support wasn’t necessarily enough to get big games that use it onto the Steam Deck.</p><p>As far as the accuracy of these tests, Linaro says:</p><div><blockquote><p>The information is intended to serve as a guide, but does not absolutely guarantee that a game will run. The results have been tested, but may not work on your specific machine and configuration. If your results differ, please contribute to the site with your own findings.</p></blockquote></div><div><p>If you want to submit your own results, Linaro is taking your contributions — <a href="https://www.worksonwoa.com/contributing">in the form of commits and pull requests</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, UK developer The Chinese Room (which is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-comes-fall-2024-developed-by-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently busy with Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>) unveiled the PC system requirements for Still Wakes the Deep. The upcoming first-person horror game is powered by Unreal Engine 5, but the minimum and recommended requirements <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1622910/Still_Wakes_the_Deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listed on the Steam page</a> don't appear to be too high:</p>
<div><p><strong>MINIMUM:</strong></p><ul>

<li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 (64-bit required) with DirectX 12</li>

<p><iframe title="STILL WAKES THE DEEP | Voice Cast Reveal | Story Minidoc" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yuvVm2w49GA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Chinese Room also unveiled the voice cast of Still Wakes the Deep. Protagonist Cameron "Caz" McLeary will be played by Alec Newman, who has a long track record in the industry. He previously played Vangarre in Xenoblade Chronicles, Lahabrea in Final Fantasy XIV, Sebastian Vael in Dragon Age II, Arthur Tailles in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, Apprentice Maraad and Captain Joris in Star Wars: The Old Republic, Simon Belmont in Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate, Finn in Dragon Age: Inquisition, Graden in The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, Jack the Ripper in the eponymous Assassin's Creed Syndicate DLC, Kram Namwen in Star Wars: Battlefront II, Robert in A Plague Tale: Innocence, Walla in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Adam Smasher (among others) in Cyberpunk 2077, Aitor in Dying Light 2: Stay Human, Blameless Marad in Horizon: Forbidden West, and Vladimir Blum in Alan Wake II. Newman said of his role:</p>
<p><em>The thing was so well written, and so well-conceived, that I don't recall having very long conversations about what Caz should sound like. With this, you can feel the writing, you can feel the characters.</em></p>
<p>The rest of the Still Wakes the Deep cast is notable, too:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neve McIntosh as Suze</li>
<li>Karen Dunbar</li>
<li>Michael Abubakar</li>
<li>Clive Russell</li>
<li>Shaun Dooley</li>
<li>Stewart Scudamore</li>
<li>Nicholas Boulton</li>
<li>Duncan Pow</li>
<li>Sandy Batchelor</li>
<li>Alan Turkington</li>
<li>Noof Ousellam</li>
</ul>
<p>In the game, players will step into the role of an oil rig worker when the off-shore platform he works on gets cut out from the world by a violent storm. As you might expect from a horror game, that's the least of the problems for the main character and the rest of the workers.</p>
<p>Still Wakes the Deep is set to launch on June 18 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/endless-ocean-luminous-guide-unlock-all-99-mystery-board-squares/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/endless-ocean-luminous/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Endless Ocean Luminous</a>, the latest in Nintendo and developer Arika’s cult aquatic exploration games, is out now, and completing the game’s story mode is no easy task. Doing so requires you to completely fill in the “Mystery Board,” a grid featuring 99 different achievement-style tasks. To make matters even more complicated, the game doesn’t inform you how to solve any of these mysteries, you just have to stumble on the solutions yourself through trial and error. But hey, if you're not up for that grind, scroll on down for our guide to unlocking all 99 squares on the Mystery Board.</p>
<h2><strong>Mystery Board Basics</strong></h2>
<p>The maps in Endless Ocean Luminous are procedurally generated, which means I can’t provide you with specific locations or instructions on how to unlock any of the squares on the Mystery Board – it’s all luck of the draw. That said, there are different types of achievements on the board, so here’s some guidance on how to approach them.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFendlessoceanluminous18.jpg"></a></figure>

<ul>
<li><strong>Disc Puzzles</strong> – These mysteries ask you to “swim aside” a specific creature (look at #32 below for an example). How these puzzles work, is you have to find a large disc on the ocean floor and scan it. You’ll then be given a clue. Determine what creature the clue was referring to, find them, have them swim with you and return to the disc with them.</li>
<li><strong>UMLs</strong> – Number 9 though 18 on the board require you to scan specific UMLs (Unique Marine Lifeforms). <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/endless-ocean-luminous-guide-how-to-find-uml/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here’s how to make a UML appear on your map</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Coins</strong> – These coins can be randomly found while scavenging (look for glints of light on the ocean floor).</li>
<li><strong>Treasure Chests</strong> – Look for treasure chests (they look like blue and black blocks) and open them to hopefully find the specific treasure required.</li>
<li><strong>Tablets</strong> – The mysteries with quotes like #3 below are acquired by finding small lore tablets.</li>
<li><strong>Landmarks</strong> - Simply swim past the landmark in question.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, without further ado, here’s how to unlock all 99 squares on Endless Ocean Luminous’ Mystery Board…</p>

<p>And there you go – that’s what's required to unlock the entire Mystery Board. Again, Endless Ocean Luminous maps are randomized, so there’s going to be a fair amount of trial and error and repetition required to do it all. This <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nDyqI1o-PZeiLFLTHX9ty66ye8RbkLNWEFKQ6jOkpyY/edit#gid=1941491767" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit spreadsheet</a> does include a handful of <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/endless-ocean-luminous-guide-how-to-replay-past-maps-including-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dive-Site IDs</a> that will take you to specific maps that contain some of the harder-to-solve mysteries, but beyond that, you’re just going to have to stick with it.</p>
<p>Endless Ocean Luminous can be played on Nintendo Switch. You can check out&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/endless-ocean-luminous-guides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech’s other Endless Ocean Luminous guides here</a>.</p>

Remember, provided you complete <em>any </em>Archie quest before the arrival of <em>The Final Shape</em>, you’ll get your hands on the Blue Steel shader, while the lore for all Archie quests will be available from June 4 on. </p>

<hr id="SoOGoo">

<p id="7yPZPt">To start the latest “Where is Archie” quest, head to the Tower’s Annex and find the paw prints. For future reference, this is where you’ll find the beginning of every Archie quest each week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24161951/ubisoft-xdefiant-unable-to-find-match-launch-day-troubles<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="U4ExXh">People dipping into Ubisoft’s free-to-play arena shooter <em>XDefiant</em> are unable to access matchmaking due to connectivity issues, Ubisoft confirmed Tuesday. “We’re aware that some players are unable to join a game — please bear with us while we look into servers and matchmaking,” <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1792971101233959058">a representative posted from the official X account</a>.</p>
<p id="q2T219">Players are reporting that they’re endlessly stuck searching for other players before receiving an “Unable to Find Match” message. <em>XDefiant </em>officially launched around 1 p.m. EDT, and players almost immediately started facing issues as people flooded to the game. “Matchmaking servers go boom!” <em>XDefiant</em> executive producer Mark Rubin posted on X shortly after launch. “We are working on it.”</p>

<p id="TqTn5n">Ubisoft’s later <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1792992558278217888">updates suggest <em>XDefiant</em>’s server woes</a> are improving, but it also noted the team is still investigating. The company will continue to update players as progress continues. </p>
<p id="KPAg3a"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23680459/xdefiant-preview-release-date-tom-clancy-ubisoft"><em>XDefiant</em> is free-to-play, 6v6 shooter</a> that lets people play as one of five factions based off Ubisoft properties: Libertad revolutionaries from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/far-cry-6/40685"><em>Far Cry 6</em></a>;<em> </em>ex-Ghost Recon specialists known as Phantoms; agents from Splinter Cell’s Echelon spy agency; DedSec street hackers from <em>Watch Dogs</em>; and the Cleaners, former sanitation workers from The Division series. Players can swap factions and weapon loadouts throughout the game, similar to switching characters in <em>Overwatch</em>.</p>
<p id="70Xfhd">Ubisoft intended to release <em>XDefiant</em> in October 2023, but ended up <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisofts-call-of-duty-rival-xdefiant-delayed-indefinitely">delaying the game</a> indefinitely. <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1773741916057665967">Ubisoft then expected <em>XDefiant</em> to be out by March</a>, which got pushed once again. The company is looking toward <em>XDefiant</em> to bolster its place in the live-service space, <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/52CZPA6t2S0cuqWQNd7HFo/55f5a6a5ce31644077755e0b93233b04/Ubisoft_FY24_Q3_PR_English.pdf">according to a February financial report</a>.</p>
<p id="Bhx64F">Overloaded servers might not sound like the worst problem to have — it typically means a lot of people are trying to play. But a free-to-play game with a bad launch runs the risk of its players moving onto something else, if they can’t get in; there’s no real shortage of other shooters for prospective <em>XDefiant</em> play instead.</p>

<p data-characters="448" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s first saga is about to enter its endgame with the launch of&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>&nbsp;expansion on June 4. In the build-up to the game’s next chapter, Bungie has been taking the time to showcase sneak peeks at certain content, like the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-showcases-dread-forces-ahead-of-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Dread enemies</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-shows-off-destiny-2-the-final-shape-exotic-class-armor/" rel="noreferrer noopener">unique Exotic armor</a>. Now, the studio is diving into the nitty gritty, explaining how weapons and their Perks are due to change in&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>.</p> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true">Typically, Bungie rebalances weapons and Perks twice an expansion, with one overhaul coming just before launch and another happening around the mid-way point. While these changes may see a powerful gun or Perk combination fall out of favor, the alterations are made in the spirit of keeping&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>‘s meta fresh. Not only are most weapons seeing some kind of change with&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>, but Bungie’s also taking a swing at some over-relied-upon strategies.</p>
 <h2 id="h-weapon-changes" data-injectable="false">Weapon changes</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="765" data-injectable="true">In a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/weapon_tuning_the_final_shape" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dev Insights post</a>, Bungie detailed how weapons would be tuned in&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>. The studio kicked things off with changes to weapon mods, mentioning that Boss Spec, Taken Spec, Minor Spec, Major Spec, and Adept Big Ones Spec would be absent for the expansion. However, Bungie noted that all weapon base damage has increased to offset this. Conversely, the damage bonus for Exotic primary weapons and trace rifles has been decreased from 40% to 30%.</p>
 <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="227" data-injectable="false">Additionally, Bungie will remove the damage bonus Kinetic weapons have against bosses, and burst weapons will shoot a number of shots reflective of their burst type. Here’s how weapon archetypes are specifically changing:</p> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="507" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Pulse Rifles</strong> – 20% damage buff to all PvE enemies (excluding Graviton Lance and Revision Zero). Additional 15% damage increase to Minors (includes Graviton Lance and Revision Zero).</li> <li><strong>Pellet shotguns</strong> – 10% damage buff to all PvE enemies (not including Legend of Acrius, Tractor Cannon, Conditional Finality, or The Fourth Horseman).</li> <li><strong>Slug shotguns</strong> – 9% damage buff to all PvE enemies.</li> <li><strong>Fusion rifles</strong> – 7% damage buff to all PvE enemies (excluding One Thousand Voices).</li> <li><strong>Sniper rifles</strong> – 7% damage buff to all PvE enemies (excluding Izanagi’s Burden’s Honed Edge shots and Cloudstrike’s storm). Minimum reserves have been increased to 17 from 14.</li> <li><strong>Glaives</strong> – 7% damage increase to projectile damage against all PvE enemies.</li> <li><strong>Linear fusion rifles</strong> – 5% damage increase against all PvE enemies. Adaptive Frame linears benefit from decreased recoil and “firing animation kick.”</li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Auto rifles</strong> – 15% damage buff against Minor PvE enemies.</li> <li><strong>Sidearms</strong> – 20% damage increase against Minor PvE enemies.</li> <li><strong>Trace Rifles</strong> – 20% damage increase against Minor and Major PvE enemies.</li> <li><strong>Scout Rifles</strong> – 20% damage increase against Minor PvE enemies. Updated hip-fire aim reticle.</li> <li><strong>Bows</strong> – 20% damage increase against Minor PvE enemies.</li> <li><strong>Submachine guns</strong> – 10% damage increase against Minor PvE enemies.</li> <li><strong>Handcannons</strong> – 5% damage increase against Minor PvE enemies. Increased stats for Crimil’s Dagger and Something New.</li> <li><strong>Machine guns</strong> – 7% damage increase against all foes (including PvP).</li> <li><strong>Swords</strong> – 7% damage increase against all foes (including PvP). Sword reticles will display the weapon’s charge state in&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>.</li> <li><strong>Wave frame grenade launchers</strong> – The Blast Radius stat will dictate the size of the weapon’s wave in&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>. At 50, the wave will be roughly the same size as it is now, going up or down from there with the stat. Special ammo wave frames will have their wave’s length reduced to 15 meters from 22.</li> </ul>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Exotic weapon changes</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true">Alongside the more general weapon tuning, Bungie also targeted a few specific Exotic weapons. Before the studio got into specifics weapon by weapon, it did note that certain Exotic primary weapons proved too powerful with the above buffs, so Sunshot, Trinity Ghoul, Polaris Lance, and Graviton Lance will each see a 10% decrease in splash damage. </p>
 <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="180" data-injectable="false">Additionally, Borealis, Hard Light, and Dead Messenger’s The Fundamentals Perk will see alterations persist through death. Here’s how other Exotic weapons are changing:</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Divinity </strong>– It will take 75% more hits before the weak spot (or “cage”) appears.</li> <li><strong>Rat King </strong>– Rat King will now use the same auto-firing animation as other sidearms.</li> <li><strong>Devil’s Ruin</strong> – The unique firing animation can no longer be applied to other weapons by switching to them while the animation is active.</li> <li><strong>Symmetry </strong>– Catalyst additionally grants +10 Reload Speed, +10 Handling, and the Eddy Current Perk.</li> <li><strong>Gjallarhorn </strong>– Wolfpack rounds now accounts for different elemental visual effects.</li> <li><strong>Touch of Malice</strong> – The burn effect applied by the Darkness Ball has been increased to 3.5 seconds from 2 seconds.</li> <li><strong>Osteo Striga</strong> – Added a 4-second cooldown between poison AOEs from defeated enemies. Poison AOEs from continuous damage are unchanged.</li> <li><strong>Necrochasm </strong>– The burn effect from the Cursed Thrall detonation has increased to 3.5 seconds from 2 seconds, and its Intrinsic Trait now increases Reload Speed after precision kills. The Catalyst has also been reworked, rewarding bonus damage, range, and aim assist after rapidly damaging three enemies.</li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>The Lament</strong> – 20% decrease to healing received from The Lament and a 20% damage decrease to high-chain revved heavy attacks.</li> <li><strong>Dead Man’s Tale</strong> – Stacks of Cranial Spike will now add +2 Stability and will provide a more noticeable increase to Reload Speed. Per Bungie, the Catalyst will see some “slightly reduced accuracy benefits,” but this will be compensated by the rise to its RPM, going to 140 from 130, and replacing the PvE-only damage buff with one that offers a 15% damage bonus when at full stacks of Cranial Spike.</li> <li><strong>The Colony</strong> – Kills now create extra insect grenades, with tougher foes spawning more.</li> <li><strong>Truth </strong>– Increased AOE damage to compensate for no impact damage and increased reserves by 3.</li> <li><strong>Queenbreaker </strong>– 12% damage increase to bosses, minibosses, Champions, and vehicles. Reserve ammo capacity was also increased by 3.</li> <li><strong>Cerberus+1</strong> – Catalyst rework makes Focus Fire activate with a special reload following a kill and no longer decreases range or fire rate.</li> <li><strong>Bastion </strong>– The Saint’s Fists Perk has been reimagined, increasing charge rate, damage, and reload speed after damaging a foe with a melee. The Perk also now provides a melee damage boost if players hit an enemy with all projectiles in a shot.</li> <li><strong>Eriana’s Vow</strong> – Destroying a Solar shield or an Anti-Barrier Champion’s barrier ignites the target.</li> <li><strong>Deterministic Chaos</strong> – The machine gun will have an intrinsic Anti-Barrier, and its Perks have been updated a bit. Heavy Metal will imbue every fourth bullet with Volatile, and Vexadecimal&nbsp;makes every 16th bullet weaken targets.</li> </ul>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Perk changes</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true">Much like weapons, Perks need a refresh from time to time, too. Here are the Perks changing in The Final Shape and how they’ll be different:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Alacrity </strong>– No longer works in Rumble PvP.</li> <li><strong>Archer’s Gambit</strong> – Will see a reduction to the Perk’s draw time increase from 66% to 60%. The base buff duration will also drop to 4 seconds, but it can be stacked up to the original 8 seconds.</li> <li><strong>Grave Robber</strong> will trigger via both Powered Melee and regular Melee eliminations.</li> <li><strong>Chain Reaction</strong> – 20% less damage and have a 15% smaller radius on Special weapons. The radius remains unchanged on heavy weapons, and damage is increased by 30%.</li> <li><strong>Eddy Current</strong> – Activation will happen after sprinting for 1.5 seconds instead of 3 seconds. It will also buff Handling and scale up all stats by 5%. Being Amplified automatically applies the Perk at peak effectiveness.</li> <li><strong>Underdog</strong> – Will be swapped out for Pulse Monitor on all weapons.</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Osmosis and Permeability</strong> – Now partially fill ammo upon activation and no longer fall off when pulling out a Ghost.</li> <li><strong>Osmosis and Tessellation</strong> – Will match the element of the equipped grenade.</li> <li><strong>Permeability and Elemental Capacitor</strong> – Will match the element of the equipped Super.</li> <li><strong>Chill Clip</strong> – Applies slow stacks based on the properties of a fusion rifle. All other weapon archetypes now take two shots to trigger.</li> <li><strong>High Ground</strong> – Reworked to provide a stacking damage buff as players get kills. Players can instantly earn max stacks when attacking an enemy from above. The buff is 25% in PvE and 15% in PvP.</li> <li><strong>Killing Tally</strong> – 21% Delirium has been updated to reflect the current version of the Perk.</li> <li><strong>Deconstruct</strong> – Will refill ammo from reserves rather than generate it out of nothing. It should also work more reliably across different weapons.</li> </ul>

<p data-characters="279" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/senuas-saga-hellblade-2/">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</a></em> offers a fourth flavor of difficulty in addition to the Neopolitan of Easy, Medium, and Hard. Dynamic Difficulty is designed to work with the player, and deliver the optimal combat experience based on their skill level. Here’s how it works.</p> <h2 id="h-the-goldilocks-difficulty" data-injectable="false">The Goldilocks Difficulty</h2> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false">Dynamic Difficulty adjusts the difficulty of combat (<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/placeit-logo-maker-tool/">without touching puzzles</a>) based on the performance of the player. Essentially, if you’re obliterating foes with ease and not getting hit all that much, the difficulty will increase. Conversely, if you’re being treated like a punching bag, the difficulty will scale down until that isn’t the case. </p> <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="837" data-injectable="true">Due to how this operates, the game should feel sufficiently difficult without being rage-inducing and easy enough to enjoy without becoming a passive experience. In the time I’ve spent with <em>Hellblade II</em>, I’ve found this to be exactly the case. As I get better at blocking, dodging, and counterattacking, enemies get better at fighting back. When they get a little too good and I beef it, I’m able to get back into it with a more toned-down experience.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-combat-difficulty.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="true">To adjust the combat difficulty in <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em>, open the Settings Menu and select Gameplay. The Difficulty options will be right under Accessibility and offer four choices: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Dynamic.</p>
 <p data-characters="412" data-current-count="412" data-injectable="true">Additionally, under the Accessibility menu will be options for Offensive and Defensive Actions. <strong>Default</strong> is your standard with you controlling Senua in combat. <strong>Simplified </strong>allows players to hit whatever button they like and the game will use the optimal move, regardless of what button was pressed. <strong>Self-Play</strong> essentially turns the game into a movie during combat as players aren’t required to press anything.</p>
 <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="389" data-injectable="false">Ninja Theory is a studio that puts a lot of <a href="https://x.com/NinjaTheory/status/1792571130651312154">emphasis on accessibility</a> and it’s incredibly refreshing to see. For those who want to sit back and experience Senua’s second out as a more theatrical experience absolutely can. Those who want to test their skills can dive into the harder difficulties. For those like me who simply want to enjoy the ride, there’s Dynamic Mode.</p>

            <link>https://www.destructoid.com/first-person-parkour-platformer-downward-returns-with-enhanced-version-on-june-4/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=first-person-parkour-platformer-downward-returns-with-enhanced-version-on-june-4</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/first-person-parkour-platformer-downward-returns-with-enhanced-version-on-june-4.877809/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/first-person-parkour-platformer-downward-returns-with-enhanced-version-on-june-4/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=first-person-parkour-platformer-downward-returns-with-enhanced-version-on-june-4<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="268" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Caracal Games’ first-person parkour platformer <em>Downward </em>first launched back in July 2017, and now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/506900/Downward_Enhanced_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s set to return</a> with some updates. <em>Downward Enhanced </em> throws updated graphics and more into the mix when it hits consoles and PC on June 4, 2024.</p> <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false">Beyond the visual improvements — which include some new assets —the enhanced version adds optimization and a new ending. Those who already own the base game will be able to upgrade to <em>Downward Enhanced </em>with a free update. You can see more of the dizzying, post-apocalyptic parkour feats in action in the release date trailer below. &nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="642" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="DOWNWARD Enhanced - Release date trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YX3tbw-OgXI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false">Similar to games like <em>Mirror’s Edge </em>but perhaps not quite as disorienting as VR attempts like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-vr-parkour-game-stride-isnt-for-the-faint-of-heart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Stride</em></a>, <em>Downward </em>has you jumping, sliding, hanging, and running along walls. This time around, however, you’ll be doing so in a ruined world in search of legendary artifacts and an explanation for the apocalypse that brought us to this point in the first place.</p> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="681" data-injectable="true">Along the way, you can upgrade your powers and boost your stats to give yourself an edge against some of the Ancient Guardians that want to put an end to all those pesky acrobatics. There’s also a balance of world exploration that has you using those parkour skills to find hidden items and secret locations.</p>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">It’s not easy to make first-person platforming work in any meaningful way, so when a developer gets it even partially right, I tend to pay attention. When <em>Downward Enhanced </em>launches, you’ll be able to jump into “humanity’s final adventure” on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/506900/Downward_Enhanced_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="272" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a></em> doggo, Archie, is a menace. He’s the Spider-Man to my <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/spider-man-2-why-does-jjj-hate-the-spider-men/">J. Jonah Jameson</a>. This serial escapee has snuck out of the Tower once more and it’s up to us to bring him in. Here’s every one of the wandering woofer’s spots in the Dreaming City.</p> <h2 id="h-where-to-find-archie-in-the-dreaming-city" data-injectable="false">Where to find Archie in the Dreaming City</h2> <h3 id="h-1-investigate-the-paw-prints" data-injectable="false">1. Investigate the paw prints</h3> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">As with any <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-where-on-the-moon-is-archie/">Archie investigation</a>, it all begins with the paw prints in the Tower’s Annex. Interacting with them will begin the quest proper and point you to Ada-1. Speaking with the armorer reveals Archie somehow managed to get into the Dreaming City, which is no easy feat. It’s time to meet up with Petra Venj.</p> <h3 id="h-2-petra-venj" data-injectable="false">2. Petra Venj</h3> <figure data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-archie-dreaming-city-001.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false">The Queen’s Wrath is hanging out in The Strand this week. Pull out your sparrow and head on over. Petra, in an annoyed tone, confirms that Archie was there and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkFYr2SX620">pulling a Lassie</a>. Let’s go check the nearest well for Timmy.</p> <h3 id="h-3-the-blind-well" data-injectable="false">3. The Blind Well</h3> <figure data-current-count="532" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-archie-dreaming-city-002.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">Fortunately, the Blind Well is pretty close. Zip on over to find the next clue entangled in the glowing green paw prints. Despite being cybernetic, Archie has been compelled to search out some bones that like to barter. I’m not sure why he’s bartering with the bones when it’s the bones themselves he wants.</p> <h3 id="h-4-huginn-munnin" data-injectable="false">4. Huginn &amp; Munnin</h3> <figure data-current-count="625" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-archie-dreaming-city-003.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="390" data-injectable="false">The only bones in the Dreaming City willing to strike up a deal would be Huginn and Munnin. To reach them, head to the temple in the northeast of Rheasilvia. Proceed to the end and jump down from the balcony. Directly behind you will be a doorway with a big hole. Fling yourself into the abyss and take a left in the next room to find Archie’s paw prints between the Ahamkara shrines.</p> <h3 id="h-5-a-cat-in-the-mists" data-injectable="false">5. A Cat in the Mists</h3> <figure data-current-count="690" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-archie-dreaming-city-004.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="214" data-injectable="false">Archie, following his canine instincts, is in pursuit of one of the many Dreaming City’s star cats. If you chased them down in <em>Forsaken</em>, you’d be forgiven for forgetting where the Divalian Mists cat is.</p> <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true">After spawning into the zone, head towards Rheasilvia. As you near the slope leading to the tunnel, walk towards the cliff and look down. There will be some outcroppings you can jump down onto. At the bottom will be a cave that houses Archie’s paw prints.</p>
 <h3 id="h-6-the-queen-s-throne" data-injectable="false">6. The Queen’s Throne</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-archie-dreaming-city-005.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">The final clue tells us that Archie’s gone to see if Queen Mara is in. Mara Sov’s throne room entrance is in the Spire of Keres. As you head there, you’ll square up against a Taken ambush. The adds will keep spawning, so focus on the Taken Ogre. Once it’s down, the minions will disappear and you’ll be left with an offering.</p>
 <p data-characters="181" data-current-count="181" data-injectable="false">Present the offering to Mara’s attendant in the Spire to be granted passage to the Queen’s throne room. Inside will be the good boy in search of pawsitive reinforcement.</p> <h3 id="h-return-to-ada-1" data-injectable="false">Return to Ada-1</h3> <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">With Archie safely recovered, it’s time to return to Ada-1 in the Tower’s Annex. This week’s gift is an Ahamkara bone the pooch took as a souvenir. It’s probably best that we hold onto this.</p>

People bought the bath water. Some claimed to have tested it for human DNA and accused Delphine of scamming them when it was revealed to not contain any. It turned out the bath water hadn’t even been shipped out yet and they were just making it up to clout chase on YouTube. A wild time was had by all. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.indy100.com/viral/onlyfans-model-belle-delphine-bathwater&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.indy100.com/viral/onlyfans-model-belle-delphine-bathwater" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">She said on a podcast earlier this year</a></span> that she sold about 600 bottles total. </p><p>Delphine now explains that selling the bath water was apparently a violation of PayPal’s terms of service, with each infringement costing her $2,500. She said the company would tell her at the time what the problem was but the end result was that all of her revenue from sales of the gamer girl bath water were seemingly confiscated. “So I don’t know if it’s because they don’t allow sex workers to use their platform or if they had a specific issue with me selling bathwater…regardless not even knowing felt shit.”</p><p>PayPal had seemingly confiscated thousands from the account and closed it until recently, when <em>Business Insider </em>and others reached out to the payment processing company for comment on the situation. While the $2,500 penalty policy was dropped last year, it wasn’t until this month that PayPal reportedly decided to return Delphine’s money. “If I didn’t have any [social media] following, they wouldn’t have given my money back,” Delphine told <em>Business Insider</em>. “Which is so shitty because what are all the normal non-social media users meant to do in this situation? I followed all the normal protocols and was roadblocked and gave up.”</p><p>It’s a version of what seems to happen all the time with online content creators who are at the mercy of massive platforms and the financial institutions which power their monetization. People get snagged on the internal machinery of faceless institutions with no one to help them out or explain what’s going on until it goes viral. For every Delphine who eventually gets their account issues settled, hundreds of others probably just give up. After all, that’s basically what she did until deciding to tweet about it on a whim years after the fact. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="443" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Archetype Entertainment <a href="https://www.exodusgame.com/en-US/news/release-your-inner-daemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just revealed</a> a major addition to the narrative of its upcoming sci-fi RPG EXODUS. The developer has been slowly revealing major narrative elements of EXODUS, which many consider the spiritual successor to the <em>Mass Effect</em> series. The new story reveal focuses on a mysterious alien known as the Silicates, which appears it will not only play a major role in EXODUS’ story but also influence its gameplay.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Archetype Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-a-weapon-against-the-celestials" data-injectable="false">A Weapon against the Celestials</h2> <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true">While a lot of the story and even gameplay features of <em>EXODUS</em> is still a mystery, the reveal of the Silicates helps paint a picture of what may be a major factor both narratively and in terms of gameplay elements whenever <em>EXODUS</em> releases.</p>
 <p data-characters="504" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true">The mysterious Silicates first were first discovered as eggs that look like simple crystals or gems. However, when touched by a Human, a symbiotic bond causes the Silicate to hatch and merge with human flesh, resulting in death for most, but transcending those that survive into a new powerful being known as a Daemon, undergoing musculature evolutions granting them incredible speed, strength, and other abilities. In essence, they become a weapon that the threat against humanity, The Celestials, fear.</p>
 <blockquote data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true"> <p>Silicates are humanity’s leverage. Daemons don’t need weapons – they are weapons. They give humanity a fighting chance against the Celestials; they even the playing field. Since Silicates will only bond with humans, there are some who see them in a religious light. They believe human-Silicate coexistence was preordained; it was meant to be and brought to fruition by some higher power. Others just see it as a fortunate break for humanity – a piece of good luck to offset all the hardships that we have endured.</p> <cite>‘<a href="https://www.exodusgame.com/en-US/news/release-your-inner-daemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Release your Inner Daemon</a>‘ – Archetype Entertainment, May 21, 2024</cite></blockquote>
 <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">Despite the immense strength Silicates provide to humans, it’s not without major drawbacks. Those that become Daemons are prone to intrusive violent thoughts and urges, which some believe is due to the Silicates “speaking” to their hosts, trying to influence their behavior to serve their own purpose.</p> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="685" data-injectable="true">Even though there is a lot we still don’t know about <em>EXODUS</em>‘, these detailed narrative features are helping to paint the picture of what to expect from the upcoming sci-fi RPG. It sounds like Silicates will not only play a major role in the story but give humans their not-so-human abilities akin to Powers in <em>Mass Effect</em>. I’m excited to hear more.</p>

  <p id="wmt9Qz">The jury trial between <em>Destiny 2</em> developer Bungie and cheating software creator and distributor AimJunkies began Monday, nearly three years after the lawsuit was filed by Bungie lead attorney Jacob Dini in a Seattle court. It’s been a long, complicated journey to this point: AimJunkies, owned by Phoenix Digital Group, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23366835/bungie-destiny-2-aimjunkies-lawsuit-countersuit-hack-file">countersued Bungie in 2022</a> claiming the Sony-owned company illegally accessed James May’s computer and accessed his copyrighted material. Then, in 2023, parts of the lawsuit — anti-circumvention and trafficking violations — were resolved in arbitration, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23609206/destiny-2-bungie-aimjunkies-cheat-maker-lawsuit">with Bungie winning $4.3 million</a>. Months later, AimJunkies filed to appeal the decision, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/aimjunkies-opening.pdf">arguing that the arbitrator “blatantly disregarded some rules in making his decision</a>.” That appeal is ongoing. This week, Bungie and AimJunkies are in court to settle the claim that AimJunkies violated Bungie’s copyright.</p>
<p id="MxwekP">Opening statements began Monday after eight jurors were selected. It’s likely the first time a video game cheating lawsuit has made it this far in the court system, according to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bungie-aimjunkies-destiny-2-trial">lawyers who spoke to Game File</a>. The thing is, cheating isn’t explicitly against United States law. The arbiter determined that AimJunkies violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act’s anti-circumvention rules by bypassing Bungie’s security measures <em>and</em> by trafficking — or selling — software designed to circumvent those measures. Now, Bungie is looking to prove AimJunkies violated copyright law, too.</p>
<p id="DyXRye">Bungie’s lawyers are blaming one of the defendants, James May, for allegedly hacking into <em>Destiny 2</em> to copy its code to create the cheating software sold by AimJunkies, according to court documents. Bungie said May split the revenue with Phoenix Digital’s Jeffrey Conway and Jordan Green. Bungie reportedly found records that Phoenix Digital paid May “more than $700,000 for his work,” according to Bungie lawyer William C. Rava during the opening statement, <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1839173/bungie-takes-aim-at-cheat-code-sellers-in-copyright-trial">as reported by Law360</a>. But the sales records provided by Phoenix Digital only documented $43,000 in sales. Bungie’s lawyers claim the company deleted cryptocurrency and other transactions, which is why they’re asking the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F734783690%2FBungie-vs-AimJunkies-via-Polygon&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F24161935%2Fbungie-destiny-2-cheating-jury-trial-aimjunkies" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23925976__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://www.scribd.com/document/734783690/Bungie-vs-AimJunkies-via-Polygon\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/24161935/bungie-destiny-2-cheating-jury-trial-aimjunkies&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23925976__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.scribd.com/document/734783690/Bungie-vs-AimJunkies-via-Polygon&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/24161935/bungie-destiny-2-cheating-jury-trial-aimjunkies&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">jury to consider “spoliation of evidence,”</a> according to court documents. This means Bungie’s lawyers are requesting that the jury presume the defendants destroyed evidence that might incriminate them.</p>
<p id="4H3VWk">The evidence that Bungie says was deleted purportedly includes forum messages, records of the cheat software, and sales information. Bungie claims that May “wiped four hard drives that [May] alleges Bungie improperly accessed in relation to this suit.” Phoenix Digital’s lawyers don’t want Bungie to be allowed to ask the jury to consider this, they said in their own filings.</p>
<p id="RpRlEm">Beyond this, Bungie told the jurors about several other confusing details, like Phoenix Digital’s <a href="https://www.aimjunkies.com/ukrainian-bme-to-acquire-leading-independent-us-videogame-cheat-distributor-aimjunkies">purported sale of AimJunkies for 7,000 bitcoins</a>, worth more than $480 million, to a company called Blome Entertainment in 2022. Phoenix Digital founder David Schaefer told Bungie’s lawyers that he created the sale press release to see Bungie “run around in circles and look like fools.” (Phoenix Digital had to pay $5,000, plus attorney fees, to Bungie “as a sanction for Schaefer’s harassing and unprofessional behavior” at one deposition in March 2023, according to court documents.)</p>
<p id="SzN4g8">On Phoenix Digital and AimJunkies’ side, lawyer Philip P. Mann said in his opening statement that May didn’t create the <em>Destiny 2</em> cheat, and that the <em>Destiny 2</em> maker had subjected Schaefer to 16 hours of questioning in a “discovery campaign to find out who Bungie thinks is behind this international conspiracy to develop cheats,” according to Law360. Mann said Bungie doesn’t have much evidence. Mann added that the lawsuit has basically put Phoenix Digital out of business and May out of a job, all while Bungie goes after the alleged $10,000 in profit the company made from <em>Destiny 2</em> cheat software — suggesting this is a David and Goliath scenario. </p>
<p id="qwSIB4">Mann’s argument centers on the fact that cheating isn’t illegal, and that there’s been no copyright infringement by the cheatmakers, because May didn’t even make the cheats — AimJunkies.com is a cheat marketplace, the lawyer said, not a cheat creation company. Phoenix Digital also contends that May isn’t an employee of the company, just another person who sells cheats — crucially, not <em>Destiny 2 </em>cheats, according to Phoenix Digital — on the platform. </p>
<p id="LcCc9U">The cheating software in question lets players do stuff like see through walls, and therefore see where their enemy is located, giving the cheating party an advantage. There are also cheats for having better aim or reducing a gun’s recoil, for instance. Again, it’s not necessarily illegal to cheat in a video game — though Bungie argues it could be a breach of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s terms of service even for the player — but it <em>is</em> illegal for a cheat maker to use copyrighted code to create the cheating software. It’s an argument Bungie and its lawyers are familiar with — Bungie has <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/11/22224696/riot-bungie-destiny-2-valorant-cheat-maker-lawsuit">sued plenty of cheating software creators</a> and sellers in the past few years. A lot of the time, it <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/bungie-lawsuit-ends-with-destiny-cheat-seller-on-the-hook-for-dollar12m/">wins</a> by defaulting or settling before getting to a trial.</p>
<p id="rXg0qQ">Court resumed Tuesday at 9 a.m. PDT and is expected to continue throughout the week. Though the trial will resolve the copyright issue, Bungie and AimJunkies will also have to settle the arbitration appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit at a later date. In the appeal, Mann <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/aimjunkies-opening.pdf">describes</a> this move as the first instance of a company to “actually stand up to Bungie and seek a decision on the merits as to whether ‘cheating’ in computer games is unlawful in the absence of an actual violation and existing intellectual property right.” The appeal is currently being considered for oral arguments in a Portland, Oregon court in August or September. Polygon has reached out to lawyers for both Bungie and Phoenix Digital and AimJunkies for comment. </p>

Even if you don’t have an Nvidia card, however, you should make sure your drivers are up to date.</p><h2 id="h67896"><a id=""></a>Using <em>Hellblade 2</em>’s graphics settings and performance meter</h2><p>It’s well worth your time to dive into <em>Hellblade</em>’s graphics settings before you start up the game as you want to mitigate how much time you spend dealing with menus during Senua’s journey. In Settings &gt; Graphics you’ll find a number of settings to start with, as well as a performance meter in the upper-right corner of the screen that’s more or less self-explanatory. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ninja-theory-hellblade-new-game-greenlit-microsoft-1851490677&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ninja-theory-hellblade-new-game-greenlit-microsoft-1851490677"><em>Hellblade 2</em> Studio Reportedly Already Working On Its Next Game</a></span></p><p>If you’re not used to reading meters like this, you’ll want to pay attention to the “Frame” section and the Video Memory bar. The former indicates how many frames you’re getting per second (FPS). <em>Hellblade</em> is a very narrative game, so 30-FPS makes for a decent experience. I found, though, that the game feels great at 60 and above, so definitely aim for that if you can. </p><p>The next thing you’ll want to mess with is your choice of upscaler, which will vary depending on your graphics card. AMD folks should go with FSR3 while those of us on team green with Nvidia cards should use DLSS. The alternatives should not be used unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>Variable rate shading will reduce how much effort your GPU spends rendering non-obvious portions of the screen. It typically results in an improvement in performance at a less-than-noticeable decrease in visual fidelity.</p><p>Clicking on “Advanced Settings” in the graphics settings will open a drop-down menu where you can tailor the experience to your preferences and the performance power of your machine. </p><p>While I do wish <em>Hellblade 2</em> had a dedicated benchmark tool, the closest is the “Preview,” activated by pressing the spacebar or the menu button on a controller. This will pull the menu back to show a scene with Senua, some foliage, a building behind her, and a puddle for reflections when you’re not in a game. You can then toggle between different levels of quality for specific settings to see the effect in real time.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="91a5b235b4b7a35382c672b9cad91175" data-recommend-id="image://91a5b235b4b7a35382c672b9cad91175" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An animated gif shows the effects of different graphics settings for reflections and foliage detail." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An animated gif shows the effects of different graphics settings for reflections and foliage detail." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="91a5b235b4b7a35382c672b9cad91175" data-recommend-id="image://91a5b235b4b7a35382c672b9cad91175" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An animated gif shows the effects of different graphics settings for reflections and foliage detail." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you navigate to the graphics settings while playing the game and select the “Preview” option, it will show the active scene instead. This is a good way to troubleshoot specific issues you may be having during select moments of <em>Hellblade 2</em>. My preference is to tweak these settings before you load into a game for less distractions, but also because the preview option in the main menu shows more motion than it does while in-game.</p><p>In my experience, I found post-processing, effects, reflection, texture, view distance, and foliage to be worth bumping up to the High settings. Reflections in particular I found to be very much worth bringing up to High. Everything else I kept down to medium, but your results and preferences may differ. </p><p>You may still have to dive into the graphics settings during gameplay to tweak things if you’re not happy with the settings. I suggest not fiddling with things too much once you’ve found a nice sweet spot. </p><h2 id="h67897"><a id=""></a><em>Hellblade 2</em> has an in-game FPS-meter, too</h2><p>Unless you use another program (like TK) to show your framerate, you can monitor it in real-time while playing <em>Saga</em> by going to Settings &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Show FPS. This will pin a frame-rate counter in one of the corners of the screen and you can adjust its opacity and text color. Since <em>Hellblade 2</em> has permanent letterbox bars at all times, the FPS counter isn’t terribly distracting. And it can help you get a sense of how well your framerate is performing if you’re not used to spotting framerate dips by eye.</p><h2 id="h67898"><a id=""></a>How to deal with black dots on character faces</h2><p>There’s a chance you might be struggling with a little visual quirk in <em>Hellblade 2</em> that dramatically sours the experience: Dancing black dots on character faces. These will pop up during gameplay and through cutscenes. </p><p>In my experience, after updating my Nvidia card to the latest driver, I haven’t seen this. But if you’re still struggling with it, I found that bumping up the “Effects” setting to “High” made these go away. </p><h2 id="h67899"><a id=""></a>What about the Steam Deck?</h2><figure id="" data-id="0a3017c1b7e4fe607a3fc952e5bd0220" data-recommend-id="image://0a3017c1b7e4fe607a3fc952e5bd0220" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Senua walking through a rocky environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows Senua walking through a rocky environment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Captured on Steam Deck.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0a3017c1b7e4fe607a3fc952e5bd0220" data-recommend-id="image://0a3017c1b7e4fe607a3fc952e5bd0220" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Senua walking through a rocky environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>From a qualitative standpoint, <em>Hellblade 2</em> is best played on a big screen, powered by something that can reliably deliver at least a solid 30-frames per second. The Steam Deck is not the machine for that. It will, however, run <em>Hellblade 2</em> with mixed results. </p><p>The majority of my time with <em>Hellblade 2</em> has been on PC, but I have spent a few hours in transit playing the game on Steam Deck. Headphones, of course, are necessary here and given how much of the experience of <em>Hellblade </em>is an aural one, the game is still entertaining in portable format. That said, you will need to bring the graphics to Low settings across the board, with FSR3 turned on. Even then, the game will dip below 30-frames per second and about 1-2 hours of battery life depending on the age of your battery. 19 FPS was the lowest dip I saw thus far.</p><p>It’s certainly “Playable,” but I would advise relying on a more powerful machine to crunch <em>Hellblade 2</em>’s pixels for you. Even relying on Steam’s Remote Play via Steam Deck is a better option than letting the Deck itself run the game on its GPU. </p><h2 id="h67900"><a id=""></a>No, there’s no way to remove the black bars without mods</h2><p><em>Hellblade 2</em> only just launched on PC and Xbox and already <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/senuassagahellblade2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/senuassagahellblade2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">there are a few mods for tweaking the visual settings</a></span>, including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/senuassagahellblade2/mods/3&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/senuassagahellblade2/mods/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a mod that removes letterboxing</a></span>. <em>Saga</em> uses a wide variety of post-processing techniques to create a lush, film-like, surreal experience. That, combined with letterboxing, to me is a pretty essential part of the visual look and artistic intent in <em>Hellblade</em> that I’d prefer to keep it as is. </p><p>Note that mods may or may not interfere with the stability of the game, so mod away at your own risk. </p><p>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Regarding Ubisoft titles, for as much as I enjoy their popcorn games, I typically wait until the inevitable Steam launch before picking anything up. They usually drop with a significant discount. But when you have a game like XDefiant, which is free-to-play, the only thing stopping you from having fun at this very moment is Ubisoft Connect. For some, that’s enough. So, when will XDefiant come to Steam?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-xdefiant-launch-on-steam">When Will XDefiant Launch on Steam?</h2>



<p>Currently, Ubisoft Connect is the only way to play XDefiant on PC. However, according to an insider at the studio, that will change in the coming months. While we don’t yet have an exact release date, we do know that XDefiant is coming to Steam in the “next few months.” </p>



<p>If you look at past Ubisoft titles, they generally launch within one year on Steam after Ubisoft Connect. However, XDefiant is a free-to-play title, meaning Ubisoft isn’t soaking in all the retail price purchases. No one is taking a cut. As such, I genuinely believe we’ll see XDefiant on Steam in six months or less.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-xdefiant">What is XDefiant?</h2>



<p>XDefiant is a free-to-play arena shooter with heroes and factions from throughout various Ubisoft franchises, such as Libertard from Far Cry 6, but also brand-new characters and groups from within the universe. </p>



<p>The game offers various game modes, including objective-based modes and numerous unique maps to battle against other players. Furthermore, you’ll have personalized loadouts, meaning no hero is genuinely the same. You can customize your weapons with more than 40 unique attachments, offering a welcome depth to loadouts!</p>
