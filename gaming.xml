Remember Secret Level, that Amazon show that came out last December? I wouldn't blame you if you already forgot about it, for the most part it was pretty forgettable considering how much of it could be boiled down to "damn… video games are violent, huh?", except positioning that as universally cool, actually (let's leave that whole conversation there). Easily the weirdest of all the episodes was the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pac-man">Pac-Man</a> one, given that it was only Pac-Man in the sense that there was a floating yellow orb thing that kind of looks like the titular, iconic video game character.
</p>

<p>
Really, though, it's about some humanoid alien being told to eat everything it comes across by this orb, called Puck (get it?), resulting in something that's admittedly intriguingly alarming and grotesque, but also has such ridiculously high levels of edgy animated short film from the early days of YouTube energy. Three days after this episode came out, there came the surprise reveal that this episode is getting a Metroidvania video game adaptation called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-labyrinth">Shadow Labyrinth</a>, for reasons I couldn't begin to understand.
</p>

<p>
And now, thanks to the powers that be at Nintendo during today's Direct, a release date has been confirmed for the confusing game: July 18th. The release date announcement came with a snazzy new trailer that revealed you also get a mech? Honestly, the whole thing is unheard of levels of silly, I'm still struggling to believe that this is a real game that's been greenlit, but hey ho, perhaps we've got a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> on our hands.
</p>
<p>
Still can't quite tell if the story will be the exact same as the Secret Level episode, there's some big discrepancies (and a much bigger <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a>: Automata vibe to it), so we'll all just have to wait a few more months to find out.

But a new look at an improved gameplay feature in the upcoming remake, <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em>, might just be enough to convert this jaded fan who’s convinced the series peaked at <em>Sons of Liberty</em>. In a 12-second clip, Naked Snake can be seen swapping his camo from a foresty look to something more suitable for an urban environment in record time. It’s way faster and less cumbersome-looking than the camo-swapping of the original.

The original required you to pause the game, then select “camouflage” from a menu, then select “face” or “uniform” before choosing your desired pattern.</p><p>As I said earlier, at best I feel sorta “meh” about <em>MGS3</em>; the menu-diving the original demands of you to swap camo, eat anything, and treat your wounds is one of its biggest offenders in my opinion (alongside the boring, self-indulgent story and that god awful song). I found it very hard to stay engaged in the action when the game made me sort through menu screens so often, despite the camo being a genuinely neat idea. </p><p><em>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</em> notably eschewed the whole eating and wound-healing stuff (for the better).

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 3 roadmap has revealed new multiplayer maps, modes, additional equipment, and multiplayer ranked play changes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-3-maps">Black Ops 6 Season 3 Maps</h2>



<p>In Black Ops 6 season 3, players can check out five new maps and a variant. Barrage is a 6v6 medium-sized Core map set in 1968 Vietnam. Nomad is a 6v6/2v2 small-sized Strike map where players battle in the ruins of a fortified settlement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next up is the return of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beloved-cod-maps-coming-back-to-black-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan-favourite map</a>, Firing Range. Black Ops 6 Season 3 has received a remastered version of Firing Range, a 6v6, medium-sized Core map that finally returned to the series after Black Ops 4 in 2018. Next is Haven, a 6v6, medium-sized core map set in a KGB Safehouse in 1991.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last up is Signal, which is again a 6v6/2v2, small-sized Strike Map. Players start their battles from opposing submarine bays while going through the Control room of an ocean rig numbers station. Additionally, a Nuketown variant called Blazetown will be released for a limited time mid-season.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-3-multiplayer-modes">Black Ops 6 Season 3 Multiplayer Modes</h2>



<p>Coming to the new multiplayer game modes revealed in the Black Ops 6 Season 3 Roadmap, players will see the return of two classic modes, Sharpshooter and Demolition. There’s also a limited-time mode called Joint Operators.</p>



<p>Sharpshooter is a free-for-all party mode where every player needs to use the same loadout, and it changes every 45 seconds. Every time it changes, you will receive a new primary weapon, secondary Weapon, dedicated melee weapon, tactical equipment and lethal equipment.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In Demolition, players will alternate between attacking and defensive positions across two bomb sites. The attacking team wins when it destroys the bomb and receives a time bonus for the first detonation. All the players from the attacking team spawn with bombs, and there are multiple respawns for both teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Joint Operators, players need to test their skills in a gauntlet of five Core mode variants in a single match: Head Stash (TDM), Inhalation (Domination), Hotbox (Hardpoint), Very High Target (HVT), and Munchies (Kill Confirmed). The modes will include some modifiers, too, like double health, low gravity, hallucinations and third-person POV.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-3-perks">Black Ops 6 Season 3 Perks</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 Season 3 Roadmap reveals additional equipment, such as two new perks and a scorestreak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Close Shave is an Enforcer type Perk, which automatically uses the player’s Dedicated Melee attack when they perform a weapon butt attack. Vendetta is a Recon-type perk that arrives mid-season. When the player respawns, it makes their killer’s last known location for a short duration—bonus points for exacting revenge. Death Machine is the new Lethal type Scorestreak.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-3-multiplayer-ranked-changes">Black Ops 6 Season 3 Multiplayer Ranked Changes</h2>



<p>Lastly, Black Ops 6 Season 3 roadmap has revealed new changes and additions for Multiplayer Ranked Play. Players can take their competitiveness to the next level as the same settings, maps, modes, and weapon restrictions used by the Call of Duty League have been added to the game. Winning matches rewards players with SR (Skill Rating), and progressing through the ranks will reward players with Rank Skins and Win Challenge rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the developers have added Retroactive SR Adjustments to reverse the impact of cheaters. When a Ranked Cheater is banned, any players that lost against them will be refunded their SR. Also, a new feature has been added that lets you rejoin Ranked Matches if they were disconnected. However, players need to rejoin within 5 minutes. Check out Ranked Play rewards and Weapon Blueprints <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-zombies-season-three-critical-launch-announcement#MULTIPLAYER" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/wuchang-fallen-feathers-the-first-hands-on-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wuchang-fallen-feathers-%E2%80%93-the-first-hands-on-preview.1147062/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wuchang-fallen-feathers-the-first-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In a space as crowded as the soulslike genre, it can be difficult to stand out, but after two hours with the uber-difficult Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, it seems the folks at Leenzee Games may be onto something. Taking place in a magical reimagining of dynastic China, you play a pirate warrior who has some serious moves, making use of intricate and deadly spells, an arsenal of weapons with potent movesets, and an upgrade tree that’s much more involved than your typical action-adventure game. This makes for an adventure where, more often than not, I felt like the scary badass the rest of the world should be afraid of, rather than the other way around. Of course, the upper limit on just how much I could make myself feel like an overpowered Dynasty Warriors character was my own skill level and understanding of Wuchang’s extremely complex systems, which I could only dive so deep with during my limited demo. But what I’ve seen so far has me quite optimistic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The main way Wuchang: Fallen Feathers seems to differentiate itself from its peers is that here, instead of a few basic sword moves, a handful of meager spells and abilities, and a tiny health bar, you’re given a pretty extensive toolkit of formidable tools to play with. Each weapon allows you to unleash unique flurries of attacks that send you soaring into the air, darting across the map, and performing insane feats of dexterity that are far beyond what’s possible in most soulslikes. It got to the point where I felt like the area boss stomping my enemies flat, rather than a scared, cautious adventurer facing incredible odds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That feeling of superiority might have something to do with how those abilities are acquired: by harvesting them from fallen enemies. That’s right! Every defeated foe is more than just a handful of upgrade materials. You actually get to learn their moves and put them to use against future opponents, eventually turning you into a deadly reflection of everyone you’ve bested in battle, and in my time with it I already began to feel like a power-stealing badass in short order. And this was just the opening areas of the adventure too – I can only imagine how wild things get later on when you’re squaring off against more powerful opponents and presumably unlocking even more insane abilities.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I can only imagine how wild things get later on when you’re squaring off against more powerful opponents and presumably unlocking even more insane abilities.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t get me wrong: there were still plenty of instances where my eagerness or lack of awareness got me absolutely smashed to pieces, but I also felt like I had way more options for cutting the enemy down to size. For example, one move I was given while wielding a giant ax let me leap straight into the air to ludicrous anime-level heights, then smash down on my opponent, stomping them flat and leaving a minion-shaped impression in the earth. Another weapon, fast moving dual blades, gave me the ability to fire off a bunch of small, sticky explosives every time I dodged, which then exploded doing a small amount of damage, but more importantly, interrupting enemy movement.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These abilities and weapon combos, combined with spells that let me do things like fire off a deadly disc of fire, allowed me to play much more aggressively than I’m accustomed to, and it’s clear there’s just a whole lot more to learn with Wuchang in general. I didn’t have nearly enough time to fully wrap my mind around the various skill trees, ability customization options that let me alter how my weapons functioned, and spellcasting system, but it’s clear this borrows quite a bit from RPGs and will need to be thought through if you want to max out your levels of badassery. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That will be pretty helpful to do too, because of the two bosses I took on in Wuchang, one of them was extremely aggressive and equally beefed up with fancy movesets. It took me quite a few tries to learn her quick, convoluted attack patterns, and master the timing for parrying her attacks, especially in the second half of the fight when each swipe of her blade sent out massive gusts of wind that knocked my on my butt and did way more damage than I thought the wind was capable of. Eventually, though, I stood triumphant against her devilish tricks. Rather than a feeble goon hopelessly outmatched by an enemy clearly above my power level, Wuchang’s boss fights made me feel a lot more like a peer locked in a duel with strong weapons and destructive abilities to see who was more worthy of success.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If there’s one part I didn’t get a completely strong read on, it’s Wuchang’s story, which centers on a disease spreading throughout the lands that drives people mad and makes them sprout feathers. I didn’t see enough to say whether or not this is likely to go the distance, but I will say I’ve lost count of the number of soulslikes in the past few years that have leaned on that incredibly tired trope. I get that having a disease that turns people into monsters offers a pretty easy reason to make everything in the world want to kill you, which is very helpful in this kind of game, but man am I ever tired of seeing it. I’d really like to see Wuchang break free from some of the story cliches in the same way it seems to be switching things up when it comes to combat style.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I get that having a disease that turns people into monsters offers a pretty easy reason to make everything in the world want to kill you, which is very helpful in this kind of game, but man am I ever tired of seeing it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also worth noting just how visually impressive Wuchang is, which is by no means the norm for the genre. Even if I was dying half a dozen times to the same boss or lost among a sea of disgusting, mutated enemies, I was at least able to content myself with how downright gorgeous everything looked, ruined and deeply troubling as the world was. That said, I did notice somewhat long load times after each humiliating defeat that respawned me back at a checkpoint, and I have to wonder how much of that hang time is owed to the world and characters looking so dang good. In fairness, there’s very little chance this thing’s been optimized enough to be representative of the final product, but since I was playing on a PC that seemed fairly powerful, it’s definitely something I’m going to want to keep an eye on as I check out future builds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With only a short exploration area and two boss fights to contend with, I only caught a small glimpse at Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, but I already feel pretty good about its chances at being more than just another soulslike to add to the ridiculously overflowing pile. The movesets are intricate and interesting, the RPG mechanics seem deep and offer a lot of freedom (even if I can’t claim to understand some of them fully), and the boss fights gave me a serious run for my money that’s rare these days. All that’s already got me pretty excited to play more.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Today, that's the Tomodachi Life community, who are celebrating all over social media in the wake of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-announced-for-nintendo-switch">announcement of Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream today</a> at the Nintendo Direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seriously, I don't think I've seen gamers this happy in a long time. Across Twitter/X, Bluesky, Reddit, and other social platforms, Tomodachi Life lovers are having the time of their lives, and making the memes to prove it. Here's just a small sample of the many, many, MANY celebrations to make your day:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">TOMODACHI LIFE SEQUEL ARE YOU KIDDING ME <a href="https://t.co/Zj6wFyRfxo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Zj6wFyRfxo</a></p>— Wind Waker Switch 2 Daily (@WindWakerDaily) <a href="https://twitter.com/WindWakerDaily/status/1905267552869060671?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I hope whoever made the Tomodachi Life summoning circle is living their best life right now <a href="https://t.co/9sCHgADL0o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/9sCHgADL0o</a></p>— sephi (@SephiGoat) <a href="https://twitter.com/SephiGoat/status/1905269369719914837?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Even better are some of the Reddit threads posted <em>before</em> the Direct, suggesting it was foolish to hope for a new Tomodachi Life, and now filled with replies joyfully eating crow about it:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">it’s time <a href="https://t.co/fBlRKW31zG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/fBlRKW31zG</a> <a href="https://t.co/aD0lfOzl47" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/aD0lfOzl47</a></p>— M1das (@M1das_OW2) <a href="https://twitter.com/M1das_OW2/status/1904940990718501256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 26, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Congratulations as well to this very, very specific Twitter account that's been keeping the fires burning for Tomodachi Life for years now:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">OH MY FUCKING GOD</p>— Number of days without Tomodachi Life 2 (@Tomodachi2count) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tomodachi2count/status/1905274570711478758?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">One segment of the community is especially excited by what they see as a tease of a long-awaited feature in Tomodachi Life: same-sex relationships. Way, way back in 2014, Nintendo issued a formal apology to fans of the game for not including same-sex relationships, saying that it was "not possible" to change the game's design so drastically after launch by implementing them in a patch. However, Nintendo also said, "We pledge that if we create a next installment in the Tomodachi series, we will strive to design a game-play experience from the ground up that is more inclusive, and better represents all players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream's trailer today, there was a brief encounter between two women that some fans are interpreting as a tease that Nintendo is about to fulfill its promise to fans.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>“We apologize for disappointing many people by failing to include same-sex relationships in Tomodachi Life. if we create a next installment in the Tomodachi series…design a game-play experience …that is more inclusive…”</p><p>Then does that team these two are hinting at,,,y’know😳 <a href="https://t.co/FZP35A1ids" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/FZP35A1ids</a></p></div>— Senpai (@_CSenpai_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_CSenpai_/status/1905271126202216575?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">NINTENDO ARE THEY GAY????

            <p>
Ubisoft has launched a new subsidiary dedicated to its big three IPs - Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry - in a move CEO Yves Guillemot calls a "new chapter" for the company. Chinese conglomerated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> will hold a minority stake in the new entity, having invested €1.16bn.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's announcement follows several <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets-report">recent reports</a> such a move was being considered behind the scenes. Earlier this month, Bloomberg claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-considering-fresh-business-to-own-assassins-creed-and-other-big-franchises-co-owned-by-others-like-tencent">Ubisoft was mulling over the launch of a fresh business unit part-owned by outside companies</a>, noting such a tactic could potentially result in the new entity being valued higher than Ubisoft itself following years of falling share prices and a string of disappointing game launches.
</p>
<p>
In today's official announcement, Ubisoft valued its new subsidiary at around €4bn. This, it wrote, "highlights the strong value of [its] IPs, significantly reinforces its balance sheet, and enables the company to continue its efforts to become a more agile organisation, unleash the full creative potential of its teams and better align its resources with the constantly evolving expectations of players."

<p>
It also confirmed the business unit will be the new home of all Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far cry development teams based in Montréal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. Additionally, the subsidiary will control each series' "back-catalog and any new games currently under development or to be developed."
</p>
<p>
"Today Ubisoft is opening a new chapter in its history," Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot wrote in a statement accompanying the announcement. "As we accelerate the company's transformation, this is a foundational step in changing Ubisoft's operating model that will enable us to be both agile and ambitious. We are focused on building strong game ecosystems designed to become evergreen, growing high-performing brands and creating new IPs powered by cutting-edge and emerging technologies."
</p>
<p>
As to what the new subsidiary will actually <em>do</em>, Guillemot says it'll focus on "transforming [Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry] into unique ecosystems". The announcement takes this a little further, claiming the "greater investment and boosted creative capacities [will] drive further increases in quality of narrative solo experiences, expand multiplayer offerings with increased frequency of content release, introduce free-to-play touchpoints, and integrate more social features."
</p>
<p>
Away from the new subsidiary and its three big name brands, Ubisoft says it'll concentrate on "nurturing the development of iconic franchises including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-ghost-recon">Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon</a> and The Division, accelerating the growth of top performing titles and leveraging disruptive technologies on selected new IPs, while continuing to deliver state-of-the-art production game engines and online services." More details are set to be shared at a later day.
</p>
<p>
This seismic shake-up of Ubisoft's structure follows a tumultuous few years for the publisher - which earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">confirmed it was undertaking a strategic review to help it right-size the business</a>, amid tumbling share prices and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">number of high-profile flops</a>, including last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. Ubisoft's failings have also significantly impacted staff - a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">string of job cuts</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff">studio closures</a> in recent times have seen its employee numbers shrink from over 20,279 people in 2022, to 18,666 in September 2024, with more redundancies having been made since then.
</p>
<p>
It remains to be seen whether Ubisoft's newly announced subsidiary can help change its fortunes, but the publisher has recently celebrated the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">numerous delay</a>s. Earlier this month it said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-tops-2-million-players-surpassing-the-launches-of-origins-and-odyssey">Shadows had topped over two million players</a>, "surpassing the launches of [Assassin's Creed] Origins and Odyssey".

During this event, the UK-based tabletop studio announced new products coming <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-old-world-core-boxes-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer The Old World</em></a>. Here is everything they announced.</p>

<h2>The AdeptiCon 2025 Preview Event Announcements</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/or72z0uw/every-reveal-from-the-warhammer-preview-show-at-adepticon-2025/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop assembled everything announced during the AdeptiCon 2025 preview event. Those announcements covered both major tentpole franchises and various spin-offs.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/adepticon-2025-preview-space-wolves-box-artwork.jpg?itok=yNMt0xkf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/adepticon-2025-preview-space-wolves-box-artwork.jpg?itok=72P0PIlA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For fans of the grimdark sci-fi future of <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>, the first big announcement centered on the space viking chapter of the Space Marines. Yes, the Space Wolves are getting new miniatures, a dedicated army box, and their own codex. These new miniatures include new Wolf Guard units and the Blood Claws.</p>

<p>For those that have rejected Imperium dogma, the preview included a new look at several Chaos Space Marine chapters. Like the Emperor's Children, the World Eaters, Death Guard, and Thousand Sons are getting their own dedicated codices. More blood for the Blood God.</p>

<p>On the gameplay side of things, the AdeptiCon 2025 Preview event highlighted a new Chapter Approved Mission Deck. This deck will change Matched Play by introducing three new ways to play: Incursion (1000 points), Strike Force (2,000 points) and the new Asymmetrical War mode. As the name implies, Asymmetrical War features uneven deployment zones and differing primary objectives.</p>

The Typhon box ramps up the battle on Volkus, where the Adeptus Mechanicus must fend off a swarm of Tyranids. Yes, playable Tyranids are coming to Kill Team. The box even includes Tyranid-themed terrain.</p>

<p>In the land of the Mortal Realms, the AdeptiCon 2025 Preview event confirmed a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-spearhead-mode-introduced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Warhammer Age of Sigmar Spearhead</a> set. The set, Spearhead: Sand and Bone, brings the smaller, more streamlined Spearhead rules to the dark lands of Dolorum and the chilling deserts of Ossia. The set includes new twists, Battle Tactics, Objectives, rules for four new Spearhead armies, and terrain fitting a Realm of Death.</p>

<p>Those new Spearhead armies are the Cities of Sigmar's Fusil-Platoon, the Serephon Sunblood Prowlers, the Ossiarch Bonereapers Mortisan Elite, and the Ogor Mawtribes Scrapglutt.</p>

First is the introduction of the Grand Cathay army for the forces of Order. This East Asia-coded army will be getting an arcane journal and battalion box with 50 miniatures. Those miniatures will include 30 Jade Warriors, 10 Jade Lancers, two different artillery units, and the battalion's leader: A Shugengan Lord astride their Great Spirit Longma mount.</p>

<p>The preview extends into the forests of the old world. On the side of chaos are the forest-dwelling, corruption-spreading Beastmen Brayherds. They will be receiving an arcane journal and battlion box of their own. Their units include ferocious shamans, chieftains, Tuskgor Chariots. Challenging them on the side of Order are the Wood Elf Realms wit their own battalion box respectively.</p>

<p>This preview is but a glimpse of announcements and developments coming to Games Workshop's franchises in the future. Release dates and price points for these announced products are all pending.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-is-paving-the-way-for-the-switch-2.1147014/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/637597/nintendo-virtual-game-cards-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>The biggest news at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/636750/nintendo-switch-march-2025-direct">Nintendo’s March Direct showcase</a> was a software update. Mixed in amongst <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/630255/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-trailer">a trailer for <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637319/nintendo-today-news-app">the surprise reveal of a mobile news app</a>, the company also announced what it calls “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637307/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-card-lending-system">virtual game cards</a>.” They’re billed as a lending system that makes it relatively straightforward to share digital games between devices. But really, they’re a tool that could make the transition to the Switch 2 later this year much easier.</p></div><p>As Nintendo explains it, these virtual cards work a lot like physical cartridges. You can “eject” a game from one device and then load it onto another, so long as the second Switch is tied to your account or a member of your family plan. Digital games “can also be lent to a Nintendo Account family group member’s system via local wireless connection,” and they’ll be able to play the game for two weeks before it’s automatically returned to you.</p><p>It’s an extremely Nintendo feature, in that it’s a playful attempt at bringing traditional physical game features into the digital realm, and that it also has some caveats, like the limited two week period, which is nowhere near enough time to make a dent in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>. Still, it seems to be a step up from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/wiki/gamesharing/">the way sharing currently works</a>, where a secondary Switch can only play games if it’s connected to the internet to verify things, rendering it largely useless while traveling. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fvirtual-game-cards%2F" rel="sponsored">Nintendo specifies in the fine print</a> that “once a virtual game card is loaded to a system, not only can you play it without an internet connection, but other user accounts on the system can play, too.”</p><p>More interesting than the feature itself is the timing. It’ll be available as part of a system update for the Switch at some point in April. Also happening in April? <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time">The big Nintendo Direct where the company will reveal actual details of the Switch 2</a>, presumably including the price, release date, and line-up of launch games. Expectations are it won’t be much longer after that before the Switch 2 finally launches.</p><div><p>Sorting out the sharing features is good news for current Switch owners. But because it’s happening at the end of that console’s lifecycle, it’s pretty clear Nintendo means for this to be a hopefully painless way of moving to the Switch 2. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343666/nintendo-switch-2-cartridge-backwards-compatibility">The next console will be backward compatible with original Switch games</a>, and that library is incredibly important. Not only is it huge, but it’s filled with some of Nintendo’s most successful games ever, like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">Breath of the Wild</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/21/15382628/mario-kart-8-deluxe-nintendo-switch-best-features">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em>.</p></div><p>And it’s a library that keeps growing: there are still major Switch 1 games in the works for this year, like <em>Metroid</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637256/pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-day-night-cycle"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, while the just-announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/637362/to"><em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em></a> doesn’t even launch until 2026. In the press release announcing the virtual game cards, Nintendo made sure to note that they “will also work with Nintendo Switch 2 systems at launch.”</p><p>Nintendo has always had a complicated relationship with the internet and user accounts (see: Friend Codes). But the new virtual card system at least makes it clear that the company sees the importance of creating a more unified system for users to play things across devices. Because whenever the Switch 2 does launch later this year, there’s going to be a whole lot more people with multiple consoles in their homes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Employees Worried About Layoffs After Tencent Deal]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employees-worried-about-layoffs-after-tencent-deal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On Thursday afternoon, Ubisoft announced that it was forming a new subsidiary company with Tencent that will include the company’s three biggest franchises along with a number of studios. This has led to a number of employees within Ubisoft to become worried about mass layoffs happening in the coming months either before or after the deal with Tencent is completed.</p>



<p>Not long after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the deal was announced</a>, multiple current Ubisoft employees reached out to express feelings of uneasiness and concern about the future of the company. Specifically, those not working on Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internal email acquired</a> by Insider Gaming, Ubisoft’s Marie-Sophie de Waubert said that she understands that there is uncertainty and questions surrounding what’s going to happen. She also tried to calm any worries about those not working on the three franchises.</p>



<p>“I also want to be clear: if you’re not currently working on these brands, it doesn’t mean your work matters any less,” she said. “This agreement will benefit all of Ubisoft, giving us the means to spark more innovation and creativity across the board. This marks the beginning of a new chapter, and you play a vital role in shaping it.”</p>



<p>Despite the messaging, however, some aren’t buying it.</p>



<p>“We feel [expletive] if we’re not on the big three,” one current Ubisoft employee said under the condition of anonymity. “They can say these things in an email, but when it comes down to it, we feel like we know where priorities are.”</p>



<p>Said another employee currently working on an unannounced project, “I want to think our team is okay right now, but we don’t know. You’d think they’d have at least some sort of clarity for us before publicly announcing the deal.”</p>



<p>The other messages received all relayed similar sentiments. There is some excitement and hope that a turnaround is coming for the company, but until questions about their status are answered, those in various areas of the company don’t want to get happy.</p>



<p>“We just want to know what’s going on,” one source said. “They promised transparency and regular communication with us, but we’ll see if that actually happens.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft regarding what the deal with Tencent means for its employees and the possibility of layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to the article.</p>



<p>Ubisoft anticipates the full deal to be completed before the end of 2025.</p>

<p>The product has evolved into something akin to Slack, but for personal use. It's used by artist communities, game developers, open source projects, influencers, and more to manage communities and coordinate work. In some cases, people simply use it as an extremely robust group messaging tool for groups of friends without any games or projects involved.</p>
<h2>Limited ads to tackle limited revenue</h2>
<p>For years, Discord proudly touted a "no ads" policy, but that dam has broken in some small ways in recent months. Discord began offering game publishers opportunities to create special "quests" that appear in the Discord interface, wherein players can earn in-game rewards for doing specific tasks, like streaming a game to friends. A new format, called video quests, is planned for this summer, too.</p>
<p>The new ad products are meant to drum up Discord's revenue potential in the lead-up to an IPO; the platform already offered premium subscriptions for access to more advanced features and a marketplace for cosmetics to jazz up profiles.</p>
<p>So far, the ad products are, by and large, much less intrusive than ads in many other social networks and seem to be oriented around providing some user value. However, an IPO could lead to shareholders demanding more from the company in pursuit of revenue.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-460201">The Last of Us Part II</a> debuted in 2020, it did so after a few major plot points were spoiled online well in advance. Now, with the show set to adapt that story when The Last of Us Season 2 premieres on HBO in a few weeks, there's a risk a whole new audience will have their experience altered by the prevalence of spoilers online. But for showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, the latter of whom is now living through this predicament for a second time, spoilers aren't a huge concern.</p><p dir="ltr">"I feel like the best way I could respect the audience is by not thinking about them too much when I'm working on whatever I'm writing. That way I could just make the best decision with as little outside influence as possible, and make the best internal decisions for the characters, for the story, for the medium," Druckmann told GameSpot. "And you know, when it comes to like, what are we going to spoil or not spoil? You know, I fought tooth-and-nail when we made the game, and that all blew up in my face at the end, when we had those leaks that happened like months before the game came out. So I've learned to not put so much stock in that. But also, now I have a creative partner, HBO. I kind of follow their lead here as far as spoilers and what we should show and not show and just, you know, again, approach it as if we're doing it for the first time, assuming the audience doesn't know anything. They're not Googling what happened in the game or not."</p><p dir="ltr">Even with spoilers floating around for those who can't resist looking for them, the second season, like the first season, changes some details in order to ensure the team is "making the best choices for this moment in time," as a TV audience has different needs than a video game player.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4466722-bella-ramsey.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466722" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1584" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4466722-bella-ramsey.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466722"></a><figcaption>The Last of Us Season 2 premieres on April 13 on HBO and Max.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4466722-bella-ramsey.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"But also, again, my approach with the show is, I assume you know nothing," he continued. "I assume you haven't played the game. I guess there's some assumption you've watched the first season, but even that, we're not 100% sure, so HBO created this beautiful recap of Season 1."</p><p dir="ltr">I asked the pair if the production team created any content meant as spoiler disinformation, like when creators for Lost or Game of Thrones would film scenes they had no plans to use just to fill the spoiler forums with disorienting noise--a practice that horrifies Mazin.</p><p dir="ltr">"The thing is, it's really hard to make the show. We use every second of every day to make the stuff we want to make," he said. "The thought of spending time shooting stuff we don't want to make is sort of a horrifying prospect to me. And I think Neil's right. The thing about spoiler stuff is it's kind of overrated; the impact that it has is overrated. And you can look at that just empirically with The Last of Us Part II, which had the leaks. There was all this spoiler outrage, and then the games sold gazillions of copies and won every award you can win, and it was beautiful. It didn't matter the spoiler. Like, I always use the example of Titanic, although, honestly, I could use Chernobyl, too. 'Hey, here's a spoiler. It blew up, right?' [The] Titanic sinks, and we all still went to the theater to watch it because we don't care about that. We care about the relationships."</p><p dir="ltr">The Last of Us Season 2 premieres on HBO and Max beginning on April 13 and will run for seven episodes on a weekly release schedule. The season won't cover all of The Last of Us Part II's story, and a third season is planned, though not yet officially announced.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch - Virtual Game Card Update Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The capitalization of "Edition" in that phrase is what's interesting--while Nintendo has mentioned that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">Switch 2</a> will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">backward-compatible</a> with select Switch 1 games, the company hasn't elaborated further on how that will work. This new phrase, and the way it's presented on this official Nintendo website, implies that it is an official term to distinguish between Switch 2-only games and Switch 2 versions of other games. Switch 2 Edition games could refer to enhanced versions of Switch games, though whether such a thing will exist or if there will be any upgrade cost remains unknown.</p><p dir="ltr">There have been multiple rumors of games that have previously launched on the current Nintendo Switch receiving some sort of enhancement on the upcoming successor. The Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has been mentioned among the likely candidates, while the recent Xenoblade Chronicles X remaster was found to be hiding a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-editions-hidden-mode-could-hint-at-switch-2-feature/1100-6530249/">secret 60 frames-per-second mode</a> within its code.</p><p dir="ltr">Virtual Game Cards were one of many announcements during the most recent Nintendo Direct, which also included the debut announcements of new games in Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-rhythm-heaven-is-coming-to-switch-but-not-until-2026/1100-6530421/">Rhythm Heaven</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-coming-to-nintendo-switch-in-2026/1100-6530426/">Tomodachi Life</a> franchises. The Direct also provided updates on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-gets-gameplay-deep-dive-slick-new-suit/1100-6530408/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-reveals-its-big-twist-on-gameplay/1100-6530425/">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has not directly mentioned "Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" games as of this writing, but that may change during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Direct livestream slated for April 2 at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET.</p>

While </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> didn't have the massive scope of the dev's other titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or the most recent </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the game's director did have one particular vision for the game's storytelling that required a significant amount of convincing to get the team on board—and that was with how the fonts would look in-game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During GDC 2025, game director Joshua Sawyer (previously helming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pillars of Eternity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) spoke about his work conceptualizing and building </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s approach to text-based storytelling and how the game's fonts needed more than static characters in speech bubbles to authentically depict an evolving game world with different cultures via a "typographic voice."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Rats, horse testicles, and fonts—OR: How to go the extra mile with your game">Rats, horse testicles, and fonts—OR: How to go the extra mile with your game</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At Sawyer's panel, titled "Justifying Absurd Expenditures on Fonts and Other Silly Features," he broke down some common struggles developers tend to fall into when trying to deliver a product. In many cases, developers tend to provide a game that is seen as a "minimum viable product," especially at first. which is a game with baseline features and nothing particularly noteworthy. Another approach is to elevate the concept go for the "maximum viable product."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/why-your-next-game-needs-a-babygirl" target="_self" data-discover="true">Why your next game needs a babygirl</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some examples he included were </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Plague Tale</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s dynamic, fully animated rat swarms, which appear like a living mass to players. In another example, Sawyer brought up </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Red Dead Redemption 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s infamous horse testicles, which shrink when riding in cold climates. As Sawyer put it, adding these features—which aren't always vital for a game—do a lot to elevate the experience into something more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What about the maximum viable product? It's way more than what's needed, you got every bell and whistle—you're inventing bells and whistles, and you're trying to elevate the experience through a type of unique maximalism that hasn't been seen [in a game]," said Sawyer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Following the above, Sawyer explained his vision for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a 16th-century European detective game where players must read and analyze intent and meaning from character interactions to make critical choices. Inspired by games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>80 Days</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Night in the Woods</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s unique approach to storytelling highlights its dynamic text presentation, featuring animated medieval-era typography that's unique for each interaction and NPC. This gives </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a feeling that you're looking into a living medieval-era painting or illustrated tome that's being created as you go—which Sawyer stated was to depict the "physicality of writing in books."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/uc-santa-cruz-professor-roleplays-gig-economy-publisher-negotiation-and-layoffs-with-game-design-students" target="_self" data-discover="true">UC Santa Cruz professor roleplays gig economy, publisher negotiation, and layoffs with game design students</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Depending on your choices and the protagonist Andreas's growth, the game's approach to text will evolve and shift over the course of the game. As the game director described it, being passionate about a feature is the first step of getting your concept off the ground, but the following steps include getting your team on board with the idea and then bringing it to life in a compelling way—which present unique challenges all their own.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One of many problems is that there were [letter] character set issues, so these might have supported the languages they originally came from," said Sawyer. "For example, many of the [characters] came from German or Swiss sources; while they might have been clear, they didn't have the characters that might be needed in Polish or Spanish or French or anything else. So that was tricky. Also, if they looked authentic [to the era], they were often quite difficult to read. Yes, we wanted them to look authentic, but the difficult-to-read part is not good for a game full of text."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What's in a font?">What's in a font?</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/achieving-creative-sobriety-in-game-design" target="_self" data-discover="true">Achieving 'creative sobriety' in game design</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sawyer described </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as "not a small game, but not an 'indie' game"—given that it had support from Microsoft Game Studios. With over three years in development and a team of 13 by the end of production, it was a modestly sized game, but Sawyer's ideas for using dynamic typography for its storytelling presented a wrinkle that took time to work out.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What sets </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> apart from other reading-dense RPGs like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disco Elysium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pillars of the Earth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is how it makes the act of reading—and viewing the text—a part of the experience. You essentially become a medieval-era detective. This was a part of the core vision of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, in that 16th century Bavaria was a melting pot of different cultures and social classes, and protagonist Andreas must be able to navigate a diverse society with unique characters who have different philosophies and worldviews, all reflected in the font-style.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To build out the whole suite of custom typography, the developers contacted Lettermatic founder Riley Cran. Working with Cran's company, they designed the game's six custom fonts—Peasant, Cursive, Humanist, Printed, Textura, and Thread Puller. Creating each font—aiming for authenticity rather than total accuracy— allowed the developers greater control over the text, at the cost of being time-consuming. Sawyer recommended that devs try to create their fonts to own it, but only if they have the resources and means to do so.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The control you have with the fonts is unparalleled, it's fantastic," he said. "You can get exactly what you need; you can get support for any localization you want, and it's your font. You don't have to worry about ongoing licensing issues and all that sort of nonsense. We eventually released our fonts for basically free to the public, and they use it for making shit posts and memes, which is the highest point of it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another vital resource that Obsidian Entertainment relied on was the accessibility teams at Microsoft, who helped hone the visual presentation of the text for readers of all kinds and text related to specific cultures. Sawyer cited some instances where the game touched on specific topics, and Microsoft sensitivity readers offered feedback to help refine it further.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One method that Sawyer suggested to elevate the look of the text and give it a dynamic feel was the stroke-by-stroke illustration of letters in real-time, which he noted wasn't exactly met with enthusiasm from the team. "So when I brought up stroke-by-stroke rendering to the team, it wasn't that people hated the idea, but there was skepticism about it," said Sawyer. Eventually, the engineering team—opting out of his initial pitch of using different alpha channels to similar motion—used his concept and built it with Adobe Illustrator, applying gradients and animation to recreate real-time illustrative pen strokes on parchment.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Sell your vision">Sell your vision</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sawyer concluded the talk by giving attendees tips on how to best present their concepts to their teams. For </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the dynamic text and fonts showcased a level of authenticity for the game's setting and concept of playing within a living book—something that Sawyer admitted took effort to get right.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is not enough for you alone to believe in this mission—the team does have to believe in this vision as well," said Sawyer. "The vision also has to include a plan, which will make people feel somewhat more confident in the idea that you are giving them. If you succeed with the core features, people will be more confident and happier about the idea of doing other things related to it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The decision to go the extra mile was worth it as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is widely regarded as one of Obsidian Entertainment's best games. All it took to help the game reach its success and elevate its concept was coming up with an idea that seemed far-fetched, but ultimately worth the effort.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.

			<p>Ubisoft <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1905268079958904991" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> via social media channels that Assassin's Creed Shadows has now surpassed three million players. They also shared the following milestones:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅2nd highest Day 1 sales revenue in Assassin's Creed franchise history</li>
<li>✅Biggest Ubisoft Day 1 ever on PlayStation Digital Store</li>
<li>✅Best community ever, with over 40 Million hours already played</li>
</ul>
<p>This follows the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-one-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">becoming a million seller on launch day</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reached-2-million-players-besting-origins-and-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaching two million units on March 22</a>. Since then, we also learned that Assassin's Creed Shadows was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-biggest-physical-game-of-the-year-in-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best retail launch of 2025 in the United Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>The game has undoubtedly been well-received. On Steam, the average review verdict is 'Very Positive' (82%). Critics were also quite positive; the game was rated 8.7 out of 10 here on Wccftech in the review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written by Francesco De Meo</a>:</p>
<p><em>Everything considered, Assassin's Creed Shadows is undoubtedly a solid open-world role-playing game and one of the best entries in the series in a long time. It brings back the stealth gameplay that made the series what it is and seamlessly combines it with the combat-focused experience seen in Valhalla. While the content bloat is still as annoying as ever, the solid narrative, engaging gameplay, and one of the most beautiful renditions of Feudal Japan ever released make it a game worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em></p>
<p>The game's success came at an absolutely critical time for Ubisoft. Earlier today, the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the rumored decision to form a new subsidiary that will take control of Ubisoft's most successful franchises: Far Cry, Rainbow Six, and Assassin's Creed itself. The strong performance of Assassin's Creed Shadows undoubtedly allowed Ubisoft to be stronger in the negotiations. Just like the rumors had <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-is-seeking-investors-for-new-entity-that-will-hold-the-publishers-biggest-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a>, Tencent has a 25% minority stake in the new subsidiary following a cash investment of €1.16 billion.</p>

The massive deal allows the founding Guillemot family to remain in control of the publisher despite its recent struggles and cratering share price. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,195776,196566" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The details of the agreement are complex and it’s not immediately clear how it will all hash out in practice. The new entity doesn’t have a name yet but will have its own board of supervisors and include Ubisoft studios Montreal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. Those teams will be in charge of the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> franchises moving forward, as well as their back catalogs. But all of it will still report up to Ubisoft proper and its current CEO, Yves Guillemot.<br></p><p> “With the creation of a dedicated subsidiary that will spearhead development for three of our largest franchises and the onboarding of Tencent as a minority investor, we are crystalizing the value of our assets, strengthening our balance sheet, and creating the best conditions for these franchises’ long-term growth and success,” Guillemot said in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1uPFqvuRRej3UoemTIgVLH/18f1d055777e1b39a3f79a951452b9e1/2025.03.27_-_Press_Release_vfinal.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1uPFqvuRRej3UoemTIgVLH/18f1d055777e1b39a3f79a951452b9e1/2025.03.27_-_Press_Release_vfinal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a press release</a></span> on Thursday. “With its dedicated and autonomous leadership team, it will focus on transforming these three brands into unique ecosystems.” </p><p>On a call with investors following the announcement, however, the company’s leadership clarified that Ubisoft 2, or whatever it ends up being called, will still report up to Guillemot. “There will be a dedicated management under the supervision of a board that will be controlled by Ubisoft,” CFO Frederick Duguet told investors. “So Ubisoft will continue controlling and consolidating this entity.”</p><p>The major deal comes after months of speculation about a possible sale of the French publisher following a year of poor sales for some of its biggest recent blockbusters, including <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em> and <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, as well as delays and cancellations of other big releases, including free-to-play shooter&nbsp;<em>The Division Heartland</em>. Those rumors included a shareholder report that Ubisoft <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shareholder-claims-company-failed-to-disclose-meetings-with-ea-and-microsoft-about-ip-acquisition/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shareholder-claims-company-failed-to-disclose-meetings-with-ea-and-microsoft-about-ip-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was even exploring a sale</a></span> of some of its franchises to Microsoft and others. Under the new structure, series like <em>The Division</em>, <em>Ghost Recon</em>, <em>The Crew</em>, <em>Prince of Persia</em>, and <em>Rayman</em> will remain under the broader Ubisoft umbrella. <br></p><p>Ubisoft is a sprawling organization with studios and employees spread out all over the world. The complex web facilitates a co-development process that the company uses to ship massive games in shorter time periods. But that also means that there’s no clean delineation between who works on what. While The Montreal and Quebec studios lead development on the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise, many employees within those offices still work on other franchises as needed. </p><p>Asked by investors how many of Ubisoft’s over 17,000 employees would be moving to the new group, the company said it was still too early to tell. That sentiment was echoed in an email sent to staff today from Ubisoft head of studios Marie-Sophie de Waubert. This brings some uncertainty and questions,” she wrote in an email obtained by<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a></span>. “Right now, we may not have all the detailed answers, but we are committed to communicating with you transparently and regularly.”</p><p>Two key provisions of the new agreement are that Tencent cannot sell its 25 percent equity stake for at least five years and Ubisoft “may not cease to hold a majority of New subsidiary voting rights and share capital for a 2-year period.” In the near term at least, the $1.25 billion deal sounds more like a financial instrument than anything else, and one that provides Ubisoft’s current ownership with more time to try to improve the company’s financial outlook. Prior to <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadow</em>’s launch, many asked if it would be enough to save the company from being broken up and sold for parts. For now at least, it seems like it won’t need to. </p><p><em>Update 3/27/2025 2:35 p.m. ET: Added more context from the investor call and internal emails. </em></p><p><em>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/r0-z3-skin-call-of-duty-controversial-paywall/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Move over, Terminator – an old familiar face is back in town and standing ready to take the spot of the most overpowered, controversial Call of Duty skin. When Season 03 arrives in Black Ops 6 on April 2, players will be able to unlock R0-Z3, a modern-day recreation of one of the sweatiest Operators in Call of Duty history.</p>



<p>Back in the day, ‘Roze’ was the firm favourite for players looking for an (unfair) edge over the competition. Her skin was darker than dark and made her a shadow in dimly-lit areas, and even a redesign to lighten her up didn’t do much to stem the sales.</p>



<p>There’s a really sneaky catch, though. You can only get the R0-Z3 skin if you own the BlackCell Battle Pass – the most expensive Battle Pass variant in Call of Duty. Surprise, surprise.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-signature-sweat">Signature Sweat</h2>



<p>The R0-Z3 skin, which is an all-new take on the classic Roze Operator, will be available exclusively through the BlackCell Battle Pass, which just so happens to be one of the most expensive single purchases you can make in Call of Duty. It’ll set you back $30 to obtain Season 03’s BlackCell Battle Pass, which is more than the average skin pack by far.</p>



<p>Here’s the spiel for R0-Z3, published in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-zombies-season-three-critical-launch-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent Call of Duty blog</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The new BlackCell Operator R0-Z3 arrives in an animated mantle and her signature mask along with her faithful hound, leading an awesome array of Season 03 BlackCell content. She is joined by a roster of teched out Operator Skins, sleek Weapon Blueprints, and sci-fi themed unlocks earned exclusively through BlackCell.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She looks as familiar as ever, but she has some golden splashes that make her fit with the BlackCell brand:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Roze first appeared in Warzone in July 2020, mere months after the game hit the market. She became a staple of the battle royale landscape, with everyone grinding the battle pass to Tier 100 to acquire the legendary Operator skin.</p>



<p>If you’ve got $30 to spare, you’ll be happy enough picking up BlackCell, and admittedly, it comes with heaps of bonus features for the avid Call of Duty fan. There are BlackCell-exclusive weapon blueprints for a range of firearms, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-amax-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMAX</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-hdr-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR</a>, which are returning for the reappearance of Verdansk in Warzone.</p>



<p>You’ll also get 1,100 COD Points, a 10% XP boost, and several exclusive skins for an array of Operators. They’re not as popular as R0-Z3 will be, but you never know.</p>



<p>Do you plan on getting the R0-Z3 skin as soon as possible, ready for Verdansk’s return? Let me know in the comments.</p>

It’s a move that finally allows two hidden-gem PlayStation games from the mid-2000s to stomp onto non-PlayStation platforms for the first time while updating them for PS5 players, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Having lived in the desolate frontier for years, the Patapon tribe was driven from their home by the Zigoton army,” an official description from new publisher Bandai Namco said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This drove them to become fierce warrior spirits that can only be commanded by the beat of the war drum, played by the Mighty One (the player). Their wait has finally come to an end as the drums of war are heard once again by the Almighty’s return to guide the Patapon tribe through their adventures to fight against challenging enemies and return them to their homeland.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Patapon 1+2 Replay seems to come with a few upgrades not seen in the 2017 PS4 remasters. Bandai Namco specifically lists upgraded graphics as one of the more noticeable additions, though returning Almighty will also notice added Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulty modes, as well as timing adjustment and constant command display options. While Patapon 1+2 Replay aims to bring the classic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/patapon">2007</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/patapon-2">2008</a> titles to players better than ever, there’s no sign of the PSP’s 2011 title, Patapon 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patapon may not be one of PlayStation’s more recognizable franchises, but it’s still a name that has been associated with the brand for nearly 20 years. It’s unclear why or how it’s leaping other platforms now or if the series will continue to blossom with any new entries in the future. There’s also been no mention of a potential Xbox version, so it’s best to expect Patapon 1+2 Replay on PC, Switch, and PS5 to be where things end for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on today’s news, you can catch up with everything else revealed during the March 2025 Nintendo Direct <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced">here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

While called Everybody's Golf in many regions, the series was Hot Shots Golf in North America for a while, until 2017's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/everybodys-golf">Everybody's Golf</a> reunited the franchise name. This latest entry, Everybody's Golf Hot Shots, looks to mark as much by combining the two names into one unified, new entry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's an interesting twist in the details, though. Digimon Survive studio HYDE is making this, under the Bandai Namco umbrella, in a partnership with Sony Interactive Entertainment. Traditionally, this has been a Sony-published series, and developer Clap Hanz was working on the series. Clap Haz released its own self-titled game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-20-years-making-playstation-golf-games-clap-hanz-wants-a-new-challenge">Clap Hanz Golf</a>, back in 2021.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, it looks like you can expect the usual blend of classic golf and some of the wackier options. Characters have their expressive celebrations, and several game modes offer strange, surprising mix-ups to your usual round of golf.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There will also be local couch co-op and online multiplayer, which is good news for those who, like me, grew up passing a controller around playing Hot Shots Golf. The announcement debuted during today's Nintendo Switch Direct, and I could see Everybody's Golf Hot Shots working pretty well as a couch co-op Switch game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No date's been set yet, but Everybody's Golf Hot Shots will be heading to PS5, Switch, and PC sometime this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced">head over to our recap of today's Nintendo Direct for March 2025</a> if you're looking for other announcements.

Just connect to your family group member’s system via local wireless when you want to lend a game. Both systems must also be connected to the internet.</p><p>You can lend one game per account for 14 days (unless the borrower returns it earlier).</p><p>After the game is returned the borrower will still have their save data, so they’ll be able to start where they left off if they borrow again or purchase the game.</p><p>Both local wireless and internet communication are required for lending software. Please note that some games, such as games available only as part of a Nintendo Switch Online membership, cannot be lent out.</p><p><em>*Available on Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch Lite, and Nintendo Switch – OLED Model systems in late April 2025. A system update is required to use this feature on Nintendo Switch systems.</em></p><p><em>**Compatible systems must be linked to a Nintendo Account to use virtual game cards. Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games and Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games can only be loaded on a Nintendo Switch 2 system. To move virtual game cards between two systems, you must pair the systems via local wireless and an internet connection, but only when pairing the systems for the first time. Up to two systems total can be linked per Nintendo Account.</em></p><p><em>*** An internet connection is required the first time you start a game that you have loaded to your system. An internet connection is also required each time a loaded title is ejected.</em></p></blockquote><p>Watch a video explaining the system below.</p><h2><span>Virtual Game Cards Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Virtual Game Card – Nintendo Direct 3.27.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EWwyh74MXXY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="バーチャルゲームカード 紹介映像" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GRgkf1jFx14?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It takes the genre at an unusual angle and offers something unexpected at every turn.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You arrive at the Archipelago on a strange mission: to kill the Deity, a mystical creature that everyone talks about, but no one has seen. To find the Deity, you will have to delve deep into the many secrets these islands keep. You will discover a place marked by tragedy, and filled with eccentric characters and remarkable contrasts.</p><p>Upgrade your cane with new parts and unlock new abilities, to explore the hidden corners of the Archipelago and face incredible creatures.</p><p><strong>Hand Crafted to the Smallest Detail</strong></p><p><em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> is the result of years of work by people who love and appreciate the same cartoons, comics and games that you do. We wanted to make an uncompromising 2D game of amazing beauty, so we went back to the genre’s roots and took the most difficult path possible – meticulously drawn, colored and animated by hand using classic frame-by-frame techniques. We didn’t cut any corners, and the results are worth it. In <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em>, no two rooms or landscapes are alike. Every place, every object, every character, every visual effect — everything is carefully planned and executed to the finest detail.</p><p>Remember how, when you were a child, you first saw your first 16-bit platformer and couldn’t believe your eyes? We want you to experience those feelings again—or maybe for the first time.</p><p><strong>Tapping the Best of the Genre</strong></p><p>Far from mindlessly relying on cliché and formula, <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> turns the genre on its head. The game carefully includes everything we all love most about side-scrollers, across the various styles, trends and eras. And it leaves out all the frustrating stuff that doesn’t make sense and wastes time.</p><p>It’s a challenging platformer that demands precision, but it never devolves into a grueling exercise where you have to memorize and methodically execute an exact sequence of <a title="Genres > Action [2,607 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. The key to success is improvisation and ingenuity.</p><p>It’s a game that encourages exploration and will give you a sense of discovery—but it won’t have you backtracking in confusion after you gain each new ability or artifact. It’s impossible to spend much time wandering around in <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> without doing anything interesting.</p><p>Finally, it’s a game with complex scenes, robust characters and a multi-layered story—but it never gets bogged down in thoughtful poses and feigned pretension. All the elements work to create an adventure that takes your breath away and breaks your heart.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Extended Gameplay Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="The Eternal Life of Goldman | Extended Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ebAKFMH1CHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When there's as big a brand as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/the-walt-disney-company">Disney</a>, that has enough money to just kind of throw whatever at the wall and see what sticks, eventually you wind up with something that might make you scratch your head a bit. Today, that thing is Disney Villains Cursed Café, a visual novel where you serve a bevy of potions to various Disney baddies, announced earlier today as part of the final Nintendo Direct for the OG Switch (but yes, it is on PC too - in fact it's already out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2439220/Disney_Villains_Cursed_Caf/">Steam</a>).
</p>

The concept is pretty simple: you are a Potionista, someone that, uh, brews potions, and you run a café frequented by Disney villains from a range of its films. That includes folks like Jafar from Aladdin, Ursula from The Little Mermaid, Gaston from Beauty and the Beast, all of them wearing not exactly casual outfits, but clothing you could see them wearing on the weekend at the very least.

For the most part gameplay looks simple. Brew a potion, serve them to the villain, listen to their stories. As mentioned it's a visual novel, and the emphasis more seems to be about chatting with Disney villains than anything particularly more complex (not to say that visual novel can't be complex, it's just this one doesn't seem to be).
</p>
<p>
There's just one thing I find a bit icky about it, as has been pointed out by several other people across social media, that being that it kind of seems to be ripping off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/coffee-talk">Coffee Talk</a>. I don't exactly love a giant like the House of Mouse trying to corporate-wash a beloved indie game like that in all honesty. Anyway, Maleficent getting an iPhone is kind of funny I guess.
