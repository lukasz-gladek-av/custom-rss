Really bad. People expected it to be bad but it was somehow even worse than that. With no major first-party game like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> and no massive pop cultural splash in the form of <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>, profits for the Japanese console manufacturer were down over 70 percent. </p><p>Here are some other interesting takeaways from Nintendo’s latest financial report:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Remasters of<em> Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door </em>and <em>Luigiʼs Mansion 2 HD 1</em> both sold over 1 million copies each</li><li>The breakdown of digital sales to physical sales jumped from 47.3 percent in the same period the year prior to 58.9 percent this time around</li><li><em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> sold more last year than all first-party games combined this year</li><li>But only sold an additional 1.3 million copies in the last nine months</li><li><em>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> actually sold <em>more</em> than <em>TOTK</em> last quarter</li><li>The Switch has reached 128 million individual players </li><li>The 3DS is dead but Nintendo still sold 60,000 games for it last quarter</li></ul><h2 id="h101289"><a id=""></a>Can the Nintendo Switch still outsell the PS2?</h2><p>The big news though is that Nintendo still plans to sell 13.5 million Switches this fiscal year. It’s already sold 2.1 million last quarter, which means it somehow needs to sell 11.4 million more this summer into the holiday season and beyond. If achieved, that would put it in spitting distance of the lifetime sales of the PlayStation 2, the best-selling console ever, known to have sold 155 million as of 2012. Maybe that’s why former Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-reveals-ps2-sold-160-million-units-worldwide&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-reveals-ps2-sold-160-million-units-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">parting gift was to move the goal posts</a></span> by announcing that the PS2 (which he helped market) ultimately went on to sell 160 million units. </p><p>It’s still possible the Switch could hit that number years into the lifecycle of a successor like a Switch 2, but analysts are skeptical given the lack of officially announced big sellers in the pipeline and the fact that total Switch sales the year that both<em> Zelda: TOTK</em> and <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder </em>came out were barely 15 million. “I really wonder how Nintendo wants to achieve their hardware sales target,” Tokyo-based analyst Serkan Toto <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-02/nintendo-s-profit-slides-as-consumers-await-new-flagship-console?srnd=undefined&amp;sref=P6Q0mxvj&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-02/nintendo-s-profit-slides-as-consumers-await-new-flagship-console?srnd=undefined&amp;sref=P6Q0mxvj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Bloomberg</em> today</a></span>. “I am skeptical if Nintendo still has enough fuel in the tank, especially if they plan to get to the target without hardware price reductions.”</p><p>A price cut is indeed one way that Nintendo could spur on new sales. While the company released the cheaper Switch Lite at $200, the stronger seller continues to be the Switch OLED at $350. Knocking $50 off of that hardware, which is running on several-year old specs at this point, would be a big deal. It’s also possible that Nintendo is still holding one or two big surprises up its sleeve for the fall and winter. And we shouldn’t underestimate the power of <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>—<em>Super Mario Party</em> remains the seventh best-selling game on Switch—and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom </em>could be a system mover despite its more old-school look. </p><p>But without a new <em>Pokémon</em> game this year, it seems more likely that 2024 will be the Switch’s weakest since 2018. Maybe there are a few more special edition Switches laying around. The gold one for <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> does look sharp, and convincing players to buy newer limited edition models while passing their older ones down to younger family members or friends is traditionally how Nintendo juices its handheld metrics. We’ll see if that’s the case this time around and the Switch threatens the PS2 for best-selling console of all time or stalls out like everyone expects. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So why does he do it? Money, naturally.</p><p>In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/film/news/harrison-ford-red-hulk-acting-captain-america-brave-new-world-1236091166/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/harrison-ford-red-hulk-acting-captain-america-brave-new-world-1236091166/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Variety</em></a></span>, Ford talked about the motion capture process he went through shooting the film, specifically regarding Ross’s Red Hulk transformation seen in <em>Brave New World</em>. When asked about what it took, his response was a very candid, Harrison Ford answer:</p><p>“It took not caring,” Ford told <em>Variety</em>. “It took being an idiot for money, which I’ve done before. I don’t mean to disparage it. I’m just saying you have to do certain things that normally your mother would not want you to do—or your acting coach, if you had one. But it’s fun, and I enjoyed it. I had a great time, and I’m delighted at the response that we got with the trailer.”</p><p>If you consider what playing a Hulk probably entails, I can imagine why Ford would describe it as having to essentially let loose and be “an idiot.” You gotta dress up in a motion capture suit and pretend to be a big, lumbering beast. That requires being a bit silly, and if you’re paid to do it, that’s a plus.</p><p>Ford takes over the role of Thaddeus Ross for <em>Brave New World</em>, the military figure-cum-president previously portrayed in five MCU movies by a mustachioed William Hurt, who sadly died in 2022. Ford will then reprise the role in <em>Thunderbolts* </em>on May 2 next year.</p><p>Ford’s comments on feeling like an idiot playing Red Hulk will probably catch some sideways looks from some Marvel fans, who demand it be taken with the utmost seriousness.

                <p>According to a new report, Microsoft and Activision are creating a new team inside Blizzard that will create "AA" games based on existing Blizzard properties.

Another benefit of making lower-budget games with smaller teams is that it could reduce the likelihood of "bureaucratic bloat" that can exist within big organizations, the report said.</p><p>This new AA studio would exist alongside Xbox's larger teams making games on bigger budgets.</p><p>Separately, the report mentioned how Halo developer 343 Industries has undergone a shift with the aim of becoming a "more streamlined single-team organization."

While <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23660809/wordle-new-york-times-interview-zoe-bell-gdc-2023"><em>The New York Times</em> is leading the way with <em>Wordle</em> and its iconic crossword</a>, major companies ranging from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22772589/netflix-video-games-app-news-updates">Netflix</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24145605/linkedin-gaming-puzzle-game-nyt-wordle-netflix-games">LinkedIn</a> are trying to carve out a place as well. So, when game designer Zach Gage, cofounder of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23984103/puzzmo-acquired-hearst-zach-gage">Hearst-owned site Puzzmo</a>, started exploring the space, he knew the project needed more than great games. He says the goal was to “design a website that isn’t just links to games but is in fact a deeper community experience.” That’s why <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23929222/puzzmo-newspaper-games-crossword-zach-gage">Puzzmo launched last year</a> with a handful of titles and multiplayer features like leaderboards.</p><p>Now both of those aspects are expanding with a new game that’s also introducing new ways to play — inspired by some of the biggest online shooters around.</p><p>Back in June, the site introduced <em>Pile-Up Poker</em>, a game that takes the rules of poker — namely the various hands — and turns it into a solitaire-like experience with the goal of earning a high score in the form of virtual cash. It’s a great addition to Puzzmo’s growing library of word games and other puzzles. It also came with a communitywide goal for everyone to work toward: earning a collective $1 trillion of in-game money. The idea is that every Puzzmo player contributes a little bit each day over time by playing <em>Pile-Up Poker</em> and racking up dollars. (Games like <em>Fortnite</em> have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1b51hyq/pandora_box_damage_already_above_10_less_than_90/">similarly experimented</a> with these kinds of collective goals.)</p><div><figcaption><em>Pile-Up Poker.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Puzzmo</cite></p></div><p>As the community pot grows closer to the goal, new features will be added for everyone. At launch, there was a deck of physical cards designed by <em>BoJack Horseman</em> artist Lisa Hanawalt, and just last week, Puzzmo added the option for clubs — in-game friend groups — to have their own custom, game-specific leaderboards so they can compare scores in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/18/14961332/typeshift-iphone-ipad-word-game-zach-gage"><em>TypeShift</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/13/13262994/really-bad-chess-zach-gage-iphone-ipad"><em>Really Bad Chess</em></a>. The tool is built to be flexible, so people can create hyperspecific ways to play with their friends.</p><p>This idea of ongoing support and updates comes from the battle passes found in games like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>League of Legends</em>. Gage is a hardcore <em>Apex Legends</em> player (he even does meetings inside of the shooter) and believes that the nature of a battle pass, with goals that encourage daily play, can nurture a more dedicated audience. “When you play every day, you start to care about the patch notes,” he explains. “It turns you into a quality community member instead of a person who is just stepping in and playing the game. You become invested.”</p><p>There are downsides, of course. A typical battle pass requires a huge investment from the developer to constantly make new in-game items for players, like <em>Fortnite</em>’s never-ending production line of skins. Daily missions can also become checklists for players rather than fun experiences. “Sometimes I have found myself playing a battle pass and wondered, ‘What am I doing? Why am I even playing this game right now? This is a waste of my time,’” Gage says. “That is a feeling that I don’t want anyone to have with any game that I’m making.”</p><div><p>“When you play every day, you start to care about the patch notes.”</p></div><p>Community objectives like the <em>Pile-Up Poke</em>r pot, which are designed sort of like Kickstarter stretch goals, solve these problems in a few ways. They don’t require much additional work for the developers since the upcoming features were already part of the roadmap. And players don’t experience the same kind of FOMO because, even if you miss a day or two, the rest of the community is still building toward those goals. At the same time, the process of hitting such a huge number has given a nice jolt to the community, according to Gage, citing vibrant discussions in the Puzzmo Discord. (He notes that the $1 trillion figure was chosen simply because “it sounded cool.”)</p><p>The hope is that the combination of all of those elements — friends groups, community goals, a deep and growing library of games — will be what it takes for Puzzmo to go up against its entrenched competition. “Everybody who we are competing with is trying to make a crossword that has the gravitas of The <em>New York Times</em> crossword,” says Gage. “But nobody is building a community around their crossword. That is the appeal of the <em>New York Times</em> crossword — there’s community. You can do it and talk to your friends about it.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Turkish air pistol shooter Yusuf Dikec has become an unlikely Olympic star after winning the silver medal at the 2024 Paris Games.
</p>
<p>
The 51-year-old won silver without any special equipment (lenses, eye covers, ear protection) and has subsequently been likened to a hitman, though he's in fact competed in every Summer Olympics since 2008.
</p>
<p>
His seeming nonchalance has been compared online to South Korean markswoman Kim Yeji, who also won silver in her event and has won over fans for just being impeccably cool.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, both sporting heroes have become the subject of video game memes.

<p>
If you haven't seen the specific video, Yeji has been given "Main Character Energy" with this clip going viral, although it's actually resurfaced from the International Shooting Sport Federation World Cup in May.

As for video games based on the Olympics, if you're <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/olympics-ditched-mario-sonic-series-to-explore-nfts-and-esports">missing a Mario &amp; Sonic game this year</a> it's all because the IOC is focused instead on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a> and esports.

Which is good! It means the cards are cheaper to buy for those looking to complete decks, collections, or binders, and offer less motivation to grubby scalpers who try to rip the former off. Shrouded Fable—a so-called “special set” (which mainly means you can’t buy them in single packs)—is yet again jam-packed with gorgeous cards, but with the rather peculiar detail that they make up a third of the set.<br></p><p>With only 99 cards total, this is the smallest set TPCi has released since 2022's <em>Pokémon GO</em> crossover. Compare it to the last special set, January’s Paldean Fates, and there’s a whopping 146 fewer cards to collect.</p><figure id="" data-id="1f9c6ae73948ea54bd309c73b5a55a02" data-recommend-id="image://1f9c6ae73948ea54bd309c73b5a55a02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shrouded Fable's ETB." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shrouded Fable's ETB." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1f9c6ae73948ea54bd309c73b5a55a02" data-recommend-id="image://1f9c6ae73948ea54bd309c73b5a55a02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shrouded Fable's ETB." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, based on my admittedly very small sample size (The Pokémon Company International sent us a total of 20 packs in various collection boxes and an Elite Trainer Box), the pull rates are not good at all. Out of all the packs, I pulled a total of <em>three</em> special art cards. Added to that are a further three basic ex cards (two of them the same), one Ace Spec, and three holo Energy cards, reminiscent of those found in Crown Zenith. But given how common we know those to be, if my sample is representative, that means those chasing any of the excellent 35 special art cards are going to have a rough time.<br></p><p>This has an odd effect, because if a third of all possible cards are rare as elephant wings, and ten of the remaining 64 are rarer types too, then you’re going to see half of the very small number of cards over, and over, and over, and over again. After opening just 20 packs, we had an average of four of every regular card, with three cards appearing a ridiculous <em>seven </em>times. Which led to the packs incredibly quickly feeling almost identical.</p><p>However, there <em>is</em> an upside to this for those who are building decks. For instance, Shrouded Fable sees the resurgence of the mighty Kingdra, since the splendid Astral Radiance full-art Kingdra went out of rotation in April this year. That ruined one of my favorite decks, but the new Kingdra ex brings an improved version of its ludicrously powerful stacking attack, and the six Seadra and three Horsea I pulled mean I can start building a new version immediately.</p><p>From today, you can buy Shrouded Fable in a lovely four-pack Kingambit box (the Kingambit art is wonderful), a three-pack blister with a Pecharunt card, one of five different two-pack tins, or a two-pack blister with a wholly unwanted Espathra card. (They are trying to push that hated monster <em>so</em> hard!) There is then some confusion about the availability of the five-pack Kingra and Greninja boxes, and indeed the Elite Trainer Box, which is officially listed as releasing on August 23, but with some sites and stores listing it as available now. We’ve asked TPCi for more details.</p><p><strong>Updated: 08/02/2024, 10:07 a.m. ET: </strong>Pokémon have got back to us to say that the Elite Trainer Box is indeed on sale now. The mystery of why the official site has the Pokémon Center version listed for late August remains!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/prison-architect-2-delayed-again-this-time-indefinitely.943038/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prison-architect-2-delayed-indefinitely<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox has announced yet another&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect 2&nbsp;</em>delay, and this time, there's no new release date on the horizon, so it's going to be a while before you can play the prison management sim.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/prison-architect-2-delayed-release.1697795/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the official Paradox forum</a>, the <i>Prison Architect 2&nbsp;</i>dev team says it won't be able to make the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prison-architect-2-delayed">previously-announced September release date</a> owing to a need for "time to improve both the game's performance and its content". These two areas were, Paradox says, identified by "continuous internal reviews and beta test groups" as places where the team needed to up its game.</p>
<p>The studio says it's still confident that&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect 2&nbsp;</em>will be "great", but that it wants to make sure the sequel "lives up to the franchise’s legacy" and that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prison-architect-2-double-eleven-leaves">developer Kokku</a> has the time it needs to make the game as good as it can be.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/prison-architect-2-delayed-indefinitely-yard.jpg?itok=MntdLc7y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/prison-architect-2-delayed-indefinitely-yard.jpg?itok=ELqnfCIi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Prison Architect 2&nbsp;</em>isn't coming out anytime soon, sadly.</figcaption></figure><p>Paradox goes on to say that it can't commit to a new release date because it needs to "re-assess the scope of the work needed to be done" before it knows when it will be able to launch&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect 2</em>. That's also why you won't be hearing much about the game in the near future; the publisher says it'll be limiting its communication in order to knuckle down and work on the game.</p>
<p>If you've pre-ordered <i>Prison Architect 2</i>, then your pre-order will be refunded, and items that would have been offered as part of that pre-order will instead be included in the base game.</p>
<p>The publisher closes its announcement by admitting that this "is not the announcement [it] hoped to make", but that it's "necessary" and that the delay will "result in a better game for you".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with <i>Prison Architect 2</i>, it's the upcoming sequel to 2015's successful prison management sim&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect</em>, which was developed by Introversion Software (and then Double Eleven from 2019 onwards).</p>
<p>The second game will bring the management sim gameplay into 3D, allowing you to build prisons with multiple levels, and it'll also introduce a number of other gameplay tweaks and improvements. Of course, now that we don't have a release date, we sadly don't know when you'll be able to enjoy those improvements.</p>
<p><em>Prison Architect 2&nbsp;</em>is set for launch sometime in the future on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1257610/Prison_Architect_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4139-PPSA14957_00-PRISONARCHITECT2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/prison-architect-2/9NF6CP5B3J18" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Will it be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled">canceled like&nbsp;<em>Life by You</em></a>? Only time will tell.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-and-activision-have-formed-a-new-team-within-blizzard-to-work-on-smaller-aa-games-based-on-existing-ip">new report</a> by Jez Corden via Windows Central, Microsoft and Activision have created a new team within Blizzard designed to work on smaller games.</p>



<p>The team’s work will reportedly involve “AA games based on existing Blizzard franchises like Overwatch, Warcraft, StarCraft, and beyond.” </p>



<p>Fans recently noticed that veteran King employees are updating their LinkedIn profiles to mention Blizzard instead. </p>



<p>Now, Corden cites sources claiming that the new team under Blizzard will be “comprised mostly with employees from King.” It is currently unclear which other employees outside King could join the new team.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Corden speculates on the team’s potential direction based on King’s previous mobile experience. The new Blizzard team could possibly support Xbox’s mobile plans. </p>



<p>Corden does point out that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently referenced a related plan for Xbox. However, at this time, the studios did not officially elaborate on the new team or its future projects. </p>



<p>There’s plenty of available IP that the new team could work with across platforms, such as the beloved Diablo series, or even Hearthstone. Although Blizzard <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blizzcon-2024-canceled-by-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled BlizzCon</a> this year, a new dedicated team may please fans.</p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1819360783811117168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, Corden added that “Microsoft wants its Xbox studios to collaborate more closely and support each other,” similar to Nintendo and Blizzard operations. </p>



<p>In February 2024, Activision and Blizzard titles began joining the Xbox Game Pass, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-iv-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beginning with Diablo IV</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/studio-global-presence-in-game-development-as-a-competitive-advantage<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Introduction">Introduction</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the very rich and complex world of game development studios face countless challenges that can hinder project success and operational efficiency or even stop it altogether. From balancing creative visions with technical constraints, to managing employee well-being, the obstacles are diverse and each significant to the process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a Studio Head responsible for running and growing Larian Studios in the UK, I have encountered many such situations that had to be dealt with in order to consistently achieve our goal which is delivering best-in-class RPGs. In this article, I’d like to describe a global studio presence framework that we have adapted and demonstrate how this strategic approach can provide solutions, drawing on insights from the industry. It’s partially thanks to this approach that we managed to achieve the release and ultimately win over 150 awards and nominations with Divinity: Original Sin, before going even further with Baldur's Gate 3, which launched to critical acclaim and received multiple Game Of The Year awards, including major trophies from the BAFTA Game Awards, Golden Joysticks, Game Developers Choice, DICE, and The Game Awards.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These achievements required a distinct strategy and vision. But before we get into that, let's have a look at the challenges.</span></p><p>Source: Photo by Jeshoots on Pexels</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Challenges">The Challenges</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="1. Balancing Creativity with Technical Feasibility"><span>1. Balancing Creativity with Technical Feasibility</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The boundless power of creativity is what drives the industry. But adapting it to technical constraints and building a robust internal company infrastructure is one of the main challenges in games development. It often happens that game studios come up with the most exciting ideas as they push the boundaries of modern technical tools, but that’s of no use if the project isn’t released on time or at all. And then there’s the constant challenge to ensure that creative visions can be manifested within the limits of existing hardware and engines without compromising the original vision or the final gameplay experience.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="2. Managing Scalable and Efficient Workflow"><span>2. Managing Scalable and Efficient Workflow</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In recent years we’ve seen the games industry produce some exciting masterpieces. With every new iteration, studios strive to outdo themselves in terms of not only artistic skills, but technical ones too. The workflows are becoming more and more intricate to allow for constant iteration while pushing the bar of the industry higher and higher. It’s quite a challenging task to manage a scalable workflow that can handle large assets, numerous iterations, and multiple teams (often spread across different locations and time zones). To set yourself up for success you need to know the collaboration within your teams is as streamlined as can be, and that there’s clear communication and alignment on your goals. This is mainly achieved through meticulous production management and the choice of technological and development tools.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="3. Adapting to Rapid Technological Changes"><span>3. Adapting to Rapid Technological Changes</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pace at which new technical solutions come around in the gaming industry (things like VR, AR, and cloud gaming have been mainly adopted on a larger scale in the last few years) means that studios have to continuously learn and adapt. Integrating these and other solutions into your game development pipeline can require a lot of extra resources and can present additional risks, however it’s often necessary to keep up with the competition or breathe life into new exciting ideas.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="4. Maintaining Employee Work/Life Balance"><span>4. Maintaining Employee Work/Life Balance</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s important to maintain focus on a healthy employee’s work/life balance as not doing it will almost certainly lead to team burnouts, affect developers mental health, ultimately reduce productivity in the long term, and even result in high staff turnover over time. These factors can compromise releasing the game altogether or maintaining the vision set at the beginning of the development cycle. Changing these things that have been around for decades for the better appears to be a significant challenge these days.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="5. Ensuring Financial Viability"><span>5. Ensuring Financial Viability</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game development is volatile by nature due to being expensive and risky at the same time. Studios have to secure enough funding and longer-term support to even have a shot at making their dream game, which can be difficult without a proven track record of past successes. Additionally, you need to be able to predict market trends and gamer preferences - often years in advance - to aim for a successful release. This adds one more layer of difficulty to the mix.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="6. Maintaining Player Engagement and Satisfaction">6. Maintaining Player Engagement and Satisfaction</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With thousands of games released every year, the task of maintaining player engagement is becoming more and more challenging. It’s not enough for studios to deliver innovative and high-quality games anymore as they also need to manage post-launch support through content updates and bug fixes while keeping the community excited to retain and increase the playerbase. This requires constantly allocating resources towards it and can be somewhat as demanding as the initial development.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Framework">The Framework</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The idea behind our framework and its implementation involves maintaining a presence in the form of game studios in specific countries for multiple strategic reasons. From acting as talent hubs to beneficial time zone overlaps, this approach might solve more issues than one would think. But here’s just a few reasons why we do it this way:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Talent Hub:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Each location is now a hub for talents in the region. People are generally much more inclined to work in a studio in their own country or a neighbouring one than move across the world, giving us a competitive advantage on finding and retaining the talent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Time Zone Overlap: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Having studios in multiple regions allows their time zones and work days to overlap. This is useful for a few reasons:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is always someone online within the team in their regular work hours, ready to offer advice, jump a call, or generally discuss something in their field of work..</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Healthier work/life balance as the company operates globally yet within reasonable working hours in each region. Thoughtful workload and task distribution helps avoid unnecessary strain on the team in regards to deadlines and shortage of time.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some tasks are passed from studio to studio where it’s applicable as the workday ends in one studio and begins in another one, ensuring continuous experience exchange and progress on features.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Centres of Expertise: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Depending on the specific talent pools in every region and despite a diverse development team in every studio, each one has major functions in which it acts as a centre of expertise, spreading it towards other studios. In our case this looks something like this, however this is a work in progress that may change over time depending on multiple factors at play:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Quebec, Canada (GMT-6)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Audio, Environment Art, Gameplay Animation, Gameplay Code, Gameplay QA, Production, Scripting, Tech Animation, VFX</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Guildford, UK (GMT +0)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Audio, Cinematic Animation, Production, Publishing, Scripting, Tools &amp; R&amp;D, UI/UX Design, Voice &amp; Performance, Writing</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dublin, Ireland (GMT +0)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Cinematic Art, Cinematic Animation, Lighting, Localisation, Publishing, Recruitment, Scripting, VFX, Writing</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Warsaw, Poland (GMT+1)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Tech, Production</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghent, Belgium (GMT+1)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Gameplay Animation, Gameplay Code, Engine Code, Character Art, Concept Art, Design, Environment Art, Scripting, Tech Art, Tech Animation, World Building</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Barcelona, Spain (GMT+1)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Console Code, Character Art, Design, Engine Code, Gameplay Code, Production, Scripting, Tech QA</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (GMT+7)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Automation QA, Cinematic Art, Cinematic Animation, Concept Art, Gameplay Animation, Gameplay QA, Scripting</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How it can help">How it can help</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="1. Balancing Creativity with Technical Feasibility"><span>1. Balancing Creativity with Technical Feasibility</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The wider your reach is, the more diverse tech expertise and resources you and your studio have access to. By having multiple studios across different regions you use a more distributed approach, inviting diversity in technological capabilities and creative inputs that can help in solving complex problems. For example, one studio might have a better grasp at cutting-edge rendering techniques, while another can easily amass writing talent. Together, these studios can both do what they are great at and combine forces, pushing both creative and technical boundaries.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By having a prominent global presence, a studio has access to a wider pool of talent, which makes it much easier to get experts in specific areas. It allows you to assign major specialisations to different locations based on their strengths and team composition. A studio in a region known for its capable engineering universities can focus on technical development like engine code, while the other one known for artistic schools could specialise in 2D/3D Art - as a broad example.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="2. Managing Scalable and Efficient Workflow"><span>2. Managing Scalable and Efficient Workflow</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fact that the process continues and the workflow never stops - on a global scale - is a big benefit to production deadlines. The operations being continuous across time zones allows for a "follow-the-sun" model where tasks are passed along across the globe, effectively utilising the so-called 24-hour work cycle of a distributed company. This setup minimises downtimes and can even enhance how responsive the studios are to development needs, one studio being able to pick up a project where another one left off. It keeps things moving forward and also allows for more predictable scheduling while reducing the pressure on the team, bringing you to more efficient and scalable workflows. This approach ensures that workloads in a given studio are way more balanced.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="3. Adapting to Rapid Technological Changes"><span>3. Adapting to Rapid Technological Changes</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Technological progress is constantly breathing down your neck, and yet you may see how different regions are adopting new tech at different speeds due to various reasons like legislation or global penetration of tech solutions. Having studios spread across the world can accelerate access to tech insights as this structure fosters a culture of continuous learning and adaptation, which is very important for staying ahead in a quickly evolving industry such as video games. Cross-pollination of ideas is mandatory for staying at the forefront of advancements in tech these days.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="4. Retaining Talent"><span>4. Retaining Talent</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the team distributed globally, the workload can be more evenly distributed even given time constraints and a sizable backlog of things to do. It allows you to maintain a healthy work/life balance in your teams as much as possible even towards the final stages of development whilst managing deadlines more efficiently. Transferring tasks across studios to balance the workload and to maintain regular working hours as much as possible and where possible can aid in promoting a much better culture at work as opposed to just single location teams. This in turn leads to a better retaining of talent as at the end of the day (or at the end of your whole development cycle) it facilitates improved employee satisfaction, reduces burnouts and generally keeps your studios a great place to work at, fostering loyalty and keeping things organised with a focus on well-being.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="5. Ensuring Financial Viability"><span>5. Ensuring Financial Viability</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The global presence also allows for a certain degree of risk diversification. If one market or project (in case you do multiple projects with such a structure) does not perform as you expect it to, others might compensate. If there’s a certain crisis or something out of the ordinary in a given region, normally others provide a bit more stability and predictability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, being present in multiple regions can increase your brand recognition and open up various funding opportunities with local accelerators or government bodies, such as being nominated for regional grants and various incentives not available to studios operating in a single country. This approach may also help in tapping into local player bases better and more effectively, tailoring content to regional preferences, and potentially increasing your overall revenue stream.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="6. Maintaining Player Engagement and Satisfaction"><span>6. Maintaining Player Engagement and Satisfaction</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Multiple studios around the world mean closer proximity to your players also spread across the world, enabling a better and more tailored market research and integration of diverse feedback into the development process. This produces culturally relevant and diverse content, increasing player satisfaction and engagement with your game. Post-launch support can be then handled in a more timezone-friendly manner too, because you can now give players faster responses and updates when it’s best to do so.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Making the Dream Come True">Making the Dream Come True</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As you can see, there are few things keeping your game studio becoming the best it can be. But international presence, while tough to master, can be a major step-up in your operations. Once you realise the importance of having a robust and adaptive framework and implement a similar structure into your operational approach, your workflow will become unmatched. I hope that this article serves as a starting guide to one of many ways of extracting the full potential of your studio.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Following&nbsp;<span>Bungie's layoff&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news</a></span>, several insiders have provided updates on their projects, starting with Destiny 3. <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1819075149360185737?t=Dc_izmLcLnoQhituMYpJuw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According</a> to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, sources inside Bungie confirmed that Destiny 3 was actually never in development, despite earlier <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-unveils-prismatic-subclass-destiny-3-leak-seemingly-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> to the contrary. The studio experimented with a spin-off project codenamed Payback for a while, but it was eventually shelved before the latest round of layoffs.</p>
<p>Bungie will instead continue to support Destiny 2, but according to another insider, Jeff Grubb, it will do so in a different fashion. During Grubb's Game Mess Mornings, the insider also confirmed the departure of major figures like Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy:</p>
<p><em>This other project, called Payback, was being overseen by Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy. This new thing was going to be the new Destiny experience, the next big thing for Destiny, but specifically not Destiny 3. Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy are no longer at Bungie; they were let go. Payback is on the shelf and the strategy now is, let's take Destiny 2 and we're going to make smaller experience packs, smaller, tinier, little things that are 6 months instead of the annual expansion packs they've done before. There'll be two smaller experience packs going forward.</em></p>
<p>This strategy change was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ehvju3/a_credible_destiny_2_leaker_reveals_new_changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> by another Destiny leaker, who said there will be 2 DLCs and two seasons per year with a seasonal narrative, a seasonal loop, and two rally events.</p>
<p>According to Jeff Grubb, Bungie will also be essentially run by PlayStation Studios Head Hermen Hulst, losing its previously recognized autonomy following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-acquires-bungie-for-3-6-billion-studio-to-remain-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisition</a> by Sony.</p>
<p><em>The process is beginning to&nbsp;basically remove their autonomy. They will no longer operate as an independent studio under Sony; they will be like any other PlayStation worldwide studio under Sony Interactive Entertainment, with Herman Hulst overseeing the studio like he does the rest of Sony studios.</em></p>
<p>Beyond Destiny 2 support, Bungie remains focused on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-bungie-ps5-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marathon</a> reboot as a competitive extraction shooter and a third franchise, which will be developed alongside PlayStation Studios.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fields-of-mistria-review-the-next-best-cozy-farming-sim.943008/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fields-of-mistria-review-next-best-cozy-farming-sim<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a world of oversaturated farming sim games, <em>Fields of Mistria</em> stands out like a light at the end of a tunnel. With beautiful art, incredible writing, and near-perfect mechanics, <em>Fields of Mistria</em> feels like a classic in the making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the beginning, the player is recruited to work on a farm in Mistria for free. All they have to do is help build the town back up, which was wrecked after an earthquake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gameplay mechanics are very similar to other farming sims – players farm, take care of animals, fish, mine, and build relationships. There’s also a bit of combat in <em>Fields of Mistria</em>, and increasing the town’s rank is necessary to progress part of the story.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teamwork-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=9aLU-R84 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teamwork-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=Xw-_9Z17 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>At every step in the story, the townspeople are ready to jump in and help.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Fields of Mistria</em> has a robust story to it. The land itself used to be full of magic, but it disappeared. Part of the player’s job is to rediscover magic, using the power of the dragons. Players can learn spells as they progress, setting it apart from your average farming sim.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>Fields of Mistria</em> perfects the little things</h2>
<p>While the gameplay loops are nothing too new, everything feels fantastic. The animations for watering, tilling, and sowing seeds are crystal clear and cute, and this idea applies to everything in the game. The animations of everything from walking to swimming are well done and stand out. Even the sounds accompanying all of these are really good.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/coming-to-mistria-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=1lS4x53K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/coming-to-mistria-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=TEW6KV-O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>From the start,&nbsp;<em>Fields of Mistria&nbsp;</em>sets itself up with an interesting story.</figcaption></figure><p>This attention to detail permeates through every other aspect of gameplay, too. The prices and requirements for quests and progressing the story are well-balanced, which is something that can be tricky. <em>Fields of Mistria</em> doesn’t feel too hard or too easy, instead striking a good balance of being challenging without being frustrating.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Mistria itself is very much alive</h2>
<p>Characters are another well-crafted part of <em>Fields of Mistria</em>. With a diverse cast of people in the town of Mistria, making them all stand out isn’t easy. However, they all do, and they all feel genuine at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A large part of this is because of how they interact together and with the player. If two or more characters are standing together, then they’re going to be having a conversation you can listen to. The characters react to things the player does and will reference things other characters in the town have done, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They’re so interconnected, and there’s an abundance of dialogue that never feels wasted. Everything each character says has weight to it, and I never saw reused dialogue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The characters never waste an opportunity to get together, either. One of my favorite parts of the game was getting together with everyone on Friday nights to celebrate the weekend. Every Friday, people would be paired up and doing something as a group, giving their relationships more meaning. While some characters were playing a tabletop RPG, others were drinking at the bar. Meanwhile, the trio of mischievous kids are up to no good around the corner.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-and-dragons-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=PsZAalMn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-and-dragons-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=Jafyrmn4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The only bad thing about the tabletop RPG was that I couldn't join in the campaign.</figcaption></figure><p>Plus, these interactions change with the seasons. People start to do different things, like creating an art club or starting new campaigns in their TTRPG. They change their outfits, their hairstyles, and their habits to fit the world around them.</p>
<p>These little parts of <em>Fields of Mistria</em> went such a long way in building Mistria, and it’s something that no other farming simulator, cozy or not, has really pushed.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The aesthetic of <em>Fields of Mistria</em> is the cherry on top</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rain-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=M_eUqZ3v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rain-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=qv1YGztD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even the rain in&nbsp;<em>Fields of Mistria&nbsp;</em>looked and sounded great.<br>
&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><em>Fields of Mistria</em> is gorgeous, there’s no doubt about it. It may be too cutesy for some folks on the surface, but it’s got more depth than that after the first thirty minutes of playtime. This applies to the characters themselves too, from their portraits to their actual sprites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Music in Mistria is another good point. It actually feels like you’re walking through an idyllic village in an RPG constantly, and it works well. Mistria has an undercurrent of magic and fantasy to it, and the music captures that well. The only problem I had with the music was that it would cut out randomly and then start again. This wasn’t a major problem, and an update right before the embargo seemed to fix the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another problem that was seemingly fixed by the last-minute update was lagging problems. Occasionally, <em>Fields of Mistria</em> would slow down and also crashed once on me. Again, this problem never happened after the update, but it was present in the early hours of my experience.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Overall, <em>Fields of Mistria</em> is one of the best farming sims in some time</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/calendar-days-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=gcCLyRsx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/calendar-days-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=l5EPMRkq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The beginning of every day also included event information that the calendar doesn't, a helpful tool for planning the day.</figcaption></figure><p>Cozy farming sims have blown up since the release of <em>Stardew Valley</em> back in 2016. While the game still has a very active player base, many people are always looking for the next big thing. <em>Fields of Mistria</em> is perfectly set to take that stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s easy to tell that developers wanted to perfect every little thing about the game, and it’s paid off. Everything about <em>Fields of Mistria</em> is taken to the next level, perfecting every aspect of the cozy farming sim genre. There's an endless amount of great things to say about&nbsp;<em>Fields of Mistria</em>, but I'll let you discover some of it for yourself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/until-dawn-video-game-adaptation-maia-mitchell-peter-stormare-1235964505/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report</a> by The Hollywood Reporter, the Until Dawn movie adaptation has added new cast members including the return of Peter Stormare.</p>



<p>Stormare is a popular actor with over 200 credits, appearing in classic movies like Fargo. They also entered gaming with the Destiny series, playing Arach Jalaal. They played the iconic Dr. Hill in Supermassive Games’ original Until Dawn from 2015. </p>



<p>THR’s new report claims that “insiders say that in a callback to the game, Stormare is reprising his role of therapist Dr. Hill.” However, at this time, the studios did not officially confirm the roles of the new cast members.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In addition to Peter Stormare, other new cast members now reportedly include Maia Mitchell and Belmont Cameli. Fans may recognize Mitchell from The Fosters, and Cameli from the recent iteration of Saved by the Bell.</p>



<p>The Hollywood Reporter previously revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-movie-adaptation-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Dawn’s movie adaptation</a> in January 2024. </p>



<p>David F. Sandberg, the director of Shazam, Lights Out, and Annabelle: Creation, is attached to direct Until Dawn. Screen Gems and PlayStation Productions partnered for the adaptation.</p>



<p>Stormare’s return in particular should build some buzz, and it may open the door for other original Until Dawn cast members to return in some way. </p>



<p>On the gaming side, Until Dawn’s anticipated new version from Ballistic Moon just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-for-pc-playstation-5-gets-esrb-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got an ESRB rating</a> this week. The rebuilt version is coming to PC and PlayStation 5 in Fall 2024.</p>

                <p>Nintendo's latest earnings report has arrived, and while Switch sales were down dramatically, the console is now even closer to reaching the PS2's high watermark of an estimated 155 million units sold. Through the quarter that ended on June 30, Switch sales stand at 143.42 million units.</p><p>Nintendo sold 2.1 million Switch consoles in the past quarter, which was down significantly from the 3.91 million it sold during the same period last year. Nintendo said the downturn can be attributed to a difficult comparison. Indeed, during the same period last year, Switch sales benefitted from the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" data-ref-id="5000-497748">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and The Super Mario Bros.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Nintendo said sales during the same quarter last year were "extremely high" due to those factors. For this year, however, "there were no such special factors in the first quarter of this fiscal year, and with Nintendo Switch now in its eighth year since launch, unit sales of both hardware and software decreased significantly year-on-year," Nintendo said.</p><p>Of the 2.1 million Switch consoles sold in the latest quarter, the majority (1.24 million) came from the OLED model, with the standard Switch (530,000 units) and Switch Lite (330,000 units) making up the rest.</p><p>Nintendo said it is forecasting to sell 13.5 million Switch consoles during its current fiscal year that ends on March 31, 2025. With 2.1 million sold already this fiscal year, that leaves 11.4 million to go to reach the target. If Nintendo can achieve that, then Switch sales would reach 154.4 million--just 600,000 shy of the PS2's estimated record of 155 million.</p><p>In terms of game sales, 30.64 million games were sold for Switch in the quarter, which was down by 41.3% compared to the 52.21 million sold during the same period last year. Again, though, it's important to note <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-sold-over-10-million-copies-in-first-three-days/1100-6514264/" data-ref-id="1100-6514264">how massive Tears of the Kingdom was</a>--Nintendo was always going to struggle to have a favorable year-over-year comparison.</p><p>Nintendo did have some new releases during the quarter, including Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (1.76 million units) and Luigi's Mansion 2 HD (1.19 million units), which Nintendo said had a "good start." As of June 30, more than 1.26 billion games have been sold for Switch.</p><p>Looking ahead, Nintendo has a number of titles on the schedule, including Emio - The Smiling Man (August 20, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom (September 26), Super Mario Party Jamboree (October 17), Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership (November 7), and Donkey Kong Country Returns HD (January 16, 2025).</p><p>Fans are also eagerly awaiting the announcement and release of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, or whatever Nintendo calls its next console.

            <p>The upcoming movie adaptation of Supermassive's horror Until Dawn sees Peter Stormare reprise his role from the game, psychiatrist Dr Hill.</p>
<p>Whilst it remains unclear how, exactly, the movie will account for the game's myriad of deaths, survivals, and endings, Stormare's casting at least hints that Supermassive's trademark player "guide" will be making an appearance.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/until-dawn-video-game-adaptation-maia-mitchell-peter-stormare-1235964505/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Stormare will be joined by Maia Mitchell and Belmont Cameli, although what roles they'll play remains under wraps for now.</p>
<p>THR says Stormare is a veteran actor with "hundreds of credits to his name", including Fargo and Prison Break. You may also recognise him from Call of Duty: Black Ops 4.</p>
<p>We learned that Supermassive's acclaimed PS4 cinematic horror game Until Dawn was being turned into a movie by the writer and director of 2017 horror hit Annabelle: Creation earlier this year. It's described as a "R-rated love letter to the horror genre", suggesting it'll retain some of the meta elements of its inspiration.</p>
<p>ICYMI, Supermassive Games' narrative-focused single-player Dead by Daylight spin-off, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-studios-narrative-dead-by-daylight-spin-off-the-casting-of-frank-stone-out-in-september">The Casting of Frank Stone, launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 3rd September</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It’s been a lovely, sunny week, and that’s meant that I’ve actually been outdoors, collecting Vitamin D to see me through the dark days (as in, the normal UK weather when you live up North). I have, however, played a chunk of Overwatch 2, loads of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/29/f1-manager-24-review/">F1 Manager 24</a>, Zenless Zone Zero, Cataclismo, and some more Elder Scrolls Online: The Gold Road, which is, unsurprisingly, something of a time sink.</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2, as per, and the very funny <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/29/thank-goodness-youre-here-review/">Thank Goodness You’re Here</a> for review. Oh sure, it it doesn’t sound like much of a game, it sounds like I’m going to chortle my way through it, so I’m sold!</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has been dipping his toe (paw?) back into MTG Arena with the release of its cutest set, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/30/mtg-arena-bloomburrow-expansion-starters-guide/">Bloomburrow</a>. Beyond that, it’s the usual: Monster Hunter Now!</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/30/deadlink-review/">Deadlink for review</a>, saying, “It’s a fun roguelike arena shooter with a banging soundtrack.” He’s also been heading back in time though, “I’ve also played more Enslaved Odyssey to the West. I’m nearly at the end of the main story and then I’ll start the DLC.”</p>


<p>Chanting “EDF! EDF!” in his sleep has been Ade, who said in his waking hours that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/earth-defense-force-6-review/">EDF 6</a> “is everything an Earth Defense Force fan could ever wish for.” He’s also been playing Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, and seriously enjoying it. He says, “It’s the kind of creative and unique experimental game that I thought major publishers (other than Nintendo) just didn’t make any more. I’m so glad Capcom proved me wrong though, as Kunitsu-Gami is an absolute gem and proving to be one of my favourite games of the year so far.”</p>
<p><strong>Miguel</strong> has been playing some Zenless Zone Zero, some Frontier Hunter, and Shadow Tower Abyss on the PS2! From Software’s weirdest and coolest pre-Souls game. Meanwhile, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has been playing Elden Ring, yet more Baldur’s Gate 3, and Mount and Blade Bannerlord, but the bigger challenge has been playing a game of telephone, trying to convince someone, anyone to come and install internet. Hopefully a chap will come along to sort that out today.</p>

<p>And finally, <strong>Tef</strong> handed in his review for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/01/steamworld-heist-2-review/">SteamWorld Heist 2</a>, and had a whale of a time with crew of submariner Steambots, taking on the game’s distinctive side-scrolling turn-based action. He’s also been out and about playing a much anticipated game… but sadly can’t tell us anything about that until later this month.</p>
<p>But what about you? What have you played?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24211410/humble-games-layoffs-indie-studios-uncertainty<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Humble Games “restructured” and reportedly laid off its 36-person team <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24204641/beloved-indie-game-publisher-humble-games-has-reportedly-laid-off-all-staff-without-warning">last week</a>. The publisher, which is part of the IGN-owned Humble Bundle, started helping developers release games <a href="https://developer.humblebundle.com/post/157036461841/humble-bundle-launches-multi-platform-publishing">in 2017</a> and published notable games like <em>Slay the Spire</em> and <em>Signalis</em>. The resulting fallout from the layoffs has left developers working with the publisher uncertain about many plans for future games, leaving their console ports in jeopardy.</p><p>Amir Fassihi, studio director of Dead Mage, the team behind the in-development <em>Wizard of Legend 2,</em> is worried that the restructuring could impact their project. “We do not want to make any changes,” Fassihi tells <em>The Verge</em>. “However, we’re unsure what changes will be forced on us because everyone in the publisher we collaborated with in the past 2.5 years is suddenly gone.” Now, Dead Mage has to “wait and hope that the new team will deliver the various publishing services that we expected from Humble Games.”</p><p>The “new team,” <a href="https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign">according to a report from <em>Aftermath</em></a> and three of the developers I spoke with, is the Powell Group, <a href="https://powellgroupconsulting.com/services/">a video game consulting company</a>. The Powell Group and Humble Games didn’t reply to requests for comment. In a post <a href="https://x.com/PlayHumbleGames/status/1815851182977425772">last week</a>, Humble Games didn’t mention the Powell Group’s involvement, only saying that “supporting our development partners and assisting former team members remains our top priority” and that “we are committed to making this transition as smooth as possible for everyone involved.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Coral Island.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Stairway Games</cite></p></div><p>Developers are mostly worried about console ports, which Humble Games seemed to have a major hand in for some of the projects it worked on.</p><p>“We are now in a difficult situation when it comes to updating the console ports, as both porting and QA support was tied into our deal with Humble,” Squid Shock Studios, developer of the newly released <em>Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus</em>, <a href="https://x.com/SquidShock/status/1817973044826226968">said in a post on Monday</a>. (The game is available on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch in addition to Steam.) “We are actively pursuing all available avenues to allow us to roll out updates to console versions, but we regret to say this may take some time to put in place.” The studio is also planning to <a href="https://x.com/SquidShock/status/1818295470034456578">launch a Patreon</a>.</p><p><em>Coral Island</em> developer Stairway Games <a href="https://x.com/coralislandgame/status/1816674043954925590">said last week</a> that the impact of the restructuring “remains uncertain for all things related to consoles.” The game is out on Xbox Series X / S, PlayStation 5, and Steam, with a Switch port in the works. The team has a hotfix for its 1.1 update “nearing release” on Steam, but “we have no idea how to get this update out to other platform players as we don’t have the backend permission on console platforms to push updates out,” Stairway said. “We only have access to the Steam backend.” Stairway is offering Kickstarter backers who are still waiting for the Switch release <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coralisland/coral-island-reimagining-the-farm-sim-game/posts/4158875">the option</a> to get a Steam key instead.</p><div><p>“Changing publishers would be an extremely uphill battle”</p></div><p>Even if developers wanted to make a change from Humble Games as a result of the restructuring, that might be difficult. “To the best of my understanding, Humble Games is fulfilling their contractual obligations to us, so changing publishers would be an extremely uphill battle,” says Matthew Taylor of <em>Rolling Hills</em> developer Catch &amp; Release.</p><p>Not every studio appears to have been significantly impacted, and things do seem to be improving for developers since the restructuring. Cody Greenhalge, technical director at <em>#Blud</em> developer Exit 73 Studios, tells <em>The Verge</em> that the Powell Group has “worked well with us and we are hopeful our game won’t have any long lasting effects from this ordeal.”</p><p>Taylor says that the Powell Group has set Catch &amp; Release up with a new release manager, producer, and back catalog specialist. “It’s still too early to know how efficiently all these new folks can work together and get onboarded quickly, but in the case of our game we only need someone to help us get new updates to Microsoft and manage discounts and events, so I think we’ll be OK,” Taylor says. “If we were working on a game still in development or having very recently released, I’d be way more stressed.”</p><p>Despite the uncertainties, Humble Games spokesperson Michael Brown said <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24210726/humble-games-console-ports-layoffs">to <em>Polygon</em></a> that “nothing has changed and no developers have had to change their porting plans; every project is moving ahead.” Brown added that “when people see that the new team at Humble Games was brought in to improve operations and support levels for all the developers, all concerns will be laid to rest.”&nbsp;</p><p>Even if things are slowly improving, the situation has been messy, leaving developers unsure of how they’ll move forward with their games. “The layoff of the whole Humble team has been the strangest thing I have seen in my 20 years of experience working,” says Fassihi. “The fact that nothing was shared with us beforehand, and we had to read this in the news, makes it even worse.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Following the news of significant layoffs at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/bungie">Bungie</a> earlier this week, there’s been a lot of further reporting on what this means for the company’s future and how they’ve ended up in this place. Senior staff have left, a new Destiny game has reportedly been cancelled, and many have called for CEO Pete Parsons to quit for mismanaging the company over the last few years.</p>
<p>The layoffs were announced on Wednesday by Bungie CEO Pete Parsons, with 220 of the company’s 1300 headcount losing their jobs, while a further 155 would be able to move across to the wider PlayStation business, and <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1818674500013097178">around 40 to form a new studio</a> and take on an incubation project. That’s roughly a third of the company’s workforce, and follows on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/06/bungies-independence-reportedly-under-threat-developers-suffering-low-morale/">100 employees losing their jobs last October</a>, leaving the new headcount at around 850 employees.</p>
<p>As part of this, it’s reported that key Bungie figures from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2">Destiny 2’s</a> early revival have departed the company. Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy have apparently left (per Jeff Grubb’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yszLbBLdM3Y&amp;ab_channel=JeffGrubb%27sGameMess" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Mess Decides podcast</a>) following the cancellation of their Destiny spin-off game, codenamed Payback. This had been reported as being Destiny 3, but as is often the case, further details are leaked once people are no longer employed, and <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1819075149360185737">Jason Schreier’s sources state it was not a direct</a> sequel, and actually cancelled some time ago.</p>


<p>The layoffs have been met with a lot of shock from outside viewers, given the very positive reception of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a>. Bungie had delayed the expansion’s release in an effort to come back from failing to meet financial expectations with the previous year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/14/destiny-2-lightfall-review/">Lightfall</a>, and by all accounts, The Final Shape was the narrative finale that Destiny needed and deserved.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bungies-deep-job-cuts-were-in-the">Stephen Totilo reports</a> that the deep job cuts were planned to happen regardless of the reception or success of The Final Shape. The need for job cuts was only made worse by The Final Shape having “sold less than Lightfall”, despite its positive reception. As Parsons stated in the job cuts announcement, “We were overly ambitious, our financial safety margins were subsequently exceeded, and we began running in the red.”</p>

<p>Since that announcement, a lot of anger has been directed at Parsons personally for his decision making, leadership and level of accountability. Parsons claimed that the leadership team “did everything we could to avoid today’s outcome,” but there have been various former employees calling for Parsons to quit, especially with anecdotes about him <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSamBartley/status/1818678522397049082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1818678522397049082%7Ctwgr%5E5c982966ceb610db0c23f156764e420a0aec9131%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techspot.com%2Fnews%2F104075-bungie-ceo-faces-backlash-after-announcing-220-people.html">inviting them to view his personal car collection</a> – a collection that has been found on car bidding site <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/">Bring A Trailer</a>, and which shows a total value of $2.4 million, over <a href="https://twitter.com/D2cbro/status/1818700972660576660?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1818700972660576660%7Ctwgr%5E5c982966ceb610db0c23f156764e420a0aec9131%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techspot.com%2Fnews%2F104075-bungie-ceo-faces-backlash-after-announcing-220-people.html">$450,000 of which came since October 2023,</a> the time of the first wave of layoffs.</p>
<p>Anyone else remember <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/07/29/nintendo-president-takes-50-pay-cut/">the time that Nintendo’s President took a 50% pay cut?</a></p>
<p>There’s also analysis of how this ties back into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/31/sony-buys-bungie-halo-destiny-2-ps5/">Sony’s 2022 acquisition of Bungie for $3.6 billion</a>. Speaking to Totilo, an anonymous former Bungie insider said, “I think Sony overpaid for Bungie. I think Bungie sold things they were just not able to deliver.” The company had seemingly overstated their earning potential, while courting Sony as a buyer.</p>
<p>And Parsons is again going to be in the spotlight for that, as part of the 2022 acquisition was that Bungie would remain autonomous. That autonomy reportedly came into threat last year as Bungie started to miss financial targets, which was seemingly a driving factor behind layoffs late last year, so the company leadership could try to retain control.</p>
<p>Bungie is remaining committed to supporting Destiny 2 going forward and the development of extraction shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a>, but the company’s future still feels uncertain. Jeff Grubb is claiming that, in time, <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1818686383449346538">Sony will take over control of Bungie’s management</a>, similar to all other developers owned by Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p>

            <p>Jail shake-and-breaker management sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prison-architect-2">Prison Architect 2 </a>has been delayed indefinitely, a couple of months after publishers Paradox parted ways with original developers Double Eleven. Current developers Kokku will use the additional time "to improve both the game's performance and its content". Additionally, Paradox are removing the option to preorder the game until they have a "robust" release timeline. Existing preorders on all platforms will be refunded, and all preorder-exclusive items will be added into the base game.</p><!--more-->
<p>Released into 1.0 in 2015, and developed by Introversion, the original Prison Architect is an old RPS favourite. Our own judge-at-large Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prison-architect-review">sentenced</a> it to a Bestest Best, with time added for being "an excellent story-making game" and for being "the only management game that has made me feel sheepish". Introversion sold the property rights to Paradox in 2019, who subsequently put Double Eleven in charge of on-going development. </p>
<p>Announced in January this year, the sequel both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prison-architect-2-is-official-bringing-paradoxs-jail-management-sim-to-3d">impressed and dismayed</a> Katharine (RPS in peace) with its newly 3D graphics. Once due for release in March, it's been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prison-architect-2-has-been-pushed-from-its-already-delayed-release-date-next-month-all-the-way-back-to-autumn">repeatedly delayed</a>. Then, in May, Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prison-architect-2-developers-part-ways-with-paradox-months-before-its-due-for-release">revealed</a> that they and Double Eleven had failed "to find a commercial agreement that worked for both parties moving forward and mutually agreed to part ways". This came after the game had passed certification on all platforms. And yet, it seems that there's still more work to be done.</p>
<p>"At this stage, we can't commit to a new release date as we need to re-assess the scope of the work needed to be done before the game is release-ready," a Paradox rep <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/prison-architect-2-delayed-release.1697795/">explained in a forum post today</a>. "Over the next few months, we will focus on improving the game and building a more robust release timeline. This also means we will be limiting our communication with you all until we have a timeline we feel comfortable with."</p>
<p>The post includes a FAQ that goes into slightly more detail about what needs fine-tuning. "Prison Architect is a game with deep systems that all interact with each other, and this is also something we want to bring with us into the sequel, Prison Architect 2," it reads. "Having systems like this in a game also means that a small change in one area will also affect one or more other areas, which we then also need to apply fixes to. Improving the performance has proven to be a task that will take time."</p>
<p>Going by Brendy's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prison-architect-2-is-coming-up-for-release-but-its-hard-to-rehabilitate-from-years-of-2d">hands-on preview</a> from May, Prison Architect 2's problems are at once more straightforward and more fundamental than a few misbehaving systems eating into the frame-rate. "Thematically and mechanically, Prison Architect is about control," he wrote. "It is about little people's lives being directed to a tragicomically draconian degree. But if this franchise is all about being the overbearing loon in charge of every minor detail, does a 3D camera complement that feeling of jealous control? For me, not hugely. If anything, the top-down 2D view of the original allowed you to quickly parse more information."</p>
<p>The Paradox post notes that the delay announcement "aligns with our commitment here at Paradox to reviewing and improving the quality of our released content." This may allude to CEO Fredrik Wester's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-ceo-admits-company-made-wrong-calls-in-several-projects-in-wake-of-life-by-yous-cancellation">admission last month</a> that the publishers have "made the wrong calls in several projects, especially outside of our core, and this must change". Paradox's recent activities include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-shutter-studio-tectonic-and-cancel-troubled-sims-competitor-life-by-you">shuttering Tectonic, developers of Life By You</a>, washing their hands of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lamplighter-developers-harebrained-go-indie-as-paradox-decides-against-new-project-or-sequel-in-the-same-genre">Harebrained Schemes</a><a></a> following dismal sales of Lamplighters League, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-and-now-under-development-by-dear-esther-studio">handing off the infamously troubled Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 to The Chinese Room</a> after years of development under Hardsuit Labs. Prison Architect 2 has only been in the public eye for a few months - hopefully it won't end up in a similar purgatorial state.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo is adding Game Boy Advance title Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team to its Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack catalogue.
</p>
<p>
The role-playing game spin-off from the main Pokémon series joins Nintendo's subscription library next week, on 9th August.
</p>
<p>
This is the first Pokémon game from the Game Boy Advance era to land on Nintendo Switch Online, which has so far offered other spin-offs such as Pokémon Snap, originally on N64, and Pokémon Trading Card Game, originally on Game Boy.
</p>
<p>
If you've not played a Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games, this long-running spin-off RPG series sees you playing as Pokémon and lets you speak to others.

<p>
Red Rescue Team was one of a duo of games, with Blue Rescue Team released at the same time for the Nintendo DS (which isn't currently part of the Nintendo Switch Online catalogue).
</p>
<p>
"Mystery Dungeon has hidden depths that make up for any drawbacks," we wrote in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-pokemondungeon-ds">review of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team</a> back in 2006. "As the game progresses, dungeons become more interesting places - and dangerous ones, filled with lava and traps and the like. Levelling up your teammates, managing your inventory, and clearing out dungeons becomes compelling pretty quickly - even though the sidequest structure allows you to play the game as slowly as you like."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-offering-extra-two-months-on-switch-online-membership-renewals">Nintendo is currently offering an additional two months of Nintendo Switch Online free</a> when you buy a 12-month  subscription via the eShop or My Nintendo Store. 
</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-vr2-well-pc/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-vr2-works-as-well-on-pc-as-it-does-on-playstation-5-setup-is-easy.942939/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-vr2-well-pc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation VR2 headset is finally becoming compatible with PC next week, and it seems like the headset works on PC as well as it does on PlayStation 5, according to a new video shared online.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GAMERGEN_/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamergen</a> on YouTube and summarized by ResetERA forums members <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-vr2-ot-vr-using-our-senses.688708/post-126590970" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cilidra</a> and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-vr2-ot-vr-using-our-senses.688708/post-126593391" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DjRare</a>, the Sony headset works very well on PC, with good tracking, image quality, and easy setup, even with the beta version of the app. The only complaints are the same for using the headset on PlayStation 5, namely the headset's cable and sweet spot. At the end of the day, the adapter bringing compatibility with PC is a great purchase for those who already own the headset and a VR-ready PC, thanks to its low cost. Those who don't own the headset, however, may find other compelling options, according to Gamergen.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nous AVONS TESTE le PSVR 2 sur PC ! - UNBOXING Test Impressions GAMEPLAY Half Life Alyx Adaptateur" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p4035mJVWe0?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It's great to hear the PlayStation VR2 works well on PC. The introduction of compatibility with the most common VR gaming platform and its recent price drop may breathe new life into the headset, which isn't getting supported by Sony as much as it should have. You can learn more about the headset by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-vr2-headset-one-cord-to-rule-them-all/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>With a pricetag befitting of next-generation hardware, the PlayStation VR2 headset offers a virtual reality experience that's unique to the PlayStation 5 ecosystem. Only time will tell if the new technology is worth the investment but all of the design changes and new features make me excited for what's to come in the future for PlayStation VR2.</em></p>
