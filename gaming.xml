It’s just won two <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bafta-games-awards-2025-the-full-list-of-winners">BAFTA Game Awards</a>: one for Best Multiplayer, another for Best Music. That’s from five nominations. The BAFTA wins bring to an end a fruitful video game awards season, drawing a line under what has been a remarkable year for Swedish developer Arrowhead.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Helldivers 2 accepts the win for Multiplayer at the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BAFTAGamesAwards?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#BAFTAGamesAwards</a> ✨ <a href="https://t.co/rYWwyc1KGR" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/rYWwyc1KGR</a></p>— BAFTA Games (@BAFTAGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/BAFTAGames/status/1909690279919071465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 8, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s remember, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks">Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time</a>, with an astonishing 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks. It is a record no first-party Sony-developed game will likely ever beat. But so much has happened since that initial explosive release: a dramatic U-turn on PSN account requirements on Steam, review-bomb campaigns, and a community often at war with Helldivers 2 itself as nerfs and buffs either went too far or not far enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through it all, Arrowhead has struggled to cope with a bigger, more mainstream playerbase than it’s ever had to contend with. But now, 14 months after Helldivers 2 hit PC and PlayStation 5, how does Arrowhead reflect on what’s gone before? Has it finally started to get to grips with the brutal, unforgiving world of live-service? And after that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-gives-all-players-next-weeks-killzone-items-for-free-following-pricing-backlash-and-theyre-available-now">Killzone collaboration</a>, could Warhammer 40,000 be next?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN sat down with Alex Bolle, production director on Helldivers 2, to find out more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Congratulations on all the awards! When you were in the thick of development and things weren't perhaps going as well as they might have otherwise been, did you ever imagine that a year after the game came out it would be considered one of the best games of 2024 and win all these awards?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> No, no, definitely not. It's a very humbling experience. I would say a year ago exactly, we had a hint that it would be a sweet year for us, but we were also in the thick of it. We were still fixing a lot of things, preparing our next big release for the content. So no, definitely not realizing we would get there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last time we spoke, we were preparing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-adds-new-faction-illuminate-in-omens-of-tyranny-update-and-its-out-now-the-game-awards-2024">Omens of Tyranny</a>. Even then we are like, okay, we have The Game Awards. We were preparing the whole shadow drop and everything. We were ready to make that shadow drop and be like, okay, this one is going to be fun. The awards part, maybe not that much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was next to my release manager trying to monitor the progress of Omens of Tyranny and the whole major order with the Illuminate. And I turned my head towards the TV at the office, it was like 2am. And I see Mikael Eriksson, the game director, just shaking hands with Snoop Dogg. And I'm like, what is going on here? Which reality are we?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So yeah, it's been good. The Golden Joysticks, DICE, all those awards, it's a good way to take a step back and look at the impact of the game. We’re nearing the end of the awards season and this one feels really good, because the credibility and the fame of it is just amazing. So yeah, it's great. It's going to be a good addition for the team, I hope.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> It's been over a year since the game came out, so people have had time now to reflect upon its release and its impact. Have you come to understand why it's won so many awards, why it's done so well? Why it's resonated so much with gamers? Have you worked out why Helldivers 2 has ended up being the success it has been?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> I wish the interview was two hours! It's a whole soup recipe, or maybe more like a very sophisticated French dish. I don't think we figured it out. One thing we keep at heart is just the interaction with the community. All the players, taking the time to really talk to them, understand what they want. We have so many devs that are continuously looking at Discord, at Reddit. We have a lot of things that come from there and we want to keep that interaction level.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That has been the thing that we thought, okay, when we prepare the fantasy for the next updates and so on, this is the part that we want to keep. We were talking about the future of the game with Mikael and it was all about that. What is it that the player wants? What is it that we are not achieving yet? What's next? And this is always like, players in mind. It's what works well. It's the ability to talk to them, ability to make that kind of fantasy in the game around the Galactic War.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-throwing-everything-but-the-kitchen-sink-at-one-planet-and-players-are-still-holding-out">Last week with Pöpli IX</a>, it's been a year and we still manage to get those moments in-game. I think it's important. These are needed. I was talking to our Game Master this morning, it feels good to have that. It's one of the things we'll cherish until we don't make the game, but so far it's working well.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Helldivers 2 Escalation of Freedom Update Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> You've spoken as a team before about the impact Helldivers 2 had on you as a studio, and it was a big shock to the system. Do you feel like now you're starting to get a handle on what Helldivers 2 is, what the audience is, and settling into a sustainable, healthy way of keeping it going as a live service? Especially after having that influx of players that you weren't perhaps expecting and the type of players that were different than what you were expecting? </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> We're still trying to figure out the good recipe for a healthy cadence for the developers, for the players as well. Who do we cater to as well? It's been super interesting. I've been at Arrowhead for a bit more than three years now, coming from bigger studios and yeah, there's a lot of things that we had to go back to square one, on how it works at Arrowhead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Johan Pilestedt, as one of our founders and the lead of the studio for so long, has been key in setting a development culture that we try to keep at heart while maintaining that live service aspect. This has been catching lightning in a bottle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I feel like every week is taking learnings again from the different wins and failures that we had along the way. Also from other developers. I think it's been one of the good advantages that we had, is that success also allows us to talk way more openly with all the devs. It's been very good on that side. It's sharing ways to do it, better ways, more sustainable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On who do we make the game for? That's a tricky one. Arrowhead’s motto has always been ‘a game for everyone is a game for no one.’ When you add this amount of players, no one and everyone is a bit muddy. So it's always a bit of a puzzle of like, okay, this content is for these type of players, this content is for this type of player. And this is where we are still working very hard with PlayStation, with the team internally to understand, hey, when you want to make this enemy, who do you have in mind?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think it's a very fingertip sensitivity that we are getting slowly. I think there's a lot of work within direction as well to remind us who we were making the game for at the very, very, very beginning, because we have a lot of the old guard of Arrowhead still around to help us figure this out. We have one of the features upcoming that we've been developing with one of our old-time founders for example, and it's been so good because he brings that magical angle on the co-op.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> The internet loves to talk about Steam concurrents, but I would like to get your take as someone who knows the data. Do you think Steam concurrents are misleading? Do they give some insight into the success or otherwise of a live service game? Obviously you had a huge peak, but it is unreasonable to expect that to maintain itself forever, and Helldivers 2 seems to have settled on Steam. From your perspective, how do you view that?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> I am far from being the expert of the studio on this. I do see sometimes a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more you talk about it, the more you show it, the more people are like, wow, interesting, it's going up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a metric among many others. There's many reasons for a game's success or failure. I think we've been doing good numbers, like breaking some trends and everything. On our side, the only thing I can say is that, yeah, we want to keep that steady floor of players and bringing people again for new memorable moments for the game and for the community. So I would say that's pretty much where we want to go. Do we have screens all around the studio with CCU [concurrent users] and all those metrics? Of course, because it's always good to keep them in mind. But we're not obsessed by it. I think we are in a position we don't have to be, but we want to make sure, hey, when we make something, it's meaningful. That's the thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Whatever happens, you'll probably forever now be the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time. I can't see a game ever really topping that. As a studio, does that mean you can be a bit more relaxed about what you're doing with Helldivers 2?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> Yes and no. Yes, in a way, especially in these days for the industry, it feels like such a privileged situation. That is amazing. I think we are cherishing that a lot. At the same time, we don't want to take this for granted. There's a studio, we have developers to pay. We have a studio life to keep on for years and years and years. So that's the thing where we're like, yeah, it's been good. We need to make sure it keeps going great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also an accountability for, again, the people we make the game for. We're not going to just start to be like, okay, it's fine. It's going to be fine. We can take a bit more time. We want to take more time to make things better, especially now that the players are asking for it. But yeah, there's definitely an ambition to keep things going, keep our standards of development, keep finding creativity and innovation. If we just became complacent, I don't think Arrowhead would be Arrowhead.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Do you think it's reasonable for a game like Helldivers 2 to have a multi-year plan that envisages the game being around for a decade? For me, Helldivers 2’s gameplay feels almost timeless, so it could become a forever game. Or will there come a point where you have to think about what’s next when it comes to Helldivers itself?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> Thank you for acknowledging that the game might not age at all! I love when you boot a game after 15, 20 years and it still plays the same.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Helldivers 2 has that about it doesn’t it? It‘s about the things that happen in the game and the physics at play and the feel of it, as opposed to it being future-proofed in terms of visuals, for example.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> Absolutely. When I talk with the team, when I talk to the directors, when I talk to Mikael about the future, it’s exciting because we want it to be around for years and years and years to come. And it's almost like, how do we stay true to the Helldivers 2 fantasy, challenging enough that we keep making amazing new features and new systems and all that while we stay true to who we are? And I think it's something that is so motivating for the years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The more we figure out how to thrive in a live environment, and we still have a way to go to figure out a lot of things around that, the more we can let creativity loose on new systems that we would've never thought about a year ago when we released. I've worked on live games before and it's where you feel like you have something you can figure out: what if I would do this cool thing I've seen in other games and adapt it to our sauce, that still makes it true to ourselves? I'm looking forward to this moment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> You’ve done a Killzone collab. I'm a massive Warhammer 40,000 fan, and as soon as I started playing Helldivers 2 I thought, oh my God, if I was an Imperial Guard soldier dropping down, facing off against waves of Tyranids or Necrons… can you give me any hope as a fan of both Helldivers 2 and Warhammer 40,000 that this is even possible?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> What I can say is that we had a blast working on the collaboration with Guerrilla on Killzone. One thing that everyone agreed internally is that making something from a different game IP in our universe, this is quite fun. It has challenges because again, we are very, very cautious about our fantasy. So we want to be able to explore those possibilities. We got super excited with Killzone. We want to do more for sure. I can't tell you more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our devs are players, they play so many games. Obviously Warhammer 40,000 is something that a lot of guys internally love to death. So the devs are discussing, the devs are proposing stuff, and the hype is building. So these are discussions internally that we are having. Warhammer 40,000, I can't really tell you. Maybe. Who knows? We'll see!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-nintendo-gamecube-controller-not-compatible-with-switch-2-games-just-gamecube-classics/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s come to the Nintendo community’s attention that the new Nintendo GameCube Controller—set to launch with the Switch 2—can is only usable with the limited collection of classic GameCube titles via Nintendo Switch Online.</p>



<p>A cool bonus during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-games-announced-during-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> was the announcement of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-online-adds-gamecube-games-to-nintendo-switch-2-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameCube integration for Switch Online</a>. Nintendo’s library of retro games is growing even more, thanks to GameCube additions. Legendary properties, including Pokémon Stadium and Super Mario Sunshine, will make up the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.</p>



<p>A line of official Nintendo GameCube Controllers are coming too—featuring the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-is-for-gamechat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C-Button</a>. But if you’re looking to grab this super-special controller, take heed of its limited capabilities.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-can-t-use-new-gamecube-controller-with-nintendo-switch-2-games">You Can’t Use New GameCube Controller With Nintendo Switch 2 Games</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s very restrictive. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The “Classic Nintendo GameCube games are coming to Nintendo Switch 2!” video on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintendoUK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo UK YouTube channel</a> features an explainer of the new GameCube Expansion features. We also get treated to a look at the new GameCube controller, but a small-print message toward the end is easily missed. </p>



<p>At <strong>2:13</strong>, a message at the top of the screen reads: “<strong>The controller is only compatible with Nintendo GameCube—Nintendo Classics.</strong>“</p>



<p>The controller isn’t expected to be cheap, and it’s also quite exclusive. It’s only: “Available for Nintendo Switch Online members” on the My Nintendo Store. Unless you’re a die-hard Nintendo or GameCube fan or collector, this is another big cost for a piece of hardware only usable with a small handful of games.</p>

<p>Between the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price of the Switch 2</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-will-nintendo-switch-2-games-cost-physical-digital-game-prices-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost of the games</a>, and even a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2s-paid-tutorial-welcome-tour-almost-made-a-player-fall-asleep-at-nintendo-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paid tutorial</a>, the Switch 2 costs soon adds up. Are you desperate for a new GameCube controller? Or is this one step too far, and you’re looking to use the new Pro Controller or Joy Con 2?</p>

While the game at its core is a turn-based game about logic and chance, I really wanted it to be set in a ‘proper’ fantasy world that has a backstory, an underlying logic, and a consistency. Yes, you’re rolling dice and collecting items, but the visuals are hand-drawn and would also work in a <a title="Genres > Visual Novel [549 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/visual-novel">visual novel</a> or roleplaying game.”</p><p>Resolution Gmaes CEO Tommy Palm added, “Innovation is at the core of what we do here at Resolution Games, and we’re very proud of the work we’ve done for immersive games. But there’s plenty of fun to be had outside of headsets too. When Henrik and David put the first prototype of GrimKeep in my hands, I simply couldn’t put it down. Good games should be shared with the world – whether they’re pioneering new ways to play like our recently released Spatial Ops, or they’re putting exciting new twists on familiar formulas such as <a title="Genres > Roguelike [313 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">roguelike</a> deck builders.”</p><p>Watch the announcement teaser trailer below.

                <p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza/" data-ref-id="5000-671287">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> promotional image posted by Nintendo Korea may have accidentally revealed one of the game's major characters--a young girl who looks suspiciously similar to Pauline.</p><p>As picked up by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/nintendo-accidentally-leaks-an-unrevealed-donkey-kong-bananza-character-that-might-unironically-have-huge-lore-implications-for-the-mario-universe/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, the character's appearance in the Nintendo Korea box art has led to a flurry of speculation as fans try to decipher what role Pauline might play in the game, and whether her young appearance means Bananza is in fact a prequel.</p><p>For those less familiar with the extended Mario/Donkey Kong universe, Pauline is a side character who first appeared as the iconic damsel in distress in the 1981 Donkey Kong arcade game. While she disappeared from the games for some time after that, she reappeared as the mayor of New Donk City in Super Mario Odyssey, and has since become a regular character in Mario spin-off titles.</p><p>Now, it appears that she may be returning to the Donkey Kong series, according to a piece of cover art that was posted to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/kr/switch2/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Korea</a> website. The art shows what looks like a younger Pauline holding onto Donkey Kong's tie as he smashes his way through the ground.</p><p>The art has now been replaced on the Korean site with an image that swaps Pauline for the crystalline purple sidekick known as Odd Rock. This has only led to further speculation after eagle-eyed fans noted that Pauline, in the original image, was wearing a purple crystal bracelet that seems to resemble Odd Rock.</p><p>The appearance of Pauline as a young girl has led fans to question the game's place in the Donkey Kong timeline, with some suggesting that Bananza could be a prequel game starring the original Donkey Kong--the character we've known as Donkey Kong from Nintendo's recent games is the grandson of the original, though The Super Mario Bros. Movie refers to him as his son. </p><p>Other theories speculate that the mystery character is actually Pauline's daughter, that Odd Rock is taking on her appearance, or that she has been aged down by some kind of magic or device.</p><p>Donkey Kong Bananza will launch on July 17, when we'll find out for sure if the mystery girl is Pauline, and what role she'll be playing in the world of Donkey Kong.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-red-faction-gorilla/1100-6530581/" data-ref-id="1100-6530581">Donkey Kong Bananza Hands-On: Red Faction Gorilla</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/" data-ref-id="1100-6530580">Switch 2 Hands-On: More Of The Same, But It Can Still Surprise You</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hands-on-the-conservative-switch-2-gets-a-bold-sequel/1100-6530583/" data-ref-id="1100-6530583">Mario Kart World Hands-On: The Conservative Switch 2 Gets A Bold Sequel</a></li></ul>

			<p>New Monster Hunter Wilds mods released online this week introduce some custom quests that allow hunters to fight against a monster that has yet to be officially available in the game.</p>
<p>The first of these new mods is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/1678?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Custom Event Quests</a>, which introduces four challenging custom quests against an Alpha Doshaguma and its pack, Zoh Shia, Arkveld, and Arch-tempered Rey Dau, a new powerful variant of the apex predator of the base game, which is already included in the game files, and will only be made available officially later this month. Some of these quests feature some illegal values that could create issues down the line if CAPCOM decides to crack down on this type of mod, so beware.</p>
<p>The second Monster Hunter Wilds custom quests mod that's now available online is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/1686?tab=description">Arena All Monsters Permanent Quest</a>, which adds custom Event Quests for all monsters currently available in the game, including the aforementioned Arch-tempered Rey Dau, except for Jin Dahaad and Zoh Shia, which do not work properly in the Wounded Hollow arena due to their unique mechanics. As for the Custom Event Quests mod, using this mod could lead to issues down the line.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about the latest entry in the series by checking out my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"> review.</a></p>

                <p>Supergiant Games has revealed some new details about Hades 2, including the fact that it runs at 60fps on Switch 2. The game is also launching later this year on the upcoming system as a timed console exclusive (alongside Switch 1). </p><p>"We learned so much from developing the original [Hades] on Nintendo Switch and we wanted to take those learnings forward to Nintendo Switch 2," explained studio director Amir Rao in a new Nintendo Creator's Voice video. "That meant for us being completely uncompromising when it comes to performance. We really really want our games to perform at 60fps."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G3wbCIUVqs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1G3wbCIUVqs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>He added that the extra power from Switch 2 will allow the studio to push Hades 2's graphical features. It got its second major update, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-the-warsong-update-adds-ares-animal-familiar-new-songs-and-more/1100-6529593/" data-ref-id="1100-6529593">the Warsong update</a>, last month, which added in areas from the first game.

It's currently in early access on Steam, so it's unclear when the full launch will happen. The game will come to PlayStation and Xbox consoles at a later date.</p><p>In GameSpot's early access <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/" data-ref-id="1900-6418231">Hades 2 review</a>, we said, "Hades II is an ambitious expansion of all the ideas that came before it, balancing them beautifully to create one of the best roguelites on the market, even in its incomplete state."</p>

<p>John Rice will once again direct, following his work on the first Angry Birds film, while Thurop Van Orman will continue as screenplay writer from the sequel.</p>
<p>"We're very excited to be partnering with Paramount Pictures and extremely proud of our incredible cast," said John Cohen, producer. "Not only do we have Jason, Josh, Rachel and Danny returning to voice their fantastic characters, but they're surrounded by an all-star ensemble of comedic talent. These are some of the funniest people out there today, and we're so thrilled to have them all on board."</p>
<p>The first two Angry Birds films have grossed over $500m worldwide.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">A Minecraft Movie had the biggest US domestic opening weekend ever for a video game adaptation</a> last week and generated $301m worldwide on its first weekend. There are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">already talks for a sequel</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the third <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-film-franchise-surpasses-1bn-in-global-box-office-revenue">Sonic the Hedgehog film led to the film franchise surpassing $1bn</a> at the global box office.</p>
<p>So far, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">biggest video game film adaptation ever remains Nintendo's The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, which earned $500m globally in a single film. But perhaps this will be usurped by Minecraft.</p>
<p>No doubt the success of these films has spurred Paramount into creating a third Angry Birds film.</p>
<p>However, there is stiff competition. Next year will see the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">release of a second Mario film in April</a>, as Nintendo looks to capitalise on its previous success.</p>
<p>Then in 2027, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-movie-gets-a-release-date-but-its-still-a-few-years-away">Sonic the Hedgehog 4</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-revealed-by-nintendo-and-its-not-as-far-away-as-you-might-have-feared">The Legend of Zelda</a> films will be released in March, following The Angry Birds Movie 3 two months prior.</p>
<p>Which film adaptation are you most excited to watch?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-get-zoh-shia-investigations/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds' first<a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-1-010-00-00-full-patch-notes-revealed/"> major update</a> introduced a lot of new features to the game, as well as new content in the form of a new monster to hunt, the returning monster Mizutsune and the highly-anticipated high rank Zoh Shia hunt, which is one of the most challenging fights in the game to date. As per series tradition, a hard hunt is rewarded with monster parts that can be used to craft powerful gear.</p>
<p>After you have defeated high rank Zoh Shia in the Germination quest, you will likely want to fight the powerful monster again to get more of its parts to craft its excellent gear. The easiest way to fight the high rank variant of the campaign's final boss is to take advantage of the SOS Flare mechanics. Any time while not in a hunt, speak with Alma, select the <strong>SOS Flare Quests</strong> tab in the Quests menu, and select Zoh Shia as the target. Chances are you will find plenty of quests with some openings, although it may take some time to join a quest as these tend to fill up rather quickly.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250409121113_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The second option to fight against high rank Zoh Shia again after taking it down the first time in Monster Hunter Wilds is by unlocking <strong>Zoh Shia Investigations</strong> in your game world, and doing so is simple enough, if you know where to look. The powerful monster can only appear in the <strong>Ruins of Wyveria</strong> during the season of <strong>Inclemency</strong>. As such, getting a Zoh Shia Investigation requires you to head over to the Ruins of Wyveria, enter your tent, change the Season to Inclemency, rinse and repeat until Zoh Shia appears, of which you will be notified in-game the same way you are notified about the appearance of other apex predators like Jin Dahaad and Rey Dau. At this point, you can already save the newly available hunting quest as an Investigation, which you can replay three times. If these three times are not enough to get all the parts you need, you will simply have to repeat the process above to make Zoh Shia appear again.</p>

            <p>Inspired is one word for it, anyway. Still, since Heroes Of Might &amp; Magic-likes aren't exactly giving roguelite deckbuilders a run for their ubiquity, I'm broadly receptive - the warmest and most exploitable of the four gamer emotions. Stormbinders is a turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> set in a fantasy land with bad weather and badder shimmering angelic eyeballs. You may recognise what it's going for. This may delight you.</p>
<p>You'll choose a hero, then get stuck into the campaign. "The story progresses across unique scenarios, uncovering a tale of magic, heroism, unlikely alliances and betrayals," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2134720/Stormbinders/">reads Steam</a>. The titular Stormbinding sounds like the interesting twist here. The game randomises weather patterns each time you boot it up, which apparently adds new wrinkles to both battle and the global map.</p>

<p>As well as map exploration, treasure hunting, and hex-based battles, there's also castle management, with a nice sunny castle and flamin' metal hell castle currently shown off. "Each faction has more than 18 unique units, including legendary heroes, wise spellcasters and mystical creatures," reads Steam. "Players can customize their armies, mixing different types of units to strategically create powerful synergies of abilities".</p>
<p>Aside from that, there isn't a tonne of information, although publishers Slytherin are holding a presentation tomorrow, April 10th at 17:00 CEST/16:00 BST, featuring an "exclusive deep dive" into the game's systems.</p>
<p>No release date on this one yet, which puts it one step behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-announce-new-back-to-roots-heroes-of-might-magic-game-with-the-iratus-devs-in-charge">Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era</a>.

            <p>Stock markets tanked and gaming laptops went into hiding this morning as US President Donald Trump’s globe-spanning tariffs <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cp8vyy35g3mt">came into effect</a>. Based on <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/08/business/video/trump-tariffs-math-equation-wrong-economist-veuger-cnc-digvid">nonsense maths</a>, these heavy taxes on imported goods are already sowing havoc within the gaming hardware industry, leaving manufacturers – whose production operations are commonly based in China and Taiwan – to scramble together a plan. Most headlines have focused on the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>’s US pre-orders being delayed as a result, but PC gear is very much following suit, with Razer pausing direct sales for its new Blade 16 and Blade 18 laptops.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645276/razer-blade-gaming-laptops-sales-pause-us-tariffs">The Verge</a>, Razer’s pre-order pages for <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-16">both</a> <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-18">laptops</a> have been replaced by a "Notify Me" button, and it’s the same story for the <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-pc-accessories/razer-adjustable-laptop-stand">Razer Adjustable Laptop Stand</a>, which was only announced yesterday. All three products are still available on Razer’s UK site at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Razer haven’t confirmed this un-selling as a direct result of the taxes, instead taking a no-comment approach. Yet the timing does stink a little of the fact that China and Taiwan, where Razer has its factories, are now subject to levies of 32% and 104% respectively. And again, they wouldn’t be the first. Besides the Switch 2, repairable laptop maker Framework have "temporarily" paused sales in the US as well.</p>
<p>“Other consumer goods makers have performed the same calculations and taken the same actions,” <a href="https://x.com/FrameworkPuter/status/1909320405627580621">Framework claimed in a Xeet</a>, “though most have not been open about it.”</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Razer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The basic dilemma faced by hardware makers, or at least the majority who need to import parts or whole products to the US, is whether to tank the extra costs (in order to keep their wares at pre-tariff prices), or to pass those costs onto consumers, resulting in potentially painful hikes. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/micron-impose-tariff-related-surcharge-some-products-april-9-sources-say-2025-04-08/">Reuters report</a> that Micron, who produce memory chips for a range of consumer SSDs, RAM modules, and laptops, have already chosen the latter for some of their products.</p>
<p>If these tariffs stay in place, it could therefore end up being a rough few years for PC owners in need of upgrades, with even American firms like Nvidia relying on Taiwanese semiconductors. The Entertainment Software Association (ESA), a US-based trade association the represents Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, EA, Epic, and other gaming giants, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/esa-trump-tariffs">have warned</a> that the policy is “going to have a real and detrimental impact on the video game industry," and previously wrote an <a href="https://www.theesa.com/the-esa-joins-multi-association-coalition-letter-to-united-states-trade-representative-greer-on-risks-of-tariffs-to-american-innovation-and-technology/">open letter</a> to the US government decrying its risks.</p>
<p>One argument in defence of these tariffs, sparking from the last square inch of US lawmaker brain matter that isn’t clogged up with Cheetos dust, is that they’ll encourage locally-based companies to move their production stateside, creating new jobs aplenty. This, of course, fails to account for the lengthy timespan of building new factories, their enormous material cost, or the talent crunch that would occur when loads of big orgs suddenly need to hire specialist technical staff simultaneously. All of which would likely result in... higher prices for the consumer.</p>
<p>I like to think that us PC types are a hardy folk that have endured plenty of money troubles before, including the great graphics card gouging of 2020 or more recent upticks in SSD prices. Still, those were caused (at least largely in part) by properly Biblical catastrophes like plague and floods. This is, just, stupid.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/razer-tariffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Razer has quietly started to pause the sales of some of its products to the US over tariffs.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645276/razer-blade-gaming-laptops-sales-pause-us-tariffs?utm_content=buffer99c07&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bsky.app&amp;utm_campaign=verge_social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Razer has stopped the pre-order and purchase of its new Blade 16 laptop on its US site. According to the Internet Archive, the laptop was avaiable on April 1st, but was removed the next day after Trump announced the new tariffs.</p>



<p>The Verge contacted Razer’s Public Relations Manager, Andy Johnston for comment on the removal, to which the he replied, “We do not have a comment at this stage regarding tariffs.”</p>



<p>The direct link to the Blade 16 configurator now takes you to a 404 error page on the US site, while other regions pages are still operational.</p>



<p>Razer has several key partners and manufacturing facilities all over the world (like most technology giants), but primarily such facilities are based in China, Taiwan, and Vietnam, who have all been impacted by Trump’s new tariffs.</p>



<p>Razer isn’t the only tech giant to pause pre-orders and sales of its products in the USA either as last week, Nintendo also it would be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-in-us-due-to-trump-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pausing pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 in the US</a> but still maintaining its June release date.</p>



<p>According to sources, Nintendo already has a decent stock supply of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles in the US, but tariff rises and uncertainty for their next batches of shipments means that a price hike is almost certainly going to happen. At the time of writing, the Nintendo Switch 2 is currently priced at $449.99.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-blue-prince-on-playstation-xbox-switch-or-pc-all-platforms-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Blue Prince is destined to win many awards in 2025, making it a popular prospect. If you want to play Blue Prince for yourself, we have the latest details on potential platforms, including PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC through Steam.</p>



<p>The early months of 2025 have seen indie games dominate. REPO has terrified players, Schedule 1 has given players a new high, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-time-does-blue-prince-release-start-date-times-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blue Prince</a> is the next level up in quality. The room-crafting roguelike is innovative and imaginative, and its review scores mean it’s likely to be in contention for multiple Game of the Year prizes.</p>



<p>But with so many consoles, platforms, and exclusivity agreements, it’s hard to know where a game is available nowadays. I’m here to draft up the answers to this question for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-blue-prince-on-ps5">Can You Play Blue Prince on PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Same rooms, different platforms. Credit to Dogubomb</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Blue Prince is arriving as a day-one launch on PlayStation 5.</strong></p>



<p>Better yet, if you own PlayStation Plus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-blue-prince-on-xbox-game-pass-or-playstation-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blue Prince is available as a free PS Plus game</a>! That’s right, if you are a PS Plus subscriber, you can play Blue Prince free of charge. We imagine developer Dogubomb has a secure partnership with Sony and PlayStation to allow this. It’s sure to give the game a massive boost and get the roguelike out there for more people.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-blue-prince-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Blue Prince on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>Xbox Series X|S players are also treated to the release of Blue Prince.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.blueprincegame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Blue Prince</a> is not a PlayStation exclusive. So if you’re on Xbox, you also get to draft rooms, explore Mt. Holly, and try to live up to your role as an heir and make yourself jolly by locating Room 46. I have even more good news: Blue Prince is a day-one Xbox Game Pass title, following in PlayStation’s footsteps.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-blue-prince-on-pc">Can You Play Blue Prince on PC?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s another tick for Blue Prince as we can confirm the roguelike is available on PC and Steam.</strong></p>



<p>A few thousand people already have Blue Prince wishlisted. The people know it’s coming, and if you’re not a console gamer, you can sample Dogubomb’s efforts for yourself on PC. The system requirements are minimal, so they shouldn’t stop you from running Blue Prince.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-blue-prince-on-nintendo-switch">Can You Play Blue Prince on Nintendo Switch?</h2>



<p><strong>The hot streak comes to an end as we regretfully announce Blue Prince is not releasing on Nintendo Switch.</strong></p>



<p>I’m not sure why, but Nintendo misses out on the soon-to-be-heralded classic. Blue Prince is only coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. But like many games, don’t be surprised if Blue Prince gets a future port on one of (if not both) the Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

			<p>Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines was first introduced to the world in the much-missed era of the 1990’s, when the world made sense and films were good. Ostensibly a stealth-oriented real-time tactics game, the Commandos series has really always been about solving puzzles. &nbsp;You have a series of unique tools – your Commando squad, consisting of Sapper, Green Berret, Driver, etc – that must combine their individual abilities in a variety of interesting ways to crack the riddle posed by complex arrangements of Nazi and their assorted view cones. The franchise was a big-hit at the time, but despite a few remakes, has remained mostly dormant since 2006. Possibly for good reason as, after an initially promising sequel, the various follow-ups failed to deliver the winning combination of brains and brawn that the original offered.</p>
<p><iframe title="Commandos: Origins | Six Soldiers, One Mission (US)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bK5xkvceNDo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Seeking to reverse the franchise’s fortunes is Commandos: Origins, developed by Claymore Game Studios, this a brand-new entry in the series that acts as a prequel to the 90’s original. Despite a noticeable level-up for the visuals, not much has changed for Commandos in the thirty-odd intervening years. Played from an isometric perspective, you guide your squad of up to six Commandos through a vast map, spending most of your time sneaking past sentries or garrotting them and dumping their bodies in some conveniently placed foliage. Thank goodness Nazis don’t have any kind of peripheral vision – must not have been eating their carrots – otherwise they’d definitely spot the hulking Green Beret who is crawling past their ankles, right freaking next to them. All video games take a healthy dose of suspension of disbelief, but Commandos: Origins demands a bigger dose than most.</p>


<p>Starting in an Allied prison, deep in Africa, the game immediately introduces us to the aforementioned Green Beret – as big and burly as ever – who is freed from his imprisonment by the Sapper, speaking with an unbelievably clipped English accent that is absolutely joyous to hear. Played from the classic top-down perspective, the two heroes make their way out of the prison complex, each helping the other to reach their objective. Stealth mechanics are perfunctory, nothing you won’t have experienced a hundred times or more, but reliable. Enemy viewing cones clearly show what your foes can see, allowing you to slip the Commandos through the gaps unnoticed.</p>
<p>Things get more interesting when their unique abilities are unlocked, allowing for some interesting tactics and unique takedowns. Take one of the earliest set-ups by way of an example, where the Sapper places a mantrap, whilst the Green Berret hides a radio nearby to lure the patrolling German to his snapping demise. Very welcome here is the visual depiction of sound waves, ensuring you know exactly who will be alerted once the radio is activated.</p>


<p>This all sounds quite promising, and it would be, if not for one enormous caveat. Commandos: Origins has amongst the worst gamepad I’ve had the misfortune to wrestle with in a console RTS. I know that transferring a game intended to be played with mouse and keyboard to work on consoles is hugely challenging, but games like Shadow Tactics prove that it can be done. Claymore Game Studios sadly didn’t take to heart any of the lessons learned by the shinobi-based RTS classic. Instead, their chosen controller implementation is fussy, finicky and, on far too many occasions, borderline unplayable.</p>
<p>Controlling the camera is a bad joke, squeezing triggers and wobbling thumb sticks in a desperate attempt to see what you need to see to actually play the game. It’s deeply unwieldy, and makes setting up cunning plans involving sniper rifles, dinghies and stolen jeeps a deeply frustrating, laborious and time-consuming affair. Selecting commandos, choosing their abilities, activating a takedown, everything is unintuitive and, worst of all, laggy. Far too often my elite squad was rumbled simply because the spy handles like a brick coated in baby oil, failing to get out of the enemy sightlines in time. For a turn-based game these foibles might be more forgivable, but in a real time strategy game, one in which there are numerous moving parts to manage to succeed, these controls are game-breaking.</p>

<p>If you are able to grin and bear it with the controls (or are playing with mouse &amp; keyboard) there’s a lot to like about Commandos: Origins. Levels in general are humongous, intricate and complex, with a veritable army of goons to sneak past and assassinate. Most take several hours to fully complete, and not just because of save-scumming your way through tricky encounters. There’s some interesting verticality to the environment too, allowing for open and free-form strategizing, with numerous possibilities to proceed presenting themselves.</p>
<p>Your commandos rarely start in the same location, instead they weave and wind their way around the environments, assisting each other in intuitive and creative ways. Sniping out guards to open the path for your driver on the other side of the map, ferrying commandos to flank the enemy in an inflatable dingy, crashing lorries through checkpoints, or just pulling out the machine guns and going wild, the potential strategies are varied, and many objectives are entirely optional. These tactics are enabled, and the gamepad controls <em>almost</em> made bearable, by the handy ability to pause the game at any point and issue each Commando with a series of orders, then unpause and watch your perfectly plan carried out.</p>

<p>Visually, this is gorgeous stuff; vehicles, uniforms, and weapons are all impeccably researched and immaculately detailed, yet with the charming larger-than-life aesthetic of a Hollywood war film. There’s something akin to playing with your GI JOEs here, chunky player characters crawling under barbed wires, kicking down doors, or chocking out Nazis. Landscapes are varied and interesting, from sand coated deserts, to ancient Germanic forests, and icy-cold tundra.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things are let down by some noticeable frame-rate drops, particularly when the bullets start flying, causing the game to be even harder to control than before. There’s plenty of visual glitches too, with Commandos regularly murdering the air next to an enemy, only for the untouched guard to fall-down dead anyway. Worse, lots of screen tears accompany camera movement, making that already lacklustre aspect of the game nausea-inducing to boot.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Commandos: Origins is probably very good; an interesting historical setting, charming visuals, and deep and varied strategic options. You won’t notice any of that if playing on console however, you’ll be too busy wrestling with the terrible controls to be having much fun. That, and the buggy visuals, make this one to be missed unless you're on PC.	</p></div>

			<p>A new Assassin’s Creed Shadows patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing plenty of new features and improvements, including PSSR support on PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p>The introduction of support for the AI-powered upscaler that made its debut with the mid-generation refresh system last year is accompanied by the introduction of Raytraced Specular in Balanced Mode, bringing this display mode's visual fidelity closer to PS5 Pro Quality Mode than Performance Mode. Those playing the game for the first time on PlayStation 5 Pro with the 1.0.2 patch will have PSSR enabled by default, but everyone else will have to enable it in the video tab of the pause menu.</p>
<p>After the new Assassin’s Creed Shadows patch went live, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a> released a comparison video that highlights how PSSR adds some improvements to image quality with better antialiasing. However, its implementation still isn't perfect, as there's a loss in sharpening and reflections, which has been seen in other games as well.</p>

<p>The new Assassin’s Creed Shadows patch, as mentioned above, also introduces other changes and improvements, such as horse auto-follow and speed improvements, the ability to reset Master Nodes straight from the menu, selling and dismantling multiple items, the ability to toggle between dynamic resolution scaling and fixed resolution mode regardless of upscaler quality on PC and more. The full patch notes can be found <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/2FUDlIPb2uWk5Ldb8OhKej">here.</a></p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the latest entry in the series by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">review.</a></p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-best-pals-ranked">Palworld</a> developers Pocketpair have announced their next gig as a fledgling games publisher. They're palling up with MythicOwl to release the latter's jaunty delivery sim Truckful, in which absolutely nothing waits for you in the woods. In which there are no ghost trucks. In which "hidden paths, misty wetlands, unforgiving marshes and dusty quicksands [do not] tell the stories of the past, waiting to be discovered". Here's a trailer.

<p>
At first blush, Truckful is a jolly 3D roadster with boisterous cargo physics, viewed from a slanted side-on perspective. It's about stacking your flatbed high with loose objects such as pianos and vases, then trying to transport them safely across the rough roads of this idyllic countryside setting.
</p>
<p>
It reminds me a bit of the village where I grew up, except that there don't seem to be as many obnoxious middle-aged townies on racing bicycles, though you do encounter a lot of chatty pedestrians, some of whom need a lift. The local forest also reminds me of the scrawny oak copses down the road from my childhood home, except that I don't recall the roots being big enough to drive up, and I don't remember the sun ever vanishing like a swallowed candle. Definitely some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-is-an-amazing-finnish-fairytale-at-the-heart-of-alan-wake-2s-forests">metsänpeitto</a> going on hereabouts. Ooh, who's that peering between the boughs? Yeah, best not stop for directions. Focus on delivering the piano.
</p>
<p>
Having Pocketpair on board as publisher means that MythicOwl have more money to blow on bonus moving parts. "With Pocketpair's support, you can expect that many great gameplay features we were cooking during past couple months, will make it the game as its development is now fully funded &amp; secure," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3090810/Truckful/">a Steam post</a>. "We're testing truckloads (!) of new stuff - locations, quests, characters, upgrades &amp; unlockables - so make sure to stay tuned to our social and community channels for more content!" I will forgive you that whoopee-cushion parenthesis if you'll forgive me for saying that you should have called this Cormac McCosy's The Road.
</p>
<p>
I guess the nearest parallel for this both mood-wise and in terms of the cargo-stacking mechanics is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dredge">Dredge</a>. Pocketpair's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">other publishing joint</a> that I know about is an untitled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game about the entertainment industry from Surgent Studios, creators of Tales Of Kenzera: ZAU.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>' previously announced cross-save feature will not be launching on PlayStation 4 and PS5 at the same time as other platforms due to a "legal issue".</p>
<p>Writing on social media, developer Poncle said the team had run into an issue last minute, which "requires us to share info on our partners that we're unable to". As such, the "chances of cross-save coming to PlayStation consoles are now very slim", it said.</p>

<p>But while the chances are slim, they are "not impossible" the Vampire Survivors developer continued, stating it is going to keep working with PlayStation to get the issue sorted.</p>
<p>"We're so sorry to build up any anticipation for this feature on PlayStation only to change plans at the last minute," Poncle wrote, before closing:</p>
<p>"For anyone wanting Cross-Save just to unlock trophies, it's worth noting that PS Trophies are automatically disabled on a platform level for all games when using a save file from another platform."</p>
<p>As for other platforms, cross-save will be coming to Vampire Survivors via PC, Xbox and mobile devices in coming weeks. It will then arrive for those playing on Nintendo Switch at an unspecified later date, as well as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a> if the developer "can do so without breaching any privacy commitments".</p>

<p>At last night's BAFTAs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">Vampire Survivors was deemed the best Evolving Game</a>, winning out against <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> Online, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>, Sea of Thieves and World of Warcraft. The game previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-wins-best-game-at-bafta-game-awards">scooped itself up the BAFTA for Best Game in 2023</a>, beating out heavy hitters including the likes of Elden Ring and God of War: Ragnarök. It also won the award for Game Design.</p>
<p>Not only that, Vampire Survivors is also getting its own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-animated-tv-series-in-the-works">animated TV series</a>. I wonder what will be necks for this breakout hit that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-review-near-endless-rpg-popcorn">Christian Donlan described as "near-endless RPG popcorn"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>'18 Wheels Of Thunder' boasts <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/big-rigs-over-the-road-racing">Big Rigs: Over the Road Racin</a>g's original <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/big-rigs-over-the-road-racing/">box art</a>, in a font forged from guitar pedals, light beer, and divorce papers. Flames jet from the snout of the marauding 'rig like snorted breakfast tequila following an especially piquant ex-wifely punchline. A rammed police car flails uselessly against the sheer girth of but one of those 18 thunderous wheels. Perhaps we might imagine a single tear trickling down the exasperated coparoo's cheek. As we reach out to wipe it from the case, we unwittingly dissolve the '1' from the tagline, leaving us with only '8'.</p>
<p>The 8 remains, smugly, for two decades. 8 is the Metacritic score for Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing. That is so incredibly powerful that words fail me. Not for Metacritic, meaningless institution run by and for leprous prestige weasels that it is. It's powerful for Big Rigs. To get less than a 61 on Metacritic, a game must either be so brazenly committed to its own bizarre artistic vision that it fizzles the minds of lesser critics like Skittles in lemonade, or simply be unplayable wank. I have read a lot of evidence that points toward the latter, but that can't be true, or it wouldn't <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3598130/Big_Rigs_Over_the_Road_Racing/">be on Steam</a>, right?

<p>"Get ready for some brake jamm'in, CB talk'in, convoy roll'in action across America," screams the trailer, with all the hammy revisionism of Tommy Wiseau labelling The Room "a dark comedy" after the fact.  It's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing game</a>, in case that wasn't clear, although Steam also has it tagged as 'psychological horror'. I'd call Steam users out for only having, like, two jokes but they're basically working with fridge magnet poetry so it's a noble effort. You'll drive one of four 'rigs over five tracks, hauling loads and trying to stay one step ahead of johnny lawman. Oh, you thought this was <em>regular</em> driving action? Hillarious. This is "non-stop driving action", you pitiful cornflake. </p>
<p>Is this new release in better shape than the original? Or, to put it another way, does it actually function? Reviews have it at a light-to-medium 'still mostly busted'. There are also a few complaints about an allegedly dodgy installer wizard. Interestingly, the current custodians do at least seem interested in keeping it playable. It's already received a few patches addressing fatal errors, the most recent of which arrived this morning.</p>
<p>Following the game's disastrous release in 2003, producer 	Sergey Titov <a href="http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/big-rigs-over-the-road-racing-2/">apparently offered</a> to personally replace any copies sent to him with a game of the buyer's choice from the Activision Value Catalog. Only 20 people took him up on it. I'd imagine the likely culprit here is malaise, although perhaps these thunderous wheels really do have an undeniable magnetism; a primeval, electric pull that writhes infinitely, like a big fat Metacritic eight.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>UK actors' union Equity is calling on the games industry to improve conditions for performers.</p>
<p>A protest took place outside last night's BAFTA Games Awards, as Equity members held placards reading "Union contracts in gaming now".</p>
<p>Performers are seeking better pay and terms and conditions for their work in the industry as part of union-negotiated agreements, which is common practice in the US but less so in the UK.</p>
<p>"It is great to see the successes of the video games industry on show at the BAFTA Games Awards, and for the incredible achievements of its workforce to be celebrated across the categories - from performers, to designers, developers and more," said John Barclay, Equity’s assistant general secretary for recorded media.</p>
<p>"But Equity is here to make sure the poor practice frequently reported by Equity members does not continue to be ignored by industry leaders. The video games industry is worth over £7bn in the UK alone and in attendance tonight are bosses from some of the richest companies in the world. Yet these companies continue to ignore Equity's calls to work with us to introduce union-negotiated agreements in the UK that would improve pay, terms and conditions for our members - something that is normal practice in the US."</p>
<p>He continued: "Pay for video game performers in the UK has stagnated despite games companies receiving almost £200m in tax breaks; performers do not have proper protections from artificial intelligence or NDA misuse; and they need safer workplaces so they don’t injure their vocals or bodies, or experience improper recordings of intimate scenes. In an industry that generates enormous wealth, Equity members deserve better."</p>
<p>The protest took place outside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">this year's BAFTA Games Awards</a>, where <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> took home multiple awards.</p>

<p>This action was part of Equity's ongoing Game On! campaign to improve the standards for performers working in the games industry.</p>
<p>It mirrors the SAG-AFTRA strike that continues over in the US, largely against the lack of AI protections for performers.</p>
<p>Last month, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal">US union warned of "alarming loopholes" for "AI abuse"</a> in the latest proposal to end industrial action. Negotiators on behalf of video game companies responded that "meaningful progress" had been made.</p>
<p>Following news of the SAG-AFTRA strike last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-stands-in-solidarity-with-sag-aftra-but-wont-authorise-its-own-strike">Equity stated it stands "in solidarity", but would not be authorising a strike</a>.</p>
<p>"Voice and performance capture artists are a vital part of this multibillion-dollar industry, bringing to life characters that make games successful," read a statement from Equity at the time. "We stand shoulder to shoulder with SAG-AFTRA as partners in a global fight to secure fair pay and protect our members' rights, which could not be more urgent as we move forward with artificial intelligence innovation."</p>
<p>However a strike in the UK has not been issued, as "industrial relations legislation in the United Kingdom is very restrictive" and the "employment status of Equity members makes it even more difficult to overcome those hurdles in this context".</p>
<p>At the start of the year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">Eurogamer spoke with voice actor Jennifer Hale</a> (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta-3">Bayonetta 3</a>) about the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike and why it's taking so long to resolve.</p>
<p>"It's a huge issue for all of us and the repercussions are vast," she said. "So to me, it makes sense that everyone needs to take their time. As performers - and we saw this in the writers strike and the theatrical contract strike - we're just the canary in the coal mine."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 unveiling may have been largely positive, but there are a few things that didn't sit very well with some fans, such as the pricing of the hardware and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-go-up-to-e90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of the software</a>. It doesn't help that the console pre-orders, scheduled to go live later today in most of the world, have been delayed in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-have-been-delayed-in-canada-thanks-to-us-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canada</a> due to the US tariffs issue, making North American customers even more anxious about a further price increase.</p>
<p>Now, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser has shared a tone-deaf statement that has riled up fans even more. As <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/nintendo-switch-2-price-tariffs-1.7503598" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by CBC Canada, he essentially told them to go buy the original Switch if they can't afford the new one.</p>
<p><em>As we look at Nintendo Switch 2 and you think about the feature sets that I talked about ... we believe that the pricing is appropriate for the value of the machine and the gameplay experience overall. We recognize there are some people that may not be able to afford the Nintendo Switch 2 price point. That's why we wanted to make the other Switch platforms available, so people still have an opportunity to come into our gaming universe, be a part of these characters in these worlds, and see value, if you will, in whatever rung of the platform they come in.</em></p>
<p>Those with a long enough memory have instantly remembered Don Mattrick's similar statement. When the Xbox One was facing criticism because of the console's initial mandatory online connectivity, he famously said:</p>
<p><em>We have a product for people who aren't able to get some form of connectivity; it's called Xbox 360.</em></p>
<p>The terrible Xbox One marketing essentially doomed Microsoft's third console from the get-go in its fight against Sony's PlayStation 4. The Nintendo Switch 2 likely won't suffer the same fate, with analysts believing it will still <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-estimated-to-sell-15m-units-in-2025-in-resounding-success-but-tariffs-shadow-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become the fastest-selling console ever</a> and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-stepping-up-to-be-more-of-a-primary-platform-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turn into more of a primary platform for core gamers</a>. Still, this reveal could have gone a bit more smoothly.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Commandos: Origins Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/commandos-origins-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/commandos-origins-review.1159062/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/commandos-origins-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether twiddling their thumbs during the decades since Commandos 3 or calmly hiding in a hedge waiting to knife a nosey Nazi in the neck on his next stroll past, if there’s one thing Commandos fans are known for it’s lurking patiently. Good things come to those who’ve waited, and Commandos: Origins fits that bill. Slow-paced, challenging, and consistently satisfying when all your plans come together, its brand of isometric stealth action is intact and has never looked better. I’ve sunk nearly 60 hours into it over the last week and a half just to see out the missions, and there are potentially dozens more hours available should I return to play through some of them again with the intention of leaving no stone unturned and no soldier unslain. The only major issue is the assortment of bugs I’ve had to become accustomed to in order to keep enjoying myself. Like a peskily placed German sniper, some of these I learnt how to avoid entirely, but there were others I just needed to find a way to neutralise.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For those of you who skipped basic training, Commandos is a classic series of real-time tactics stealth ’em ups set during the Second World War that goes all the way back to the late ’90s. Picture a crew of elite but generally crabby commandos crawling around on their bellies behind enemy lines, driven by a whole lot of mouse clicking, and you’re most of the way there. For a modern comparison, it’s a lot like The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, only filmed exclusively from a drone (and without Guy Ritchie’s wit or Henry Cavill’s perfectly curled cookie duster). Or the BBC’s Rogue Heroes with 90% less swearing and 100% less AC/DC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, while its cheesy yet otherwise stony-faced approach may lack the outright humour of those crackling British Special Forces capers, Commandos: Origins is arguably the best version of the series’ concept to date. It’s a familiar yet modern experience for grizzled veterans, and also an intuitive and approachable one for new players who are ready to test themselves against a steadily escalating difficulty curve.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where eagles stare</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like any great stealth game, Origins is as much a game about tactics as it is a salvo of deadly puzzles to solve. It essentially boils down to analysing every upcoming encounter, inspecting each enemy soldier’s vision cone, and finding a way to dispatch them that won’t bring the whole German army down on your squad’s heads. A large part of my time with Origins has been spent simply staring at the screen, surveying my prey like an ambush predator. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A large part of my time with Origins has been spent simply staring at the screen, surveying my prey like an ambush predator.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of the six commandos on your team has a set of unique tools and abilities. For the most part, Origins curates the characters available for each mission, tailoring the action for their skills. There are only two instances where all six soldiers will be on the same battlefield at once, which is kind of a shame because those are real highlights. That said, I probably would’ve played a huge amount of Origins exclusively using the Marine’s throwing knives and harpoon gun had I had the chance, so forcing me to expand my approach by sidelining him sometimes was probably wise and almost certainly kept things from becoming stale. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of sidelining, I actually don’t miss the inventory management of the previous games, though I feel like I wouldn’t have removed the ability to pick up and use enemy weapons for the Green Beret in particular. The argument here is that Origins is more about thoughtful stealth at all times – and less about spraying lead from scavenged MP40s at anything with a swastika on it. Thoughtful stealth, luckily, is empowered by the coolest part of Origins: Command Mode. Riffing on similar modes in the late, great Mimimi’s Desperados 3 and Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, Command Mode allows you to freeze time indefinitely and queue up individual actions for each of your commandos. Back in real time, they’ll execute those simultaneously on your say so. Nailing the timing on a set of Command Mode instructions is powerfully satisfying, whether it’s simply two crawling commandos stabbing a distracted pair of soldiers from the side, or a more complicated and elaborately choreographed ballet of harpoons, blades, and bullets.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Commandos: Origins Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s all quite a slow process to do well, but it’s a truly rewarding one when you figure out the solution to taking on what initially may seem like too many meticulously positioned soldiers to tackle. Maybe your first choice of target is impossible to kill quietly because he’s always in sight of one of his other comrades, and maybe that very squadmate is always in view of a third, and so on. But there’s fun in uncovering who should be the first domino to fall throat-first onto a Fairbairn–Sykes combat knife. Some enemies will leave their posts to investigate strange sounds, like the Sapper’s whistle or the Green Beret’s radio – or inspect the Driver’s burning packets of cigarettes. Some will only temporarily turn and face a distraction, giving you precious moments to slip by them. Experimenting with which routes and tools work best is a task that tapped into a compulsive part of my brain.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s fun in uncovering who should be the first domino to fall throat-first onto a Fairbairn–Sykes combat knife.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The opportunities are always there; it’s just on us to find them – and the fact that they’re not telegraphed or signposted makes every victory feel like you’ve outfoxed the developers. At one point I spotted a tiny gap in the view cones of four soldiers on a small set of stairs in the water. It allowed me to not only get behind them to wipe them out, but also to bring three other squadmates via boat to the rear of my main objective. Was that there on purpose? Probably, but maybe not. Leaving it ambiguous as to whether you’ve gone about an encounter in the precise way Claymore Game Studios surreptitiously left ajar for us – or succeeded with an unpredictable sequence of moves the dev team perhaps never saw coming –  is just good design.  Either way, the encouragement to explore every corner of the maps for the best opportunities is thoroughly baked in.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In large part, that’s because these levels are all exceedingly detailed dioramas, sprawling and dense, and every one feels like I’m playing a high-stakes game of toy soldiers on the kind of miniature map exhibits you might see tucked behind glass at a war museum. Missions take place all across Europe and North Africa, too, so the variety of backdrops is terrific – from snowy Scandinavia to lush, soggy fields and baking deserts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The huge environments are also rendered entirely in three dimensions and you can enter buildings seamlessly, and the fact that I felt the need to say that should give you an idea of how long it’s been since we’ve had a proper Commandos game. You can make fine camera rotations in any compass direction, so getting the right angle to spot a gap in security is easy. That said, scrolling around too fast sometimes introduces a bit of temporary choppiness, but it’s a short-lived gripe. It’s otherwise great looking overall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is, unfortunately, some occasional clumsiness when navigating particularly complex, multi-storey structures. Over the course of the campaign I encountered a few enemies that appeared to be sharing a floor with me, but who were actually on a different level entirely and should’ve been hidden from view at that moment. I also had the misfortune of placing down a beartrap that became irretrievable because it wasn’t on the same platform I wanted to leave it, and being shot through a solid container that apparently wasn’t really there is never any fun. There were also occasional instances where my commands were being misinterpreted and my men were setting off to unintended areas and directly into enemy sight lines, due to an apparent disconnect between what floors are being displayed and what floor Origins <em>thinks </em>I’m clicking on. These aren’t major frustrations, though, and remedying them typically just required some minor zooming, or panning the camera slightly. That, or a quick reload to bring back the prematurely deceased.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Saving dyin’ privates</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In the trial-and-error world of tactical games like Commandos, quick save is your friend – and Origins is no exception. The ability to pick up directly where you left off after doing something risky and/or stupid is what actually gives us the freedom to experiment with different approaches in the first place. Make no mistake, quick save well and truly saved my bacon (and quickly!) on many occasions – but, unfortunately, this essential feature also seems to provoke some of Origins’ most bothersome bugs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, loading a save you made while one of your commandos was climbing a wire – or perched high on a climbable pole – appears to leave the poor bastard marooned on an invisible level above the map, fruitlessly crawling or moonwalking into oblivion. The solution, naturally, is to simply resolve to never save while one of your men is climbing anything. That wasn’t the end of my issues, though. After another reload I noticed my Marine was no longer in his boat, but walking on water back to the marker I’d placed. This bug eventually resolved itself, but one where my Sapper simply disappeared off the map and became unselectable did not. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That kind of issue could’ve become game-breaking, but Origins – seemingly aware that it has a few technical landmines for you to step on – keeps a queue of several quick saves. For the most part, if something goes awry, there’s a strong chance you’ll have a slightly older save you can revert too. In this instance, though, I’d sadly filled all my saves without noticing my Sapper was no longer present. The only solution was restarting the mission entirely, which was over an hour lost.</p><div id="rank-these-world-war-ii-men-on-a-mission-movies" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank these World War II 'men-on-a-mission' movies</h3><h3>Rank these World War II 'men-on-a-mission' movies</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One weird issue, and one I can’t tell whether it’s related to the quick saves or not, is the occasional instance of enemies falsely detecting one of your commandos in a bush they’re no longer hiding in – and getting locked in an alert state about it. They’ll subsequently circle it and blast it to hell to no avail. It wasn’t so bad because I was able to either skirt around it or totally exploit it by stabbing all the soldiers while they were busy slaughtering the unfortunate shrubbery, but it definitely wasn’t supposed to happen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I wouldn’t necessarily call the enemies smart overall, and it would’ve been nice if they displayed a little more of the initiative we see in other modern stealth games. Instead of callously ignoring dead bodies after an alert phase resets, for instance, they might want to drag their kaput companions off to a predefined location, à la Hitman. They make up for their dim bulbs by being extremely dangerous, though – and they’re just unpredictable enough to keep you on your toes when you think you’ve got their patterns figured out. They won’t inspect the nearest hiding places in the same order after a reload, for instance, so you’d better have a backup plan – or at least make sure nobody’s climbing a telephone pole when they come looking.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Blizzard has shared a roadmap for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, taking us through the rest of this year and teasing a bit of what's to come in 2026.</p>
<p>This roadmap <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-backtracks-on-diablo-4-annual-expansions-next-due-in-2026">reiterates that another hellish expansion is on the way</a>, but it won't be available until next year. Along with that new expansion, 2026 also promises players a new ranking system, leaderboards and a new <em>something</em>. I only say <em>something </em>here, because the rest of the roadmap's text has been engulfed by fire, but I am going to make an educated guess and say it will probably be a new class.</p>
<p>But, before all of that, there is plenty of Diablo 4 chaos slated for 2025.</p>

<p>Coming up next on the roadmap is the April to July season, which is known as Belial's Return. "Belial, Lord of Lies has returned to warp reality to his will. Daring wanderers can clash with Belial and two bosses from Vessel of Hatred as part of the updated Lair Boss system," <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24189529/the-age-of-hatred-persists-diablo-iv-2025-roadmap">reads the season's official blurb</a>.</p>
<p>There's also an "earnable feline pet" on the way in the coming months, as well as a "new IP collab" and some quality of life tweaks to lair bosses.</p>
<p>Then between July and September, Diablo 4 players will be welcoming Sins of the Horadrim, which will return to Nightmare Dungeons. Players can expect new activities here, as well as interactions "that let you progress the dungeon’s intensity as you hunt down the barons of Hell" (sounds chill).</p>
<p>During this time, Blizzard will also be introducing keyboard and mouse support for consoles as a permanent addition to the game, something the developer said has been a much requested feature. Between July and September, there will also be an earnable pet available, although the team did not specify what kind.</p>
<p>Moving into the colder months of September to December, we then have Infernal Chaos, which will bring Infernal Horde Updates. As you may have surmised given that these months come with the header Infernal Chaos, this means things are going to get "more chaotic" for players, as the Diablo 4 team puts "new choices into your hands".</p>
<p>There will also be a new variety of powers to earn here, known as chaos powers. Advanced options between Infernal Waves will also be making a showing during these months as well. Again, Blizzard has teased an earnable pet and a "new IP collab" for between September and December, but again has kept further details under wraps for now.</p>

<p>Diablo 4 will celebrate its second anniversary this June. On its initial release back in 2023, we awarded Diablo 4 four out of five stars. "Like the Blizzard hits of old, Diablo 4 is a designer's game at heart, built on intricacy and depth. A sense of fearful overcompensation holds it back," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-review-richness-luxury-and-compromise">Eurogamer's original Diablo 4 review</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, we have also been treated to a major expansion known as Vessel of Hatred. This expansion also earned itself four Eurogamer stars.</p>
<p>"A polished, bewitching upgrade that sinks its claws into you - featuring perhaps the best character class in Diablo's history," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review">Eurogamer's Vessel of Hatred review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
