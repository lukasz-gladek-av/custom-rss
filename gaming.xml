            <p>We already knew that Marvel Rivals has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-opening-weekend-sees-10m-players-join-in">proven incredibly popular</a> since its launch last month - 10 million players joined online at launch - but now it's smashed another milestone, topping 600K concurrent players this weekend on Steam.</p>
<p>As recorded by <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/">SteamDB</a>, the number of players jumping into NetEase's hero shooter has hit 644,269 on Valve's digital platform, making it one of the biggest games not just of the  weekend, but also one of the biggest games by concurrent numbers of all-time, too.</p>

<p>With just <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, PUBG, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a> sporting more concurrent players in the last 24 hours, Marvels Rivals' 644,269 concurrent players cements it in the annals of Steam history as the 14th biggest game by simultaneous player-count alone.</p>
<p>That's bigger than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>' all-time Steam concurrent peak (578,569), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> (472,962), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> (458,709), and Grand Theft Auto 5 (364,548).</p>
<p>"NetEase's spin on the hero battler is complex and moreish, but rarely much actual fun," our Chris wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-review">Eurogamer's Marvel Rivals review</a>. "Its biggest impact is a renewed appreciation for the rivals that do it better." He awarded it two out of five stars.</p>
<p>Yesterday's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-update-kills-mods-removing-cheats-skins-and-19-inches-of-venom">Marvel Rivals update has seemingly wiped the ability to use mods on PC</a>.</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals has been in Season 0 since its release last month, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-season-1-will-nerf-some-of-the-most-dominant-characters">yesterday the online hero shooter's first season launched</a>, bringing significant balance changes and the heroic Fantastic Four team: Mister Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, the Human Torch, and the Thing.</p>
<p>Since the update rolled out, however, players are reporting that asset hash checking has stripped the ability to use mods, such as custom skins or FPS boost mods.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In an interview at the National Board of Review Awards Gala, Erivo was asked what “dream role” she’s manifesting for her future. And now, she said she’s ready to tackle one of the most iconic superheroes in history.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In quite the change of pace from Erivo’s most recent portrayal of Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West in “Wicked,” she announced her dream role is Storm, the character from Marvel’s “X-Men.”</p><p>“I really want to play Storm,” Erivo told the interviewer. “I know it sounds frivolous, but I think we haven’t uncovered how grand she is, and all of that inner turmoil she has,” the 38-year-old continued. “So I think there’s a world in which we could do something with that.”</p><p>Storm, the weather-controlling superhero mutant, was made famous in the Marvel comics in the 1970s.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lords-of-the-fallen">Lords of the Fallen</a> publisher CI Games confirmed it would not "embed social or political agendas" in its games due to the "high risk it can present".</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/czaty-inwestorskie/20250108/ci-games-marek-tyminski">Strefa Inwestorów</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/lords-of-the-fallen-studio-embraces-the-dei-bugbear-says-it-will-not-include-any-social-or-political-agendas-in-its-games/">PC Gamer</a>), global marketing director Ryan Hill told investors the studio would focus on "excellent user experience with compelling thematics and characters created specifically for core and adjacent audiences" following perceptions "a number of high profile releases underperform[ed] commercially during the last year" due to what he believed to be "social or political agendas."</p>
<p>"We remain committed to producing player-first video games that prioritise an excellent user experience with compelling themes and characters created specifically for core and adjacent audiences," Hill said when asked for the studio's position on "DEI [diversity, equity, and inclusion - more commonly known as EDI in the UK] in gaming".</p>
<p>"While some video games have recently taken the opportunity to embed social or political agendas within their experiences, it is clear that many players do not appreciate this, and as a result, we have seen a number of high profile releases underperforming commercially during the last year alone.</p>
<p>"Our games will always be developed to maximise player enjoyment and commercial success, and as such, we will not be integrating any social or political agencies into these experiences going forward having observed the high risk this can present."</p>
<p>Hill did not expand on his definition of "social or political agencies", nor defined what "high risk" meant to him and studio leadership. He also didn't exemplify what games he considered had "underperformed commercially" or, indeed, clarify what commercial success looked like to him.</p>
<p>CI Games declined to comment further on Hill's statement to investors.</p>
<p>The action-RPG is currently sitting on a "mixed" Steam user score, and received just two stars in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lords-of-the-fallen-2023-review">Eurogamer's Lords of the Fallen review</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lords-of-the-fallen-sequel-now-in-full-development">A sequel is currently in development</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/11/24341043/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-details-leaks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Nintendo’s announcement of the Switch successor is imminent. Just how imminent is anyone’s guess with the company stating that it would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">reveal info on the console</a> before the end of its fiscal year in March. Rumors regarding the new Switch have been circulating for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">more than a year</a>, but with less than two months to go until the promised deadline, and in the absence of any real information from Nintendo itself, speculation about the console, its specs, physical profile, and more have reached a fever pitch. So before the official reveal, here’s everything we think we know about Nintendo’s next console.</p><p>The only concrete, Nintendo-confirmed piece of information we know about the new console is that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">it’ll be backwards compatible with the Switch</a>. Everything else has come by way of leaks and info supplied by third-party manufacturers. Late last year, one such manufacturer, Dbrand, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">debuted its Killswitch carrying case meant for the Switch 2</a>. According to Dbrand CEO Adam Ijaz, the Killswitch is based on the “actual dimensions” of the new console obtained from a “3D scan of the real hardware.” But in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>, he declined to say exactly how or where Dbrand obtained such information.</p><div><figcaption>Dbrand’s render of its Killswitch 2 case.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Dbrand</cite></p></div><p>If the Killswitch’s design is indeed derived from the real thing, the new console will be larger than the Switch OLED with an 8-inch screen, and feature a kickstand that will span the length of the console similar to the OLED model. That the new Switch will be larger than previous iterations is supported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">leaks</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339979/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-renders-onleaks">info from other accessory manufacturers</a> as well as the idea that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/26/24141744/is-nintendo-going-off-the-rails">Joy-Con controllers will attach via magnet</a> instead of sliding and snapping into place. The new controller design will also incorporate magnets in the joysticks to combat against the dreaded “Joy-Con drift” that plagues the Switch even now.</p><p>CES 2025 provided even more fodder for the rumor mill, with accessory manufacturer Genki <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">showing off a 3D printed mock-up of the console</a> on the show floor. In an interview with <em>The Verge</em>, Genki CEO Eddie Tsai went into detail about what he knows about the new Switch reaffirming rumors regarding its larger size, magnetic Joy-Con, and more.</p><p>While there’s a lot of speculation and potential evidence about what the new console will look like, there’s less circulating about what it can actually do. Beyond <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/1/24333491/new-year-new-alleged-switch-2-leak">an alleged photo of the console’s motherboard</a>, there hasn’t been much out there about the console’s hardware specifications. Because Nintendo has never made consoles at the bleeding edge (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23420732/bayonetta-3-review-nintendo-switch">or, honestly, even the cutting one</a>) of graphics or processing power, it’s hard to guess how well the console will perform or what additional features, like a microphone, it’ll have.</p><p>Though the console’s internals remain a mystery, we do know that it’ll be backwards compatible with Switch games. We can also reasonably guess at least one game that’ll be a launch title: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15782806/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-announced-e3-2017"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a>. Announced in 2017, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197164/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-delay-release-date">undergoing a change of studio and a development reboot</a> two years later, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer">Nintendo debuted gameplay footage</a> for the first time last year and shared a soft launch window of 2025. When <em>Twilight Princess</em> launched in 2006, it debuted on both the GameCube and served as a launch title for the Wii. <em>Breath of the Wild</em> was also cross-gen, debuting on the Wii U while launching with the Switch in 2017.</p><div><figcaption>At CES 2025, The Verge saw a 3D printed mockup of the Nintendo Switch 2, here it is next to the Steam Deck.</figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Knowing that the new Switch and <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> both launch in 2025 and with <em>Twilight Princess </em>and <em>BotW</em> as examples, it’s speculated that the reason for <em>Metroid 4</em>’s long stint in development hell was, at least in part, because the game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24050473/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2">was being tooled for both the Switch and its successor.</a> Also, you just can’t have a new Nintendo console without a <em>Mario</em> game. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> was a Switch launch title</a>, and though there’s been other new releases like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Wonder</em></a>, there hasn’t been a new, <em>standalone</em> (put down your pitchforks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22274990/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Bowser’s Fury</em></a> fans) 3D <em>Mario</em> game since then. It’s all but assured one will be announced with the new Switch. The recently announced <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> is also a good launch title candidate as Nintendo curiously worded the game’s debut trailer with “releasing simultaneously worldwide on Nintendo Switch in 2025.”</p><p>For all the rumors and reasonable guesses supported by increasingly convincing evidence, it’s helpful to remember that at the end of the day, we’re still talking about Nintendo. The company has always tread <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276650/nintendo-switch-2-predictions-playtest-alarmo">a separate and unpredictable path</a> from the other two major console manufacturers and that oddball strategy has mostly worked very well. Though the company is <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-nintendo-of-america-laying-off-contractors-ahead-of-switch-2-launch">not immune to the same layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/16/24075174/switch-2-launch-date-rumor-q1-2025">delays</a> (the Switch 2 was originally pegged for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/31/23814298/nintendo-switch-sequel-2024-rumor">a 2024 release</a>) plaguing its peers and indeed has its own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/13/23402344/nintendo-nlrb-complaint-settlement-aston-carter">manifold</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/30/11335284/nintendo-alison-rapp-fired-harassment-denial">issues</a> with how it treats and pays its employees <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/24/23039777/workers-nintendo-third-party-repair-facility-were-reportedly-overwhelmed-with-joy-con-repairs">and contractors</a>, of the major publishers, it seems to be the one that is best navigating the current crisis ravaging the industry.</p><p>It is folly trying to predict what Nintendo will do, and that applies to its new console. All we can count on is that it’s coming soon, and when it arrives, it’ll be big.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Is it a coincidence that Aaron Pierre, the British actor, is everywhere right now and particularly in movies that show his specific talents?  In other words, is Pierre being groomed to be the next secret agent for the British Secret Service (MI6)?</p><p>It’s our theory but please hear us out. In his role as Terry Richmond in the 2024 film “Rebel Ridge,” Pierre proved he has the physical chops to cut it as Bond. </p><p>Just watch this fight scene from the movie and imagine Pierre in a tux instead of casual clothing. He can squabble with the best of them. </p><p>Furthermore, he’s shown that he has the acting chops through his variety of roles. He’s played a badass former marine (“Rebel Ridge”), an enslaved Black man in the 1800s (“<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theroot.com/exclusive-ibram-x-kendi-presents-the-underground-rail-1849040705&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theroot.com/exclusive-ibram-x-kendi-presents-the-underground-rail-1849040705">The Underground Railroad</a></span>”), Malcolm X (“<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theroot.com/heres-why-kelvin-harrison-jr-was-nervous-to-play-mlk-j-1851321412&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theroot.com/heres-why-kelvin-harrison-jr-was-nervous-to-play-mlk-j-1851321412">Genius: MLK/X</a></span>”), and even a lion cub (“Mufasa: The Lion King”).</p><p>The fact that none of these roles are like the other exemplifies his skill set as a movie star. </p><p>Lastly, (and maybe most importantly), he’s got the looks. While it may not be the most important part of being 007, Bond is an infamous lady killer who can have almost any woman he wants. It’s what makes him a flawed and interesting character because oftentimes the women he falls for get him into loads of trouble. If you go on any social media platform, there are thousands of women always fawning over the young man. Just check TikTok daily and several edits highlight his looks.</p><p>Not that he needed our help, since he’s already doing pretty well for himself. But we’ve cast our vote. Pierre is the future of 007.</p><p><em>This story originally appeared on The Root, our sister site, on January 10.</em></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Following Hideo Kojima's departure from Konami, it felt like the Metal Gear Solid series was done, as the Japanese publisher has since only released the multiplayer game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-survive-more-than-expected/">Metal Gear Survive</a>. With the launch of the first series collection last year, however, Konami made it clear that it was time to bring back Big Boss.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is setting out not only to be an extremely faithful remake, but also a prime example of what a proper remake should be. Leaving the original story untouched, the remake of the third entry in the series, which reveals Big Boss' backstory after having been the series' main villain since its inception, will only feature, besides enhanced visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5, quality-of-life improvements that promise to elevate the original stealth gameplay to new heights. If taking down enemies without being seen using everything around you to your advantage is your thing, there will be no better game in 2025 to get than Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater.</p>
<h2>Ghost of Yotei (2025 - PlayStation 5)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ghost-of-yotei-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/">Ghost of Tsushima</a> has been so successful that it was only a matter of time until Sucker Punch Productions brought players back to their beautiful rendition of Feudal Japan. And that time is almost upon us, as Ghost of Yotei will make its debut later this year on PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Very little is known about the second entry in the series, but from the game's reveal trailer, it's clear how Sucker Punch will double down on everything that made the original such a great game: amazing atmosphere, tense duels, stealth gameplay, and a guiding wind that will help Yotei reach her next destination. If her final destination will truly be vengeance remains to be seen, but there's no doubt that the journey through Hokkaido will be well worth it and count among the top action games released in 2025.</p>
<h2>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (2025 - Nintendo Switch)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Metroid-Prime-4-Beyond.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The silence surrounding Metroid Prime 4: Beyond since its announcement has been so deafening that it almost felt like the game would never see the light of day. Thankfully, that was not the case, and the wait for the next first-person adventure of famed bounty hunter Samus Aran is almost over.</p>
<p>Following a development reboot that brought the game back into the hands of series' creator Retro Studios, the fourth entry in the series was finally properly revealed to the world last year with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-first-trailer-release-date/">short gameplay trailer</a> that showed just enough of what fans of the series expected to see. With an oppressive atmosphere, navigational puzzles, and a combat system that will force players to use every tool at their disposal to survive, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond looks like the perfect game to bring Samus back into the spotlight following the release of the excellent Metroid Dread.</p>
<h2>Crimson Desert (Fall 2025 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crimson-Desert_Key-Art_2-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Unlike every other game on this list, <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/">Crimson Desert</a> is a bit of an unknown. While developer Pearl Abyss has proven itself in the MMO space with Black Desert: Online, developing an open-world action-adventure game of this scope is a whole different matter, but from what has been shown so far, it looks like the Korean developer is more than up to the challenge.</p>
<p>Controlling Macduff as he traverses the continent of Pywel, which is going through political turmoil following the death of the Unifier of Lands, players will get to explore tons of different locations, ranging from the plains of Akapen to the cold lands of Kweiden, raid castles, enter dungeons to solve puzzles, befriend allies and fight foes and mythical beasts using a variety of weapons and martial arts techniques, including weapons that usually don't see much representation in games with a fantasy setting such as pistols and hand-mounted cannons, weapons that hint at how the world where Macduff will leave his mark is a lot more complex than what it seems at a glance.</p>
<h2>Grand Theft Auto VI (Fall 2025 - PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GTA-VI-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While 2025 will see the release of some hotly anticipated titles, the excitement surrounding them pales in comparison to the anticipation for Grand Theft Auto VI. This should be hardly surprising for anyone, as it is predicted to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">biggest entertainment launch of all time</a>.</p>
<p>If it were any other game, however, the anticipation for the next entry in the series by Rockstar Games would be completely unjustified, as we have seen very little of the game so far. Still, the return to Vice City together with the criminal duo headed by Lucia promises to be one to remember, as does the parody of contemporary American culture with the dominance of social media and influencer culture, considering what Rockstar Games achieved with its latest open-world game, Red Dead Redemption 2, and how much technology has moved forward since the release of Grand Theft Auto V back in 2013.</p>

            <p>Devil May Cry is coming to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>
<p>That's according to Fortnite leakers Loolo_Wrld and Wensoing, both of whom say the long-running rumours of a Dante-flavoured crossover - which first bubbled up in 2023 - are indeed correct, and there is one in the works.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Whilst both are fairly established leakers in their own rights, their news was picked up and shared by noted Fortnite leaker ShiinaBR, adding credence - if not quite a cast-iron guarantee - to the claims.</p>
<p>When pressed for more information - such as well the collaboration may arrive - Loolo was coy, saying, "I can’t specify anything about that for now", appending the statement with a zipped-mouth emoji.</p>
<p>Wensoing similarly will only commit to "coming soon", but acknowledges that both leakers "have heard about [the Devil May Cry crossover] several times via [their] insiders".</p> <div>

<p>As for the details? Well, that's all still very much up for speculation. There's no doubting that Devil May Cry boasts several iconic outfits and weapons, though, so there's plenty to pick from.</p>
<p>ICYMI, Fortnite Festival, the concert-themed rhythm-action portion of Epic Games' free-to-play jack-of-all-trades juggernaut, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-festival-is-getting-local-co-op-support-rekindling-memories-of-rock-band">getting local co-op support next month</a> - conjuring nostalgic memories of countless evenings spent twanging away in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rock-band">Rock Band</a> with pals.</p>
<p>As Matt reminded us yesterday, Fortnite Festival is the work of Rock Band developer Harmonix - which Epic Games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-acquires-rock-band-developer-harmonix">acquired back in 2021</a> - and is extremely reminiscent of the studio's beloved earlier titles, right down to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rock-band-developer-harmonixs-new-fortnite-music-mode-will-support-instrument-controllers">support for guitar-shaped plastic peripherals</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cdl-minor-i-%E2%80%93-falcons-lag-miami-and-surge-eliminated-on-day-one.1079817/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-minor-i-teams-eliminated-first-day/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Call of Duty League’s first Minor is taking place as we speak, with every pro team coming together to compete for a $20,000 one-shot prize. In the opening round, the first losses were dealt, and as swiftly as they entered, Vegas Falcons, Miami Heretics, LAG M8, and Vancouver Surge were all eliminated from the running.</p>



<p>In a shocking finish, LAG M8 were reverse-swept by Minnesota Rokkr, suffering a huge blow that left LAG sitting on a donut for the season so far – not a single game won.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-expectations-tapered">Expectations Tapered</h2>



<p>LAG M8 has had a rough season thus far. The team, which is made up of three former world champion players and a talented newcomer, has failed to secure a single win against any other CDL squad. In most cases, the team has fallen just a few steps shy of landing a win, but that trend has continued into the Minor.</p>



<p>In the opening fixture for the CDL Major I, LAG M8 went 2 – 0 up after two close finishes, but Rokkr turned things around during the Control with a 3 – 0 result. From there, LAG imploded, getting steamrolled by Rokkr in the second Hardpoint and final S&amp;D round.</p>



<p>The team was understandably muted on social media following the loss:</p>











<p>Elsewhere, the Vegas Falcons were also eliminated from the tournament without winning a single map. It was a tall order, with the team facing off against OpTic Texas in the first round, and despite a valiant effort, the Vegas Falcons were roughly booted from the running.</p>



<p>Sadly, the Falcons boast one of the worst records in CDL history at this point, sitting on a win/loss record of 0 – 5 and a game-win percentage of just 14.2%. OpTic Texas is white hot right now, so you can’t really blame Vegas for the loss.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-next-round">The Next Round</h2>



<p>As we move into the next round, four enormous matches have been lined up:</p>



<ul>
<li>Royal Ravens vs. Cloud 9 NY</li>



<li>Boston Breach vs. OpTic Texas</li>



<li>LA Thieves vs. Atlanta FaZe</li>



<li>Toronto Ultra vs. Minnesota Rokkr</li>
</ul>



<p>The likes of the Ravens, Boston, LAT, and Ultra all earned a bye ahead of the tournament thanks to their performance in the first round of qualifiers. They’re the undoubted power players of the tournament thus far, with the Royal Ravens leading the pack on a perfect record with a 75% game-win record. </p>



<p>LAT and Ultra follow close behind with identical records of 4- 0 and a 70.5% win percentage.</p>



<p>The tournament is warming up, but it won’t last for long. On Sunday evening, the victor will be crowned and they’ll be $20,000 richer.</p>

<p>Following the launch of Marvel Rivals Season 1, several new heroes have been found within the game files, including Professor X.</p>



<p>The findings come courtesy of dataminer <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1877868849728479345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XOX_LEAK</a> on X (formerly Twitter), who has allegedly found references to 5 new heroes within the game files. The five heroes potentially coming to Marvel Rivals are:</p>



<p>Professor X – Support<br>Jia Jing – Support<br>Paste Pot Pete – Damage<br>Colossus – Tank<br>Locus – Support</p>



<p>While it’s currently unclear when, or even if, the heroes will come to the game, the findings following the Season 1 update do suggest that they are being developed as of the time of writing. Whether or not they’ll eventually come to the game or not, though, remains to be seen.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-marvel-rivals-heroes-have-leaked">More Marvel Rivals Heroes Have Leaked</h2>

<li>Deadpool</li>



<li>Captain Marvel&nbsp;</li>

<li>Phoenix/Jean Grey&nbsp;</li>



<li>Modok</li>
</ul>



<p>As of January&nbsp;2025, 37&nbsp;playable characters&nbsp;have been officially announced.</p>



<p>Following the launch of Marvel Rivals Season 1, the game hit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-new-peak-player-count-steam-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">644,269 concurrent players</a>, the highest player count in the game’s history.

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>Let’s see what you’ve been up to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Andrewww</strong> has been prepping for a house move, so gaming has been limited to just a smidgeon of Astro Bot, which was a Christmas present, and a bit of Life Is Strange: Before The Storm.</li>
<li><strong>TSBonyman</strong>, meanwhile has been having a blast of nostalgia with RoboCop: Rogue City. The slow movement works for combat, but less so when doing detective work, but it’s really having the authentic likenesses and actors from the original movies represented that does it.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week. Hope you have a great weekend ahead!</p>

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is set to be released on February 4, bringing a deeply realistic open-world RPG experience to players everywhere. It’s one of the most highly anticipated games of 2025, featuring a widely branching and immersive story that might leave newcomers feeling confused about what’s going on.</p>



<p>With that being said, I’ve pieced together a guide to tackle the topic: ‘Do you need to play Kingdom Come Deliverance first?’ The first game came out in 2018, and the second game is a direct follow-on from that title.</p>



<p>But do you need to play Kingdom Come Deliverance before 2? Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-a-sequel">Is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 a Sequel?</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is a direct sequel to the first game, which was released in 2018. The events of the second game start very soon after the ending of the first title, with the player assuming control of the same protagonist in roughly the same game world.</p>



<p>That means that you might be feeling wary about going into such an expansive story with no idea of what happened in the first title.</p>



<p>Is it worth playing Kingdom Come Deliverance before KCD2, though?</p>



<p>Not necessarily.</p>



<p>In the game’s opening sequences, you’re given a step-by-step introduction to the universe, and Warhorse Studios, the game’s developer, has done a wonderful job of letting you know what happened in the first game while making it seem like a natural walkthrough.</p>



<p>You’ll learn about – or have the option to <strong>choose </strong>– what happened in the first game. Many themes pull across from KCD into KCDII, but if you’re completely new to the series and want to get started with the second game, you won’t feel like a fish out of water.</p>



<p>By itself, KCDII is a perfectly enjoyable game that can be appreciated by anyone who hasn’t played the first title. There are many flashback sequences and conversations that help you piece together the main character’s story before Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-kingdom-come-deliverance-story-real">Is The Kingdom Come Deliverance Story Real?</h2>



<p>Most of the events that unfold in Kingdom Come Deliverance (and the sequel) are true-to-life. The historical figures are mostly real, and the setting is a like-for-like replica of real-world locations. The era has been represented perfectly by Warhorse Studios, which employed scores of experts to make sure everything was as accurate and authentic as possible.</p>



<p>That being said, it’s highly likely Henry of Skalitz <strong>wasn’t</strong> a real person. He’s a fictional rendition created to explore this wonderful world at a turbulent time.</p>

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is set to be released on February 4, and previews are running wild. It’s scoring high in the early impressions – including mine. This open-world RPG from Warhorse Studios is a direct continuation of the 2018 epic, both of which are steeped in history and authenticity.</p>



<p>In this snapshot game guide, I’m answering one key question: ‘Does Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 have photomode?’</p>



<p>Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-there-photomode-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Is There Photomode in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 does have photomode</strong>, but it’s a relatively unassuming, toned-down inclusion.</p>



<p>When you activate photomode in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll be presented with a freecam that you can move around, but that’s about it. There are no options to zoom, tilt, or alter the field of view, and there is no function that allows you to apply filters, or to edit the image in any way.</p>



<p>It’s simple, but it’s <strong>there</strong>.</p>



<p>The first Kingdom Come game, released in 2018, did <strong>not </strong>have a photomode, so users found it awkward to capture shots of the game’s environment. If you played on PC, there was a command to remove the UI, which was the best you could get.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios has gone one step ahead of that in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 by including a basic photomode.</p>



<p>That’s not to say that this is where it ends for the feature, though. The team may enhance the photomode once the game has been released in full on February 4, adding poses, facial expressions, a time of day scroller, and frames. It’s likely not high on the list of pre-release priorities, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-photomode-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">How to Use Photomode in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</h2>



<p>If you’re playing Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 with a controller, simply click both L3 and R3 together to open up the photomode menu.</p>



<p>If you’re playing the game with a keyboard, you need to tap F1 to open the photomode screen, but that can, of course, be rebound at your will.</p>



<p>That’s all there is to it – owing to the simplicity of the feature, there’s not much else to say.</p>
