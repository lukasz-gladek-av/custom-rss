              <p>Lil Wayne makes an unexpected appearance in a very unusual legal fight. <em>Call of Duty</em> is coming to Switch as soon as a few months from now. And one of Ubisoft’s Canadian studios just unionized. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. I’m finalizing my personal game of the year list and I think I’ve almost nailed it. What games do you wish more people had paid attention to this year?</p> <h2>“Okay, you’re a goon, but what’s a goon to a Goblin?? Nothin’. Nothin’. You ain’t scaring nothing.”</h2> <p>That’s how attorney Ray Kim described Aspyr, the company behind a Switch port of <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II</em> that ended up at the center of a very bizarre lawsuit, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/star-wars-kotor-ii-lawsuit-saga"><em>Game File</em> reports</a>. Those are lyrics from Lil Wayne on the track “We Be Steady Mobbin.” Aspyr were the “goons,” per the legal filing in an actual court of law, while the players suing over missing DLC were “the goblins, and they will not be deterred.” The group reached a settlement earlier this month but the long, messy paper trail revealed plenty of other interesting nuggets, including the <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-kotor-old-republic-2-remake-kotor-kotor2-lucasfilm-leak-court-docs-2000651434">existence of an apparent <em>KOTOR 2</em> remake</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Divinity</em>‘s director suggests you might not want to bother with the old games</h2> <p>“If you play [the two <em>Divinity: Original Sin</em> games], you will see things <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845">in [the upcoming] <em>Divinity</em></a> that reference those two,” Swen Vincke <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/theyre-a-bit-outdated-larian-boss-swen-vincke-doesnt-believe-you-should-play-the-older-divinity-games-before-the-new-one-unless-you-want-the-lore/">told <em>GamesRadar</em></a>. “If you played the first <em>Divinity</em>, you will see it referenced properly inside of this <em>Divinity</em>. Ego Draconis, same story, or The Dragon Knight Saga, all of it is being referenced, but it’s just part of the history of what happened in this world, and it helped shape the world to the point where it is now.”</p>

 <p>But if you just want a taste of the lore and came to Larian through the cinematic feel of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, just play <em>Original Sin 2</em>. “If you played because you really enjoy tactical combat or co-op multiplayer or really having lots of freedom, you should definitely play <em>Original Sin 2</em>, because that’s a game that was a blueprint for<em> BG3</em>,” he said.</p>

 <h2><em>Call of Duty</em> will reportedly come to Switch soon</h2> <p>Years after signing an agreement to bring the franchise back to Nintendo’s platforms, the shooter is still MIA. “The first <em>CoD</em> Switch version is nearly done,” <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2003171421879460027">claims</a> <em>Windows Central</em>‘s Jez Corden. He said it’s currently scheduled for a 2026 release, though it’s not entirely clear which form the game will take: a port of an existing sequel or a completely different experience. “We’re committed to getting the franchise on Switch,” a spokesperson for Activision confirmed earlier this year.</p>

 <h2>We almost got <em>Grand Theft Auto: Tokyo</em></h2> <p>Ex-Rockstar North tech director Obbe Vermei, who worked on the franchise’s PS2-era games, said the studio had once looked at setting the open-world formula in cities all across the world, <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>-style. An entry based in Japan was the closest to getting off the ground. “We had ideas about<em> GTA</em> games in Rio de Janeiro, Moscow and Istanbul,” he told <a href="https://www.gameshub.com/news/article/obbe-vermeij-interview-2849146/"><em>Games Hub</em> in a recent interview</a>. “Tokyo almost actually happened. Another studio in Japan were going to do it, take our code and do<em> GTA: Tokyo</em>. But then that didn’t happen in the end.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “People love having these wild ideas but then when you’ve got billions of dollars riding on it, it’s too easy to go ‘let’s do what we know again,’ and also America is basically the epicenter of Western culture, so everybody knows the cities, even people who haven’t been there. They have a mental image of the cities.”</p>

 <h2>A Ubisoft studio in North America just unionized for the first time</h2> <p>Ubisoft Halifax is located in Nova Scotia and works on mobile projects, including <em>Rainbow Six Siege Mobile</em>. The group announced its plan to unionize earlier this year and had a majority vote ratified last week after Ubisoft dropped its initial challenges. “It has started a conversation,” programmer Jon Huffman <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/atlantic/nova-scotia/article/halifax-workers-form-first-ubisoft-union-in-north-america/">told CTV News</a>. “Colleagues have reached out to say it’s a huge surprise. Whether or not they choose to follow, that’s up to them. We’ve shown the way forward, hopefully.”</p> <h2>Bloober Team’s next project name-checks some of the best horror games</h2> <p><strong>“</strong>You have no idea how hard it is for me not to reveal what Project M truly is—but for now, it’s still too early to talk about it. We’re confident that we’ll be able to share the first details very soon,” CEO Piotr Babieno told <em>Nintendo Insider</em>. <strong>“</strong>What I can say is this: fans of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>,&nbsp;<em>Limbo</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Eternal Darkness</em> will immediately feel at home. That said, Project M introduces a bold twist—one that no horror game has ever explored before. This is a vision that could only exist on Nintendo hardware.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-loses-indie-game-awards-after-being-accused-of-lying-about-ai-use-2000655119"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> was stripped of some Indie Game Awards over its use of AI</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-the-old-country-rare-big-game-you-can-finish-weekend-short-aaa-2k-2000655148">More games like <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>, please</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-switch-2s-most-impressive-port-is-75-percent-off-right-now-2000655205"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>‘s super Switch 2 discount was too good to be true</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" src="about:blank" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=2647155999&amp;parent=Kotaku.com"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start"></span></iframe></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-netflix-adaptation-finds-director-johan-renck/</link>
            <guid>1390987</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-netflix-live-action-series-announced-by-ubisoft/">All the way back in 2020</a>, Netflix and Ubisoft announced that they were working on a live-action adaptation of Ubisoft's marquee franchise, Assassin's Creed. For nearly five years after that announcement, the show seemingly didn't make any progress. Though <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-live-action-tv-series-officially-greenlit-by-netflix/">after getting the green light this past July</a>, the show has already begun to find members of its cast, and now, a director.</p>



<p>A report from November <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-assassins-creed-tv-series-casts-toby-wallace-as-co-lead/">confirmed that Toby Wallace would star as one of the co-lead characters in the adaptation</a>, and now a new report from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/assassins-creed-netflix-directed-johan-renck-1236610672/">Variety</a> adds that Johan Renck, the Emmy-winning director best known for his work on Chernobyl, the series created by HBO's The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin, has been tapped to direct Assassin's Creed for Netflix.</p>



<p>The report also adds that, beyond Wallace, Lola Petticrew, Zachary Hart, and Laura Marcus have all joined the cast as regulars for the series, though we don't yet know who any of the actors will be playing as details of the adaptation's plot are being kept quiet for now.</p>



<p>We do know that the series will begin filming in Italy in 2026, and that Italy is also reportedly the geographical setting for the series. The show's logline says the story will be "<em>centred on the secret war between two shadowy factions - one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny</em>."</p>



<p>If you know anything about Assassin's Creed, then you know that the logline does nothing more than outline the basic facts of the game's stories since the first game was released back in 2007. So it seems like we'll be waiting for a while longer before actually learning what era and elements of the Assassin's Creed story the show will lean on.</p>



<p>The series is being led by showrunners Roberto Patino and David Weiner, with Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, Austin Dill, and Genevieve Jones from Ubisoft's film and television department serving as executive producers. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>For nearly five years, I've been on a mission to find a new reality TV show to fill the void left by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/arts/television/terrace-house-suicide.html?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Terrace House</u></em></a>. It's sent me down a perilous spiral of trashy reality dating series and <a href="https://aftermath.site/kiss-or-die-netflix-review-comedy-variety-tv-yakuza-like-a-dragon/"><u>half-baked variety shows</u></a> that weren't worth my finite time on this rock. This nostalgia-fueled trek is one I share with fellow members of the still-active <em>Terrace House</em> subreddit, who, following the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-52782235?ref=aftermath.site"><u>devastating passing of cast member and Stardom wrestler Hana Kimura</u></a> from cyberbullying that led to the show's end, is kept chiefly alive with retrospective support group posts, keeping up with the lives of past cast members, and a grape vine where members to swap recommendations for new shows like <a href="https://aftermath.site/boyfriend-netflix-terrace-house-review/"><em><u>The Boyfriend</u></em></a>, <em>Love Wagon</em>, or Netflix's latest show <em>Badly in Love</em> in hopes that anything might recapture its magic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But the more I watch the newer crop of shows, the clearer it becomes that they keep mistaking volatility for romance, manufacturing blowups with only marginally amusing payoffs. And yet, even at their most chaotic or earnest, none of them has yet to come close to topping <em>Terrace House: Boys &amp; Girls in the City</em>'s infamous omurice incident. A TV moment that still occupies real estate in my frontal lobe.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rTE9W8DW5GI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Netflix - Terrace House Opening theme 2015 Season 1"></iframe></figure><h2 id="what-made-terrace-house-special">What made Terrace House special?</h2><p>One primary reason why <em>Terrace House</em> is often missed as a cultural touchstone is that it was a reality show that didn’t revolve around dramatic meet-cutes, romance, or a constant stream of contestants getting eliminated. Instead, the show’s premise centered on a group of young creatives—artists, models, fashion entrepreneurs, and musicians—cohabiting in lavish yet cozy Japanese houses. It's a show that brought prominence to artists like <a href="https://x.com/LaLaChuu/status/1938345071440761271?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Lauren Tsai</u></a>, a card-carrying Kojima Productions' scanned celebrity featured in <em>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</em>, and Avian Ku, the fashion entrepreneur whose mother's store, 88tees, was prominently featured in <em>Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em>, which was first given worldwide prominence from her time on the show.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P1LNrzr8JzM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="terrace house fans"></iframe></figure><p>Rather than being a reality series tightly controlled to manufacture big moments like<em> Love Island</em>, the participants stayed in the house as long as they wanted, leaving when they felt ready to embark on the next stage of their lives, whether that was romance or career. This approach created a more relaxed pace and fostered deeper engagement beyond superficial aesthetics and the sensationalism typically seen in reality TV, such as my current gyaru-meets-yankii reality TV vice, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1xgX5E8wBo&amp;%3Bpp=ygUVYmFkbHkgaW4gbG92ZSBuZXRmbGl4&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Badly in Love</u></em></a>, which sensationalizes romance under the tight constraints of just two weeks. So far, its incidents, which have more often led to helicopter production management where even the hints of friction, like joking about smoking a joint or splashing water on each other, has led to folks getting kicked off the show or sternly warned (despite the premise of them being "bad boys" and "bad bitches" as a selling point). While romance was undoubtedly on the table on <em>Terrace House</em>, that was never its primary focus, so when it was, it was always worth investing in, regardless of whether it lasted beyond the confines of the show. And the zenith of the show's romance and drama, for <em>Terrace House</em> and all of reality TV, is the omurice incident.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="the-omurice-incident">The omurice incident&nbsp;</h2><p>At the center of the omurice incident was fashion model Minori Nakada and hair stylist Tatsuya Uchihara. The two had feelings for each other. The only problem is that the latter spent forever refusing to own up to it. So, one morning, while making omurice—a technical egg-over-rice omelet staple in Japanese cuisine—Minori set aside a special bowl for "Uchi" to eat later. Only, instead of writing a cutesy message or illustration in ketchup as the dish is wont to have, she wrote "coward."</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p><span>"Please eat and enjoy." (Image: Netflix)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>It was a declaration of love and war that she'd later <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kee-kee&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>kee-kee</u></a> with her roommates, who thought it was "perfect." After spending the better part of 14 episodes confiding in her roommates about how their romance had yet to take off, they wondered what he'd think of the passive-aggressive callout, saying "He'll think it's cute, but I'm sure it'll hit a sore spot" like "an arrow going through."</p><p>After cleaning his bowl and scratching his head with a faraway look in his eyes, Uchi finally mustered up the courage to knock on the door of the girls' room—a watershed moment for any and every scene in <em>Terrace House</em>— to chat with Minori. After failing to woo her with the old "lifting her chin" maneuver to seal their romance with a kiss to prove her wrong (everyone laughed in embarrassment), the girls cleared the room for an honest "what are we?" chat. It, too, failed to spark a conversation, leading him to leave the room and hash it out with his boys. The show's reaction panel of celebrities found their whole pussyfooting/ egging on of each other equal parts cute and lame. They also immediately (and rightfully) dubbed the moment "a legendary omurice."</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p><span>(Image: Netflix)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>This whole debacle ended with them finding each other and confessing their feelings, before turning an awkward handshake into the kiss that Uchi failed his QTEs on earlier, beginning their love life. Are they dating now? Fuck no. But this polite bit of mild romantic friction is still the best thing committed in reality TV by a long shot, closely followed by the show's equally infamous meat incident, which has led to <a href="https://blubbyweb.com/2020/01/26/the-terrace-house-meat-incident-an-entire-essay-on-why-uchis-anger-was-justified/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>whole essays being written about it</u></a>.</p><p>For me, the omurice incident is up there with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-bowl-ad-japanese-commercial-sakeru-candy-long-man-1850088438?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Long Long Man Sakeru gum commercials</u></a> as a stim that triggers the happy chemical in my brain whenever I reminisce about them. Hopefully, one day I'll come across a reality TV show that carries the same kind of awkward/wholesome, romantic bumble-king antics. But until then, the omurice incident remains king.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>You’ve never quite experienced a racing game the way it was meant too be played without a racing wheel. The Logitech G29 Driving Force Racing Wheel and Floor Pedals is the perfect way to feel like you’re actually in the car driving. And it’s on sale right now!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5725/">You can get your own Logitech G29 Driving Force Racing Wheel and Floor Pedals right now at Amazon for $199.99, which represents a savings of $130.01 and 39% off.</a> That means it’s the best time to go ahead and get yours so you can enjoy your racing games to the fullest.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5725/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A sturdy racing wheel perfect for all your gaming adventures</h2>
<p>The steering wheel has a nice grip and provides good rotational response, making it easier to turn into corners and making it feel more natural while playing racing games. In addition to having dual motor force feedback that simulates road feel, terrain changes and resistance when the driver pushes the limits of the vehicle, the Logitech G29 is able to provide an added sense of immersion in racing games by providing a tangible sense of feedback when the user is interacting with the virtual vehicle.</p>
<p>The pedals are made of high-quality material and provide the same level of resistance as you would experience with a real vehicle’s acceleration and braking system. With the separate location of each pedal and the placement of the pedals being similar to those found in a real vehicle, the pedals provide a realistic driving experience. Whether you are using the pedals to accelerate quickly down a long straightway or to slow down gently into a sharp corner, the pedals react smoothly to the input of the user.</p>



<p>This is a sturdily-built racing wheel, too. You’re not paying for flimsy garbage. It’s capable of standing up to the rigors of many hours of gameplay, which is good if you end up playing a lot of racing titles at home. When driving aggressively around corners, the wheel doesn’t flex or move in a way that makes driving difficult, and the pedals remain firmly in place underfoot. It doesn’t feel cheap, even though you’ll be saving some serious money on it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5725/">Really, we can’t complain about the Logitech G29. It’s a great pick for anyone who wants to level up their sim racing experience.</a> Since you can get it for a great price right now, you should go ahead and add it to your setup for an even better time out on the digital road. And if you know someone who wants to start getting into racers, now’s the time to get a set with a racing wheel to gift them, even if it arrives after the holidays.</p>

<p>Epic Games may have wrapped up for Christmas, but there is still one more treat in store for players with the release of an IShowSpeed Icon Series skin tomorrow, leaks state.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s huge string of collabs has continued for the festive season, with the likes of Hatsune Miku, Sabrina Carpenter, Harry Potter, and SpongeBob SquarePants joining the game, and there’s set to be another Icon Series skin on Christmas Eve.</p>







<h2 id="h-ishowspeed-coming-to-fortnite">IShowSpeed Coming to Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Flipping onto the scene. Image via YouTube</figcaption></figure>



<p>Reports of a new Icon Series coming to Fortnite first came from <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/2003471578747797877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpushFNBR</a>, who speculated that it would be IShowSpeed receiving the special treatment, and other established leaks, including <a href="https://x.com/FireMonkey/status/2003467431260385310" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FireMonkey</a>, stated that it would indeed be the popular streamer who joins the Icon Series gang.</p>



<p>Rumors of an IShowSpeed skin in Fortnite started to emerge after the streamer responded to a question asking what his stream scheduled for December 24th would be about, which he stated would see him “go back to my first stream ever.”</p>



<p>IShowSpeed’s first stream was playing Fortnite, and his comments now align with the leaks of a new treat that will be added to the Item Shop just in time for Christmas.</p>



<p>However, while the collab will include the usual Outfits, Back Blings, Pickaxes, Gliders, and even a Jam Track, there won’t be any emotes in the bundle, a decision that will raise eyebrows considering the huge amount of popular memes IShowSpeed has become famous for, including his barking, backflip, and imitation of Cristiano Ronaldo’s Siu celebration.</p>



<p>Official confirmation of the Icon Series addition and pricing of the individual items and the bundle have yet to be revealed, with it likely that it will be Speed himself that unveils the skin, following the trend showcased with previous reveals in the past.</p>

            <p>A key former member of the Grand Theft Auto team has said Rockstar toyed with ideas for many non-American settings for the series, including the capital cities Tokyo, Rio, Moscow and Istanbul.</p>
<p>Of them, Tokyo apparently came the closest to being realised. "We had ideas about GTA games in Rio de Janeiro, Moscow and Istanbul. Tokyo almost actually happened," Obbe Vermeij, former technical director at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-north">Rockstar North</a>, who worked on GTA 3, Vice City, San Andreas and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>, told <a href="https://www.gameshub.com/news/article/obbe-vermeij-interview-2849146/">GamesHub</a>. "Another studio in Japan were going to do it, take our code and do GTA: Tokyo. But then that didn't happen in the end.</p>
<p>"People love having these wild ideas," Vermeij added, "but then when you've got billions of dollars riding on it it's too easy to go let's do what we know again, and also America is basically the epicenter of Western culture, so everybody knows the cities, even people who haven't been there. They have a mental image of the cities.</p>
<p>"I think it's unlikely it's going to be in Bogota next time, especially since there's just more and more money involved as the project gets bigger. It doesn't make sense to set it in some leftfield location for novelty. GTA: Toronto? It just wouldn't work."</p>

<p>I wonder if the Torontonians and Bogotanos know they live in leftfield cities...?</p>
<p>Jokes aside, GTA has rarely, if ever, been set outside of US-adjacent cities, with most of the games based in and around Los Santos (loosely Los Angeles), Liberty City (loosely New York), and Vice City (loosely Miami). There was once a London-themed expansion for Grand Theft Auto 1, set in the year 1969, but that's as close as it got.</p>
<blockquote><em>"I'm afraid we're stuck in this loop of about five American cities. Let's just get used to it"</em></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-did-grand-theft-auto-never-return-to-london-as-a-setting-one-of-the-biggest-reasons-was-guns">Rockstar co-founder and former GTA lead writer Dan Houser recently explained</a> that the series kept coming back to cities like Miami and New York and Los Angeles because they're melting pots of activity, where extreme wealth rubs against extreme poverty, and where glitz, glamour and organised crime can all be found. Other major cities might have that, but do they also have one other key ingredient - guns?</p>
<p>"You needed guns," Houser said, "you needed these larger-than-life characters. It just felt like the game was so much about America, possibly from an outsider's perspective, but that was so much about what the thing was that it wouldn't have really worked in the same way elsewhere."</p>

<p>When pushed on whether the series might ever be set in Europe, Obbe Vermeij answered, "It’s just not realistic. I would love it, and if games still took a year to make then yeah sure, you can have a little fun, but you're not going to get that when there's a GTA every 12 years.</p><p>"You're not going to set it in a new location. You don't really need to either because the technology changes so much. Nobody is going to say that they're not going to play GTA 6 because they've already played Vice City. That doesn't make sense. It's completely different.</p>
<p>"They'll revisit New York again. They'll go back to LA or maybe Las Vegas," Vermeij added. "I'm afraid we're stuck in this loop of about five American cities. Let's just get used to it."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6 will take us back to fictional Miami</a>, or Vice City as it's called, but in the present day rather than the 80s, as in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-vice-city">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</a>. GTA 6 will tell a story based around dual protagonists Lucia Caminos and Jason Duval, marking the first time a GTA game has had a playable female lead. GTA 6 will be released in November next year.</p>

            <p>EA shareholders have approved <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">the proposed $55bn acquisition</a> of the video game giant by Saudi Arabia and private equity firms, leaving only the US government in the way of what would be the largest corporate buyout of all time.</p>
<p>This acquisition, first announced back in September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-almost-entirely-owned-by-saudi-arabia-sale">would leave EA 93.4 percent owned by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund</a>, a government wealth fund used to build infrastructure, attract businesses to Saudi Arabia, and more.</p>
<p>Critics of the fund and of this proposed deal argue that it's also used for washing the country's reputation, as Saudi Arabia has been heavily criticised over the years for human rights abuses.</p>

<p>This acquisition would be made if approved with the assistance of Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, the latter founded and owned by Jarred Kushner - son-in-law to President Donald Trump. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-acquires-warner-bros-in-827bn-deal-including-studios-behind-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy">This same firm was also involved in the hostile takeover attempt of Warner Bros Discovery</a> earlier this month, though it reportedly pulled back amidst criticism of Kushner's involvement.</p><p>It is worth noting that the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabias-investment-fund-reportedly-low-on-cash-and-limiting-investment-following-ea-acquisition">will be a little low on cash after this acquisition if it goes through</a>, perhaps marking the end of the spending spree its been doing over the past few years.</p>

			<p>The process of EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/">going private and selling to a 'Consortium' of investors, which includes the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Jared Kushner's Silver Lake</a>, has just crossed its first hurdle. As initially reported by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3mamalgryks2m">Stephen Totilo at Game File</a>, EA's shareholders have voted to approve the sale of EA to the Consortium.</p>



<p>Now, the privatization sale has to be approved by government regulators, a process which, if <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-aims-to-close-activision-blizzard-acquisition-next-friday/">Microsoft's journey to acquiring Activision Blizzard King is any indication</a>, will take longer than a few months, considering that EA announced the sale back in September and shareholders have already approved it before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Particularly because after one major video game industry acquisition made government regulators around the world pay more attention to the industry, we could see EA's deal face more scrutiny from global regulators. There have <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Secretary-Bessent-re-Electronic-Arts.pdf">already been voices of concern from US senators</a> in letters to the Secretary of the Treasury over the deal, alleging that the sale could allow for "<em>the Saudi government’s ability to exert its influence through EA would offer the authoritarian regime an effective tool to project power worldwide</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We urge you and the Committee to apply searching scrutiny to this unprecedented, proposed foreign privatization of a major American technology and entertainment company</em>," the letter reads.</p>



<p>It's not just within the US that voices of concern over the deal are being raised. <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2025/12/12/cwa-canada-urges-competition-bureau-to-scrutinize-55-billion-electronic-arts-buyout/">CWA Canada is also asking Canada's competition regulators to scrutinize the deal closely</a>, with concerns shared for the Canadian developers EA employs at its Canadian-based studios, including Motive, EA Vancouver, and BioWare.</p>



<p>While the US senators' letter to the Secretary of the Treasury voiced concerns over foreign influence, CWA Canada's letter to the Canadian Competition Bureau shared more concerns about the job losses and layoffs that could result from the sale. </p>



<p>"<em>Relatedly, the transaction could lead to reductions in jobs in Canadian labor markets. EA has said publicly that the deal would not lead to “immediate” layoffs, but with the deal being financed with US$20 billion in debt, some analysts suggest layoffs are one of the key ways the company will seek to cut costs in order to service its massive debt. Layoffs could further consolidate and concentrate existing labor markets for video game workers in Canada. Our concerns are compounded by the company’s history of recent layoffs: EA has laid off over 1,700 workers since 2023</em>."</p>



<p>We're still a long way off from this deal going through; like the Microsoft-Activision Blizzard King deal, we'll likely be hearing about it for well over a year before it is finalized, if it does indeed end up happening.</p>



<p>If it doesn't go through, then we'll likely return to a status quo in the video game industry. If it does, then the Saudi Arabia PIF will own 93.4% of EA, with the other Consortium investors vying for the remaining 6.6%. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-usb-c-charging-station-250w-6-port-gets-a-surprise-christmas-price-drop-lowest-price-ever-this-holiday-season-2000655257</link>
            <guid>1390939</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="76" data-end="622">Running out of outlets is a familiar problem in homes, dorms, and offices alike. With phones, laptops, tablets, earbuds, and smartwatches all needing regular charging, it often feels like your devices are battling for the one free socket on the wall. Deciding whether to charge your phone or your laptop shouldn’t be a daily dilemma. While you could hunt down another outlet across the room, that solution is inconvenient and far from ideal. A better approach is using a powerful, multi-device charging station that can handle all of your stuff at once.</p>
<p data-start="624" data-end="1020">The Anker Prime 250W USB-C Charger is designed to solve this exact issue. Built to charge multiple devices quickly and efficiently, this high-capacity charging station eliminates the need to juggle plugs or carry around several bulky adapters. Even better, it’s currently available at a significant discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6570/">Normally priced at $170, it can now be purchased for just $100, representing a 41% savings.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6570/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="624" data-end="1020">Universal Compatibility</h2>
<p data-start="1022" data-end="1612">It works seamlessly with a wide range of devices, from Samsung smartphones and JBL earbuds to Apple Watches and MacBooks. The charging station includes multiple ports to accommodate different needs, featuring four USB-C ports and two USB-A ports. When a single USB-C port is used on its own, it can deliver up to 140 watts of power. That’s enough to fully charge a smartphone at impressive speeds or quickly replenish larger devices. A 16-inch MacBook Pro can reach 50% battery in roughly 25 minutes starting from zero.</p>
<p data-start="1614" data-end="2031">One feature of note is its adjustable power delivery system. An integrated LED display shows exactly how much power each port is providing, giving users clear visibility into their charging setup. A smart control dial on the side allows you to manually prioritize specific ports, making it easy to redirect more power to a device that needs to charge quickly—perfect for last-minute phone top-offs before heading out.</p>


<p data-start="2033" data-end="2350">Beyond performance, the charger also helps reduce desk and workspace clutter. With multiple charging ports built directly into one compact unit, there’s no need for extra wall adapters or power bricks. Everything plugs into one centralized station, keeping your setup clean and organized without taking up much space.</p>
<p data-start="2352" data-end="2725">Safety is another area where Anker excels. The charger is equipped with ActiveShield 3.0 technology and meets the latest safety standards. This system monitors temperature 80 times per second—over six million checks per day—to prevent overheating and protect connected devices. It’s twice as responsive as the previous ActiveShield 2.0, offering even greater peace of mind.</p>
<p data-start="2727" data-end="2940" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6570/">For a limited time, the Anker Prime 250W USB-C Charger is available at 41% off, dropping the price from $170 to just $100.</a> For anyone tired of outlet battles and slow charging speeds, this deal is hard to pass up.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anime Final Quest Codes (December 2025)]]></title>

<p>Use these Roblox Anime Final Quest monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including cash, draws and much more.</p>



<p>Anime Final Quest is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-universal-tower-defense-codes/">Roblox</a> action RPG where players take on story missions, fight enemies inspired by popular anime worlds, and build a powerful roster of characters. Instead of running a business or placing structures, players spend their time clearing stages, defeating enemies, and tackling bosses to unlock stronger fighters. Team composition matters heavily, as different characters bring unique skills and strengths to battles.</p>







<p>Progression in this Roblox game depends on resources earned through quest completion, daily activities, and special events. These materials are primarily used for character summons, enhancements, and evolutions that increase overall team power. While steady play rewards consistent progress, redeemable codes provide a shortcut by granting free currency and bonuses, allowing players to summon more characters and strengthen their lineup without sinking hours into repetitive grinding.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-anime-final-quest-codes">How To Get More Anime Final Quest Codes</h2>



<p>Anime Final Quest codes are most commonly shared through the game’s official Discord server, the Roblox game page, and occasionally on the developer’s social media channels. The Discord community is particularly active, with developers frequently posting new codes. Therefore, the best place to find new codes is the Anime Final Quest Discord. However, tracking all these platforms can be challenging, especially since there’s no alert system to notify players when codes expire.</p>



<p>Therefore, we recommend bookmarking this guide in your browser, as it is regularly updated with the latest codes and removes expired ones promptly, ensuring you always have access to valid codes.</p>

<p>During a new interview, Bloober Team’s CEO revealed some minor details about their Nintendo-exclusive game, Project M. </p>



<p>Bloober Team’s CEO discussed several topics, including bringing Cronos: The New Dawn to Nintendo Switch 2, considering the possibility of their other games coming to the new console, and more. He also revealed that the mysterious Project M is only possible on Nintendo hardware. </p>



<h2 id="h-project-m-has-a-twist-that-no-horror-game-has-explored-yet">Project M has a Twist that No Horror Game has Explored Yet</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.nintendo-insider.com/bloober-team-nintendo-switch-2-interview-ports-ue5-remake-ceo-piotr-babieno/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Insider</a>, Bloober Team’s CEO, Piotr Babieno, was asked what players should expect from the Nintendo-exclusive horror game, Project M. Babieno responded, stating that it is very tough for him “not to reveal what Project M truly is—but for now, it’s still too early to talk about it.” However, the developers are confident that they will be able to share the first details “very soon”. </p>



<p>Babieno provided some additional details before wrapping up the Project M topic. The CEO revealed that fans of Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Limbo, and Eternal Darkness will feel immediately at home with this game. Project M will introduce “a bold twist,” which is something that “no horror game has explored before.” Lastly, the “vision” for this game “could only exist on Nintendo hardware”, concluded the Bloober CEO. </p>



<p>In other news, Cronos: The New Dawn will receive an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-getting-a-new-difficulty-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">easier difficulty option</a> in early 2026.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, GTA 6 may still be a while away, but that gives us plenty of time to go back and replay all of those Rockstar games we’ve loved from the past, or even check out some that we may have missed. But which parts of the famed Grand Theft Auto developers’ library should you prioritise first? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, we’ve gone ahead and ranked our favourite Rockstar games. From school-yard antics to tragic tales on the American frontier, here are the 10 best Rockstar games. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>10. Manhunt</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/manhunt-1764780304845.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For a studio that’s no stranger to causing controversy due to the contents of its games,  arguably none of Rockstar’s negative press surrounding GTA has come close to the furore that followed Manhunt. A stealth-action horror game in which you play as a death row inmate forced into partaking in a series of snuff films for the disembodied voice of a pre-Succession Brian Cox, it maybe shouldn’t have been a surprise that it garnered horrified reactions from the mainstream media, resulting in it being banned in several countries.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the controversy only tells half of the story, because Manhunt is a good game, and a singular one in Rockstar’s library (although we don’t talk about its inferior sequel). A disturbing satire of the USA’s fascination with violence, it's undeniably gnarly, but smartly psychological in its approach. Linear hallways create a very specific kind of tension that so many of the studio’s other works simply can’t due to their open-world nature. The result is tight, focused, and brutal action that works to horrifying effect. Well over 20 years old now, Manhunt has stuck long in the memory… although maybe that’s mostly due to how its stark box art staring out from store shelves scared the absolute crap out of me as a child. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>9. GTA 3</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/gta-3-1764780346882.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Very few games have charted the future of game development quite like Grand Theft Auto 3. The open world of Liberty City plays host to a twisting story of gang warfare, drug running, and betrayal in the series' first 3D entry. To say it broke new ground is an understatement, and the additional dimension and shift to a street-level camera is only the start of it. The PlayStation 2 had seen nothing of the like in terms of an immersive city sandbox full of opportunity. Its bounty of side missions and minigames blended with a main story that allowed for Rockstar to flex its storytelling chops like never before, telling the tale of Claude’s search for the truth through a cinematic lens and an all-star cast to match the story’s mob movie-inspired ambition (The Sopranos alumni Frank Vincent and Joe Pantoliano included). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 3’s slice of fictional New York may seem like a small map to wander around in these days, but gradually unlocking its three islands, each with its own East Coast flavouring, felt like a miracle at the time. Yes, the repetitive, simplistic mission design and less-than-desirable vehicle handling may not have aged anything close to gracefully since its 2001 launch, but an engaging story and compelling (if archetypal) characters are still there to be seen. It’s still worth playing today to see where the roots of what GTA (and a dozen other open-world games) sprouted from.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>8. Bully</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/bully-1764780403659.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Bully has often been described as “GTA, but in a school”, and to an extent, that’s exactly what it is. By substituting shotguns for slingshots and muscle cars for go-karts, it hits the right spot for anyone looking to wreak havoc at a private New England boarding school instead of running drugs across a fictional Miami or Los Angeles. The source of that havoc is Jimmy Hopkins, a troubled 15-year-old with a history of educational expulsions. Tasked with navigating a year at Bullworth Academy, a variety of classroom minigames, various clique quests, and hallway politics all serve to tell Bully’s story – one full of teenage charm and typical Rockstar social commentary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skating or cycling around the academy and its suburban surroundings is a delight, with memorable landmarks like a colourful funfair or the looming Happy Volts Asylum filling a sizable map that changes mood with the seasons as the story unfolds. This world is the result of Rockstar adapting the GTA formula for an unfamiliar, unconventional setting – look a little closer, and you’ll see well-worn mechanics twisted to fit school life (for example, attending lessons late risks the fury of teachers and prefects, which is Bully’s version of the Wanted system). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bully is admittedly a little janky to play today, thanks to a less-than-robust camera and over-reliance on quicktime events, but it's still a very fun time. And maybe if we’re really lucky, when Rockstar is done with GTA 6, we’ll get that sequel we’ve all wanted for almost 20 years now. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>7. GTA 4</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/gta-4-1764780551132.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a strong argument for Niko Bellic being the strongest of all the GTA protagonists – something I’d likely agree with. Whether all of GTA 4 stands as tall around him is up for further debate. 2008’s return to Liberty City took on the surprisingly bleak issues of the American Dream and what it means to be an immigrant in the modern Western world. It’s a story that delivers for the most part, providing a surprising amount of mature depth for a studio whose tales have historically been approached from a more pulpy angle. The city itself was a revelation for the time, packing a varied amount of detailed sights and sounds, even if in hindsight its visuals replicate the brown-grey blur that so many games from the Xbox 360 era suffer from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s in objective design and general gameplay that GTA 4 is let down, though, which, for the most part, is a lot of driving people from A to B and assassinating single targets. Well, aside from the fantastic Three Leaf Clover bank heist mission, that is, which would go on to inspire the central hook of GTA 5. There’s no denying the longevity of Niko as a character, though, and the very real, grounded struggles he battles throughout his story. We certainly understand why he’d really rather go bowling with his cousin…</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>6. GTA Vice City</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/vice-city-1764780588552.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There are few video game locations as iconic as Vice City. Its neon-drenched roads, soundtracked by an all-timer collection of ‘80s hits, served as the setting for many people’s core memories of the PS2. Rockstar’s time-traveling trip back to the 1980s is anchored by protagonist Tommy Vercetti, played fantastically by Goodfellas’ Ray Liotta. Released only a year after the game-changing GTA 3, it’s remarkable how much of a step up Vice City achieved in just 12 months, not just in its star-studded cast and characterful storytelling, but also in the way its design injected life into every corner of its proxy Miami. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">An engaging story filled with Scarface parallels brought with it a new sense of excess, which lent a blockbuster style to a series that was, in many ways, still finding its feet. Those early days are evident in the relatively shonky controls and dated mission design –  during the campaign’s twilight hours, your attempts to wrestle control of businesses and balance money-making plates across the city don’t quite support the more ballistic ambition of the story. That doesn’t take away from Vice City’s overall charm, though; it remains a landmark piece of Rockstar history. And we can’t wait to go back to those beaches and clubs next year in GTA 6.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>5. Max Payne 3</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/max-payne-3-1764780695224.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar decided to take Max Payne in-house for its third entry, having published the first two Remedy-developed games. Perhaps unsurprisingly, leaving Max’s Finnish creatives behind resulted in an entirely different tone, but one that is equally as thrilling. Gone are the pulpy comic book panels, melodramatic monologues, and moonlit greys of neo-noir New York, replaced by sensory overload thanks to blinding sunlight, dancefloor bullet ballets, and a now-synonymous soundtrack composed by Health. Building on the bullet-time foundations that propelled the series to success in a post-Matrix world, Max Payne 3 transports the tortured ex-NYPD officer to Brazil in the midst of a gritty gang war that leads to a larger conspiracy that’s bleaker than anything Sam Lake would have cooked up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The decision to target societal ills reflects the difference between Rockstar and Remedy as developers – the former is always willing to take swipes at nations and their ingrained domestic problems, whereas the latter looks inwards for more cerebral tales of individual struggle. Both are valid, and both work in the world of Max Payne, which means all three entries are fantastic in their own way. They all share one thing in common, however: that unrivalled power trip of triggering that bullet time, leaping backwards through the air, and raining dual Uzi fire down on anyone standing in your way. Delicious.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>4. GTA San Andreas</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/san-andreas-1764780732818.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If the jump between GTA 3 and Vice City was big, then the chasm between Vice City and San Andreas requires industrial machinery to measure. In just two years, Rockstar had taken all of its previous Grand Theft Auto learnings, plus several huge swings, and blended them all together to concoct its first version of California. This vast (at least by PS2 standards) state is home to multiple cities that steadily unlock as you progress through its story. The road trip between them conveys a great sense of scale, as does the incredibly varied mission design and extensive cast of characters you meet during your tenures in each metropolis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It isn’t just the sheer size that’s impressive, but also the gambles Rockstar took when it came to gameplay. San Andreas features elements pilfered from the RPG and life-sim genres, allowing you to sculpt your character and customise their appearance, adjusting their physique depending on how many weights you lift or Cluckin’ Bell buckets you feast on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, of course, there’s CJ himself, a protagonist who lives on beyond the meme that follows him like a shadow. Authentically brought to life by rapper Young Maylay, his story is one of redemption and survival that pits him against some of the series' most memorable adversaries, chief among them being Samuel L. Jackson’s despicable Officer Tenpenny. It all comes together to make one of Rockstar’s greatest games, and the best GTA of the PS2 era.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>3. Red Dead Redemption</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/red-dead-1764780819709.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar had been displaying cinematic ambitions for many years before Red Dead Redemption’s arrival in 2010, so it was only natural that it would one day tackle one of the most fundamentally filmic of genres: the western. Taking heavy influence from the likes of The Wild Bunch, Red Dead’s cross-continent tale of an outlaw coming to terms with being the last of his kind takes fan-favourite John Marston to Mexico and back as he hunts down his former mentor, Dutch Van Der Linde. It’s a more rural setting than we’d previously come to expect from a Rockstar open-world, allowing for those cinematic flourishes to take hold and present an impressive artistic achievement. Bustling city streets made way for dusty canyons, and a stunning Woody Jackson score filled the space once dominated by constant radio chatter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Dead Redemption’s slower pace allows for the story to play out elegantly, with Marston’s near-invisible foe hanging menacingly in the background, patiently awaiting their memorable snow-covered face-off. Then there’s the ending, which I’d never spoil here for those who’ve never had a chance to witness it, but safe to say it's lived long in the memory as one of video games’ most impactful finales in the 15 years since. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The road to that point is paved by some admittedly fairly routine mission design and a lot of horse riding, but there’s still enough personality in its dead-eye shooting system and endlessly fun minigames (liar’s dice, here’s looking at you) to allow for Red Dead Redemption to age very gracefully. It lives on as one of Rockstar’s three finest achievements.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>2. GTA 5</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/gta-5-1764780856019.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto 5 is a blockbuster in every sense of the word. Not just because of the colossal number of copies it’s sold, nor the amount of money it cost to make, but because of every aspect of its design. It wears excess proudly on its sleeve, reflected in the drive for money displayed by each of its three protagonists. This greed – itself Rockstar’s clearest criticism of capitalism and the obnoxious characters it produces – comes to a head in GTA 5’s signature heist missions, each a series of audacious action set pieces battling to upstage one another. These campaign highpoints blend in seamlessly with a Los Santos map bustling with life and teeming with charm – Rockstar’s signature humour oozes out of every sight and sound, from street corner billboards to radio station ramblings. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This sandbox has kept fans entertained ever since its construction in 2013, and thanks to the addition of GTA Online, it has expanded and improved consistently to this day. It’s created a whole new ecosystem for players to live in, take on increasingly complex heists, and even build race tracks that stretch and loop into the sky. It truly is its own ridiculous beast. But while it may be that expansive multiplayer mode that led to GTA 5’s enormous success, it’s Michael, Franklin, and Trevor’s story that has proven to have the most staying power, at least for us. It’s the best that a Grand Theft Auto campaign has ever been, and that has us excited to see how Rockstar will try to top it with GTA 6.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>1. Red Dead Redemption 2</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/red-dead-2-1764780956736.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The culmination of all Rockstar’s work to date, Red Dead Redemption 2 took living, breathing video game worlds to the next level when it was released in 2018. The level of detail in its sprawling frontier is extraordinary, with every creature, both animal and human, reacting authentically to your every movement. This makes each interaction with these digital personalities feel astonishingly lifelike. This expertly crafted, turn-of-the-century western America is the stage for a whole host of memorable characters, both quirky and dangerous, but none stick in the mind as firmly as protagonist Arthur Morgan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">His journey represents the peak of Rockstar storytelling, displaying a level of complexity and nuance simply not present in any of the studio’s other games. The Van Der Linde gang’s trials and tribulations lead to a memorable set of dangerous missions thanks to the increasing desperation of its leader, Dutch. It’s a tale laden with standout chapters – a turf war between the Gray and Braithwaite families leads up to a manor house siege, a blockbuster bank heist in the major city of Saint Denis leads to an unexpected sojourn to the island of Guarma, and tensions between the native Wapiti Indians and American Army lead to flame-soaked shootouts. It would be hard to pick a single favourite from that list. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a vast, epic tapestry steeped in cinematic style, and the best game Rockstar has given us yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

            <guid>1390927</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> is a multiplayer extraction adventure in which players scavenge the remnants of a devastated world. The main threat is Arc’s machines and, as developer Embark Studios puts it, “the unpredictable choices of fellow survivors.” But one Arc Raiders player, hell bent on killing relative newcomers, casuals, and those who have next to no loot or even none at all, has gone viral for killing others for sport — sparking a debate about what is and isn’t acceptable PvP behavior in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with a brief primer on how Arc Raiders works. You can play solo or in parties up to three, working as a team to progress through the game. However, other players are a constant threat, and while Arc Raiders’ explosive launch has seen a number of wholesome, viral clips of players coming together to help each other out, some players just want to watch the world burn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taylor "THump" Humphries, a retired American professional H1Z1 and Apex Legends player, who has taken it upon themselves to hunt down teams of players and kill them for, well, sport. In a clip viewed 4.8 million times so far on Twitter / X, THump kills a group of players, one of whom pleads: “we just started. I have nothing.” THump is then called “scum” and “a piece of s**t.” THump responds to say: “yeah, I killed every single one of you by the way.” He then laughs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">THump‘s post reads: “I love killing grown men that have jobs and children as they are trying to get 5 million credits for the expedition. Killing all teamers in solos, live now.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I love killing grown men that have jobs and children as they are trying to get 5 million credits for the expedition. Killing all teamers in solos, live now.<a href="https://t.co/hiY3uPb3e7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/hiY3uPb3e7</a> <a href="https://t.co/ncHTgNMT1x" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ncHTgNMT1x</a></p>— THUMP (@THump) <a href="https://twitter.com/THump/status/2001729907760730180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The post sparked a strong reaction from a large group of players, some of whom hit out at THump‘s actions, some of whom backed him up. “I come from a place where PvP is not optional,” THump said. “It’s a way of life. You want optional PvP go play WoW.” Then: “couldn’t imagine spending my Friday night getting mad at a random streamer on the internet enough to comment under his tweet because he killed people in a PvP game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Another toxic streamer,” one critic posted. “You should try helping them instead, it might make you feel good about yourself for a change.” Another said THump was demonstrating “psychotic behavior.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think there's something uniquely anti-social about people whose only enjoyment in games is ruining the fun of nice and friendly people,” <a href="https://x.com/MizutamariVT/status/2002466141915246730" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said X / Twitter user Mizutamari</a>. “There was always a difference between people who trolled guys that were yelling slurs or slamming keyboards and people who only trolled guys that were friendly and seemed to try and keep a happy disposition.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the months since Arc Raiders’ release, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ovpbft/proper_pvp_etiquette/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a sort of PvP etiquette has emerged</a>. If you encounter another player and have no intention to PvP, call out that you’re friendly. It’s considered <em>not cool</em> to say friendly and act friendly then shoot, but of course that does happen. In Arc Raiders, PvP is always on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In truth, this griefing debate has been around for as long as competitive multiplayer games have existed, but Arc Raiders has certainly brought it back to the forefront. Who cares if you pretend to be friendly then shoot to kill? It’s a video game, right? “Your fellow human who trusted you cares,” suggested redditor ilmk9396.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a video game. You don't die in real life when your character dies,” countered MachinationMachine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There's a real person on the other end spending real time and effort playing the game and they trust you not to steal that from them after you say you're friendly,” responded ilmk9396. “They let their guard down and then you take advantage of that like a coward. Be a man and shoot on sight if you want the loot.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, from MachinationMachine: “it's a competitive PvP videogame where you role-play as a ruthless post-apocalyptic raider. How is being honorable good role-playing?”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And so on, and so forth. But isn’t this exactly what Embark Studios had hoped would emerge from Arc Raiders? “In the end, only you decide what kind of Raider you are — and how far you’ll go to prevail,” reads the official blurb. Here, the developer is essentially handing over Arc Raiders to its community. Do what you feel is right, basically. The game is designed for tension. But is it designed for relentless PvP?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The game is designed for you to work together, as there's typically enough loot in the environment to go around so that everyone can rise up and you can have a good time together, with the occasional PvP,” iNteg suggested. “The second lobbies only become about PvP you lose most of your playerbase who wants to enjoy the other aspects of the game and not just PvP. Going in with a mindset that it's only about PvP takes the charm and fun out of the game completely and also ruins the experience, you lose any sort of potential magic that could have happened because oop, see person must rat and gun them down without an interaction.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This one isn’t going anywhere, and neither is THump. Undeterred by any potential backlash, he has doubled down on his playstyle, posting a similar clip with the comment: “love loading up Arc Raiders on Saturday night to show the blue-collar workforce of America what a real professional gamer looks like.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Love loading up Arc Raiders on Saturday night to show the blue-collar workforce of America what a real professional gamer looks like.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Atlus has released an update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, with version 1.03 promising improved frame rate stability and a new docked performance mode.</p>
<p>One of the main criticisms of Persona 3 Reload for its Switch 2 release surrounded the performance of the game on Nintendo’s new handheld. Targeting 30FPS made sense, but with both the game’s demo and the full release, fans and reviewers alike noted that there were frame rate drops.</p>


<p>Version 1.03 is the answer to this, and it promises to boost frame rate stability across both handheld and docked play at 30FPS. However, if you pop your Switch 2 into a dock to play on TV, then a new performance mode is available to target 60FPS, which is a pretty impressive jump up.</p>
<p>This update will also be rolled back to the demo of the game, to help give a new and correct impression of what performance will be like. That’s expected in the coming days, but Atlus had better hurry, because they’ve put the game on sale with a 15% discount on the eShop through 4th January, and people will certainly want to wait and see how it holds up now.</p>
<p>Here’s the brief patch notes for&nbsp;Persona 3 Reload Version 1.03:</p>

<ul>
<li>Performance Mode (only available in TV Mode) – targets 60 FPS</li>
<li>TV Mode and Handheld Mode – improved frame rate stability</li>
</ul>
<p>In our review of the Switch 2 release of Persona 3 Reload, Nic said, “Persona 3 Reload on Switch 2 is a great opportunity to play an incredible game on the go. While there’s compromises to the game on more powerful consoles, and it needs a performance patch, my commutes got a lot more interesting having this in my bag.”</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Realistic Car Driving monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Cash and much more.</p>



<p>Realistic Car Driving puts you behind the wheel in an immersive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-universal-tower-defense-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience where your driving skills actually matter. Unlike arcade-style games, this simulator emphasizes authentic vehicle physics, challenging players to master realistic handling across diverse terrains and weather conditions. From city streets to off-road trails, each environment demands different techniques as you build your automotive collection. The game revolves around earning cash through various activities – winning races, completing time trials, and participating in driving challenges. </p>







<p>This currency is crucial for expanding your garage with vehicles ranging from everyday commuters to exotic supercars. What keeps players engaged is the depth of progression. Beyond simply acquiring vehicles, you’ll spend hours fine-tuning performance parts, adjusting suspension settings, and applying cosmetic modifications at the customization shops. Although cash is earned through regular gameplay, the fastest way to jump ahead is by redeeming promo codes — developers regularly release codes that grant free cash so players can buy more expensive cars and accelerate their progression instead of grinding.&nbsp;</p>

</ol>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-realistic-car-driving-codes">How To Get More Realistic Car Driving Codes</h2>



<p>Realistic Car Driving codes are typically released through the game’s official community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official Discord server and the creator’s (Ferdi26) social media pages, where developers post updates and announcements regularly. Codes often come out around game milestones, major updates, or special events.</p>



<p>But if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops. Furthermore, the developers don’t announce expiration dates for codes, making it challenging to know how long each one will remain active. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself.</p>

<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s developer, Sandfall Interactive, is not tempted to scale up after winning Game of the Year. </p>



<p>Sandall Interactive’s Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 ended up winning Game of the Year for 2025, and also ended up breaking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-broke-all-time-the-game-awards-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an all-time The Game Awards record</a>, which proves how much of a success the title was this year. However, the developers are not looking to expand things instantly, and will keeo things as is for the time being. </p>







<h2 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-says-it-s-good-to-have-limitations-when-you-are-creative">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Director Says “It’s Good to Have Limitations When You Are Creative”</h2>



<p>During a new interview with Edge Magazine (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/we-love-making-games-more-than-we-love-managing-clair-obscur-expedition-33-lead-says-its-good-to-have-limitations-so-the-rpg-studio-wont-scale-up-for-any-future-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s director, Guillaume Broche, was asked whether their next project would become a “large-scale production”. Broche responded, stating, “No, I think it’s good to have limitations when you are creative,” and that it’s the “best way to be the best version of yourself.” </p>



<p>The director added that there is the potential to “scale up now” as the studio has “a lot more money”; however, “I would say it’s not tempting for us because even the management team and myself, we’d have to be hands-on and doing things for ourselves.”</p>



<p>Broche continued, stating that the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 dev team loves “making games more than we love managing” and wants to continue working on games.&nbsp;These past five years were some of the best of my life, and I want to be happy like that again,” concluded Broche. </p>

            <p>Two of the lead Dispatch creators believe Breaking Bad star Aaron Paul wouldn't have agreed to be in the game had he realised how much work it would actually be.</p>
<p>Aaron Paul plays the central role of Robert in the game, the player character, so he features throughout. His acting commitment, then, was not slight.</p>
<p>"It was gruelling," narrative director Pierre Shorette told me recently. "We were worried he would never work with us again because it took so long. It's like water torture, a drip here and there. We'll call him after eight weeks of not speaking, like, 'Hey, we need you for four hours.' It's like, 'Fuck, I thought I was done with this.' We just had to keep bringing him back across two years because he's in basically the entire fucking game."</p>
<p>"I think if he knew what this was going to be," game director Nick Herman added, "he wouldn't have done it."</p>
<p>"He would have said no for sure," Shorette agreed. "For sure."</p>

<p>Originally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success">Dispatch studio AdHoc had been talking about getting Rahul Kohli to play Robert</a>. "But we had and have a cool casting director that had a great relationship with [Aaron Paul], and I think he did respond to the script," said Shorette. "He was feeling it." Aaron Paul had also been in dark animated comedy Bojack Horsemen, which has tonal similarities to Dispatch. "He responded to that aspect of the game," Shorette said. "Thank god too, because I don't know what this is without him at this point."</p><p>Shorette went on to reveal that he had actually spoken to Aaron Paul fairly recently, around the time Dispatch was released, in October/November time. "I was like, 'Hey dude, I feel empty. You're famous and successful - do you ever feel this way?' And he immediately called me. It was a cool big bro move."</p>
<p>It was during this conversation that Aaron Paul told Shorette that he'd been approached in France by people - fans - who'd played Dispatch and apparently loved his work in it. Aaron Paul has moved to France, by the way, according to Shorette. "And I think he got approached a couple times on the streets of Paris," Shorette said.</p>
<p>"That happens all the time [for him] but it's usually someone calling him 'bitch' across the street referencing Breaking Bad, obviously. People were hitting him up while the game was still coming out episodically like, 'Hey, love you in Dispatch,' And he was shocked that it reached France and that it kind of popped off."</p>
<p>"Think about how long he's been in the zeitgeist," Herman added. "People <em>only</em> walk up to him for Breaking Bad. For someone to come up and say, 'Hey, this video game that is coming out right now: I love you in it' - it just doesn't happen for him."</p><p>And remember it's just Aaron Paul's voice in the game, albeit his very recognisable voice - not his digital likeness or captured performance. "I think that's when it clicked for him, like, oh this is real," Herman said. "This is a thing that popped."</p>
<p>The ramifications of that success, of Aaron Paul being praised on the streets of Paris for his work in the game, are that he's much more likely to agree to be a part of whatever AdHoc does with Dispatch next which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">will probably be a Dispatch Season 2</a>. "I think probably, if we're being real, it kind of needed to do what it did for him to be interested in doing it again," Herman said, laughing.</p>
<p>Dispatch has been a studio-defining success for AdHoc, which had been struggling for several years to get the game signed and released. Eventually, a partnership with role-play mega-group - and now gaming brand - Critical Role paved the way, and the game quickly captured an audience and raced to 2m sales. Now AdHoc will need to decide what comes next for Dispatch while also making <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/critical-role-working-on-its-first-video-game-which-will-be-set-in-exandria">a game based on the D&amp;D adventures of Critical Role</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/23/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-review/</link>
            <guid>1390882</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Given how much I enjoyed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/14/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/">Pokémon Legends Z–A</a> — more than most people, if some parts of the internet are to be believed — I was really looking forward to the Mega Dimension DLC. The good news is that the best bits of Z–A are still there, along with a bevy of Pokémon missing from the base game and a slew of brand-new Mega Evolutions to keep things interesting. The problem is that getting between the exciting new bits is a bit of a slog.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension | Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VnzCyRyPugM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So, what is this DLC in a nutshell? Basically, after the near-apocalyptic ending of the game, a young girl called Ansha shows up with her friend, Hoopa, and asks for your help making some donuts. Being the do-gooder that you are, you accept — it’s honestly not the weirdest request you’ve had since getting to Lumiose, so you set about getting the one missing ingredient you need. Events transpire and you wind up in Hyperspace Lumiose — a sterile-looking pocket dimension mirroring a small chunk of the city you have just come from.</p>


<p>The main difference between the real world and Hyperspace Lumiose, other than the very muted colour palette, is that the Pokémon here aren’t native to Lumiose. Oh, and they’re all over Lv100. Your first foray here sees you getting absolutely wrecked by a gang of over-levelled Mankeys.</p>


<p>If you’re not already at or around Lv100, you’re going to really struggle, and thus the grind begins. Your goal now is to research Hyperspace Lumiose, use donuts to open hyperspace rifts, jumping in and doing three of a limited pool of missions. Pick up 10 shiny items, destroy 5 floating Poké Balls, catch 3 Pokémon, etc. The kicker is that you have a very short mission timer based on the quality of the donut you used, meaning that you have to work fast to finish the randomly generated map.</p>
<p>Within each pocket you will find three different Pokémon, two of which you’re likely to have already, and the third being something unique to the DLC’s hyperspace Pokédex. Finding and catching these new Pokémon is, of course, exciting. It’s a little rough though that you fight them at over Lv100 and they’re reduced all the way back to Lv20 when you catch them. Sure, a lot of the thrill of Pokémon is in the chase, but when your Lv100 Feraligatr needs to use multiple attacks to take them down, you want to catch a Pokémon with some of its bulk remaining.</p>

<p>Do enough research and you unlock the boss fight — a brand new mega evolution to call your own. These fights can be incredibly tough. While it’s 3-on-1, rather than the 2-on-1 of the base game, you still have the mission timer, alongside the fact that these things hit like a truck (no surprise when you’re fighting a creature at Lv140). Sure, your donuts give you a temporary level boost, but you’re not going to be matching their level.</p>
<p>Fortunately, if you run out of time you can simply pick up where you left off with zero penalty, removing the difficulty of the actual boss fight. It’s obvious why this is the case — the game is tough as nails in these fights — but to me it underscores that the developers knew how frustrating these could be.</p>
<p>Beat the boss and you unlock a new tier of pocket dimension, offering more Pokémon of higher difficulties, as you might expect having played the main game. Outside of this gameplay loop, what else does the DLC offer? There’s a string of new side missions using the new Pokémon you caught, but other than that, not much.</p>

<p>So… is Mega Dimension good? Honestly, it feels like it would have been post-game content a generation or two ago, rather than a paid DLC. We’re no strangers to the grind in the world of Pokémon, but I’m struggling to find a time when the struggle felt like such a chore.</p>
<p>The idea of randomly generated dungeons is cool, but we need a less intense timer and more variety (and colour) inside each one. Doing the same missions again and again in order to get to the next boss (and eventually the chance to try to find a Legendary Pokémon) gets a bit stale, pretty quickly. If you miss the chance to catch the Legendary, it’s worse still. The difficulty spike could also benefit from being toned down a notch.</p>

              <p>EA’s shareholders are clearly keen on a buy-out, no matter where the money comes from. The sale, that would see the 43-year-old company <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">become majority owned by the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund</a> (PIF), could go ahead by the beginning of 2027 pending government approval, now that public investors have voted in favor of the deal. And government approval might not be <em>too</em> tricky, given Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner would also benefit from 1.1 percent of the deal.</p> <p>The full deal <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">will see EA become a private company</a>, 37 years after it originally went public, with ownership unevenly split between three groups. The vast majority—an enormous 93.4 percent—will be owned by the murderous regime of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman via Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. That will leave 5.5 percent going to Californian private equity firm Silver Lake, and 1.1 percent for Affinity Partners, Jared Kushner’s investment firm that is, well, primarily funded by Saudi Arabia. If completed, it would mean EA stockholders will receive an enormous $210 per share.</p>   <p>While this will make for a nice payday for shareholders (which obviously includes EA management), it will also <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">leave EA saddled with $20 billion in debt</a> from paying off the ludicrously inflated share price, putting its credit rating in the sewers, and it’s hard to see how the company can sustain that.&nbsp;Then, of course, there’s the very significant matter of the company being almost entirely owned by a state that <a href="https://www.humandignitytrust.org/country-profile/saudi-arabia/">kills people for being gay or trans</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45812399">murders</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/18/saudi-arabia-turki-al-jasser-executed">journalists</a>, and <a href="https://theweek.com/60339/things-women-cant-do-in-saudi-arabia">denies women many basic rights</a>. EA employees obviously have good reason to be fearful, no matter how much the PIF may exist to whitewash the country’s actions, and there’s no way of knowing how the ownership might affect everything from basic company policy to what’s included in games.</p>

 <p>Given the precarious state in which this deal would leave an impossibly indebted EA, and the likely exodus of both those let go in attempt to combat crippling costs and those who leave in disgust, it seems extremely unlikely EA could survive in any recognizable form. While games like&nbsp;<em>FC26&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em> are huge successes, they’re also massive investments for smaller returns when compared to the mobile slop that makes up more than half of the games industry’s $200 billion value.</p>

 <p>The deal will certainly face lengthy scrutiny around the world, just as we saw with Microsoft’s $67 billion buyout of Activision Blizzard King, although it could have a far easier ride in the U.S. While <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ftc-xbox-activision-congress-appeal-blizzard-1850638519">the FTC fought hard against the Microsoft deal</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/08/supreme-court-trump-power-ftc-slaughter">all bets are off under Trump,</a> and Kushner’s involvement could certainly help grease the wheels.</p>

 <p>From the shareholders’ perspective, however, EA is a company that’s stalled and lacked for enough big hits in recent years, and hasn’t looked likely to turn things around for a long while. This is an opportunity to get out with a big profit, no matter the human cost, nor the company’s future.</p>

Big title after big title, a brand new console in the Switch 2, and a new GOTY contender almost every other week. It's been breathless, but not without <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-does-it-bother-you-that-big-games-companies-are-using-genai">industry struggles</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/layoffs">mass layoffs</a>, cancellations, and closures.</p>
<p>Which is why now, more than ever, it's important to shout out those smaller titles, those games that go a little more under the radar in a jam-packed release calendar. And 2025 has been incredible for independent games and smaller studios, with many of the year's best titles coming from those corners. Some of those are part of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/games-of-the-year-2025-nintendo-life-staff-picks">our big Staff GOTY list</a>, of course.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067risvny&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>But, as we've done for the past few years, we want to shine a light on some of the games we've played and loved, that came oh-so-close to making our Game of the Year list and still deserve attention. So here are our picks for the hidden gems that launched on Switch 1 and Switch 2 in 2025, <strong>in alphabetical order</strong> (and there's a poll at the end to pick your favourite).</p>
<p><em>NL staff key: Alana Hagues (AH), Jim Norman (JN), Ollie Reynolds (OR), PJ O'Reilly (PJ)</em></p>
<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blade_chimera">Blade Chimera (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>Team Ladybug does not miss, yet the developer's games are consistently overlooked, in my eyes. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blade_chimera">Blade Chimera</a> is once again adorned with the studio's signature beautiful pixel art visuals with a pure combat-focused adventure. It's Metroidvania, yes, but one with guns, swords, lasers, and other futuristic sci-fi weapons where fighting and movement are king. This isn't a game about secrets — it's a game about fun.</p>
<p>2025 has been a banner year for the Metroidvania genre, but Blade Chimera's early release this year shouldn't discount it from the conversation. It should be right up there. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bokura-planet">BOKURA: planet (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>I had heard next to nothing about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bokura-planet">BOKURA: planet</a> before I accidentally stumbled across it on the Switch 2 eShop. This co-op-only adventure game sounded ripe for some GameChat goodness and, playing through it with site editor Gavin (my fellow space explorer), it proved to be just that.</p>
<p>There were neat two-screen puzzles and platforming challenges that led to some good laughs, but what surprised me the most was its screen-specific story beats, where each of us was left with important bits of information that the other didn’t know. It’s a fantastic conceit, one that threw up more than a few surprises for the big finale, and it made me want to play the whole thing all over again from the other perspective.</p>
<p>A Hazelight joint it ain’t, but it’s a great excuse to see GameChat in action. - <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dear-me-i-was">Dear me, I was... (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>Taisuke Kanasaki has been the art director on some beautiful cult classics over the years — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/hotel_dusk_room_215">Hotel Dusk</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/another_code_recollection">Another Code</a> have basically cemented him as a legend among DS fans — and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dear-me-i-was">Dear me, I was</a> can easily sit among these.</p>
<p>It's only an hour long, but Dear Me, I was is beautiful; a wordless story told with stunning rotoscoping that will make you think about life and art in new ways. It's simple, effective, and the tearjerker you should absolutely try if you love narrative-driven games or art. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>Having been desperate to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a> ever since its reveal in 2022, I'm so glad Necrosoft Games got it over the finish line in 2025. Sure, it might seem like a tactical RPG twist on <strong>Persona</strong> school-life elements, but it's actually a fair bit different from Atlus' series. And the gameplay isn't built around traditional stat building, instead feeling like a chain of puzzles you have to solve to emerge victorious.</p>
<p>It certainly helps that the cast is loud, proud, and incredibly out there, like a bunch of high-school weirdos that I would've hung out with growing up. Couple this with its love of classic Italian horror cinema, and Demonschool stands out among 2025's strategy RPGs. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/duck_detective_the_ghost_of_glamping">Duck Detective: The Ghost of Glamping (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>You are Eugene McQuacklin, a duck recovering from a bread addiction, who dons his fedora and trench coat to solve small-town crimes and fend off the ghosts of his recent divorce. If this isn’t a funny image to you, then <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/duck_detective_the_ghost_of_glamping">Duck Detective: The Ghost of Glamping</a> (and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/duck_detective_-_the_secret_salami">its predecessor</a>, for that matter) will not be up your street; however, if that idea brought even the smallest smile to your face, then boy, do I have a recommendation for you.</p>
<p>It’s a little on the short side, and some of the ‘Deducktions’ are rather trial-and-error-y, but Ghost of Glamping is one of the cosiest, funniest mysteries that you will have tackled in a good long time. - <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/laika_aged_through_blood">Laika: Aged Through Blood (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>I'll be honest, I never even considered the idea that a game like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trials_rising">Trials Rising</a> could work as a Metroidvania, but that's exactly what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/laika_aged_through_blood">Laika: Aged Through Blood</a> has accomplished with its BMX-inspired exploration gameplay.</p>
<p>Despite its colourful, cartoony visuals, Laika is a sombre experience that absolutely isn't intended for younger audiences. It's brutal, with graphic scenes of violence, potty-mouth protagonists, and punishing difficulty to boot. It's all worth it for that sublime soundtrack, though – you won't hear anything else quite like it. <em>- OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/morsels">Morsels (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>Monster-catching roguelites aren't exactly new, but what if they were utterly disgusting? That's a very reductive breakdown of what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/morsels">Morsels</a> is, a messy game that's overstimulating with every second. You'll die multiple times without knowing what hit you, start again and try and figure out what you did wrong, only to do something else erroneous.</p>
<p>Morsels is a game about making a mess with a bunch of messy creatures. And it's about navigating through the mess, the visual noise. It's extremely compelling on that front alone — if it's your cup of tea. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>As a top-down Zelda fan, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</a>'s colourful energy and industrial world enchanted me on its first reveal. Pipistrello loves GBA sprite work and intricately-connected areas, with skills that you gradually unlock to reveal more and more of the map.</p>
<p>And it's that map that makes Pipistrello so good. I love a map that teases you, leaves a carrot dangling for you to come back and chomp when you have the right ability. And it helps that every ability Pippit gets feels useful in some way, whether it's for combat, exploration, or just <em>fun</em>.</p>
<p>Pocket Trap has made an excellent adventure here — which includes an actual in-game GBA-type machine — and I really hope more people pick the game up. - <em>AH</em></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rift_of_the_necrodancer">Rift of the NecroDancer (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>Who thought we'd be putting Brace Yourself Games' latest title on a list like this? But here we are. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rift_of_the_necrodancer">Rift of the NecroDancer</a> is a completely different take on the rhythmic action that made the Canadian developer famous. This time, it's <strong>Guitar Hero</strong> meets bullet hell. That means this isn't a gentle game, and you'll have to try and try again to defeat each enemy.</p>
<p>When you reach that higher plane and hit all of the notes perfectly, and dodge all of the attacks? That feeling is unmissable. And look, if you need a break, there's even a dash of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/rhythm_heaven">Rhythm Heaven</a> waiting in the form of minigames. Surely that alone should be enough to get all you Switch owners running to own this? - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/roadwarden">Roadwarden (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/roadwarden">Roadwarden</a> is one of those games that folk were telling me to play long before it landed on Switch, and in the end I was sort of glad I waited, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/roadwarden">through reviewing it</a> I got to sit down and properly engross myself in a game that people <em>should</em> really be talking about in the same breath as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disco_elysium_the_final_cut">Disco Elysium</a>. It really is on that level of world and character-building.</p>
<p>And it's on that level in terms of your choices, and their ramifications for your playthrough, too. It's quite something, and the world here is as interesting as the mostly text-based shenanigans that play out. <em>"Mostly text-based? That sounds like it's for old nerds!"</em> Yes, mate, I get that, but the writing is exquisite, and the whole thing is set to a nerve-y time limit. It requires your best detective skills and the ability to hustle and think on your feet. It also never lets you paint any sort of full picture, so replays aplenty are inbound.</p>
<p>You do want to be a weird <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">Witcher</a> version of those lads from Revachol, right? - <em>PJ</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ruffy_and_the_riverside">Ruffy and the Riverside (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ruffy_and_the_riverside">Ruffy and the Riverside</a> is the answer to the question, <em>'What if Paper Mario was a mascot platformer from the '90s instead of an RPG?'</em> Chatty and bursting with personality, Ruffy has its very own unique gimmick that is endlessly creative and clever: copying and pasting.</p>
<p>It really is that simple! But it opens up so many puzzle solutions and ideas that the developers cram into every area with glee. Pack in plenty of collectibles and you have a game that would feel right at home on the N64. There's even some rough edges, just like the good ol' days, but we love Ruffy all the more for them. Sometimes. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shotgun_cop_man">Shotgun Cop Man (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>I absolutely adore arcade-inspired games that demand perfection to achieve high scores and achievements, and that's exactly what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shotgun_cop_man">Shotgun Cop Man</a> does. The premise is simple: rid each level of as many enemies as possible while you make your way to the end goal. The twist? Movement is completely tied to the kickback provided by your shotgun (and other weapons) when you fire it.</p>
<p>So while there's definitely a slight learning curve to begin with, Shotgun Cop Man is right up there with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_meat_boy">Super Meat Boy</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a> as a perfectly tuned platformer that feels unbelievably satisfying to master. It's also hilarious, too! <em>- OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sorry_were_closed">Sorry We're Closed (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sorry_were_closed">Sorry We're Closed</a> is a survival horror like no other. Swapping out dark, grimy environments for colourful backdrops, it boasts a plethora of incredibly well-realised characters and enemies while introducing an intriguing new form of combat in which you quite literally target the hearts of your foes.</p>
<p>Though I wouldn't necessarily say it's scary in the traditional sense, it's undeniably unsettling, with the juxtaposition of bright, vivid colours and horrific visuals conjuring up a sense of fear that few other games can manage. Better yet, there are optional tank controls for those who, like me, refuse to let the past die. - <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_antiquities">Strange Antiquities (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>As fans of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_horticulture">Strange Horticulture</a>, there was no way we were going to skip <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_antiquities">Strange Antiquities</a>, and what an excellent follow-up to a quirky, occultish puzzler. Antiques are the natural follow-up to plants, right?</p>
<p>Anyway, 2025 has been an amazing year for the puzzle genre, and Strange Antiquities is among the best. Yes, it takes the same cosy-ish premise of the original, swapping the green for the old, but it's just as weird — and occasionally sinister — as Horticulture. It's all about reading, studying, and paying attention to the weird and wonderful things you hear about in-game. And the overarching narrative is equally rewarding. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_tactical_takedown">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_tactical_takedown">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</a> looked made for Switch when it arrived on PC in May, and the port onto the hybrid five months later proved a great match. Turn-based tactical X Beat ‘em up isn’t a combination that I thought the industry had been crying out for, but good heavens, did Strange Scaffold use it to good effect!</p>
<p>Racking up combos in this table-top-looking world is some of the most satisfying tactical gameplay I've experienced all year. You will never have played a Turtles game quite like this one, and hey, that’s pretty tubular, bro! - <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a> is exactly how it sounds: you set up a tiny shop and you, well, sell books! It's the epitome of cosy, and the inclusion of real-life books with real authors lends a sense of authenticity to the otherwise quaint, picturesque presentation. Watching the numbers go up as you sell more and more books is so very satisfying, but it never feels like you're pressured to perform well.</p>
<p>If you're after something genuinely relaxing, then I urge you to give this one a shot. - <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/until_then">Until Then (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>I was really surprised by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/until_then">Until Then</a>. Though I expected an experience filled with weird, <strong>Twin Peaks</strong>-inspired goings on — which it certainly has — I didn't quite expect it to feel so relatable and emotional. It perfectly captures the slow, almost monotonous day-to-day experience of high school, but in a way that's constantly engaging with some truly beautiful pixel art visuals.</p>
<p>It's the type of game you'll complete, leave alone for a few years, then play through again once you've forgotten the story. Remarkable stuff. - <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/videoverse">Videoverse (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>2025 is the year when I've fallen more out of love with being online than ever before. But <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/videoverse">Videoverse</a> reminded me that things haven't always been this way. That things were good, and <em>can</em> still be good. The power of online communities, a shared love of video games, and love and acceptance over hate make Videoverse an essential, humanistic experience for anyone who loves games, writing, and who grew up in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>We had to wait a few years to get this on Switch, but I'm glad we finally got it. - <em>AH</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘GTA 6 Will Cost $70 and Won’t Get Another Delay’, Ex Rockstar Animator Says]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/gta-6-will-cost-70-wont-get-another-delay-ex-rockstar-animator-says/</link>
            <guid>1390861</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>There's been a lot of discussion on whether <strong>Rockstar Games</strong> would price <strong>GTA 6</strong> at the regular $70-$80 range of most triple-A games or become the first title to break the scary <strong>$100</strong> threshold.</p>



<p>The debate was <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launch-for-100/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally sparked</a> by Wedbush Securities analyst <strong>Michael Pachter</strong>, who predicted in August that the developer would make this bold choice and get away with it due to the game's massive hype. We at Wccftech quickly sought the opinion of another analyst, <strong>Rhys Elliot</strong> from Alinea Analytics, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-why-gta-vi-likely-wont-be-priced-100-according-to-an-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">countered</a> that it would be a bad idea as it would limit the barrier of entry to GTA 6 Online, which, if GTA 5 is any measure, will over time become Rockstar's main revenue driver. The most likely scenario would see Rockstar offering an optional, higher-priced edition, just like most triple-A publishers do nowadays, while keeping the base edition at its regular price.</p>



<p>Now, former Rockstar animator Mike York revealed a similar outlook in an interview <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Esports Insider</a>. </p>



<p><em>I don't think the price tag for GTA 6 will be $100. I think it will come out at $70, around the flatline of normal releases. I don't think Rockstar Games feel they need to release it at a higher cost. They'll sell so many copies of the game that they won't need to be greedy and charge $100. They don't need to leave that sour taste in people's mouths if they don't have to, so I don't think they'll do that.</em> <em>It might have a $99 day-one version if you pre-order it, where it gives you a huge bundle when GTA Online comes out. You have your own apartment or something like that. But the base game will be $70.</em></p>



<p>The other big question mark on the game pertains to its launch date. It has already been <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed twice</a>, after all, and fans are really worried there might be a third time. York, however, isn't concerned:</p>



<p><em>I think the game will be released in November 2026, as it’s a good time for the game to come out for Rockstar for multiple reasons to sell video games. If you want to sell a big amount of video games, then that’s the perfect time for GTA 6 to come out with it being a month before Christmas. Usually, companies only delay these things once or twice when they need to, so I think it will come out around that time</em>.</p>



<p>GTA 6 is currently scheduled to launch on November 15, 2026 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X.</p>
